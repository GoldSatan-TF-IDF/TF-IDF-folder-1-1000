john irving last night in twisted river for everett my pioneer my hero i had a job in the great north woods working as a cook for a spell but i never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell bob dylan tangled up in blue i coos county new hampshire chapter under the logs the young canadian who could not have been more than fifteen had hesitated too long for a frozen moment his feet had stopped moving on the floating logs in the basin above the river bend hed slipped entirely underwater before anyone could grab his outstretched hand one of the loggers had reached for the youths long hairthe older mans fingers groped around in the frigid water which was thick almost soupy with sloughedoff slabs of bark then two logs collided hard on the wouldbe rescuers arm breaking his wrist the carpet of moving logs had completely closed over the young canadian who never surfaced not even a hand or one of his boots broke out of the brown water out on a logjam once the key log was pried loose the river drivers had to move quickly and continually if they paused for even a second or two they would be pitched into the torrent in a river drive death among moving logs could occur from a crushing injury before you had a chance to drownbut drowning was more common from the riverbank where the cook and his twelveyearold son could hear the cursing of the logger whose wrist had been broken it was immediately apparent that someone was in more serious trouble than the wouldbe rescuer whod freed his injured arm and had managed to regain his footing on the flowing logs his fellow river drivers ignored him they moved with small rapid steps toward shore calling out the lost boys name the loggers ceaselessly prodded with their pike poles directing the floating logs ahead of them the rivermen were for the most part picking the safest way ashore but to the cooks hopeful son it seemed that they might have been trying to create a gap of sufficient width for the young canadian to emerge in truth there were now only intermittent gaps between the logs the boy whod told them his name was angel pope from toronto was that quickly gone is it angel the twelveyearold asked his father this boy with his darkbrown eyes and intensely serious expression could have been mistaken for angels younger brother but there was no mistaking the family resemblance that the twelveyearold bore to his everwatchful father the cook had an aura of controlled apprehension about him as if he routinely anticipated the most unforeseen disasters and there was something about his sons seriousness that reflected this in fact the boy looked so much like his father that several of the woodsmen had expressed their surprise that the son didnt also walk with his dads pronounced limp the cook knew too well that indeed it was the young canadian who had fallen under the logs it was the cook whod warned the loggers that angel was too green for the river drivers work the youth should not have been trying to free a logjam but probably the boy had been eager to please and maybe the rivermen hadnt noticed him at first in the cooks opinion angel pope had also been too green and too clumsy to be working in the vicinity of the main blade in a sawmill that was strictly the sawyers territorya highly skilled position in the mills the planer operator was a relatively skilled position too though not particularly dangerous the more dangerous and less skilled positions included working on the log deck where logs were rolled into the mill and onto the saw carriage or unloading logs from the trucks before the advent of mechanical loaders the logs were unloaded by releasing trip bunks on the sides of the trucksthis allowed an entire load to roll off a truck at once but the trip bunks sometimes failed to release the men were occasionally caught under a cascade of logs while they were trying to free a bunk as far as the cook was concerned angel shouldnt have been in any position that put the boy in close proximity to moving logs but the lumberjacks had been as fond of the young canadian as the cook and his son had been and angel had said he was bored working in the kitchen the youth had wanted more physical labor and he liked the outdoors the repeated thunkthunk of the pike poles poking the logs was briefly interrupted by the shouts of the rivermen who had spotted angels pike polemore than fifty yards from where the boy had vanished the fifteenfoot pole was floating free of the log drive out where the river currents had carried it away from the logs the cook could see that the river driver with the broken wrist had come ashore carrying his pike pole in his good hand first by the familiarity of his cursing and only secondarily by the loggers matted hair and tangled beard did the cook realize that the injured man was ketchumno neophyte to the treachery of a log drive it was aprilnot long after the last snowmelt and the start of mud seasonbut the ice had only recently broken up in the river basin the first logs falling through the ice upstream of the basin on the dummer ponds the river was icecold and swollen and many of the lumberjacks had heavy beards and long hair which would afford them some scant protection from the blackflies in midmay ketchum lay on his back on the riverbank like a beached bear the moving mass of logs flowed past him it appeared as if the log drive were a life raft and the loggers who were still out on the river seemed like castaways at seaexcept that the sea from one moment to the next turned from greenish brown to bluish black the water in twisted river was richly dyed with tannins shit angel ketchum shouted from his back i said move your feet angel you have to keep moving your feet oh shit the vast expanse of logs had been no life raft for angel whod surely drowned or been crushed to death in the basin above the river bend although the lumberjacks ketchum among them would follow the log drive at least to where twisted river poured into the pontook reservoir at dead woman dam the pontook dam on the androscoggin river had created the reservoir once the logs were let loose in the androscoggin they would next encounter the sorting gaps outside milan in berlin the androscoggin dropped two hundred feet in three miles two paper mills appeared to divide the river at the sorting gaps in berlin it was not inconceivable to imagine that young angel pope from toronto was on his way there come nightfall the cook and his son were still attempting to salvage leftovers for tomorrows meals from the scores of untouched dinners in the small settlements dining lodgethe cookhouse in the socalled town of twisted river which was barely larger and only a little less transient than a logging camp not long ago the only dining lodge on a river drive hadnt been a lodge at all there once was a traveling kitchen that had been permanently built onto a truck body and an adjacent truck on which a modular dining hall could be taken down and reassembledthis was when the trucks used to perpetually move camp to another site on twisted river wherever the loggers were working next in those days except on the weekends the rivermen rarely went back to the town of twisted river to eat or sleep the camp cook had often cooked in a tent everything had to be completely portable even the sleeping shelters were built onto truck bodies now nobody knew what would become of the lessthanthriving town of twisted river which was situated partway between the river basin and the dummer ponds the sawmill workers and their families lived there and the logging company maintained bunkhouses for the more transient woodsmen who included not only the french canadian itinerants but most of the river drivers and the other loggers the company also maintained a better equipped kitchen an actual dining lodgethe aforementioned cookhousefor the cook and his son but for how much longer not even the owner of the logging company knew the lumber industry was in transition it would one day be possible for every worker in the logging business to work from home the logging camps and even the slightly less marginal settlements like twisted river were dying the wanigans themselves were disappearing those curious shelters for sleeping and eating and storing equipment had not only been mounted on trucks on wheels or on crawler tracks but they were often attached to rafts or boats the indian dishwashershe worked for the cookhad long ago told the cooks young son that wanigan was from an abenaki word leading the boy to wonder if the dishwasher herself was from the abenaki tribe perhaps she just happened to know the origin of the word or shed merely claimed to know it the cooks son went to school with an indian boy whod told him that wanigan was of algonquian origin while it lasted the work during a river drive was from dawn till dark it was the protocol in a logging operation to feed the men four times a day in the past when the wanigans couldnt get close to a river site the two midday meals had been trekked to the drivers the first and last meal were served in the base campnowadays in the dining lodge but out of their affection for angel tonight many of the loggers had missed their last meal in the cookhouse theyd spent the evening following the log drive until the darkness had driven them awaynot only the darkness but also the mens growing awareness that none of them knew if dead woman dam was open from the basin below the town of twisted river the logsprobably with angel among themmight already have flowed into the pontook reservoir but not if dead woman dam was closed and if the pontook dam and dead woman were open the body of the young canadian would be headed pellmell down the androscoggin no one knew better than ketchum that there would likely be no finding angel there the cook could tell when the river drivers had stopped searchingfrom the kitchens screen door he could hear them leaning their pike poles against the cookhouse a few of the tired searchers found their way to the dining lodge after dark the cook didnt have the heart to turn them away the hired help had all gone homeeveryone but the indian dishwasher who stayed late most nights the cook whose difficult name was dominic baciagalupoor cookie as the lumberjacks routinely called himmade the men a late supper which his twelveyearold son served wheres ketchum the boy asked his dad hes probably getting his arm fixed the cook replied ill bet hes hungry the twelveyearold said but ketchum is wicked tough hes impressively tough for a drinking man dominic agreed but he was thinking that maybe ketchum wasnt tough enough for this losing angel pope might be hardest on ketchum the cook thought because the veteran logger had taken the young canadian under his wing hed looked after the boy or he had tried to ketchum had the blackest hair and beardthe charredblack color of charcoal blacker than a black bears fur hed been married youngand more than once he was estranged from his children who had grown up and gone their own ways ketchum lived yearround in one of the bunkhouses or in any of several rundown hostelries if not in a wanigan of his own devisingnamely in the back of his pickup truck where he had come close to freezing to death on those winter nights when hed passed out dead drunk yet ketchum had kept angel away from alcohol and hed kept not a few of the older women at the socalled dance hall away from the young canadian too youre too young angel the cook had heard ketchum tell the youth besides you can catch things from those ladies ketchum would know the cook had thought dominic knew that ketchum had done more damage to himself than breaking his wrist in a river drive the steady hiss and intermittent flickering of the pilot lights on the gas stove in the cookhouse kitchenan old garland with two ovens and eight burners and a flameblackened broiler aboveseemed perfectly in keeping with the lamentations of the loggers over their late supper they had been charmed by the lost boy whom theyd adopted as they would a stray pet the cook had been charmed too perhaps he saw in the unusually cheerful teenager some future incarnation of his twelveyearold sonfor angel had a welcoming expression and a sincere curiosity and he exhibited none of the withdrawn sullenness that appeared to afflict the few young men his age in a rough and rudimentary place like twisted river this was all the more remarkable because the youth had told them that hed recently run away from home youre italian arent you dominic baciagalupo had asked the boy im not from italy i dont speak italianyoure not much of an italian if you come from toronto angel had answered the cook had held his tongue dominic knew a little about boston italians some of them seemed to have issues regarding how italian they were and the cook knew that angel in the old country might have been an angelo when dominic had been a little boy his mother had called him angelùin her sicilian accent this sounded like angehloo but after the accident nothing with angel popes written name could be found among the boys few belongings not a single book or letter identified him if hed had any identification it had gone into the river basin with himprobably in the pocket of his dungareesand if they never located the body there would be no way to inform angels family or whoever the boy had run away from legally or not and with or without proper papers angel pope had made his way across the canadian border to new hampshire not the way it was usually done eitherangel hadnt come from quebec hed made a point of arriving from ontario he was not a french canadian the cook hadnt once heard angel speak a word of french or italian and the french canadians at the camp had wanted nothing to do with the runaway boyapparently they didnt like english canadians angel for his part kept his distance from the french he didnt appear to like the québécois any better than they liked him dominic had respected the boys privacy now the cook wished he knew more about angel pope and where hed come from angel had been a goodnatured and fairminded companion for the cooks twelveyearold son danielor danny as the loggers and the saw mill men called the boy almost every male of working age in twisted river knew the cook and his sonsome women too dominic had needed to know a number of womenmainly to help him look after his sonfor the cook had lost his wife dannys young mother a longseeming decade ago dominic baciagalupo believed that angel pope had had some experience with kitchen work which the boy had done awkwardly but uncomplainingly and with an economy of movement that must have been born of familiaritydespite his professed boredom with cookingrelated chores and his penchant for cutting himself on the cutting board moreover the young canadian was a reader hed borrowed many books that had belonged to dominics late wife and he often read aloud to daniel it was ketchums opinion that angel had read robert louis stevenson to young dan to excessnot only kidnapped and treasure island but his unfinished deathbed novel st ives which ketchum said should have died with the author at the time of the accident on the river angel had been reading the wrecker to danny ketchum had not yet weighed in with his opinion of that novel well whatever angel popes background had been hed had some schooling clearlymore than most of the french canadian woodsmen the cook had known more than most of the sawmill workers and the local woodsmen too why did angel have to die danny asked his dad the twelveyearold was helping his father wipe down the dining tables after the latearriving loggers had gone off to bed or perhaps to drink and although she often kept herself busy in the cookhouse quite late into the night at least well past dannys bedtime the indian dishwasher had finished with her chores by now shed driven her truck back to town angel didnt have to die danielit was an avoidable accident the cooks vocabulary often made reference to avoidable accidents and his twelveyearold son was overfamiliar with his fathers grim and fatalistic thoughts on human fallibilitythe recklessness of youth in particular he was too green to be out on a river drive the cook said as if that were all there was to it danny baciagalupo knew his dads opinion of all the things angel or any boy that age was too green to do the cook also would have wanted to keep angel far away from a peavey the peaveys most important feature was the hinged hook that made it possible to roll a heavy log by hand according to ketchum the old days had been more perilous ketchum claimed that working with the horses pulling the scoots out of the winter woods was risky work in the winter the lumberjacks tramped up into the mountains theyd cut down the trees and not that long ago used horses to pull the timber out one log at a time the scoots or wheelless drays were dragged like sleds on the frozen snow which not even the horses hooves could penetrate because the sled ruts on the horsehaul roads were iced down every night then the snowmelt and mud season came andback then as ketchum would sayall the work in the woods was halted but even this was changing since the new logging machinery could work in muddy conditions and haul much longer distances to improved roads which could be used in all seasons mud season itself was becoming less of an issueand horses were giving way to crawler tractors the bulldozers made it possible to build a road right to a logging site where the wood could be hauled out by truck the trucks moved the wood to a more central drop point on a river or on a pond or lake in fact highway transport would very soon supplant the need for river drives gone were the days when a snubbing winch had been used to ease the horses down the steeper slopes the teams could slide on their haunches ketchum had told young dan ketchum rated oxen highly for their steady footing in deep snow but oxen had never been widely used gone too was railroad logging in the woods it came to an end in the pemigewasset valley in the same year one of ketchums cousins had been killed by a shay locomotive at the livermore falls paper mill the shay weighed fifty tons and had been used to pull the last of the rails from the woods the former railroad beds made for firm haul roads for the trucks in the s although ketchum could still remember a murder on the beebe river railroadback when hed been the teamster for a bobsled loaded with prime virgin spruce behind a fourhorse rig ketchum had been the teamster on one of the early lombard steam engines toothe one steered by a horse the horse had turned the front sled runners and the teamster sat at the front of the log hauler later models replaced the horse and teamster with a helmsman at a steering wheel ketchum had been a helmsman too danny baciagalupo knewclearly ketchum had done everything the old lombard loghauler roads around twisted river were truck roads now although there were derelict lombards abandoned in the area there is one still standing upright in twisted river and another one tipped on its side in the logging camp in west dummeror paris as the settlement was usually called after the paris manufacturing company of paris maine phillips brook ran to paris and the ammonoosucand into the connecticut river the rivermen drove hardwood sawlogs along phillips brook to paris and some pulpwood too the sawmill in paris was strictly a hardwoods operationthe manufacturing company in maine made toboggansand the logging camp in paris with its steampowered sawmill had converted the former horse hovel to a machine shop the mill managers house was also there together with a seventyfiveman bunkhouse and a mess hall and some rudimentary family housingnot to mention an optimistically planted apple orchard and a schoolhouse that there was no schoolhouse in the town of twisted river nor had anyone been optimistic enough about the settlements staying power to plant any apple trees gave rise to the opinion held chiefly in paris that the logging camp was a more civilized community and less temporary than twisted river at the height of land between the two outposts no fortuneteller would have been foolish enough to predict success or longevity for either settlement danny baciagalupo had heard ketchum declare certain doom for the logging camp in paris and for twisted river but ketchum suffered no progress gladlyas the cook had cautioned his son dominic baciagalupo was not a storyteller the cook routinely cast doubt on some of ketchums stories daniel dont be in too big a hurry to buy into the ketchum version dominic would say had ketchums aunt an accountant truly been killed by a toppled stack of edging in the lathe mill in milan im not sure there is or ever was a lathe mill in milan daniel the cook had warned his son and according to ketchum one thunderstorm had killed four people in the sawmill at the outlet dam to dummer pondthe bigger and uppermost of the dummer ponds allegedly lightning had struck the log carriage the dogger and the setter not to mention the sawyer holding the bandsaw levers and the takeaway man were killed by a single bolt ketchum had told danny witnesses had watched the entire mill burn to the ground im surprised that another of ketchums relatives wasnt among the victims daniel was all that dominic would say indeed another of ketchums cousins had fallen into the slasher in a pulpwood slasher mill an uncle had been brained by a flying fourfoot log at a cutup mill where theyd been cutting long spruce logs into pulpwood length and thered once been a floating steam donkey on dummer pond it was used to bunch logs for the sawmill entrance at the outlet dam but the engine had exploded a mans ear was found frozen in the spring snow on the island in the pond where all the trees had been singed by the explosion later ketchum said an ice fisherman used the ear for bait in the pontook reservoir more relatives of yours i assume the cook had asked not that im aware of ketchum had replied ketchum claimed to have known the legendary asshole whod constructed a horse hovel upstream of the bunkhouse and mess hall at camp five when all the men in the logging camp got sick they strung up the purported legend in a network of bridles in the horse hovel above the manure pituntil the asshole fainted from the fumes you can see why ketchum misses the old days daniel the cook had said to his son dominic baciagalupo knew some storiesmost of them not for telling and what stories the cook could tell his son didnt capture young dans imagination the way ketchums stories did there was the one about the bean hole outside the cooks tent on the chick wolnepy near success pond in the aforementioned old days on a river drive dominic had dug a bean hole four feet across and started the beans cooking in the ground at bedtime covering the hole with hot ashes and earth at am when it would be piping hot he planned to dig the covered pot out of the ground for breakfast but a french canadian had wandered out of the sleeping wanigan probably to take a pee when it was still dark he was barefoot when he fell into the bean hole burning both his feet thats it thats the whole story danny had asked his dad well its kind of a cooking story i guess ketchum had said to be kind ketchum would tease dominic on the subject that spaghetti was replacing baked beans and pea soup on the upper androscoggin we never used to have so many italian cooks around ketchum would say winking at danny youre telling me youd rather have baked beans and pea soup than pasta the cook asked his old friend your dad is a touchy little fella isnt he ketchum would say to danny winking again constipated christ ketchum had more than once declared to dominic are you ever touchy now it was that mudseason swollenriver time of year again thered been a strong surge of water coming through one of the sluice gateswhat ketchum called a driving head probably from the sluice gate at the east end of little dummer pondand a green kid from toronto whom they barely knew had been swept away for only a while longer would the loggers increase the volume of water in twisted river they did this by building sluice dams on the tributary streams flowing into the main driving river the water above these dams was released in the spring adding torrents of water volume to a log drive the pulpwood was piled in these streams and on the riverbanks during the winter and then sluiced into twisted river on the water released from the dams if this was soon after the snowmelt the water ran fast and the riverbanks were gouged by the moving logs in the cooks opinion there were not enough bends in twisted river to account for the rivers name the river ran straight down out of the mountains there were only two bends in it but to the loggers particularly those oldtimers whod named the river these two bends were bad enough to cause some treacherous logjams every springespecially upstream of the basin nearer the dummer ponds at both bends in the river the trapped logs usually needed to be pried loose by hand at the bend upriver where the current was strongest no one as green as angel would have been permitted out on a logjam but angel had perished in the basin where the river was comparatively calm the logs themselves made the water in the river basin choppy but the currents were fairly moderate and at both bends the more massive jams were broken up with dynamite which dominic baciagalupo deplored the blasting wreaked havoc with the pots and pans and dangling utensils in the cookhouse kitchen in the dining hall the sugar bowls and the ketchup bottles slid off the tables if your dad is not a storyteller danny he is definitely not a dynamite man was how ketchum had put it to the boy from the basin below the town of twisted river the water ran downstream to the androscoggin in addition to the connecticut the big logdriving rivers in northern new hampshire were the ammonoosuc and the androscoggin those rivers were documented killers but some rivermen had drowned or been crushed to death in the relatively short stretch of rapids between little dummer pond and the town of twisted riverand in the river basin too angel pope wasnt the first nor would the young canadian be the last and in the compromised settlements of twisted river and paris a fair share of sawmill workers had been maimed or had even lost their livesno small number of them unfortunately because of the fights they got into with the loggers in certain bars there werent enough womenthat was usually what started the fightsalthough ketchum had maintained that there werent enough bars there were no bars in paris anyway and only married women lived in the logging camp there in ketchums opinion that combination put the men from paris on the haul road to twisted river almost every night they never should have built a bridge over phillips brook ketchum also maintained you see daniel the cook said to his son ketchum has once again demonstrated that progress will eventually kill us all catholic thinking will kill us first danny ketchum would say italians are catholics and your dad is italianand so are you of course although neither you nor your dad is very italian or very catholic in your thinking either i am mainly speaking of the french canadians when i refer to catholic thinking french canadians for example have so many children that they sometimes number them instead of name them dear god dominic baciagalupo said shaking his head is that true young dan asked ketchum what kind of name is vingt dumas ketchum asked the boy roland and joanne dumas do not have twenty children the cook cried not together maybe ketchum replied so what was little vingt a slip of the tongue dominic was shaking his head again what ketchum asked him i promised daniels mother that the boy would get a proper education the cook said well im just making an effort to enhance dannys education ketchum reasoned enhance dominic repeated still shaking his head your vocabulary ketchum the cook began but he stopped himself he said nothing further neither a storyteller nor a dynamite man danny baciagalupo thought of his father the boy loved his dad dearly but there was also a habit the cook had and his son had noticed itdominic often didnt finish his thoughts not out loud anyway not counting the indian dishwasherand a few of the sawmill workers wives who helped the cook in the kitchenthere were rarely any women eating in the cookhouse except on the weekends when some of the men ate with their families that alcohol was not permitted was the cooks rule dinner or supper as the older rivermen used to eating in the wanigans called it was served as soon as it was dark and the majority of loggers and sawmill men were sober when they ate their evening meal which they consumed quickly and with no intelligible conversationeven on weekends or when the loggers werent engaged in the river drives as the men had usually come to eat directly from some manner of work their clothes were soiled and they smelled of pitch and spruce gum and wet bark and sawdust but their hands and faces were clean and freshly scented by the pinetar soap that the cavernous washroom of the cookhouse made readily availableat the cooks request washing your hands before eating was another of dominics rules furthermore the washroom towels were always clean the clean towels were part of the reason that the indian dishwasher generally stayed late while the kitchen help was washing the last of the supper dishes the dishwasher herself was loading the towels into the washing machines in the cookhouses laundry room she never went home until the washing cycles had ended and shed put all the towels in the dryers the dishwasher was called injun jane but not to her face danny baciagalupo liked her and she appeared to dote on the boy she was more than a decade older than his dad she was even older than ketchum and she had lost a sonpossibly hed drowned in the pemigewasset if danny hadnt misheard the story or maybe jane and her dead son were from the pemigewasset wildernessthey may have come from that part of the state northwest of the mills in conwayand the doomed son had drowned elsewhere there was a bigger uncontained wilderness north of milan where the spruce mill was there were more logging camps up there and lots of places where a young logger might drown jane had told danny that pemigewasset meant alley of the crooked pines which conjured to the impressionable boy a likely place to drown all young dan could really remember was that it had been a wilderness riverdriving accidentand from the fond way the dishwasher looked at the cooks son perhaps her lost boy had been about twelve when he drowned danny didnt know and he didnt ask everything he knew about injun jane was something hed silently observed or had imperfectly overheard listen only to those conversations that are directed to you daniel his father had warned him the cook meant that danny shouldnt eavesdrop on the disjointed or incoherent remarks the men made to one another when they were eating most nights after their evening mealbut never as flagrantly as in the wanigan days and not usually when there was an earlymorning river drivethe loggers and the sawmill men drank the few who had actual homes in twisted river drank at home the transientsmeaning most of the woodsmen and all the canadian itinerantsdrank in their bunkhouses which were crudely equipped in that dank area of town immediately above the river basin these hostelries were within walking distance of the dismal bars and the seedy misnamed dance hall where there was no actual dancingonly music and the usual toofew women to meet the loggers and sawmill workers with families preferred the smaller but contentiously more civilized settlement in paris ketchum refused to call the logging camp paris referring instead to what he said was the real name of the placewest dummer no community not even a logging camp should be named for a manufacturing company ketchum declared it further offended ketchum that a logging operation in new hampshire was named after a company in maineone that manufactured toboggans of all things dear god the cook cried soon all the wood on twisted river will be pulpwoodfor paper what about toboggans is worse than paper books are made from paper ketchum declared what role do toboggans play in your sons education there was a scarcity of children in twisted river and they went to school in parisas danny baciagalupo did when he went to school at all for the betterment of young dans education the cook not infrequently kept his son home from schoolso that the boy could read a book or two a practice not necessarily encouraged by the paris or as ketchum would have it the west dummer school perish the thought that the children in a logging camp should learn to read ketchum railed as a child he had not learned to read he was forever angry about it there werethere still aregood markets for both sawlogs and pulpwood over the canadian border the north country of new hampshire continues to feed wood in huge quantities to paper mills in new hampshire and maine and to a furniture mill in vermont but of the logging camps as they used to be mere tumbledown evidence remains in a town like twisted river only the weather wouldnt change from the sluice dam at the bottom of little dummer pond to the basin below twisted river a persistent fog or mist lay suspended above the violent water until midmorningin all seasons except when the river was frozen from the sawmills the keen whine of the blades was both as familiar and expected as the songs of birds though neither the sounds of sawing nor the birdsongs were as reliable as the fact that there was never any spring weather in that part of new hampshireexcept for the regrettable period of time from early april till the middle of may which was distinguished by frozen slowly thawing mud yet the cook had stayed and there were few in twisted river who knew why there were fewer who knew why hed come in the first place and from where or when but his limp had a history of which everyone was aware in a sawmill or loggingcamp kind of town a limp like dominic baciagalupos was not uncommon when logs of any size were set in motion an ankle could get crushed even when he wasnt walking it was obvious that the boot on the cooks maimed foot was two sizes bigger than the one he wore on his good footand when he was either sitting down or standing still his bigger boot pointed the wrong way to those knowledgeable souls in the settlement of twisted river such an injury could have come from any number of logging accidents dominic had been pretending to be a teenager in his own estimation he was not as green as angel pope but he was green enough as the cook would tell his son hed had an afterschool job on the loading platforms at one of the big mills in berlin where a friend of dominics absent father was a foreman until world war ii the supposed friend of dominics dad was a fixture there but the cook remembered socalled uncle umberto as an alcoholic who repeatedly badmouthed dominics mom even after the accident dominic baciagalupo was never contacted by his absconding father and uncle umberto not once proved himself as a family friend there was a load of hardwood sawlogs on the log deckmostly maple and birch young dominic was using a peavey rolling the logs into the mill when a bunch of logs rolled all at once and he couldnt get out of their way he was only twelve in he handled a peavey with a rakish confidence dominic had been the same age as his son was now the cook would never have allowed his beloved daniel on a log deck not even if the boy had been ambidextrous with a peavey and in dominics case when he had been knocked down by the logs the hinged hook of his own peavey was driven into his left thigh like a fishhook without the barb and his left ankle was crunched sidewaysit was shattered and mangled under the weight of the wood from the peavey wound he was in no danger of bleeding to death but one could always die of blood poisoning in those days from the ankle injury he might have died of gangrene lateror more likely had the left foot amputated if not the entire leg there were no xrays in coos county in the medical authorities in berlin were disinclined to undertake any fancy reassembly of a crushed ankle in such cases little or no surgery was recommended it was a waitandsee category of accident either the blood vessels were mashed flat and there would be a subsequent loss of circulationthen the doctors would have to cut the foot offor the broken and displaced bits of the ankle would fuse together and heal every which way and dominic baciagalupo would walk with a limp and be in pain for the rest of his life that would turn out to be the case there was also the scar where the peavey had hooked him which resembled the bite wound of a small peculiar animalone with a curved solitary tooth and a mouth that wasnt big enough to enclose the twelveyearolds thigh and even before he took a step the angle of dominics left foot indicated a sharp left turn the toes were aimed in a sideways direction people often noticed the deformed shape of the ankle and the misdirected foot before they saw the limp one thing was certain young dominic wouldnt be a logger you need your balance for that kind of work and the mills were where hed been injurednot to mention that his runaway fathers drunken friend was a foreman there the mills were not in dominic baciagalupos future either hey baciagalupo uncle umberto had often hailed him you may have a neapolitan name but you hang around like a sicilian i am sicilian dominic would dutifully say his mother seemed inordinately proud of it the boy thought yeah well your name is napolitano umberto told him after my dad i suppose young dominic ventured to guess your dad was no baciagalupo uncle umberto informed him ask nunzi where your name came fromshe gave it to you the twelveyearold didnt like it when umberto who clearly disliked dominics mother called her nunzian affectionate family nickname shortened from annunziatawhich umberto didnt say affectionately at all in a play or in a film the audience would have had no trouble recognizing umberto as a minor character yet the best actor to play umberto would be one who always believed he was cast in a major role and youre not really my uncle i suppose dominic inquired of umberto ask your mama umberto said if she wanted to keep you siciliano she shoulda given you her name his mothers maiden name was saettashe was very proud of the sighaytah as she pronounced the sicilian name and of all the saettas dominic had heard her speak of when she chose to talk about her heritage annunziata was reluctant to speak of dominics heritage at all what little the boy had gleanedbits of information or misinformationhad been gathered slowly and insufficiently like the partial evidence the incomplete clues in the increasingly popular board game of young dans childhood one the cook and ketchum played with the boy and sometimes jane joined them was it colonel mustard in the kitchen with the candlestick or had the murder been committed by miss scarlet in the ballroom with the revolver all young dominic knew was that his father a neapolitan had abandoned the pregnant annunziata saetta in boston he was rumored to have taken a boat back to naples to the question where is he now which the boy had asked his mother many times annunziata would shrug and sigh and looking either to heaven or in the direction of the exhaust vent above her kitchen stove she would say mysteriously to her son vicino di napoli in the vicinity of naples young dominic had guessed with the help of an atlas and because the boy had heard his mother murmur the names of two hill towns and provinces in the vicinity of naples in her sleepbenevento and avellinodominic had concluded that his dad had fled to that region of italy as for umberto he was clearly not an uncleand definitely a legendary asshole as ketchum would have said what kind of name is umberto dominic had asked the foreman from da king umberto had answered indignantly i mean its a neapolitan name right the boy had asked what are you questioning me for you da twelveyearold pretending to be sixteen umberto cried you told me to say i was sixteen dominic reminded the foreman look you gotta job baciagalupo umberto had said then the logs rolled and dominic became a cook his mother a sicilianborn italianamerican transported by an unwanted pregnancy from bostons north end to berlin new hampshire could cook shed left the city and had moved to the north country when gennaro capodilupo had slipped away to the docks off atlantic avenue and commercial street leaving her with child as he sailed figuratively if not literally back to naples asshole if not uncle umberto was right dominics dad was no baciagalupo the absconding father was a capodilupocahpohdeelewpoh as annunziata told her son meant head of the wolf what was the unwed mother to do for the lies he told your father should have been a boccadalupo she said to dominic this meant mouth of the wolf the boy would learna fitting name for asshole umberto young dominic often thought but you angelùyou are my kiss of the wolf his mom said in an effort to legitimize him and because his mother had a highhanded love of words she would not name dominic a head of or a mouth of the wolf for annunziata saetta only a kiss of the wolf would do it should have been spelled baciacalupo but nunzi always pronounced the second c in baciacalupo like a g over time and due to a clerical error in kindergarten the misspelled name had stuck hed become dominic baciagalupo before he became a cook his mother also called him dom for shortdominic being derived from doménica which means sunday not that annunziata was a tireless adherent of what ketchum called catholic thinking what was both catholic and italian in the saetta family had driven the young unmarried woman north to new hampshire in berlin other italians presumably also catholics would look after her had they expected she would put her child up for adoption and come back to the north end nunzi knew that this was done but she wouldnt consider giving up her baby andnotwithstanding the sizable nostalgia she expressed for the italian north endshe was never tempted to go back to boston either in her unplanned condition she had been sent away understandably she resented it while annunziata remained a loyal sicilian in her own kitchen the proverbial ties that bind were irreparably frayed her boston familyand by association the italian community in the north end and whatever represented catholic thinking therehad disowned her in turn she disowned them nunzi never went to mass herself nor did she make dominic go its enough if we go to confession when we want to she would tell young domher little kiss of the wolf she wouldnt teach the boy italian eithersome essential cooking lingo exceptednor was dominic inclined to learn the language of the old country which to the boy meant the north end of boston not italy it was both a language and a place that had rejected his mother italian would never be dominic baciagalupos language he said adamantly that boston was nowhere he ever wanted to go everything in annunziata saettas new life was defined by a sense of starting over the youngest of three sisters she could read and speak english as well as she could cook siciliano nunzi taught children how to read in a berlin elementary schooland after the accident she took dominic out of school and taught him some fundamental cooking skills she also insisted that the boy read booksnot just cookbooks but everything she read which were mostly novels her son had been crippled while violating the generally overlooked childlabor laws annunziata had taken him out of circulation her version of homeschooling being both culinary and literary neither area of education was available to ketchum who had left school when he was younger than twelve at nineteen in ketchum could neither read nor write but when he wasnt working as a logger he was loading lumber onto the railroad flatcars from the open platforms at the end of the biggest berlin mill the deck crew tapered the load at the top so that the flatcars could safely pass through the tunnels or under the bridges that was the extent of my education before your mom taught me to read ketchum enjoyed telling danny baciagalupo the cook would commence to shake his head again although the story of dominics late wife teaching ketchum to read was apparently incontestable at least the saga of ketchum belatedly learning to read seemed not in the talltale category of ketchums other storiesthe one about the lowroofed bunkhouse at camp one for example according to ketchum some injun had been assigned the task of shoveling snow off the roof but the indian had neglected the job when the roof collapsed under the weight of the snow all but one logger escaped the bunkhouse alivenot the indian who was suffocated by what ketchum called the concentrated odor of wet socks of course the cook and his son were well aware of ketchums nearly constant complaintnamely that the stink of wet socks was the bane of bunkhouse life i dont remember an indian at camp one was all dominic had said to his old friend youre too young to remember camp one cookie ketchum had said danny baciagalupo had often observed that his father bristled at the mere mention of the sevenyear age difference between himself and ketchum whereas ketchum was inclined to overemphasize the discrepancy in their ages those seven years would have seemed insurmountable to them had the two young men met in the berlin of their youthwhen ketchum had been a rawboned but strapping nineteen already sporting a full if ragged beard and annunziatas little dom was not yet a teenager hed been a strong wiry twelveyearoldnot big but compact and sinewyand the cook had retained the appearance of a leanmuscled young logger although he was now thirty and looked older especially to his young son it was his dads seriousness that made him look older the boy thought you could not say the past or the future in the cooks presence without making him frown as for the present even the twelveyearold daniel baciagalupo understood that the times were changing danny knew that his fathers life had been changed forever because of an ankle injury a different accident to the boys young mother had altered the course of his own childhood and changed his dads life forever again in a twelveyearolds world change couldnt be good any change made danny anxiousthe way missing school made him anxious on the river drives in the notsoold days when danny and his dad were working and sleeping in the wanigans the boy didnt go to school that he didnt like schoolbut that he always and far too easily made up the work he missedalso made danny anxious the boys in his grade were all older than he was because they skipped school as often as they could and they never made up the work they missed theyd all been held back and had repeated a grade or two when the cook saw that his son was anxious he invariably said stand your ground danieljust dont get killed i promise you one day well leave here but this made danny baciagalupo anxious too even the wanigans had felt like home to him and in twisted river the twelveyearold had his own bedroom above the cookhousewhere his father also had a bedroom and where they shared a bathroom these were the only secondstory rooms in the cookhouse and they were spacious and comfortable each room had a skylight and big windows with a view of the mountains andbelow the cookhouse at the foothills of the mountainsa partial view of the river basin logging trails circumscribed the hills and mountains there were big patches of meadow and second growth where the woodcutters had harvested the hardwoods and the coniferous forest from his bedroom it seemed to young daniel baciagalupo that the bare rock and second growth could never replace the maples and birch or the softwoodsthe spruce and fir the red and white pine and the hemlock and tamarack the twelveyearold thought that the meadows were running wild with waisthigh grass and weeds yet in truth the forests in the region were being managed for sustainable yields of timber those woods are still producingin the twentyfirst fucking century as ketchum would one day say and as ketchum regularly suggested some things would never change tamarack will always love swamps yellow birch will forever be highly prized for furniture and gray birch will never be good for fuckall except firewood as for the fact that the river drives in coos county would soon be limited to fourfoot pulpwood ketchum was morosely disinclined to utter any prophecies all the veteran logger would say was that the smaller pulpwood tended to stray out of the current and required cleanup crews what would change the logging business and what might put an end to the cooks job was the restless spirit of modernity the changing times could kill a mere settlement like twisted river but danny baciagalupo was just wondering obsessively what work would there be in twisted river after the woodcutters moved on would the cook then move on danny worried could ketchum ever move on as for the river it just kept moving as rivers doas rivers do under the logs the body of the young canadian moved with the river which jostled him to and froto and fro if at this moment in time twisted river also appeared restless even impatient maybe the river itself wanted the boys body to move on toomove on too chapter dosido in a storage closet off the pantry in the cookhouse kitchen the cook kept a couple of folding cotsfrom the wanigan days when hed slept in any number of portable kitchens dominic had salvaged a couple of sleeping bags too it was not out of nostalgia for the wanigans that the cook had kept the old cots and mildewed sleeping bags sometimes ketchum slept in the cookhouse kitchen occasionally if danny was awake the boy would tirelessly endeavor to get his dads permission to sleep in the kitchen too if ketchum hadnt had too much to drink danny hoped to hear another of the loggers storiesor the same story wildly revised the first night after angel pope had disappeared under the logs it snowed a little it was still cold at night in april but dominic had turned the two gas ovens on in the kitchen the ovens were set at and degrees and the cook had premixed the dry ingredients for the scones the corn muffins and the banana bread before going to bed his french toast from the banana bread was popular and he would make pancakes from scratch in the morning because of the raw eggs dominic didnt like to keep the pancake batter in the fridge more than two days also lastminute almost every morning he made buttermilk biscuits which he baked quickly in the degree oven it was usually dannys job to be sure that the potatoes were peeled and cubed and soaking overnight in salted water his dad would fry the potatoes on the griddle in the morning when he fried the bacon the griddle on the old garland was above the broiler which was eyelevel to the cook even with a longhandled spatula and standing on tiptoe or on a low stoolneither method of elevating himself was the easiest thing for a cook with a crooked footdominic would frequently burn his forearm when he reached to the back of the griddle sometimes injun jane would spell the cook at the griddle because she was taller and her reach was longer it would be dark when dominic got up to fry the bacon and do his baking and dark when danny woke in the upstairs of the cookhouse to the smell of bacon and coffee and still dark when the kitchen help and the indian dishwasher arrived from townthe headlights of their vehicles heralding their arrival almost simultaneously with the engine sounds most mornings the garland s broiler was flaming hotfor melting the cheese on top of the omelets among young dans beforeschool jobs were cutting up the peppers and tomatoes for the omelets and warming the big saucepan of maple syrup on one of the back burners of the eightburner stove the outside door to the cookhouse kitchen didnt open or close properly it was so loosefitting that it rattled in the wind the inside screen door opened into the kitchen which could be added to the list of things that made danny baciagalupo anxious for any number of practical reasons you wanted the door to open to the outside there was enough traffic in the busy kitchen to not want a door getting in the wayand once long ago a bear had come into the cookhouse kitchen it had been a balmy nightthe troublesome outside door to the cookhouse was propped openand the bear had just butted the screen door with its head and walked inside danny had been too young to remember the bear although hed asked his father to tell him the story many times the boys mother had long before put him to bed upstairs she was having a latenight snack with dannys dad when the bear joined them the cook and his wife were sharing a mushroom omelet and drinking white wine when he used to drink dominic baciagalupo had explained to his son he had often felt compelled to fix latenight snacks for himself and his wife not anymore dannys mother screamed when she saw the bear that made the bear stand up on its hind legs and squint at her but dominic had had quite a lot of wine at first he didnt know it was a bear he must have thought it was a hairy drunken logger coming to assault his beautiful wife on the stove was an eightinch castiron skillet in which the cook had recently sautéed the mushrooms for the omelet dominic picked up the skillet which was still warm in his hand and hit the bear in the facemostly on its nose but also on the broad flat bridge of its nose between the bears small squinty eyes the bear dropped to all fours and fled through the kitchen door leaving the torn screen and the broken wooden slats hanging from the frame whenever the cook told this story he always said well the door had to be fixed of course but it still opens the wrong way in telling the story to his son dominic baciagalupo usually added i would never hit a bear with a castiron skilleti thought it was a man but what would you do with a bear danny asked his dad try to reason with it i guess the cook replied in that sort of situation you cant reason with a man as for what that sort of situation was dan could only guess had his father imagined he was protecting his pretty wife from a dangerous man as for the eightinch castiron skillet it had acquired a special place for itself in the cookhouse it no longer made its home in the kitchen with the other pots and pans the skillet was hung at shoulder height on a hook in the upstairs of the cookhouse where the bedrooms wereit resided just inside dominics bedroom door that skillet had proved its worth it had become the cooks weapon of choice should he ever hear someones footsteps on the stairs or the sound of an intruder animal or human sneaking around in the kitchen dominic didnt own a gun he didnt want one for a new hampshire boy he had missed out on all the deer huntingnot only because of the ankle injury but because he hadnt grown up with a dad as for the loggers and the sawmill men the deer hunters among them brought the cook their deer he butchered the deer for them and kept enough meat for himself so that he could occasionally serve venison in the cookhouse it wasnt that dominic disapproved of hunting he just didnt like venison or guns he also suffered from a recurrent dream hed told daniel about it the cook repeatedly dreamed that he was murdered in his sleepshot to death in his own bedand whenever he woke from that dream the sound of the shot was still ringing in his ears so dominic baciagalupo slept with a skillet in his bedroom there were castiron skillets of all sizes in the cookhouse kitchen but the eightinch size was preferable for selfdefense even young dan could manage to swing it with some force as for the tenandahalfinch skillet or the elevenandaquarterinch one they may have been more accommodating to cook in but they were too heavy to be reliable weapons not even ketchum could swing those bigger skillets quickly enough to take out a lecherous logger or a bear the night after angel pope had gone under the logs danny baciagalupo lay in bed in the upstairs of the cookhouse the boys bedroom was above the insideopening screen door to the kitchen and the loosefitting outer door which he could hear rattling in the wind he could hear the river too in the cookhouse you could always hear twisted river except when the river ran under the ice but danny must have fallen asleep as quickly as his father because the twelveyearold didnt hear the truck the light from the trucks headlights had not shone into the cookhouse whoever was driving the truck must have been able to navigate the road from town in neartotal darkness because there wasnt much moonlight that nightor else the driver was drunk and had forgotten to turn on the trucks headlights danny thought he heard the door to the trucks cab close the mud which was soft in the daytime could get crunchy underfoot at nightit was still cold enough at night for the mud to freeze and now there was a dusting of new snow perhaps he hadnt heard a truck door close dan was thinking that clunk might have been a sound in whatever dream the boy had been having outside the cookhouse the footsteps on the frozen mud made a shuffling soundponderous and wary maybe its a bear danny thought the cook kept a cooler outside the kitchen the cooler was sealed tight but it contained the ground lamb for the lamb hash and the baconand whatever other perishables wouldnt fit in the fridge what if the bear had smelled the meat in the cooler danny was thinking dad the boy spoke out but his father was probably fast asleep down the hall like everyone else the bear seemed to be having trouble with the outer door to the cookhouse kitchen it batted at the door with one paw young dan heard grunting too dad danny shouted he heard his father swipe the castiron skillet off the hook on the bedroom wall like his dad the boy had gone to bed in his long johns and a pair of socks the floor in the upstairs hall felt cold to danny even with his socks on he and his dad padded downstairs to the kitchen which was dimly lit by the pilot lights flickering from the old garland the cook had a twohanded grip on the black skillet when the outer door opened the bearif it was a bearpushed against the screen door with its chest it came inside in an upright position albeit unsteadily its teeth were a long white blur im not a bear cookie ketchum said the flash of white which danny had imagined was the bears bared teeth was the new cast on ketchums right forearm the cast went from the middle of the big mans palm to where his arm bent at the elbow sorry i startled you fellas ketchum added close the outer door will you im trying to keep it warm in here the cook said danny saw his father put the skillet on the bottom step of the stairs ketchum struggled to secure the outer door with his left hand youre drunk dominic told him ive got one arm cookie and im righthanded ketchum said youre still drunk ketchum dominic baciagalupo told his old friend i guess you remember what thats like ketchum said dan helped ketchum close the outer door ill bet youre real hungry he said to ketchum the big man swaying slightly ruffled the boys hair i dont need to eat ketchum said it might help to sober you up the cook said dominic opened the fridge he told ketchum ive got some meat loaf which isnt bad cold you can have it with applesauce i dont need to eat the big man said again i need you to come with me cookie where are we going dominic asked but even young dan knew when his father was pretending not to know something he clearly knew you know where ketchum told the cook i just have trouble remembering the exact spot thats because you drink too much ketchumthats why you cant remember dominic said when ketchum lowered his head he swayed more for a moment danny thought that the logger might fall down and by the way both men had lowered their voices the boy understood that they were negotiating they were also being careful not to say too much because ketchum didnt know what the twelveyearold knew about his mothers death and dominic baciagalupo didnt want his son to hear whatever odd or unwelcome detail ketchum might remember just try the meat loaf ketchum the cook said softly its pretty good with applesauce danny said the riverman lowered himself onto a stool he rested his new white cast on the countertop everything about ketchum was hardened and sharpedged like a whittleddown stickand as danny had observed wicked toughwhich made the sterile fragilelooking cast as unsuited to the man as a prosthetic limb if ketchum had lost an arm he would have made do with the stumphe might have used it as a club but now that ketchum was sitting down danny thought the river driver looked safe enough to touch the boy had never felt a cast before even drunk ketchum somehow knew what dan was thinking go onyou can touch it the logger said extending his cast in the boys direction there was dried blood or pitch on what danny could see of ketchums crooked fingers they protruded from the cast unmoving with a broken wrist it hurt to move your fingers for the first few days the boy gently touched ketchums cast the cook gave ketchum a generous serving of meat loaf and applesauce theres milk or orange juice dominic said or i could make you some coffee what a disheartening choice ketchum said winking at danny disheartening the cook repeated shaking his head ill make some coffee danny wished that the two men would just talk about everything the boy knew much of their history but not enough about his mother of her death no detail could be odd or unwelcomedanny wanted to hear every word of it but the cook was a careful man or he had become one even ketchum who had driven his own children away from him was especially cautious and protective with danny much as the veteran logger had behaved around angel i wouldnt go there with you when youve been drinking anyway the cook was saying i took you there when youd been drinking ketchum said so he wouldnt say more he took a mouthful of meat loaf and applesauce except when its under a logjam a body doesnt move downstream as fast as a log dominic baciagalupo said as if he were speaking to the coffeepotnot to ketchum whose back was turned to him not unless the body is caught on a log danny had heard this explanation in another context it had taken a few daysthree to be exactfor his mothers body to make the journey from the river basin to the narrows where it had bumped up against the dam first a drowned body sinks the cook had explained to his son then it rises theyre keeping the dams closed through the weekend ketchum said he meant not only dead woman dam but the pontook dam on the androscoggin ketchum ate steadily but not fast the fork held unfamiliarly and a little clumsily in his left hand its good with applesauce isnt it the boy asked him ketchum nodded in agreement chewing vigorously they could smell the coffee brewing and the cook saidmore to himself than to his son or ketchumi might as well start the bacon while im at it ketchum just went on eating i suppose the logs are already at the first dam dominic added as if he were still speaking to no one but himself i mean our logs i know which logs you mean and which dam ketchum told him yes the logs are already at the damthey were there while you were making supper so you saw that moron doctor there the cook asked not that you need a genius to put a cast on a broken wrist but you must be a man who loves to take chances dominic went out of the cookhouse to get the bacon from the cooler it was black outside and the sound of the river rushed into the warm kitchen you used to take chances cookie ketchum called out to his old friend he looked cautiously at danny your dad used to be happier toowhen he drank i used to be happierperiod the cook said the way he dropped the slab of bacon on the cutting board made danny look at his father but ketchum never turned his attention away from the meat loaf and applesauce given that bodies move downstream slower than logs ketchum said with deliberate slowness his speech slightly slurred what would you guess as to angels estimated time of arrival at that spot im having trouble remembering exactly danny was counting to himself but it was clear to the boy and to ketchum that the cook had already been estimating the young canadians journey saturday night or sunday morning dominic baciagalupo said he had to raise his voice above the hissing bacon im not going there with you at night ketchum danny quickly looked at ketchum anticipating the big mans response it was after all the story that most interested the boy and the one closest to his heart i went there with you at night cookie the odds are better youll be sober sunday morning the cook told ketchum nine oclock sunday morningdaniel and i will meet you there they meant dead woman dam though young dan knew that neither man would say it we can all go in my truck ketchum said ill drive daniel with me in case youre not quite sober dominic replied ketchum pushed his clean plate away he rested his shaggy head on the countertop and stared at his cast youll meet me at the millpond you mean ketchum asked i dont call it that the cook said the dam was there before the mill how can they call it a pond when its where the river narrows you know mill people ketchum said with contempt the dam was there before the mill dominic repeated still not naming the dam one day the water will breach that dam and they wont bother to build another one ketchum said his eyes were closing one day they wont be driving logs on twisted river the cook said they wont need a dam where the river runs into the reservoir though i believe theyll keep the pontook dam on the androscoggin one day soon cookie ketchum corrected him his eyes were closedhis head his chest and both his arms were sprawled on the countertop the cook quietly removed the clean plate but ketchum wasnt asleep he spoke more slowly than before theres a sort of spillway off to one side of the dam the water makes a poolits almost like an open wellbut theres a kind of containment boom just a rope with floats to keep the logs out it sounds like you remember it as exactly as i do dominic told him that was where theyd found his mother danny knew her body floated lower in the water than the logs she must have drifted under the containment boom and into the spillway ketchum had found her all alone in the pool or the wellnot a log around her i cant quite see how to get there ketchum said with some frustration with his eyes still closed he was slowly curling the fingers of his right hand his fingertips reaching for but not quite touching the palm of his cast both the cook and his son knew that the logger was testing his tolerance of the pain well i can show you ketchum dominic said gently you have to walk out on the dam or across the logsremember the cook had carried one of the folding cots into the kitchen he nodded to his son who helped him set up the cotwhere it wouldnt be in the way of the ovens or the insideopening screen door i want to sleep in the kitchen too danny told his dad if you make a little distance between yourself and the conversation you might actually go back to sleep dominic said to his son i want to hear the conversation danny said the conversation is almost over the cook whispered in the boys ear kissing him dont count on it cookie ketchum said with his eyes still closed ive got the baking to do ketchumand i might as well start the potatoes ive heard you talk and cook at the same time ketchum told him he hadnt opened his eyes the cook gave his son a stern look pointing to the stairs its cold upstairs danny complained the boy paused on the bottom step where the skillet was on your way please put the skillet back where it belongs daniel the boy went grudgingly upstairs pausing on every step he listened to his father work with the mixing bowls young dan didnt need to see in order to know what his dad was doingthe cook always made the banana bread first as danny hung the eightinch castiron skillet on the hook in his fathers bedroom he counted sixteen eggs cracked into the stainlesssteel bowl then came the mashed bananas and the chopped walnuts sometimes his dad topped the bread with warm apples the cook made the scones next adding the eggs and the butter to the dry ingredientsthe fruit if he had any he added last from the upstairs hall danny could hear his father greasing the muffin tins which he then sprinkled with flourbefore he put the cornmuffin mixture into the tins there was oatmeal in the banana breadand sweet bran flour which the boy could soon smell from his bedroom it was warmer under the covers from where danny heard the oven doors open and the baking pans and muffin tins slide in then he heard the oven doors close the unusual sound which made the boy open his eyes and sit up in bed was his father struggling to lift ketchumholding the big man under both arms while he dragged him to the folding cot danny hadnt known that his dad was strong enough to lift ketchum the twelveyearold crept quietly down the stairs and watched his father settle ketchum on the cot where the cook covered the logger with one of the unzipped sleeping bags as if the opened bag were a blanket dominic baciagalupo was putting the potatoes on the griddle when ketchum spoke to him there was no way i could let you see her cookieit wouldnt have been right i understand the cook said on the stairs danny closed his eyes again seeing the story which he knew by heartketchum taking small steps on the logs drunk while he reached into the pool created by the spillway dont come out here cookie ketchum had called ashore dont you try walking on the logsor on the dam either dominic had watched ketchum carry his dead wife along the edge of the containment boom get away from me cookie ketchum had called as he came across the logs you cant see her anymoreshes not the same as she was the cook who was also drunk had taken the blanket from the back of ketchums truck but ketchum would not come ashore with the body even drunk he had kept walking on the logs with small rapid steps spread the blanket in the back of the truck cookiethen walk away when ketchum came ashore dominic was standing at a triangular pointequidistant from the riverbank and ketchums truck just stand your ground cookietill i cover her ketchum had said danny wondered if that was the source of his fathers frequent admonition stand your ground danieljust dont get killed maybe it had come from ketchum who had gently placed the cooks dead wife in the back of his truck covering her with the blanket dominic had kept his distance didnt you want to see her danny had asked his dad too many times i trust ketchum his father had answered if anything ever happens to me daniel you trust him too danny realized that he must have crept back upstairs to his bedroom and fallen asleep when he smelled the lamb hash in addition to all the baking hed not been aware of his dad opening the difficult outer door to the cookhouse kitchen and getting the ground lamb from the cooler the boy lay in his bed with his eyes still closed savoring all the smells he wanted to ask ketchum if his mom had been faceup in the water when hed first spotted her or if hed found her in the spillway facedown danny got dressed and went downstairs to the kitchen only then did he realize that his father had found the time to come upstairs and get dressed probably after ketchum had passed out on the cot dan watched his dad working at the stove when the cook was concentrating on three or four tasks that were all in close proximity to one another his limp was almost undetectable at such moments danny could imagine his father at the age of twelvebefore the ankle accident at twelve danny baciagalupo was a lonely kid he had no friends he often wished that he could have known his dad when they were both twelveyearolds when youre twelve four years seems like a long time annunziata saetta knew that it wouldnt take her little doms ankle four years to heal nunzis beloved kiss of the wolf was off the crutches in four months and he was reading as well as any fifteenyearold by the time he was only thirteen the homeschooling worked in the first place annunziata was an elementaryschool teacher she knew how much of the school day was wasted on discipline recess and snacks the boy did his homework and doublechecked it during what amounted to nunzis school day dominic had time for lots of extra reading and he kept a journal of the recipes he was learning too the boys cooking skills were more slowly acquired andafter the accidentannunziata made her own childlabor laws she would not permit young dominic to go off to work at a breakfast place in berlin until the boy really knew his way around a kitchen and he had to wait until hed turned sixteen in those four years dom became an extremely wellread sixteenyearold and an accomplished cook who was less experienced at shaving than he was at walking with a limp it was when dominic baciagalupo met dannys mom she was a twentythreeyearold teaching in the same elementary school as annunziata saetta in fact the cooks mother introduced her sixteenyearold son to the new teacher nunzi had no choice in the matter her cousin maria another saetta had married a calogeroa common sicilian surname after some greek saint who died therethe name has something to do with children in general i think or maybe orphans in particular nunzi had explained to dominic she pronounced the name cahlohgerroh it was used as a first name too his mother explainedfrequently for bastards at sixteen dominic was sensitive to the subject of illegitimacynot that annunziata wasnt her cousin had sent her pregnant daughter away to the wilds of new hampshire bemoaning the fact that the daughter was the first woman in the calogero family to have graduated from college it was only a teachers college and a lot of good it did hershe still got knocked up the poor girls mother told nunzi who repeated this insensitivity to dom the boy understood without further detail that the pregnant twentythreeyearold was being sent to them because annunziata and her bastard were considered in the same boat her name was rosina butgiven nunzis fondness for abbreviationsthe banished girl was already a rosie before she made the trip from boston to berlin as was often the way back thennot only in the north end and by no means limited to italian or catholic familiesthe saettas and the calogeros were sending one family scandal to live with another thus annunziata was given a reason to resent her boston relatives twice let this be a lesson to you dom the teenagers mother told him we are not going to judge poor rosie for her unfortunate conditionwe are going to love her like nothing was the matter while annunziata should be commended for her spirit of forgivenessespecially in when unwed mothers could generally be counted among america s most unforgiven soulsit was both reckless and unnecessary to tell her sixteenyearold son that he was going to love his second cousin like nothing was the matter why is she my second cousin the boy asked his mom maybe thats not what she ismaybe shes called your cousin onceremoved or something nunzi said when dominic looked confused his mother said whatever shes called shes not really your cousinnot a first cousin anyway this information or misinformation posed an unknown danger to a crippled sixteenyearold boy his accident his rehabilitation his homeschooling not to mention his reinvention as a cookall thesehad deprived him of friends his own age and little dom had a fulltime job he already saw himself as a young man now nunzi had told him that the twentythreeyearold rosie calogero was not really his cousin as for rosie when she arrived she was not yet showing that she soon would be posed another problem rosie had a bs in education from the teachers college at that time frankly she was overqualified to teach at a berlin elementary school but when the young woman started to look pregnant she would need to temporarily quit her job or else well have to come up with a husband for you either real or imaginary annunziata told her rosie was certainly pretty enough to find a husband a real onedominic thought she was absolutely beautifulbut the poor girl wasnt about to sally forth on the requisite social adventures necessary for meeting available young men not when she was expecting for four years the boy had cooked with his mother in some ways because he wrote every recipe downnot to mention each variation of the recipes he would make occasionally without herhe was surpassing her even as he learned as it happened on that lifechanging night dominic was making dinner for the two women and himself he was on his way to becoming famous at the breakfast place in berlin and he got home from work well before rosie and his mom came home from school except on weekends when nunzi liked to cook dominic was becoming the principal cook in their small household stirring his marinara sauce he said well i could marry rosie or i could pretend to be her husbanduntil she finds someone more suitable i mean who needs to know to annunziata it seemed like such a sweet and innocent offer she laughed and gave her son a hug but young dom couldnt imagine anyone more suitable for rosie than himselfhe had been faking the pretend part he would have married rosie for real the difference in their ages or that they were vaguely related was no stumbling block for him as for rosie it didnt matter that the sixteenyearolds proposal which was both sweet and notsoinnocent was unrealisticand probably illegal even in northern new hampshire what affected the poor girl who was still in the first trimester of her pregnancy was that the lout whod knocked her up had not offered to marry hernot even under what had amounted to considerable duress given the predilections of the male members of both the saetta and calogero families this duress took the form of multiple threats of castration ending with death by drowning whether it was naples or palermo the lout sailed back to was not made clear but no marriage proposal was ever forthcoming dominics spontaneous and heartfelt offer was the first time anyone had proposed to rosie overcome she burst into tears at the kitchen table before dominic could poach the shrimp in his marinara sauce sobbing the distraught young woman went to bed without her dinner in the night annunziata awoke to the confusing sounds of rosies miscarriageconfusing because at that moment nunzi didnt know if the loss of the baby was a blessing or a curse dominic baciagalupo lay in his bed listening to his second or onceremoved cousin crying the toilet kept flushing the bathtub was fillingthere must have been bloodand over it all came the sympathetic crooning of his mothers most consoling voice rosie maybe its better this way now you dont need to quit your jobnot even temporarily now we dont have to come up with a husband for younot a real one or the imaginary kind listen to me rosieit wasnt a baby not yet but dominic lay wondering what have i done even an imaginary marriage to rosie gave the boy a nearly constant erection well he was sixteen years oldno wonder when he heard that rosie had stopped crying young dom held his breath did dominic hear medid i wake him up do you think the boy heard the girl ask his mother well he sleeps like the dead nunzi said but you did make quite a ruckusunderstandably of course he must have heard me the girl cried i have to talk to him she said dominic could hear her step out of the tub there was the vigorous rubbing of a towel and the sound of her bare feet on the bathroom floor i can explain to dom in the morning his mother was saying but his notreallyacousins bare feet were already padding down the hall to the spare room no i have something to tell him rosie called dominic could hear a drawer open a coat hanger fell in her closet then the girl was in his roomshe just opened his door without knocking and lay down on the bed beside him he could feel her wet hair touch his face i heard you he told her im going to be fine rosie began ill have a baby some other day does it hurt he asked her he kept his face turned away from her on the pillow because he had brushed his teeth too long agohe was afraid his breath was bad i didnt think i wanted the baby until i lost it rosie was saying he couldnt think of what to say but she went on what you said to me dominic was the nicest thing anyone ever said to meill never forget it i would marry you you knowi wasnt just saying it the boy said she hugged him and kissed his ear she was on top of the covers and he was under them but he could still feel her body pressing against his back ill never have a nicer offeri know it his notreallyacousin said maybe we could get married when im a little older dominic suggested maybe we will the girl cried hugging him again did she mean it the sixteenyearold wondered or was she just being nice from the bathroom where annunziata was draining and scrubbing the tub their voices were audible but indistinct what surprised nunzi was that dominic was talking the boy rarely spoke his voice was still changingit was getting lower but from the moment annunziata had heard rosie say maybe we willwell dominic began to talk and talk and the girls interjections grew fainter but lengthier what they said was indecipherable but they were whispering as breathlessly as lovers as she went on compulsively cleaning the bathtub annunziata no longer wondered if the miscarriage had been a blessing or a curse the miscarriage was no longer the point it was rosie calogero herselfwas she a blessing or a curse what had nunzi been thinking shed opened her house to a pretty intelligent and clearly emotional young womanone whod been rejected by her lover and banished from home by her familywithout realizing what an irresistible temptation the twentythreeyearold would be for a lonely boy coming of age annunziata got off her knees in the bathroom and went down the hall to the kitchen noting that the door to her sons bedroom was partially open and the whispering went on and on in the kitchen nunzi took a pinch of salt and threw it over her shoulder she resisted the impulse to intrude on the two of them butfirst stepping back into the hallshe raised her voice my goodness rosie you must forgive me annunziata announced i never even asked you if you wanted to go back to boston nunzi had tried to make this not appear to be her idea shed attempted a neutral or indifferent tone as if she were speaking strictly out of consideration for what rosie herself wanted to do but the murmuring from dominics bedroom was broken by a sudden shared intake of breath rosie felt the boy gasp against her chest the second she was aware of her own gasp it was as if they had rehearsed the answer so perfectly in unison was their response no annunziata heard her son and rosie cry they were a chorus definitely not a blessing nunzi was thinking when she heard rosie say i want to stay here with you and dominic i want to teach at the school i dont ever want to go back to boston i cant blame her for that annunziata realized she knew the feeling i want rosie to stay nunzi heard her son call out well of course you do annunziata thought but what would the repercussions of the difference in their ages be and what would happen if and when the country went to war and all the young men went but not her beloved kiss of the wolfnot with a limp like that nunzi knew rosie calogero kept her job and did it well the young cook also kept his job and did it wellwell enough that the breakfast place started serving lunch too in a short time dominic baciagalupo became a much better cook than his mom and whatever the young cook made for lunch he brought the best of it home for dinner he fed his mother and his notreallyacousin very well on occasion mother and son would still cook together but on most culinary matters annunziata yielded to dominic he made meat loaf with worcestershire sauce and provolone and served it warm with his multipurpose marinara sauceor cold with applesauce he did breaded chicken cutlets alla parmigiana in boston his mother had told him shed made veal parmesan but in berlin he couldnt get good veal he substituted pork for vealit was almost as good dominic made eggplant parmesan toothe sizable contingent of french canadians in berlin knew what aubergine was and dom did a leg of lamb with lemon and garlic and olive oil the olive oil came from a shop nunzi knew in boston and dominic used it to rub roast chicken or baste turkey both of which he stuffed with cornbread and sausage and sage he did steaks under the broiler or he grilled the steaks which he served with white beans or roasted potatoes but he didnt much care for potatoes and he loathed rice he served most of his main dishes with pasta which he did very simplywith olive oil and garlic and sometimes with peas or asparagus he cooked carrots in olive oil with black sicilian olives and more garlic and although he detested baked beans dominic would serve them there were lumbermen and mill workers mostly oldtimers whod lost their teeth who ate little else the baked beans and pea soup crowd nunzi called them disparagingly occasionally annunziata could get fennel which she and dom cooked in a sweet tomato sauce with sardines the sardines came in cans from another shop nunzi knew in boston and mother and son mashed them to a paste in garlic and olive oil and served them with pasta topped with bread crumbs and browned in the oven dominic made his own pizza dough he served meatless pizzas every friday nightin lieu of fish which neither the young cook nor his mom trusted was fresh enough in the north country shrimp frozen in chunks of ice the size of cinder blocks arrived unthawed in trains from the coast hence dominic trusted the shrimp and the pizzas made more use of his beloved marinara sauce the ricotta romano parmesan and provolone cheese all came from boston as did the black sicilian olives the cook who was still learning his craft chopped a lot of parsley and put it on everythingeven on the ubiquitous pea soup parsley was pure chlorophyll his mother had told him it offset garlic and freshened your breath dominic kept his desserts simple andto nunzis vexationthere was nothing remotely sicilian about them apple pie and blueberry cobbler or johnnycake in coos county you could always get apples and blueberries and dominic was good with dough his breakfasts were even more basiceggs and bacon pancakes and french toast corn muffins and blueberry muffins and scones in those days he would make banana bread only when the bananas had turned brown it was wasteful to use good bananas his mother had told him there was a turkey farm in the androscoggin valley roughly between berlin and milan and the cook made turkey hash with peppers and onionsand a minimal amount of potatoes corned beef isnt fit for hashit must be irish annunziata had lectured to him that alcoholic asshole uncle umberto who would drink himself to death before the war was over never ate a meal cooked by his notreallyanephew the veteran lumberman could scarcely tolerate being a foreman to the everincreasing numbers of female mill workers and the women refused to tolerate umberto at all which only served to exacerbate the troubled foremans drinking minor character or not umberto would haunt dominics memory where the notreallyanuncle played a major role how had dominics father been umbertos friend and did umberto dislike nunzi because she wouldnt sleep with him given his mothers banishment from boston and her situation in berlin dominic would often torture himself with the thought that umberto had wrongly imagined nunzi might be rather easily seduced and one winter month some years ahead of asshole umbertos demise annunziata saetta caught the same flu all the schoolchildren had nunzi died before the united states had officially entered the war what were rosie calogero and young dom to do they were twentyfour and seventeen respectively they couldnt very well live together in the same house not after dominics mother died nor could they tolerate living aparthence the notquitecousins had a quandary on their hands not even nunzi could tell them what to do not anymore the young woman and noticeably younger man only did what they thought poor annunziata would have wanted and maybe she would have young dom simply lied about his age he and his notreallya cousin rosie calogero were married in mud season just before the first big log drives of that year on the androscoggin north of berlin they were a successful if not prosperous young cook and a successful though not prosperous schoolteacher at least their work wasnt transient and what need did they have to be prosperous they were both in their different ways young and in love and they wanted only one childjust oneand in march they would have him young dan was born in berlin just before mud season as his father always put it mud season being more definitive than the calendarand almost immediately upon his birth the boys hardworking parents moved away from the mill town to the cooks sensibilities the stench of the paper mill was a constant insult it seemed plausible to believe that one day the war would be over and when it was berlin would grow biggerbeyond all recognition except for the smell but in the town was already too big and too fetidand too full of mixed memoriesfor dominic baciagalupo and rosies prior experience in the north end had made her wary of moving back to boston although both the saetta and calogero families entreated the young cousins to come home children know when they are not loved unconditionally dominic was aware that his mother had felt she was spurned and while rosie never appeared to resent the circumstances that had compelled her to marry a mere boy she truly resented how her family had banished her to berlin in the first place the entreaties by the saetta and calogero families fell on deaf ears who were they to say all was forgiven apparently it was okay with them that the cousins were married and that they had a child but what dominic and rosie remembered was how it had not been okay for either a saetta or a calogero to be pregnant and unmarried let them find someone else to forgive was how rosie put it dominic knowing how nunzi had felt agreed boston was a bridge that had been burned behind them more to the point the young couple felt confident that they hadnt burned it surely moral condemnation wasnt new to new england not in and while most people might have chosen boston over twisted river the decisions made by many young married couples are circumstantial to the newly formed baciagalupo family twisted river may have seemed remote and rawlooking but there was no paper mill the sawmill and loggingcamp settlement had never kept a cook through a single mud season and there was no schoolnot in a town largely inhabited by itinerants there was however the potential for a school in the smaller but more permanentseeming settlement on phillips brooknamely paris formerly west dummer which was only a few miles on the loghauler road from the visibly scruffier settlement in twisted river where the logging company had heretofore refused to invest in a permanent cookhouse according to the company the portable makeshift kitchen and the dining wanigans would have to do that this made twisted river look more like a logging camp than an actual town failed to discourage dominic and rosie baciagalupo to whom twisted river beckoned as an opportunityalbeit a rough one in the summer of leaving themselves enough time to order textbooks and other supplies in preparation for the new paris schoolthe cook and the schoolteacher together with their infant son followed the androscoggin north to milan and then traveled northnorthwest on the haul road from the pontook reservoir where twisted river poured into the pontook was simply called the narrows there wasnt even a sawmill and the rudimentary dead woman dam was as yet unnamed as ketchum would say things were a lot less fancy then the couple with their child arrived at the basin below twisted river before nightfall and the mosquitoes to those few who remembered the young familys arrival the man with the limp and his pretty but olderlooking wife with her new baby must have appeared hopefulalthough they carried only a few clothes with them their books and the rest of their clothes together with the cooks kitchenware had come ahead of themall of it on an empty logging truck covered with a tarp the kitchen and dining wanigans needed more than a good cleaning a fullscale restoration was what the wanigans wantedand what the cook would insist on having if he was going to stay and if the logging company expected the cook to remain past the next mud season they would have to build a permanent cookhousewith bedrooms above the cookhouse where the cook and his family intended to live rosie was more modest in her demands a oneroom school would be sufficient for paris née west dummer where there had never been a school before there were only a few families with schoolage children on phillips brook in and fewer still in twisted river there would soon be moreafter the war when the men came homebut rosie baciagalupo née calogero wouldnt get to see the men return from war nor would she ever educate their children the young schoolteacher died in the late winter of shortly after her son dan had turned two the boy had no memory of his mother whom he knew only by the photographs his father had keptand by the passages shed underlined in her many books which his dad had saved too as in the case of dominic baciagalupos mother rosie had liked to read novels to judge dominic by his apparent pessimismthere was an air of aloofness about his conduct or a noticeable detachment in his demeanor and even something melancholic in his bearingyou might conclude that he had never recovered from the tragic death of his twentysevenyearold wife yet in addition to his beloved son dominic baciagalupo had got one thing that hed wanted the cookhouse had been built to his specifications apparently there was a paris manufacturing company connection some bigwigs wife passing through berlin had raved about dominics cooking the word had gotten around the food was way better than standard loggingcamp fare it wouldnt have been right for dominic to just pack up and leave but the cook and his son had stayed for ten years of course there was an old logger or twochief among them ketchumwho knew the miserable reason the cook who was a widower at twenty blamed himself for his wifes deathand he wasnt the only man who made living in twisted river resemble a mercilessly extended act of penance one had only to think of ketchum in dominic baciagalupo was only thirtyyoung to have a twelveyearold sonbut dominic had the look of a man long resigned to his fate he was so unflinchingly calm that he radiated a kind of acceptance that could easily be mistaken for pessimism there was nothing pessimistic about the good care he took of his boy daniel and it was only for the sake of his son that the cook ever complained about the harshness or the limitations of life in twisted river the town still didnt have a school for example as for the school the paris manufacturing company had built on phillips brook thered been no discernible improvements on the quality of education rosie baciagalupo had provided granted the oneroom schoolhouse had been rebuilt since the forties but the schools thuggish culture was dominated by the older boys whod been held back a grade or two there was no controlling themthe longsuffering schoolteacher was no rosie baciagalupo the paris schools thugs were inclined to bully the cooks sonnot only because danny lived in twisted river and his dad limped they also teased the boy for the proper way in which he invariably spoke young dans enunciation was exact his diction never descended to the dropped consonants and broad vowels of the paris kids and they abused him for it the west dummer kids ketchum unfailingly called them stand your ground danieljust dont get killed his father predictably told him i promise you one day well leave here but whatever its faults and his familys sad story the paris manufacturing company school on phillips brook was the only school the boy had attended even the thought of leaving that school made danny baciagalupo anxious angel was too green to be felling trees in the forest or working on the log brows ketchum said from the folding cot in the kitchen both the cook and his son knew that ketchum talked in his sleep especially when hed been drinking a log brow which was made of log cribwork and built into a bank on the side of a haul road had to be slightly higher than the bed of the logging truck which was pulled up beside it logs brought in from the woods could be stored behind the cribwork until they were ready to be loaded alternatively log skids formed a ramp up to the truck bed then a horse or a tractorpowered jammer a hoist was used to load the logs ketchum wouldnt have wanted angel pope to have anything to do with loading or unloading logs danny baciagalupo had begun his kitchen chores when ketchum spoke again in his drunken stupor he should have been sticking lumber cookie the cook nodded at the stove though he knew perfectly well that ketchum was still asleep without once looking at the veteran riverman stacking boardsor sticking lumber as it was calledwas usually a beginninglaborer position at a sawmill even the cook wouldnt have considered angel too green for that the lumber was stacked by alternating layers of boards with stickers these were narrow slats of wood laid perpendicular to the boards to separate them to allow the air to circulate for drying dominic baciagalupo might have allowed danny to do that progressively increasing mechanization ketchum mumbled if the big man had so much as attempted to roll over on the folding cot he would have fallen off or collapsed the cot but ketchum lay unmoving on his back with his cast held across his chestas if he were about to be buried at sea the unzipped sleeping bag covered him like a flag his left hand touched the floor oh boyhere we go again the cook said smiling at his son progressively increasing mechanization was a sore point with ketchum by rubbertired skidders were already appearing in the woods the larger trees were generally being yarded by tractors the smaller horselogging crews were being paid what was called a piece rate by the cord or thousand board feet to cut and haul timber to an assigned roadside location as rubbertired logging equipment became more common an old horselogger like ketchum knew that the trees were being harvested at a faster rate ketchum was not a fasterrate man danny opened the tricky outer door of the cookhouse kitchen and went outside to pee although his father disapproved of peeing outdoors ketchum had taught young dan to enjoy it it was still dark and the mist from the rushing river was cold and wet on the boys face fuck the donkeyengine men ketchum shouted in his sleep fuck the asshole truck drivers too youre quite right about that the cook said to his sleeping friend the twelveyearold came back inside closing the kitchens outer door ketchum was sitting up on the cot perhaps his own shouting had woken him he was frightening to behold the unnatural blackness of his hair and beard gave him the appearance of someone whod been burned in a terrible fireand now the livid scar on his forehead seemed especially ashen in the whitish light from the fluorescent lamps ketchum was assessing his surroundings in an unfocused but wary way dont forget to fuck constable carl too the cook said to him absolutely ketchum readily agreed that fucking cowboy constable carl had given ketchum the scar the constable routinely broke up fights at the dance hall and in the hostelry bars hed broken up one of ketchums fights by cracking the loggers head with the long barrel of his coltthe kind of showoff weapon only an asshole would have in new hampshire in ketchums opinion hence constable carl was a cowboy yet in danny baciagalupos opinion getting smacked on your forehead with a colt was preferable to constable carl shooting you in the foot or in the kneea method of breaking up fights that the cowboy generally favored with the canadian itinerants this usually meant that the french canadians couldnt work in the woods they had to go back to quebec which was okay with constable carl was i saying something ketchum asked the cook and his son you were positively eloquent on the subject of the donkeyengine men and the truck drivers dominic told his friend fuck them ketchum automatically replied im going northanywhere but here he announced ketchum was still sitting on the cot where he regarded his cast as if it were a newly acquired but utterly useless limb he stared at it with hatred yeah sure dominic said danny was working on the countertop cutting up the peppers and tomatoes for the omelets the boy knew that ketchum talked about going north all the time both the millsfield and the second college grant regions of new hampshire which is now officially known as the great north woods and the aziscohos mountain area southeast of wilsons mills maine were the logging territories that beckoned to ketchum but the veteran river driver and horselogger knew that the aforementioned progressively increasing mechanization would go north too in fact it was already there you should leave here cookieyou know you should ketchum said as the first of the headlights from the kitchen help shone into the cookhouse yeah sure the cook said again like dominic baciagalupo ketchum talked about leaving but he stayed the engine sound of the indian dishwashers truck stood out among the other vehicles constipated christ said ketchum as he finally stood up does jane ever shift out of first gear the cook who had not once looked at ketchum while he was working at the stove looked at him now i didnt hire her for her driving ketchum yeah sure was all ketchum said as injun jane opened the outer door the indian dishwasher and the rest of the kitchen help came inside danny briefly wondered why jane was the only one who seemed to have no trouble dealing with that tricky door ketchum had folded up the cot and the sleeping bag he was putting them away when jane spoke uhohtheres a logger in the kitchen she said thats never a good sign you and your signs ketchum said without looking at her is your husband dead yet or do we have to postpone the celebration i havent married him yet and i have no plans to jane replied as always the indian dishwasher lived with constable carla bone of contention with ketchum and the cook dominic didnt like the cowboy any better than ketchum didnor had jane been with the constable long and speaking of signs she gave some vague indication that she might leave him he beat her the cook and ketchum had more than once remarked on janes black eyes and split lips and even danny had noticed the thumbsize and fingerprintshaped bruises on her upper arms where the constable had evidently grabbed her and shaken her i can take a beating was what jane usually said to ketchum or the cook though it clearly pleased her that they were concerned for her safety but carl should watch out she only occasionally added one day i just might beat him back jane was a big woman and she greeted the twelveyearold as she always did by hugging him against one of her massive hips the boy came up to her breasts which were monumental not even the baggy sweatshirt that she wore in the earlymorning cold could conceal them injun jane had a ton of coalblack hair tooalthough this was unfailingly arranged in one thick braid which hung to her rump even in sweatpants or baggy dungareesher kitchen clothes of choicejane couldnt hide her rump on top of her head with a hole cut out of it for the braid was a cleveland indians baseball capa gift from ketchum one summer sick of the blackflies and the mosquitoes ketchum had tried driving a truck it was a longdistance lumber hauler and hed actually acquired the baseball cap in faroff cleveland danny could only imagine that this must have happened before ketchum had decided that all truck drivers were assholes well jane youre an injunthis is the cap for you ketchum had told her the logo on the cap was the red face of chief wahoo a toothy indian with a crazed grin his head and part of his feather encircled with the letter c the wishboneshaped c was red the cap was blue as for who chief wahoo was neither ketchum nor injun jane knew the twelveyearold had heard the story frequently it was one of janes favorites one of the more memorable times danny saw her take the cleveland indians cap off was when she told the boy how ketchum had given the cap to her ketchum was actually kind of goodlooking when he was younger jane never failed to tell the boy though he was never as goodlooking as your dador as goodlooking as youre going to be the indian dishwasher always added her grinningindian baseball cap was watermarked and stained with cooking oil jane liked to put the chief wahoo cap on the twelveyearolds head where it rested low on his forehead just above the boys eyes he could feel his hair sticking out of the hole in the back of the cap danny had never seen injun janes hair unbraided although shed been his babysitter many times especially when he was youngertoo young at the time to accompany his dad on the river drives which meant that the boy was too young to get a decent nights sleep in the kitchen wanigan jane had regularly put young dan to bed in his room above the cookhouse kitchen danny had assumed that she must have slept in his dads bedroom on those nights when his father was away the next morning when jane made the boy breakfast there was no evidence that her long black braid had ever been undonethough it was hard to imagine that sleeping with a braid of hair that long and thick could be very comfortable for all danny knew jane might have slept in the cleveland indians baseball cap too the crazily grinning chief wahoo was a demonic everwatchful presence ill leave you ladies to your chores ketchum was saying lord knows i wouldnt want to be in the way lord knows one of the kitchen helpers said she was one of the sawmill workers wivesmost of the kitchen helpers were they were all married and fat only injun jane was fatter and she wasnt married to constable carl the constable was fat too the cowboy was as big as ketchumalthough ketchum wasnt fatand carl was mean danny had the impression that everyone despised the cowboy but constable carl always ran for office unopposed quite possibly no one else in twisted river had the slightest desire to be constable the job chiefly entailed breaking up fights and finding ways to send the french canadian itinerants back to quebec constable carls waynamely shooting them in the feet or in their kneeswas mean but it worked yet who wanted to split open peoples heads with a gun barrel or shoot people in the feet and knees danny wondered and why would injun jane whom the boy adored want to live with a cowboy like that living here can be compromising daniel the boys father often said women have to lose their looks before theyll live with constable carl ketchum had tried to explain to young dan but when the women lose too much of their looks carl finds someone else all the kitchen help certainly each and every one of those sawmill workers wives had lost their looksin danny baciagalupos estimation if injun jane was fatter than all of them she still had a pretty face and amazing hair and she had such sensational breasts that the cooks son couldnt bear to think about them which meant of course that he couldnt keep his thoughts from drifting to janes breasts at unexpected times is it their breasts that men like about women danny had asked his father ask ketchum the cook had replied but danny thought that ketchum was too old to take an interest in breastsketchum seemed too old to even notice breasts anymore granted ketchum had lived hard hed been roughed up and looked older than he was ketchum was only thirtysevenhe just looked a lot older except for how black his hair and beard were and janehow old was she danny wondered injun jane was twelve years older than dannys dadshe was fortytwobut she looked older too shed been roughed up as well and not only by constable carl to the twelveyearold everyone seemed oldor older than they were even the boys in dannys grade at school were older ill bet you had a great nights sleep jane was saying to the cook she smiled at danny when she reached behind herself to tie the apron strings around her thick waist her breasts were gigantic the boy was thinking did you get any sleep danny the indian dishwasher asked him sure i got enough the boy answered he wished his dad and the sawmill workers wives werent there because he wanted to ask jane about his mother his dad could talk to him about ketchum retrieving her battered body from the spillway maybe that was because ketchum had prevented the cook from seeing what the river and the logs had done to her but dannys father could never talk about the accident itselfat least not to his son and not with anything approximating specific details ketchum could barely bring himself to say more we were all drunk danny ketchum always began your dad was drunk i was drunkyour mom was a little drunk too i was the drunkest dominic would assert without fail there was such blame attached to his drunkenness that the cook had stopped drinking though not immediately maybe i was drunker than you cookie ketchum sometimes said after all i let her go out on the ice that was my fault the cook usually insisted i was so drunk that you had to carry me ketchum dont think i dont remember ketchum would say but neither man could or would say exactly what had happened danny doubted that the details had eluded them it was more a matter of the details being unutterable or that it was unthinkable for either man to divulge such details to a child injun jane who had not been drinkingshe never dranktold the twelveyearold the story as many times as the boy had asked her shed told him the same story every time thats how he knew it was probably true jane had been dannys babysitter that night danny would have been two on a saturday night there was dancing in the dance hallthere was both actual dancing and square dancing then dominic baciagalupo didnt dance with a limp like his he couldnt but his somewhat older wifeketchum called her cousin rosieloved to dance and the cook loved to watch her dance too rosie was pretty and small both thin and delicatein a way that most of the women her age in twisted river and paris new hampshire were not your mom didnt have the body of someone pushing thirtynot someone from around here anyway as injun jane put it whenever she told the story to young dan apparently ketchum was either too old or already too bangedup for the war although constable carl had fairly recently split open ketchums forehead ketchum had already had a host of other injuries and maimingsenough to make him ineligible for military service but not of sufficient severity to stop him from dancing your mother taught ketchum to read and dance the cook had told his sonin a curiously neutralsounding way as if dominic either had no opinion or didnt know which of these acquired skills was the more remarkable or important for ketchum to have learned in fact ketchum was rosie baciagalupos only dance partner he looked after her as if she were his daughter and out on the dance floor the cooks wife was so small beside ketchum that she almost could have passed for his child except for the noteworthy coincidence as danny had heard injun jane say that the boys mom and ketchum were both twentyseven years old ketchum and your dad liked to drink together jane told young dan i dont know what it is that men like about drinking together but ketchum and your dad liked it a little too much perhaps the drinking had allowed them to say things to each other danny thought since dominic baciagalupo had become a teetotalerthough ketchum still drank like a riverman in his early twentiesmaybe the men had more guarded conversations even the twelveyearold knew there was a lot they left unsaid according to ketchum injuns couldnt or shouldnt drink at allhe took it as simple common sense that injun jane didnt drink yet she lived with constable carl who was a mean drunk after the dance hall and the hostelry bars had closed the constable drank himself into a belligerent temper it was often late when jane drove herself homewhen shed finished with washing the towels and had put them in the dryers in the laundry room and could only then drive home from the cookhouse late or not constable carl was occasionally awake and warlike when jane was ready to go to bed after all she got up early and the cowboy didnt ill draw you a picture injun jane would say to young dan sometimes apropos of nothing your father couldnt drink as much as ketchum but he would try to keep up your mother was more sensible but she drank too much too my dad cant drink as much as ketchum because hes smaller danny always asked jane weight has something to do with it yes the dishwasher generally replied it wasnt the first night that ketchum carried your dad back to the cookhouse from the dance hall your mom was still dancing around them doing her pretty little dosidos did young dan ever detect a degree of envy or sarcasm in the way injun jane referred to cousin rosies pretty little dosidos danny knew that a dosido was a squaredance figure hed asked ketchum to show him but ketchum had shaken his head and burst into tears jane had demonstrated a dosido for danny with her arms folded on her enormous bosom she passed by his right shoulder circling him backtoback the boy tried to imagine his mother dosidoing ketchum as the big man carried his dad was ketchum dancing too danny asked i suppose so jane replied i wasnt with them until later i was with you remember at the frozen river basin rosie baciagalupo stopped dosidoing ketchum and called across the ice to the mountainside when twisted river was frozen there was more of an echo the ice brought your voice back to you quicker and truer than if it had traveled over the open water i wonder why that is danny usually said to jane i heard them from the cookhouse injun jane went on never offering any speculation on the echo your mom called i love you your dad over ketchums shoulder called back i love you too ketchum just yelled shit and other such things then he yelled assholes pretty soon all three of them were yelling assholes i thought the yelling would wake you up although nothing woke you up at nightnot even when you were two my mom went out on the ice first danny always asked dosidos on the ice were hard to do jane answered ketchum went out on the ice to dosido with her he was still carrying your dad it was black ice there was snow in the woods but not on the river basin the basin was windblown and thered been no new snow for almost a week jane usually added most years the ice didnt break up in the river basin this way the drunken cook couldnt stand but he wanted to slide around on the ice too he made ketchum put him down then dominic fell downhe just sat down on the seat of his pants and ketchum pushed him like a human sled dannys mom dosidoed the two of them if they hadnt been yelling assholes so loudly one of them might have heard the logs in those days the horseloggers dumped as many logs as they could on the river ice between little dummer pond and the basin in twisted riverand on the tributary streams upriver too sometimes the weight of the logs broke through the ice on dummer pond first it was the bigger of the dummer ponds held back by a sluice dam that didnt always hold one way or another the ice upstream of the town of twisted river always broke up first and in the late winter of the logs shot down the rapids from little dummer pond the ice breaking ahead of the logsboth the broken slabs of ice and all the logs coming into the river basin in an unimpeded torrent in the late winter or early spring this invariably happened it just usually happened in the daytime because the daytime weather was warmer in the avalanche of logs came into the river basin at night ketchum was pushing dominic across the ice on the seat of his pants the cooks pretty somewhat older wife was dancing around them was the phrase somewhat older a part of injun janes account of that night danny baciagalupo wouldnt remember although he knew for a fact that jane never failed to interjectat the moment the logs rushed into the river basinthe aforementioned noteworthy coincidence that ketchum and cousin rosie were the same age injun jane had opened the door from the cookhouse kitchen she was going to tell them to stop yelling assholes or they would wake up little danny jane was high enough above the river basin to hear the rushing water and the logs all winter long the sound of the river was muffled under the ice and snow not that saturday night jane closed the kitchen door and ran down the hill no one was yelling assholes now the first of the logs skidded onto the ice in the river basin the logs were wet and they seemed to pick up speed when they hit the ice some of the logs were driven deep into the basin under the ice when they rose the bigger logs broke through the ice from underwater like torpedoes injun jane always said by the time jane reached the river basin the sheer weight of the logs was breaking up the ice when the ice first broke some of the slabs were as big as cars ketchum had left the cook in a sitting position when he first saw rosie disappear one second she was dosidoing in the next second she had slipped out of sight behind a slab of ice the size of a wall then the logs completely covered where shed been ketchum picked his way back across the chunks of ice and bobbing logs to where the cook had fallen on one side dominic baciagalupo was drifting downstream on a pulpitsize slab of ice shes gone cookiegone ketchum was calling the cook sat up surprised to see a log rise out of the basin and come crashing down beside him rosie dominic asked if he had yelled i love you too there would have been no discernible echo nownot with the noisy music the logs and broken ice were making ketchum put the cook over his shoulder and tiptoed from log to log ashore sometimes he stepped on an ice floe instead of a log and his sinking leg would get wet above his knee assholes injun jane was yelling from the riverbankto both of them or all three of them assholes assholes she cried and cried the cook was wet and cold and shivering and his teeth were chattering but ketchum and jane could understand him well enough she cant be gone ketchumshe cant just disappear like that but she was gone that fast danny the dishwasher told the boy faster than the moon can slide behind a cloudyour mom was gone like that and when we got back to the cookhouse you were wide awake and screamingit was worse than any nightmare i ever saw you have i took it as a sign that you somehow knew your mom was gone i couldnt get you to stop cryingyou or your father ketchum had got hold of a cleaver he just stood in the kitchen with his left hand on a cutting board holding the cleaver in his right hand dont i told him but he kept staring at his left hand on the cutting boardimagining it gone i guess i left him in order to look after you and your dad when i came back to the kitchen ketchum was gone i looked everywhere for his left hand i was sure i was going to find his hand somewhere i didnt want you or your father finding it but he didnt cut his hand off danny always interrupted her well nohe didnt jane told the boy with some impatience youve noticed that ketchum still has a left hand havent you sometimes especially when ketchum was drunk danny had seen the way the logger looked at his left hand it was the way hed stared at his cast last night if injun jane had seen ketchum staring at his cast she might have taken this as a sign that ketchum still thought about cutting off his hand but why the left one danny baciagalupo would wonder ketchum was righthanded if you hated yourself if you were really taking yourself to task or holding yourself accountable wouldnt you want to cut off your good hand they were bustling about the kitchenall the fat women and the lean cook with his leaner son you didnt pass behind someone without saying behind you or putting your hand on the persons back when the sawmill workers wives passed behind danny they often patted the boy on his bum one or two of them would pat the cook on his bum too but not if injun jane was watching danny had noticed how jane often placed herself between his father and the kitchen helpersespecially in the narrow gauntlet between the stove and the countertop which got narrower whenever the oven doors needed to be opened there were other tight quarters in the cookhouse kitchen challenging the cooks and the servers but that passage between the stove and the countertop was the tightest ketchum had gone outside to peea seemingly unbreakable habit from the wanigan dayswhile injun jane went into the dining room to set the tables in those good old days in the portable logging camps ketchum liked to wake up the rivermen and the other loggers by pissing on the metal siding of the sleeping wanigans theres a wanigan in the river he was fond of hollering oh sweet jesusits floating away a cacophony of swearing followed from inside the portables ketchum also liked to beat on the metal siding of the sleeping wanigans with one of the river drivers pike poles dont let the bear in he would holler oh lordits got one of the women oh lorddear god no danny was ladling the warm maple syrup from the big saucepan on the back burner into the pitchers one of the sawmill workers wives was breathing down the back of the boys neck behind you cutie the woman said hoarsely his dad was dipping the banana bread in the egg mixture one of the kitchen helpers was putting the bananabread french toast on the griddle while another kept turning the lamb hash with a spatula before he went outside for an apparently neverending piss ketchum had spoken to the twelveyearold nine oclock sunday morningdont let your dad forget danny well be there the boy had said what plans are you making with ketchum injun jane whispered in the twelveyearolds ear big as she was the boy hadnt noticed her behind him he first mistook her for the sawmill workers wife whod been breathing down his neck but jane had returned from the dining room dad and i are meeting ketchum at dead woman dam on sunday morning danny told her jane shook her head her long braid longer than a horses tail swishing above her big rump so ketchum talked him into it she said disapprovingly the boy couldnt see her eyes above the pulleddown visor of her cleveland indians cap as always chief wahoo was grinning insanely at the twelveyearold the nearperfect choreography in the kitchen would have been imperceptible to a stranger but danny and the indian dishwasher were used to it they saw that everything was always the same right down to the cook holding the hot tray of scones with the oven mitts while the sawmill workers wives deftly got out of his wayone of them knocking the corn muffins out of the muffin tins into a big china bowl as she did so no one bumped into anyone big as they all weresave danny and his dad who were in the present company noticeably small in the cramped aisle between the countertop and the stove where there was a pan or a pot on six of the eight burners the cook and the indian dishwasher passed backtoback this wasnt newit happened all the timebut danny caught a nuance in their dance and he overheard as he previously hadnt the brief but distinct dialogue between them as they passed backtoback jane deliberately bumped dominicshe just touched her big rump to the middle of his back because the top of the cooks head came up only to janes shoulders dosido your partner the dishwasher said despite his limp the cook caught his balance not one scone slid off the hot tray dosido dominic baciagalupo softly said injun jane had already passed behind him no one but danny had noticed the contact though if ketchum had been theredrunk or soberketchum surely would have noticed but ketchum of course was outsidepresumably still pissing chapter a world of accidents angel pope had gone under the logs on thursday after breakfast on friday injun jane drove danny in her truck to the paris manufacturing company school on phillips brook and then drove back to the cookhouse in twisted river the riverdriving crew would be prodding logs on a site just upstream of dead woman dam the cook and his kitchen helpers would prepare four midday meals they would backpack two meals to the rivermen and drive two meals to the loggers loading the trucks along the haul road between the town of twisted river and the pontook reservoir fridays were hard enough without the woe of losing angel everyone was in too much of a hurry for the weekend to start although weekends in twisted river in the cooks opinion amounted to little more than drinking too much and the usual sexual misstepsnot to mention the subsequent embarrassment or shame as danny baciagalupo had heard his dad say repeatedly and from dominics point of view the fridaynight meal in the cookhouse was the weeks most demanding for the practicing catholics among the french canadians the cook made his renowned meatless pizzas but for the nonmackerelsnappersas ketchum was fond of describing himself and most of the loggers and sawmill workersa meatless pizza on a friday night wouldnt suffice when injun jane dropped danny at the paris school she punched him lightly on his upper arm it was where the older boys at school would hit him if he was lucky naturally the older boys hit him harder than jane didwhether they hit him on the upper arm or somewhere else keep your chin down your shoulders relaxed your elbows in and your hands up around your face jane told him you want to look like youre going to throw a punchthen you kick the bastard in the balls i know the twelveyearold told her he had never thrown a punch at anyonenor had he ever kicked someone in the balls janes instructions to the boy bewildered him he thought that her directions must have been based on some advice constable carl had given her but jane only had to worry about the constable hitting her young dan believed that nobody else would have dared to confront hermaybe not even ketchum while jane would kiss danny goodbye at the cookhouse or virtually anywhere in twisted river she never kissed him when she dropped him at the paris manufacturing company school or when she picked him up in the vicinity of phillips brook where those west dummer kids might be hanging out if the older boys saw injun jane kiss danny they would give him more trouble than usual on this particular friday the twelveyearold just sat beside jane in the truck not moving young dan might have momentarily forgotten where they werein which case he was expecting her to kiss himor else hed thought of a question to ask jane about his mother what is it danny the dishwasher said do you dosido my dad the boy asked her jane smiled at him but it was a more measured smile than he was used to seeing on her pretty face that she didnt answer made him anxious dont tell me to ask ketchum the boy blurted out this made injun jane laugh her smile was more natural and more immediately forthcoming as always chief wahoo was madly grinning i was going to say that you should ask your father the dishwasher said dont be anxious she added punching his upper arm againthis time a little harder danny jane said as the twelveyearold was climbing out of the truck cab dont ask ketchum it was a world of accidents the cook was thinking in the kitchen he was cooking up a storm the lamb hash which hed served for breakfast would be good for a midday meal too hed also made a chickpea soup for the catholics and a venison stew with carrots and pearl onions yes there was the infernal pot of baked beans and the omnipresent pea soup with parsley but there was little else that was standard loggingcamp fare one of the sawmill workers wives was cooking some italian sweet sausage on the griddle the cook kept telling her to break up the sausage meat as she cooked itwhereupon another of the sawmill workers wives started singing try beatin your meat with a spatula she sang to the unlikely but overfamiliar tune of vaya con dios the other women joined in the lead singer among the sawmill workers wives was the woman the cook had put in charge of proofing the yeast for the pizza doughhe was keeping an eye on her dominic wanted to mix the pizza dough and start it rising before they drove off on the haul road to deliver the midday meals on a friday night there would be a bunch of pissedoff french canadians if there werent enough meatless pizzas for the mackerelsnappers the cook was making cornbread too he wanted to start the stuffing for the roast chickens he was also serving in the cookhouse friday night he would mix the sausage with the cornbread and some celery and sage adding the eggs and butter when he got back to his kitchen from the river site and wherever they were loading the trucks in a large saucepan in which danny had warmed the maple syrup dominic was boiling the butternut squash he would mash it up and mix it with maple syrup and add the butter when he returned to town on friday night together with the stuffed roast chickens he would serve scalloped potatoes with the whipped squash this was arguably ketchums favorite meal most fridays ketchum ate some of the meatless pizza too dominic was feeling sorry for ketchum the cook didnt know if ketchum truly believed they would find angel in the spillway of the upper dam sunday morning or if ketchum hoped they would never find the boys body all the cook had determined was that he didnt want young daniel to see angels body dominic baciagalupo wasnt sure if he wanted to see angels bodyor ever find the boy either the pot of waterin which the cook had poured a couple of ounces of vinegar for the poached eggswas coming to a boil again for breakfast hed served the lamb hash with poached eggs but when he served the hash as a midday meal he would just have lots of ketchup handy poached eggs didnt travel well when the water and vinegar came to a boil dominic poured it over the cutting boards to sterilize them one of the sawmill workers wives had made about fifty bacon lettuce and tomato sandwiches with the leftover breakfast bacon she was eating one of the sandwiches while she eyed the cooksome mischief was on her mind dominic could tell her name was dot she was far too large to be a dot and shed had so many children that she seemed to be a woman who had abandoned every other capacity shed ever conceivably possessed except her appetite which the cook didnt like to think about at all she had too many appetites dominic imagined the sawmill workers wife with the spatulathe one who needed to be reminded to break up the sausage on the griddleappeared to be in on the mischief because she had her eye on the cook too since the woman eating the blt had her mouth full the one with the spatula spoke first her name was may she was bigger than dot and had been married twice mays children with her second husband were the same age as her grandchildrenthat is the children of her children from her first marriageand this unnatural phenomenon had completely unhinged may and her second husband to the degree that they couldnt recover sufficiently to console each other concerning the sheer strangeness of their lives what dominic found unnatural was mays ceaseless need to lament the fact that she had children the age of her grandchildren why was it such a big deal the cook had wondered just look at her ketchum had said meaning may for her everything is a big fucking deal maybe so the cook considered as may pointed the spatula at him wiggling her hips in a seductive manner she said in a purring voice oh cookie i would leave my miserable life behindif only you would marry me and cook for me too dominic was using the longhandled dish scrubber on the cutting boards which were soaking in boiling water the vinegar in the hot water made his eyes tear youre married already may he said if you married me and we had children youd have kids younger than your grandchildren i dare not guess how that would make you feel may looked genuinely stricken by the idea maybe he shouldnt have raised the dreaded subject the cook was thinking but dot who was still eating the blt spasmodically laughed with her mouth fullwhereupon she commenced to choke the kitchen helpers may among them stood waiting for the cook to do something dominic baciagalupo was no stranger to choking hed seen a lot of loggers and mill workers chokehe knew what to do years ago hed saved one of the dancehall women she was drunk and she was choking on her own vomit but the cook had known how to handle her it was a famous storyketchum had even titled it how cookie saved sixpack pam the woman was as tall and rawboned as ketchum and dominic had needed ketchums help to knock her to her knees and then wrestle her to all fours where the cook could apply a makeshift heimlich maneuver sixpack pam was so named because this was ketchums estimate of the womans nightly quota before she started on the bourbon dr heimlich was born in but his nowfamous maneuver hadnt been introduced in coos county in dominic baciagalupo had been cooking for big eaters for fourteen years countless people had choked in front of him three of them had died the cook had observed that pounding someone on the back didnt always work ketchums original maneuver which entailed holding the chokers upside down and vigorously shaking them had been known to fail too but once ketchum had been forced to improvise and dominic had witnessed the astonishingly successful result a drunken logger had been too pugnacious and too big for ketchum to shake upside down ketchum kept dropping the man who was not only choking to deathhe was trying to kill ketchum too ketchum repeatedly punched the madman in the upper abdomenall uppercuts upon the fourth or fifth uppercut the choker expectorated a large unchewed piece of lamb which he had inadvertently inhaled over the years the cook had modified ketchums improvisational method to suit his own smaller size and less violent nature dominic would slip under the flailing arms of the choker and get behind him or her he would hold the victim around the upper abdomen and apply sudden upward pressure with his locked handsjust under the rib cage this had worked every time in the kitchen when dot began to flail her arms dominic quickly ducked behind her oh my god cookiesave her may cried the childrengrandchildren crisis was momentarily off her mind if not entirely forgotten with his nose in the warm sweaty area at the back of dots neck the cook could barely join his hands together as he reached around her dots breasts were too big and low dominic needed to lift them out of the way to locate where dots rib cage ended and her upper abdomen began but when he held her breasts albeit briefly dot covered his hands with her own and forcefully shoved her butt into his stomach she was laughing hysterically not choking at all crazy may and the rest of the kitchen helpers were laughing with her oh cookiehow did you know thats how i like it dot moaned i always thought that cookie was a doitfrombehind kind of guy may said matteroffactly oh you little dog dot cried grinding against the cook i just love how you always say behind you dominic finally freed his hands from her breasts he lightly pushed himself away from her i guess were not big enough for him dot may said sorrowfully something mean had entered her voice the cook could hear it im going to pay for the childrengrandchildren remark dominic was thinking or maybe were just not injun enough may said the cook didnt so much as look at her the other kitchen helpers even dot had turned away may was defiantly patting the lamb hash flat against the griddle with the spatula dominic reached around her and turned the griddle off he touched his fingers to the small of her back as he passed behind her lets pack up ladies he said almost the same way he usually said it you and may can pack the meals to the rivermen the cook told dot the rest of us will drive till we find the loggers on the haul road he didnt speak to may or look at her so dot and i do all the walkin may asked him you should walk more than you do dominic said still not looking at her walkings good for you well i made the damn bltsi guess i can carry them dot said take the lamb hash with you too the cook told her someone asked if there were any ultracatholic french canadians among the river drivers maybe dot and may should pack some of the chickpea soup to the river site too im not carryin soup on my back may said the mackerelsnappers can pick the bacon out of the blts dot suggested i dont think there are any mackerelsnappers among these rivermen dominic said well take the chickpea soup and the venison stew to the loggers on the haul road if there are any angry catholics among the river drivers tell them to blame me oh ill tell them to blame you all right may told him she kept staring at him but he wouldnt once look at her when they were going their separate ways may said im too big for you to ignore me cookie just be glad im ignoring you may he told her the cook had not expected to see ketchum among the loggers loading the trucks on the haul road even injured ketchum was a better river driver than any of the men on the river site that moron doctor told me not to get the cast wet ketchum explained why would you get the cast wet dominic asked him ive never seen you fall in maybe i saw enough of the river yesterday cookie theres venison stew one of the kitchen helpers was telling the loggers thered been an accident with one of the horses and another accident with the tractorpowered jammer ketchum said that one of the french canadians had lost a finger unloading logs from a log brow too well its friday dominic said as if he expected accidents among fools on a friday theres chickpea soup for those of you who care that its friday the cook announced ketchum noted his old friends impatience whats the matter cookie what happened ketchum asked him dot and may were just fooling around the cook explained he told ketchum what had happenedwhat may had said about injun jane too dont tell metell jane ketchum told him jane will tear may a new asshole if you tell her i know ketchumthats why im not telling her if jane had seen dot holding your hands on her tits she would have already torn dot a new asshole cookie dominic baciagalupo knew that too the world was a precarious place the cook didnt want to know the statistics regarding how many new assholes were being torn every minute in his time ketchum had torn many he would think nothing of tearing a few more theres roast chicken tonight with stuffing and scalloped potatoes dominic told ketchum ketchum looked pained to hear it i have a date the big man said just my luck to miss stuffed chicken a date the cook said with disgust he never thought of ketchums relationshipsmainly with the dancehall womenas dates and lately ketchum had been seeing sixpack pam god only knew how much they could drink together dominic baciagalupo thought having saved her the cook had a soft spot for sixpack but he sensed that she didnt like him much maybe she resented being saved are you still seeing pam dominic asked his harddrinking friend but ketchum didnt want to talk about it you should be concerned that may knows about you and jane cookie dont you think you should be a little worried dominic turned his attention to where the kitchen helpers were and what they were doing they had set up a folding table by the side of the haul road there were propane burners in the wanigan the burners kept the soup and the stew hot there were big bowls and spoons on the folding table the loggers went into the wanigan each with a bowl and a spoon in hand the women served them in the wanigan you dont look worried enough cookie ketchum told him if may knows about jane dot knows if dot knows every woman in your kitchen knows even i know but i dont give a shit about it i know i appreciate it dominic said my point is how long before constable carl knows speaking of assholes ketchum said he rested his heavy cast on the cooks shoulder look at me cookie with his good hand ketchum pointed to his foreheadat the long livid scar my heads harder than yours cookie you dont want the cowboy to know about you and janebelieve me whos your date dominic baciagalupo almost asked his old friend just to change the subject but the cook didnt really want to know who ketchum was screwingespecially if it wasnt sixpack pam most nights increasingly when jane went home it was so late that constable carl had already passed out the cowboy wouldnt wake up until after shed left for work in the morning there was only the occasional troublemostly when jane went home too early but even a dumb drunk like the constable would eventually figure it out or one of the kitchen helpers would say something to her husband the sawmill workers were not necessarily as fond of the cook and injun jane as the rivermen and the other loggers were i get your point the cook said to ketchum shit cookie ketchum said does danny know about you and jane i was going to tell him dominic answered going to ketchum said derisively is that like saying you were going to wear a condom or is that like wearing one i get your point the cook said again nine oclock sunday morning ketchum told him dominic could only guess that it was a date of two nights duration that ketchum was havingmore like a spree or a bender maybe in twisted river if there were nights the cook could have concealed from his son they would have been saturday nights when the whoring around and drinking to excess were endemic to a community staking an improbable claim to permanence in such close proximity to a violent rivernot to mention the people who made a plainly perilous living and looked upon their saturday nights as an indulgence they deserved dominic baciagalupo who was both a teetotaler and a widower not in the habit of whoring around was nonetheless sympathetic to the various selfdestructionsinprogress he would witness on an average saturday night maybe the cook revealed more disapproval for ketchums behavior than he would ever show toward twisted river s other louts and miscreants because ketchum was no fool perhaps the cook had less patience for ketchums foolishness but to a smart twelveyearoldand danny was both observant and smartthere appeared to be more than impatience motivating his fathers everlasting disappointment in ketchum and if injun jane didnt defend ketchum from the cooks condemnation young dan did that saturday night when angel had possibly arrived at dead woman damwhere because people float lower than logs the boys battered body might already have passed under the containment boom in which case the young canadian would be eddying in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction to the right or left of the main dam and the sluice spillwaydanny baciagalupo was helping his dad wipe down the tables after supper had been served in the cookhouse the kitchen help had gone home leaving injun jane to scour the last of the pots and pans while she waited for the washing cycles to end so she could put all the towels and other linens in the dryers whole families came to the cookhouse for saturdaynight supper some of the men were already drunk and fighting with their wives and a few of the women in turn lashed out at their children one of the sawmill men had puked in the washroom and two drunken loggers had shown up late for suppernaturally theyd insisted on being fed the spaghetti and meatballs which the cook made every saturday nightfor the kidswas congealed and growing cold and was so beneath dominic baciagalupos standards that he fixed the men some fresh penne with a little ricotta and the perpetual parsley this is fuckin delicious one of the drunks had declared whats it called cookie the other hammered logger asked prezzémolo dominic said importantly the sheer exoticness of the word washing over the drunken loggers like another round of beer the cook had made them repeat the word until they could say it correctlypretszaymoloh jane was disgusted she knew it was nothing more exotic than the italian word for parsley for two drunks who were born late jane complained you would let ketchum go hungry if it was ketchum danny said to his father youre wicked harsh on ketchum but the two drunks had been given a special supper and sent on their contented way danny and his dad and jane were at the tail end of their saturdaynight chores when the wind from the suddenly kickedopen door to the dining room heralded another late arrival at the cookhouse from the kitchen jane couldnt see the visitor she shouted in the direction of the rushing wind at the diningroom door youre too late supper is over i aint hungry said sixpack pam indeed there was nothing hungerdriven in pams appearance what little flesh she had hung loosely from her big bones and her lean ferallooking face tightlipped and drawn suggested more of a mostlybeer diet than a penchant for overeating yet she was tall and broadshouldered enough to wear ketchums woolflannel shirt without looking lost in it and her lank blond hair which was streaked with gray appeared to be clean but uncared forlike the rest of her she held a flashlight as big as a billy club twisted river was not a welllit town not even the sleeves of ketchums shirt were too long for her so i guess youve killed him and claimed his clothes for your own the cook said watching her warily i aint chokin either cookie pam told him not this time sixpack jane called from the kitchen danny guessed that the ladies must have known each other well enough for jane to have recognized pams voice its kinda late for the hired help to still be here aint it pam asked the cook dominic recognized sixpacks special drunkenness with an envy and nostalgia that surprised himthe big woman could hold her beer and bourbon better than ketchum jane had come out of the kitchen with a pasta pot under her arm the open end of the pot was leveled at pam like the mouth of a cannon young dan in a presexual state of onethird arousal and twothirds premonition remembered ketchums remark about women losing their looks and how the various degrees of lost looks registered with constable carl to the twelveyearold jane hadnt lost her looksnot quite yet her face was still pretty her long braid was striking and more radiant to imagine was all that coalblack hair when she undid the braid there were her stupendous breasts to contemplate too yet seeing sixpack pam unhinged danny in a different but similar way she was as handsome in the category of stronglooking as a man and what was womanly about her came with a rawnesshow she had insouciantly thrown on ketchums shirt without a bra so that her loose breasts swelled the shirtand now her eyes darted from jane to danny and then fixed upon the cook with the venturesome but nervous daring of a young girl i need your help with ketchum cookie pam said dominic was fearful that ketchum had had a heart attack or worse he hoped that sixpack would spare young daniel the gruesome details i can help you with ketchum injun jane told pam i suppose hes passed out somewhereif so i can carry him easier than cookie can hes passed out naked on the toilet and i aint got but one toilet pam said to dominic not looking at jane i hope he was just reading the cook replied ketchum appeared to be making his dogged way through dominic baciagalupos books which were really dominics mothers books and rosies beloved novels for someone whod left school when he was younger than danny ketchum read the books he borrowed with a determination bordering on lunacy he returned the books to the cook with words circled on almost every pagenot underlined passages or even complete sentences but just isolated words danny wondered if his mom had taught ketchum to read that way once young dan had made a list of the words ketchum had circled in his mothers copy of hawthorne s the scarlet letter collectively the words made no sense at all symbolize whippingpost sex malefactresses pang bosom embroidered writhing ignominious matronly tremulous punishment salvation plaintive wailings possessed misbegotten sinless innermost retribution paramour besmirches hideous and these were only the words ketchum had circled in the first four chapters what do you suppose hes thinking danny had asked his dad the cook had held his tongue though it was hard to resist the temptation to reply surely sex and bosom were much on ketchums mind as for malefactresses ketchum had known some sixpack pam among them regarding the paramour dominic baciagalupo was more of an authority than he wanted to bethe hell with what ketchum made of the word and considering whippingpost and writhingnot to mention wailings misbegotten besmirches and hideousthe cook had no desire to investigate ketchums prurient interest in those words the matronly the sinless the innermost and above all symbolize were mild surprises nor would dominic have imagined that ketchum gave much thought to what was embroidered or ignominious or tremulous or plaintive the cook believed that retribution especially the punishment part was as much up his old friends alley as the possessed factor because ketchum surely was possessedto the degree that the salvation ingredient seemed highly unlikely and did ketchum regularly feel a panga pang for whom or what dominic wondered maybe theyre just words young dan had reasoned what do you mean daniel was ketchum trying to improve his vocabulary for an uneducated man he was very well spokenand he kept borrowing books its a list of kind of fancy words most of them danny had speculated yes the cook concurredsex and bosom and perhaps pang excluded all i know is i was readin out loud to him and then he took the fuckin book and went into the bathroom and passed out sixpack was saying hes got himself wedged in a corner but hes still on the toilet she added dominic didnt want to know about the reading out loud his impression of ketchums dancehall women did not include an element of literary interest or curiosity it was the cooks opinion that ketchum rarely spoke to these women or listened to them but dominic had once asked ketchum insincerely what he did for foreplay to the cooks considerable surprise ketchum had answered i ask them to read out loud to me it gets me in the mood or in the mood to take the book to the bathroom and pass out with it dominic now thought dryly nor did the cook imagine that the literacy level among ketchums dancehall women was especially high how did ketchum know which women could read at all and what was the book that had put him out of the mood with sixpack pam quite possibly ketchum simply had needed to go to the bathroom injun jane had gone into the kitchen and now returned with a flashlight so you can find your way back she said to dominic handing him the light ill stay with danny and get him ready for bed can i go with you the boy asked his dad i could help you with ketchum my place aint very suitable for kids danny pam told him that concept begged a response but all the cook said was you stay with jane daniel ill be right back he added more to jane than to his son but the indian dishwasher had already gone back inside the kitchen from the upstairs of the cookhouse where the bedrooms were there was a partial view of the river basin and a better view of the town above the basin however the town was so dark at night that one had little sense of the activities in the various saloons and hostelries from the distant cookhousenor could danny and injun jane hear the music from the dance hall where no one was dancing for a while the boy and the indian dishwasher had watched the two flashlights making their way to town the cooks bobbing light was easily identified by his limpand by his shorter steps for dominic needed to take twice as many steps to keep up with the longer strides of sixpack pam it was their conversation jane might have wished she could hear it was ketchum naked on the toilet danny definitely wanted to see but soon the flashlights were lost in the fog shrouding the river basin and in the dimmer lights of the town hell be back soon the twelveyearold said because he must have sensed that jane hoped so she made no response other than to turn down the bed in his fathers roomshe also turned the nighttable light on danny followed her into the upstairs hall watching her touch the eightinch castiron skillet as she left the bedroom shoulderhigh to his dad the skillet was breasthigh to injun jane it was level with dannys eyes as he passed by it touching it too thinking about whacking a bear jane asked the boy i guess you were thinking about it he told her go brush your teeth and all that other stuff she said the boy went into the bathroom he shared with his father when hed put on his pajamas and was ready for bed jane came into dannys bedroom and sat on his bed beside him ive never seen you undo your braid the boy said i wonder what you look like with your hair down youre too young to see me with my hair down jane told him i wouldnt want it on my conscience that i frightened you to death the boy could see the playfulness in her eyes under the visor of her cleveland indians cap there was a shout from the area of the town and either a corresponding shout or an echo from the nearby river basin but no words were distinguishable in the shouting and any interconnected disputes or followup shouts were whipped away by the wind its dangerous in town on a saturday night isnt it danny asked injun jane i know this little fella with a limpmaybe you know who i meanand hes always saying how its a world of accidents maybe that sounds familiar to you jane said her big hand had sneaked under the covers and found young dans armpit where she knew he was the most ticklish i know who you mean the twelveyearold cried no tickling well the accidents are just more numerous on a saturday night jane continued not tickling him but keeping her hand in his armpit however nobodys going to mess with your dadnot when sixpack is with him theres the cominghomealone part the boy pointed out dont worry about your father danny jane told him she let go of his armpit and straightened up on the bed could you take sixpack danny asked her it was one of daniel baciagalupos favorite questions he was always asking injun jane if she could take someone the equivalent of ketchum tearing an actual or alleged combatant a new asshole could jane take henri thibeault or nofingers la fleur or the beaudette brothers or the beebe twinsor scotty fernald earl dinsmore charlie clough and frank bemis injun jane generally answered i suppose so when danny had asked her if she could take ketchum shed said if he were drunk enough maybe but when the imaginary opponent was sixpack pam jane hesitated danny had not known her to hesitate a whole lot sixpack is a lost soul jane finally said but could you take her young dan insisted jane leaned over the boy as she got up from the bed squeezing his shoulders with her strong hands she kissed him on his forehead i suppose so said injun jane why wasnt sixpack wearing a bra danny asked her she looked like she got dressed in a hurry jane told him she blew him another kiss from the doorway of his bedroom closing the door only halfway behind her the light from the hall was dannys nightlightfor as long as he could remember he heard the wind shake the loosefitting outer door to the kitchen there was a rattling sound as the wind tugged at that bothersome door the twelveyearold knew it wasnt his dad coming home or another night visitor just the wind injun jane called to him from down the hall ever since the bear story she knew the boy had been apprehensive about intruders jane always left her shoes or boots downstairs and came upstairs in her socks if she had gone downstairs danny would have heard the stairs creak under her weight but jane must have stayed upstairs as silent in her socks as a nocturnal animal later young dan heard water running in the bathroom he wondered if his father had come home but the boy was too sleepy to get up and go see danny lay listening to the wind and the omnipresent turmoil of the river when someone kissed him on his forehead again the twelveyearold was too deeply asleep to know if it was his dad or injun janeor else he was dreaming about being kissed and it was sixpack pam who was kissing him striding through townwith the cook limping after her like a loyal but damaged dogpam was too formidable and purposeful a figure to inspire anyone to dream of kissing her or of being kissed by her certainly the cook was dreaming of no such thingnot consciously slow down sixpack dominic said but either the wind carried his words beyond her hearing or pam willfully lengthened her stride the wind tunneled furrows in the threestory tower of sawdust outside the sawmill and the dust blew into their eyes it was very flammable what ketchum called a potential infernoat this time of year especially the winterlong pile wouldnt be trucked out of town until the haul roads hardened up at the end of mud season only then would they truck it away and sell it to the farmers in the androscoggin valley of course there was more inside the mill a fire in the sawdust would ignite the whole town not even the cookhouse on the hill nearest the river bend would be spared because the hill and the cookhouse bore the brunt of the wind off the river the bigger more brightly burning embers would be blown uphill from the town to the cookhouse yet the building the cook had insisted upon was the most substantial in the settlement of twisted river the hostelries and saloonseven the sawmill itself and the socalled dance hallwere mere kindling for the sawdust fire ketchum imagined in his doomsayer dreams of everimpending calamities possibly ketchum was even dreaming nowon the toilet or so dominic baciagalupo considered as he struggled to keep pace with sixpack pam they passed the bar near the hostelry favored by the french canadian itinerants in the muddy lane alongside the dance hall was a lombard steam log hauler it had been parked there so long that the dance hall had been torn down and rebuilt around it theyd used gasolinepowered log haulers to pull the loaded sleds of logs through the woods since the s if the town burned dominic was thinking maybe the old lombard forwarder would be the only surviving remains to the cooks surprise when he regarded the lombard now he saw the beaudette brothers asleep or dead in the front seat over the sled runners perhaps theyd been evicted from the dance hall and had passed out or been deposited there dominic slowed as he limped by the slumpedover brothers but pam had seen them too and she wasnt stopping they wont freezeit aint even snowin sixpack said outside the next saloon four or five men had gathered to watch a desultory fight earl dinsmore and one of the beebe twins had been brawling so long that theyd exhausted their best punches or maybe the men were too inebriated to be fighting in the first place they seemed beyond hurting each otherat least intentionally the other beebe twin out of either boredom or sheer embarrassment for his brother suddenly started fighting with charlie clough in passing sixpack pam knocked charlie down then she leveled earl dinsmore with a forearm to his ear leaving the beebe twins to aimlessly regard each other the recognition slowly dawning on them that there was no one to fightnot unless they dared to take on pam its cookie with sixpack nofingers la fleur observed im surprised you can tell us apart pam told him shoving him out of her way they reached the flatroofed row housesthe newer hostelries where the truckers and donkeyengine men stayed as ketchum said any contractor who would construct a flatroofed twostory building in northern new hampshire was enough of a moron to not know how many assholes a human being had just then the dancehall door blew or was shoved open and the miserable music reached themperry como singing dont let the stars get in your eyes there was an outside flight of stairs to the nearest hostelry and pam turned catching dominic by his shirtsleeve and pulling him after her watch the nexttolast step cookie she told him tugging him up the stairs stairs had never worked well with his limpespecially not at the pace sixpack led him the nexttolast step from the top was missing the cook stumbled forward catching his balance against pams broad back she simply turned again and lifted him under both armshoisting him to the topmost step where the bridge of his nose collided with her collarbone there was a womanly smell at her throat if not exactly perfume but the cook was confused by whatever odors of maleness clung to ketchums woolflannel shirt the music from the dance hall was louder at the top of the stairspatti page singing how much is that doggie in the window no wonder no one dances anymore dominic baciagalupo was thinking just as sixpack lowered her shoulder and forced open the door shit i hate this song she was saying dragging the cook inside ketchum she shouted but there was no answer thankfully the awful music stopped when pam closed the door the cook couldnt comprehend where the kitchen which they had entered ended and the bedroom began scattered pots and pans and bottles gave way to strewn undergarments and the giant unmade bed the only light on which was cast by a greenish aquarium who knew that sixpack pam was a fish person or that she liked pets of any species if fish were what was in the aquariumdominic couldnt see anything swimming around in the algae maybe sixpack was an algae person they navigated the bedroom it was hard even without a limp to get around the enormous bed and while it was easy for dominic to imagine the extreme situation and awkward location of ketchums collapse and why this might have made it necessary for pam to hastily dress herself without a bra they passed three bras en route to the bathroomany one of which even in a hurry surely would have been opportune sixpack now scratched her breast under ketchums woolflannel shirt dominic wasnt immediately worried that she was fondling herself suggestively or otherwise flirting with him it was as unplanned a gesture as her knocking charlie clough to the muddy ground or the spontaneous forearm to the ear that had dropped earl dinsmore the cook knew that if sixpack were to suggest anything she would be far less ambiguous about it than to merely touch her breast in passing besides ketchums woolflannel shirt must have been itchy against her bare skin they found ketchum on the toilet more or less as pam must have discovered himwith the paperback hed been reading pinned by his cast and held open on one of his bare thighs and with both knees splayed wide apart the water in the toilet was laced with bright bloodred streaksas if ketchum had been slowly bleeding to death hes gotta be bleedin internally sixpack exclaimed but the cook realized that ketchum had dropped a pen with red ink into the toilet he must have been using the pen to circle certain words i already flushed before leavin him pam was saying as dominic rolled up his sleeve and reaching between ketchums knees picked the pen out of the toilet bowlflushing again dominic washed his hands and the pen in the sink drying them with a towel it was only then that he noticed ketchums erection one of the cooks most fervent hopesnamely to never see ketchum with an erectionmay have caused him to first overlook the obvious naturally sixpack hadnt overlooked it well i wonder what he thinks hes goin to do with that she was saying as she lifted ketchum under his heavy arms she was able to prop him more upright on the toilet seat rescuing him from his wedged position if you take hold of his ankles cookie i can handle the rest the book which nearly followed the pens path into the toilet slid off ketchums thigh to the floor dostoyevskys the idiot was a surprise to dominic baciagalupo who could more easily understand ketchum passing out with the novel on or off a toilet than he could imagine sixpack reading out loud to ketchum from the gigantic greenlylit bed dominic instinctively uttered aloud the books title which was misunderstood by pam youre tellin me hes an idiot she said how were you liking the book the cook asked her as they lugged ketchum out of the bathroom they managed to hit ketchums head on the doorknob as they passed the open door ketchums cast was dragging on the floor its about fuckin russians sixpack said dismissively i wasnt payin much attention to the storyi was just readin it to him the passing blow to his head hadnt awakened ketchum although it seemed to serve as an invitation for him to speak as for those kind of dives where you could get into a shitload of trouble just looking at some supersensitive asshole there was never anything in downtown berlin to equal hells half acre in bangornot in my experience ketchum said his erection as upstanding and worthy of attention as a weather vane what do you know about maine pam asked him as if ketchum were conscious and could understand her i didnt kill pinettethey could never pin it on me ketchum declared that wasnt my stamping hammer theyd found lucky pinette murdered in his bed in the old boom house on the androscogginabout two miles north of milan hed had his head bashed in with a stamping hammer and there were those rivermen who claimed that lucky had had a dispute with ketchum at the sorting gaps on the river earlier in the afternoon ketchum typically was discovered to be spending the night at the umbagog house in errolwith a dimwitted woman who worked in the kitchen there neither the stamping hammer that had repeatedly hit pinette indenting his forehead with the letter h nor ketchums hammer was ever found so who killed lucky sixpack asked ketchum as she and dominic dropped him onto the bed where the river drivers undying erection trembled at them like a flagpole in a galeforce wind ill bet bergeron did it ketchum answered her he had a stamping hammer just like mine and bergeron wasnt bangin some retard from errol pam replied with his eyes still closed ketchum merely smiled the cook resisted the urge to go back into the bathroom and see what words ketchum had circled in the idiotanything to get away from his old friends towering erection are you awake or what dominic asked ketchum who appeared to have passed completely out againor else he was imagining himself as one of the passengers in a thirdclass compartment on the warsawst petersburg train because ketchum had only recently borrowed the idiot and the cook found it unlikely that sixpack had read very far into the first chapter before the passingoutonthetoilet episode had interrupted what ketchum called his chosen foreplay well i guess ill go home dominic said as ketchums finally drooping erection seemed to signify the end of the evenings entertainment perhaps not to pamfacing the cook she began to unbutton her borrowed shirt here comes suggestive dominic baciagalupo was thinking there was no room between the foot of the bed and the bedroom wall where sixpack blocked his way he would have had to walk on the bed stepping over ketchum to get around her come on cookie pam said show me what you got she tossed the woolflannel shirt on the bed where it covered ketchums face but not his fallen erection she was semiretarded ketchum mumbled from under the shirt and she wasnt from errolshe came from dixville notch he must have meant the kitchen worker in the umbagog house the woman hed been banging the night lucky pinette was hammered to death in the old boom house on the androscoggin it could have been just a coincidence that neither ketchums stamping hammer nor the murder weapon was ever found sixpack fiercely took hold of the cooks shoulders and snapped his face between her breastsno ambiguity now it was half a heimlich maneuver that he made on her ducking under her arms to get behind herhis hands locking on her lower rib cage under her pretty breasts with his nose jammed painfully between pams shoulder blades dominic said i cant do this sixpackketchums my friend she easily broke his grip her long hard elbow smacked him in the mouth splitting his lower lip then she headlocked him half smothering him between her armpit and the soft side of her breast you aint no friend of his if you let him find angel hes tearin himself up over that damn kid cookie pam told him if you let him so much as see that boys body or whats left of it you aint no friend of ketchums they were rolling around on the bed beside ketchums covered face and his naked unmoving body the cook couldnt breathe he reached around sixpacks shoulder and punched her in the ear but she lay on him unflinchingly with her weight on his chest she had his head and neck and his right arm locked up tight all the cook could do was hit her again with his awkward left hookhis fist struck her cheekbone her nose her temple and her ear again christ you cant fight worth shit cookie sixpack said with contempt she rolled off him letting him go dominic baciagalupo would remember lying there his chest heaving alongside his snoring friend the ghastly green light from the aquarium washed over the gasping cook in the tanks murky water the unseen fish might have been mocking him pam had picked up a bra and was putting it on with her back to him the least you can do is take danny with you earlier than when youre goin to meet ketchum you two find angels bodybefore ketchum gets there just dont let ketchum see that boy she shouted ketchum pulled the shirt off his face and stared unseeing at the ceiling the cook sat up beside him pam had put the bra on and was angrily struggling into a tshirt dominic would also remember this sixpacks unbelted dungarees low on her broad but bony hips and the unzipped fly through which he caught a glimpse of her blond pubic hair shed dressed herself in a hurry to be sureand she was hurrying now get out cookie she told him he looked once at ketchum who had closed his eyes and covered his face with his cast did ketchum let you see your wife when he found her pam asked the cook dominic baciagalupo would try to forget this parthow he got up from the bed but sixpack wouldnt let him step around her answer me she said to him no ketchum didnt let me see her well ketchum was bein your friend she said letting the cook limp past her to the door in the kitchen area watch that step second from the top she reminded him you ought to ask ketchum to fix that step for you dominic said ketchum removed the stepso he could hear someone comin up the stairs or sneakin down sixpack informed the cook there was no doubt ketchum had to take certain precautions dominic was thinking as he let himself out the door the missing step awaited himhe stepped over it carefully the depressing music from the dance hall hit him on the stairs teresa brewer was singing till i waltz again with you when the wind blew open the door the cook thought he had closed shit he heard pam say either the wind or the dancehall music momentarily revived ketchumenough for the riverman to make a final comment before sixpack slammed the door not so fucking lucky noware you lucky ketchum asked the windy night poor pinette dominic baciagalupo was thinking lucky pinette may already have been past hearing the questionthat is the first time ketchum had asked it if hed really asked it certainly lucky was long past hearing anything now the cook skirted the shabby hostelry bars with their broken interrupted lettering no mino s the neon blinked at him th rd beer fr e another sign blinked after he passed the neon announcements dominic would realize hed forgotten his flashlight he was pretty sure that sixpack wouldnt be friendly if he went back for it the cook tasted the blood from his split lip before he put his hand to his mouth and looked at the blood on his fingers but the available light in twisted river was dim and growing dimmer the dancehall door blew or was slammed closed cutting off teresa brewer as suddenly as if sixpack had taken the singers slender throat in her hands when the dancehall door blew or was kicked open again tony bennett was crooning rags to riches dominic didnt for a moment doubt that the towns eternal violence was partly spawned by irredeemable music out in front of the saloon where the beebe twins had been fighting there was no evidence of a brawl charlie clough and earl dinsmore had managed to pick themselves up from the muddy ground the beaudette brothers either murdered or passed out had roused themselves or been removed from the old lombard forwarder forever occupying the lane alongside the dance hall which it would almost certainly outlive dominic baciagalupo wove his way forward in the darkness where his limp could easily have been mistaken for the tentative progress of a drunk at the bar near the hostelry most frequented by the french canadian itinerants a familiar figure lurched toward dominic out of the dark but before the cook could be certain it was constable carl a flashlight blinded him halt that means stop arrête if youre fuckin french the cowboy said good evening constable dominic said squinting into the light both the flashlight and the windblown sawdust were causing him problems youre out kinda late cookieand youre bleedin the constable said i was checking up on a friend the cook replied whoever hit you wasnt your friend the cowboy said stepping closer i forgot my flashlighti just bumped into something carl like a knee or an elbow maybe constable carl speculated his flashlight was almost touching dominics bloody lower lip the boilermakers on the constables rank breath were as evident as the sawdust stinging the cooks face as luck would have it someone had upped the volume on the music from the dance hall where the virtual revolving door was flung open againdoris day singing secret lovewhile injun janes two lovers stood facetoface the drunken cowboy patiently examining the sober cooks lip injury just then the favorite hostelry of the french canadian itinerants rudely disgorged one of the nights luckless souls young lucien charest yipping like a coyote pup was hurled out naked and landed on all fours in the muddy road the constable swung his flashlight toward the frightened frenchman it was deathly quiet then as the dancehall door slammed shut on doris dayas abruptly as the indiscriminate door had released secret love into the nightand both dominic baciagalupo and lucien charest clearly heard the knucklecracking sound of constable carl cocking his absurd colt jesus carl dont dominic was saying as the constable took aim at the young frenchman get your naked french ass back indoors where you belong the constable shouted before i blow your balls off and your pecker with em on all fours lucien charest peed straight down at the groundthe puddle of piss quickly spreading to his muddy knees the frenchman turned and still on all fours scampered like a dog toward the hostelry where the mischiefmakers whod thrown the young man outside now greeted him at the hostelry door as if his naked life depended on it it probably did cries of lucien were followed by frenchspeaking gibberish too fast and hysterical for either the cook or the constable to comprehend when charest was safely back inside the hostelry constable carl turned off his flashlight the ridiculous colt was still cocked the cook was disconcerted that the cowboy slowly uncocked the weapon while it was pointed at the knee of dominic baciagalupos good leg you want me to walk you home little cookie carl asked im okay dominic answered they could both make out the lights of the cookhouse uphill from the riverbasin end of town i see you got my darlin jane workin late again tonight the constable said before the cook had time to consider a careful reply carl added isnt that boy of yours gettin old enough to put himself to bed daniels old enough dominic answered i just dont like leaving him alone at night and hes wicked fond of jane that makes two of us constable carl said spitting that makes three of us dominic baciagalupo was thinking but the cook said nothing he was also remembering how pam had pressed his face between her breasts and how close she had come to suffocating him he felt ashamed and disloyal to jane because sixpack had also aroused himin a peculiarly lifethreatening way good night constable the cook said he had started uphill before the cowboy shone his flashlight on him briefly illuminating the way ahead good night cookie carl said when the flashlight went out the cook could feel that the constable was still watching him you get around pretty good for a cripple the cowboy called up the dark hill dominic baciagalupo would remember that too just a snatch of the song from the dance hall reached him but dominic was now too far from town to hear the words clearly it was only because hed heard the song so many times that he knew what it waseddie fisher singing oh my papaand long after the cook could no longer hear the stupid song he was irritated to find himself singing it chapter the eightinch castiron skillet the cook couldnt entirely dispel the feeling that the constable had followed him home for a while dominic baciagalupo stood at the window in the darkened dining hall on the lookout for a flashlight coming up the hill from town but if the cowboy were intent on investigating the goingson at the cookhouse not even he would have been dumb enough to use his flashlight dominic left the porch light on by the kitchen door so that jane could see the way to her truck he put his muddy boots beside janes at the foot of the stairs the cook considered that perhaps he had lingered downstairs for another reason how would he explain his lip injury to jane and should he tell her about his meeting with the constable shouldnt jane know that dominic had encountered the cowboy and that both constable carls behavior and his disposition were as unpredictable and unreadable as ever the cook couldnt even say for certain if the constable somehow knew that jane was dominics paramour as ketchum might have put itin reference to the toiletreaders list of words from another illicit love story dominic baciagalupo went quietly upstairs in his socksthough the stairs creaked in a most specific way because of his limp and he could not manage to creep past his open bedroom door without jane sitting up in bed and seeing him he sneaked enough of a look at her to know shed let her hair down dominic had wanted to clean up his wounded lower lip before he saw her but jane must have sensed he was hiding something from her she sailed her cleveland indians cap into the hall nearly hitting him chief wahoo landed upside down but still grinningthe chief appearing to stare crazily down the hall in the direction of the bathroom and young dans bedroom in the bathroom mirror the cook saw that his lower lip probably needed to be stitched the wound would heal eventually without stitches but his lip would heal faster and there would be less of a scar if he had a couple of stitches for now after hed painfully brushed his teeth he poured some hydrogen peroxide on his lower lip and patted it dry with a clean towelnoting the blood on the towel it was just bad luck that tomorrow was sunday he would rather let ketchum or jane stitch up his lip than try to find that moron doctor on a sunday in that place dominic wouldnt even think of by its illfated name the cook came out of the bathroom and continued down the hall to daniels room dominic baciagalupo kissed his sleeping son good night leaving an unnoticed spot of blood on the boys forehead when the cook came out into the hall there was chief wahoo grinning upside down at himas if to remind him that he better watch his words carefully with injun jane who hit you she asked him as he was getting undressed in the bedroom ketchum was wild and unrulyyou know how he can be when hes passed out and talking at the same time if ketchum had hit you cookie you wouldnt be standing here it was just an accident the cook insisted relying on a favorite word ketchum didnt mean to hurt mehe just caught me with his cast by accident if hed hit you with his cast you would be dead jane told him she was sitting up in bed with her hair all around her it hung down below her waist and she had folded her arms over her breasts which were hidden by both her hair and her arms whenever she took her hair down and later went home that way she could get in real trouble with constable carlif he hadnt already passed out it was a night when jane should stay late and leave early in the morning if she went home at all dominic was thinking i saw carl tonight the cook told her it wasnt carl who hit you either jane said as he got into bed beside her and it doesnt look as if he shot you she added i cant tell if he knows about us jane i cant tell either she told him did ketchum kill lucky pinette the cook asked nobody knows cookie we havent known doodleysquat about that for ages why did sixpack hit you jane asked him because i wouldnt fool around with herthats why if you had screwed sixpack i would have hit you so hard you wouldnt ever have found your lower lip jane told him he smiled which the lip didnt like when he winced at the pain jane said poor babyno kissing for you tonight the cook lay down next to her there are other things besides kissing he said to her she pushed him to his back and lay on top of him the sheer weight of her pressing him into the bed and taking his breath away if the cook had closed his eyes he would have seen himself in sixpacks suffocating headlock again so he kept his eyes wide open when injun jane straddled his hips and firmly seated herself in his lap dominic felt a sudden intake of air fill his lungs with an urgency possibly prompted by sixpack having assaulted him jane mounted the cook she wasted no time in slipping him inside her ill show you other things the indian dishwasher said rocking herself back and forth her breasts fell on his chest her mouth brushed his face carefully not touching his lower lip while her long hair cascaded forward forming a tent around the two of them the cook could breathe but he couldnt move janes weight was too great for him to budge her besides dominic baciagalupo wouldnt have wanted to change a single element of the way she was rocking back and forth on top of himor her gathering momentum not even if injun jane had been as light as dominics late wife rosie and the cook himself were as big as ketchum it was a little like riding a train dominic imaginedexcept all he could do was hold tightly to the train that was in reality riding him it didnt matter now that danny was certain hed heard water running in the bathroom or that the kiss on his foreheadeither his fathers kiss or a second goodnight kiss from janehad been real it didnt matter either that the boy had incorporated the kiss into a dream he was having about sixpack pam whod been ardently kissing himnot necessarily on his forehead nor did it matter that the twelveyearold knew the odd creak his dads limp made on the stairs because hed heard the limp a while ago and there was a different unfamiliar creaking now on stairs his father always put his good foot forward the lame foot followed more lightly after it what mattered now was the new and neverending creaking and where the anxious wideawake boy thought the creaking came from it wasnt only the wind that was shaking the whole upstairs of the cookhouse danny had heard and felt the wind in every season the frightened boy quietly got out of bed andholding his breathtiptoed to his partially open bedroom door and into the upstairs hall there was chief wahoo with his lunatic upsidedown grin but what had happened to jane young dan wondered if her hat had ended up in the hall where was her head had the intruder for surely there was a predator on the loose decapitated janeeither with one swipe of its claws or in the case of a human predator with a bush hook as he made his cautious way down the hall danny half expected to see janes severed head in the bathtub as he passed the open bathroom door without spotting her head the twelveyearold could only imagine that the intruder was a bear not a man and that the bear had eaten jane and was now attacking his dad for there was no denying where the violent creaks and moans were coming fromhis fathers bedroomand that was definitely moaning or worse whimpering that the boy could hear as he came closer when he passed the cleveland indians cap the recognition that chief wahoo had landed upside down only heightened the twelveyearolds fears what danny baciagalupo would see more accurately what he thought he saw upon entering his dads bedroom was everything the twelveyearold had feared and worsethat is both bigger and hairier than what the boy had ever imagined a bear could be only his fathers knees and feet were visible beneath the bear more frightening still his dads lower legs werent moving maybe the boy had arrived too late to save him only the bear was movingthe rounded humpbacked beast its head not discernible was rocking the entire bed its glossyblack hair both longer and more luxuriant than danny had ever imagined a black bears hair would be the bear was consuming his father or so it appeared to the twelveyearold with no weapon at hand one might have expected the boy to throw himself on the animal attacking his dad in such a savage or frenzied mannerif only to be hurled into a bedroom wall or raked to death by the beasts claws but family historieschiefly perhaps the stories we are told as childreninvade our most basic instincts and inform our deepest memories especially in an emergency young dan reached for the eightinch castiron skillet as if it were his weapon of choice not his fathers that skillet was a legend and danny knew exactly where it was holding the handle in both hands the boy stepped up to the bed and took aim at where he thought the bears head ought to be hed already started his twohanded swingas ketchum had once shown him with an ax being sure to get his hips behind the swinging motionwhen he noticed the bare soles of two clearly human feet the feet were in a prayerful position just beside his dads bare knees and danny thought that the feet looked a lot like janes the indian dishwasher was on her feet all day andfor such a heavy womanit was only natural that her feet often hurt her she liked nothing better shed told young dan than a foot rub which danny had more than once given her jane danny askedin a small doubting voicebut nothing slowed the forward momentum of the castiron skillet jane must have heard the boy utter her name because she raised her head and turned to face him that was why the skillet caught her fullforce on her right temple the ringing sound a dull but deep gong was followed by a stinging sensation young dan first felt in his hands a reverberant tingle passed through both wrists and up his forearms for the rest of his life or as long as his memory endured it would be small consolation to danny baciagalupo that he didnt see the expression on janes pretty face when the skillet struck her her hair was so long that it simply covered everything janes massive body shuddered she was too massive and her hair was too sleekly beautiful for her ever to have been a black bearnot in this life or the next where she most assuredly was going jane rolled off the cook and crashed to the floor there was no mistaking her for a bear now her hair had fanned outflung wide as wings to both sides of her inert colossal torso her big beautiful breasts had slumped into the hollows of her armpits her motionless arms reached over her head as if even in death jane sought to hold aloft a heavy descending universe but as astonishing as her nakedness must have been to an innocent twelveyearold danny baciagalupo would best remember the faraway gaze in janes wideopen eyes something more than the final splitsecond recognition of her fate lingered in injun janes dead eyes what had she suddenly seen in the immeasurable distance danny would wonder whatever jane had glimpsed of the unforeseeable future had clearly terrified hernot just her fate but all their fates maybe jane danny said again this time it wasnt a question though the boys heart was racing and he must have had many questions on his mind nor did danny more than glance at his dad was it his fathers nakedness that made the boy so quickly look away perhaps it was what ketchum had called the littlefella aspect of the cook the latter aspect was greatly enhanced by how near dominic now was to the dead dishwasher jane danny cried as if the boy needed a third utterance of the indians name to finally register what he had done to her the cook quickly covered her private parts with a pillow he knelt in the vast expanse of her farflung hair putting his ear to her quiet heart young dan held the skillet in both hands as if the reverberation still stung his palms possibly the ongoing tingle in his forearms would last forever though he was only twelve danny baciagalupo surely knew that the rest of his life had just begun i thought she was a bear the boy told his dad dominic could not have looked more shocked if at that moment the dead dishwasher had turned herself into a bear yet the cook could see for himself that it was his beloved daniel who needed some consoling trembling the boy stood clutching the murder weapon as if he believed a real bear would be the next thing to assail them its understandable that you thought jane was a bear his father said hugging him the cook took the skillet from his shaking son hugging him again its not your fault daniel it was an accident its nobodys fault how can it be nobodys fault the twelveyearold asked its my fault then his dad told him it will never be your fault daniel its all mine and it was an accident of course the cook was thinking about constable carl in the constables world there was no such thing as a nofault accident in the cowboys mind if you could call it that good intentions didnt count you cant save yourself but you can save your son dominic baciagalupo was thinking and for how many years might the cook manage to save them both for so long danny had wanted to see jane undo her braid and let down her hairnot to mention how he had dreamed of seeing her enormous breasts now he couldnt look at her i loved jane the boy blurted out of course you did danieli know you did were you dosidoing her the twelveyearold asked yes his father answered i loved jane too just not like i loved your mom he added why was it necessary for him to say that the cook asked himself guiltily dominic had truly loved jane he must have been yielding to the fact that there was no time to grieve for her what happened to your lip the boy asked his dad sixpack smacked me with her elbow the cook answered were you dosidoing sixpack too his son asked him no daniel jane was my girlfriendjust jane what about constable carl young dan asked we have a lot to do daniel was all his dad would tell him and they didnt have a lot of time the cook knew before long it would be light outside they had to get started in the confusion and sheer clumsiness that followed and in their frantic haste the cook and his son would find a multitude of reasons to relive the night of their departure from twisted river though they would remember the details of their forced exit differently for young dan the monumental task of dressing the dead womannot to mention bringing her body down the cookhouse stairs and toting her to her truckhad been herculean nor did the boy at first understand why it was so important to his father that jane be correctly dressedthat is exactly as she would have dressed herself nothing missing nothing awry the straps to her stupendous bra could not be twisted the waistband of her mammoth boxer shorts could not be rolled under her socks could not be worn inside out but shes dead what does it matter danny was thinking the boy wasnt considering the scrutiny that injun janes body might soon come underwhat the examining physician would conclude was the cause of death for example a blow to the head obviously but what was the instrumentand where was it the approximate time of death would need to be factored in too clearly it mattered to the cook that at the time of her death jane would appear to have been fully clothed as for dominic he would forever be grateful to ketchumfor it was ketchum whod acquired a dolly for the cookhouse on one of his drunken binges in maine the dolly was useful in unloading the dry goods from the trucks or the cases of olive oil and maple syrupeven egg cartons and anything heavy the cook and his son had strapped jane onto the dolly thus they were able to bring her down the cookhouse stairs in a semiupright position and wheel her standing almost straight to her truck however the dolly had been no help getting injun jane into the cab which the cook would later recall as the herculean part of the taskor one herculean part among several as for the instrument of death dominic baciagalupo would pack the eightinch castiron skillet among his most cherished kitchen itemsnamely his favorite cookbooks because the cook knew he had no time and scant room to pack his kitchenware the other pots and pans would stay behind the rest of the cookbooks and all the novels dominic would leave for ketchum danny scarcely had time to gather some photos of his mom but not the books hed kept her pictures pressed flat in as for clothing the cook packed only the bare necessities of his own and young dans clothesand dominic would pack more clothes for himself than he did for his son because daniel would soon outgrow what he was wearing the cooks car was a pontiac station wagonthe socalled semiwoodie chieftain deluxe theyd made the last real woodie in the semiwoodie had fake wooden panels outside offset against the maroon exterior and real wood inside the interior had maroon leather upholstery too because of dominics lame left foot the pontiac chieftain deluxe came with automatic transmissionin all likelihood making it the only vehicle with automatic transmission in the settlement of twisted river which made it possible for danny to drive the car too the twelveyearolds legs werent long enough to depress a clutch pedal all the way to the floor but danny had driven the semiwoodie station wagon on the haul roads constable carl didnt cruise the haul roads there were many boys dannys age and even younger driving cars and trucks on the back roads around phillips brook and twisted river unlicensed preteens with pretty good driving skills the boys who were a little taller than danny could depress the clutch pedals all the way to the floor considering the contingencies of their escape from twisted river it was a good thing that danny could drive the chieftain because the cook would not have wanted to be seen walking through town back to the cookhouse after he drove jane in her truck to constable carls by that early hour of the morning in the predawn light dominic baciagalupos limp would have made him recognizable to anyone who might have been up and aboutand for the cook and his son to have been seen walking together at that ungodly hour would have been most unusual and suspicious of course dominics maroon semiwoodie was the only car of its kind in town the pontiac chieftain might not pass unnoticed although it would pass more quickly through the settlement than the cook with his limp and the station wagon would never be parked within sight of where dominic would leave janes truckat constable carls are you crazy danny would ask his father as they were preparing to leave the cookhousefor the last time why are we bringing the body to the constable so the drunken cowboy will wake up in the morning and think he did it the cook told his son what if constable carl is awake when we get there the boy asked thats why we have a backup plan daniel his dad said a misty almost imperceptible rain was falling the long maroon hood of the chieftain deluxe glistened the cook wet his thumb on the hood he reached inside the open driversside window and rubbed the spot of dried blood off his sons forehead remembering his goodnight kiss dominic baciagalupo knew whose blood it was he hoped it hadnt been the last kiss he would give daniel and that no more blood not anyones blood would touch his boy tonight i just follow you right young dan asked his dad thats right the cook said the backup plan foremost in his mind as he climbed into the cab of janes truck where jane was slumped against the passengerside door jane wasnt bleeding but dominic was glad that he couldnt see the bruise on her right temple janes hair had fallen forward covering her face the contusion it was swollen to the size of a baseball was pressed against the passengerside window they drove a caravan of two to the flatroofed twostory hostelry where sixpack was renting what passed for a secondfloor apartment in the rearview mirror of janes truck the cook had only a partial view of his sons small face behind the wheel of the pontiac the chieftains exterior visor resembled that of a baseball cap pulled low over the windshieldeyes of the eightcylinder station wagon with its sharktoothed grille and aggressive hood ornament shit dominic said aloud he had suddenly thought of janes cleveland indians cap where was it had they left chief wahoo upside down in the upstairs hall of the cookhouse but they were already at sixpacks place not a soul had been on the streets and the dancehall door had not once opened they couldnt go back to the cookhouse now danny parked the pontiac at the foot of the outside stairs to pams apartment the boy had squeezed into the cab of janes truck between poor dead jane and his father before dominic noticed injun janes missing baseball capyoung dan was wearing it we need to leave chief wahoo with her dont we the twelveyearold asked good boy his dad said his heart welling with pride and fear regarding the backup plan there was so much for a twelveyearold to remember the cook needed his sons help in getting injun jane from the cab of the truck to constable carls kitchen door which jane had said was always left unlocked it would be all right if they dragged her feet through the mud because the constable would expect janes boots to be muddy they just couldnt allow another part of her to touch the ground naturally the dolly would have left wheel tracks in the mudand what would dominic have done with the dolly leave it in janes truck or at constable carls door they drove to that forlorn part of town near the sawmill and the hostelry favored by the french canadian itinerants constable carl liked living near his principal victims what would you guess ketchum weighs danny asked after his dad had parked janes truck in her usual spot they were standing on the running board of the truck young dan held jane upright in the passenger seat while his father managed to guide her stiffening legs out the open door but once her feet were on the running board what then ketchum weighs about twotwenty maybe twothirty the cook said and sixpack young dan asked dominic baciagalupo would feel the stiffness in his neck from sixpacks headlock for about a week pam probably weighs about oneseventyfiveoneeighty tops his dad answered and what do you weigh danny asked the cook could see where this line of questioning was going he let injun janes feet slide all the way to the mud he stood on the wet ground beside her holding her around her hips while daniel still standing on the running board hugged her under her arms we will both end up in the mud with jane on top of us dominic was thinking but he said as casually as possible oh i dont know what i weighabout onefifty i guess he weighed all of with his winter clothes on he knew perfectly wellhe had never weighed as much as pounds and jane young dan grunted stepping down to the ground from the trucks running board the body of the indian dishwasher pitched forward into his and his fathers waiting arms though janes knees buckled they did not touch the mud the cook and his son staggered to hold her but they didnt fall injun jane weighed at least poundsmaybe or although dominic baciagalupo would profess not to know the cook could scarcely get his breath as he dragged his dead paramour to her bad boyfriends kitchen door but he managed to sound almost unconcerned as he answered his son in a whisper jane oh she weighs about the same as ketchummaybe a little more to their mutual surprise the cook and his son saw that constable carls kitchen door was not only unlockedit was open the wind maybeor else the cowboy had come home so drunk that hed left the door open in a blind unthinking stupor the misty rain had wet what they could see of the kitchen floor while the kitchen was dimly lit at least one light was on but they couldnt see beyond the kitchen they could not know more when janes splayed feet were touching the kitchen floor dominic felt confident that he could slide her the rest of the way inside by himself it would help him that her boots were muddy and the floor was wet goodbye daniel the cook whispered to his son in lieu of a kiss the twelveyearold took janes baseball cap off his head and put it on his fathers when the cook could no longer hear dannys retreating steps on the muddy street he steered janes great weight forward into the kitchen he could only hope that the boy would remember his instructions if you hear a gunshot go to ketchum if you wait for me in the pontiac for more than twenty minuteseven if there is no shotgo to ketchum dominic had told the twelveyearold that if anything ever happened to his dadnot just tonightgo to ketchum and tell ketchum everything watch out for the nexttolast step at the top of pams stairs the cook had also told his son wont sixpack be there the boy had asked just tell her you need to talk to ketchum shell let you in his father had said he could only hope that pam would let daniel in dominic baciagalupo slid injun janes body past the wet area on the kitchen floor before he let her come to rest against a cabinet holding her under her arms he allowed her immense weight to sag onto the countertop then with excruciating slowness he stretched her body out upon the floor while he was bending over her the cleveland indians cap fell off the cooks head and landed upside down beside jane chief wahoo was grinning insanely while dominic waited for the cockingsound of the colt which the cook was certain he would hear just as danny would be sure to hear the discharging of the gunit was more than loud at that hour everyone in town would hear a gunshotmaybe even ketchum still sleeping off his bender on occasion even from the distance of the cookhouse dominic had heard that colt discharge but nothing happened the cook let his breathing return to normal choosing not to look around if constable carl was there dominic didnt want to see him the cook would rather let the cowboy shoot him in the back as he was leaving he left carefully using the outwardturned toe of his bad foot to smear his muddy footprints as he left outside a wooden plank was stretched across the gutter from the road dominic used the plank to wipe flat the drag marks where the toes and heels of janes boots had carved deep rutsmarking the tortured path from her truck to the constables kitchen door the cook returned the plank to its proper place wiping the mud from his hands on the wet fender of janes truck which the increasingly steady rain would wash clean the rain would take care of his and young dans footprints too no one saw the cook limp past the silent dance hall the beaudette brothers or their ghosts had not reoccupied the old lombard log hauler which stood as the lone sentinel in the muddy lane alongside the hall dominic baciagalupo was wondering what constable carl might make of injun janes body when he stumbled over it in the blearyeyed morning what had he hit her with the cowboy might speculate having hit her more than once before but where is the weapon the blunt instrument the constable would be sure to ask himself maybe im not the one who hit her the cowboy might later concludeonce his head cleared or most certainly when he learned that the cook and his son had left town please god give me time the cook was thinking as he saw his boys small face behind the waterstreaked windshield of the chieftain deluxe young dan was waiting in the passenger seat as if hed never lost faith that his father would safely return from constable carls and be their driver by time that dogged companion dominic baciagalupo meant more than the time needed for this most immediate getaway he meant the necessary time to be a good father to his precious child the time to watch his boy become a man the cook prayed he would have that much time though he had no idea how he might arrange such an unlikely luxury he got into the drivers seat of the station wagon without receiving thecaliber bullet hed been expecting young dan began to cry i kept listening for the gunshot the twelveyearold said one day daniel you may hear it his dad told him hugging him before he started the pontiac arent we going to tell ketchum danny asked all the cook could say might one day be in danger of sounding like a mantra but dominic would say it nonetheless we havent time like a long slowly moving hearse the maroon semiwoodie took the haul road out of the settlement as they drove southsoutheast sometimes within sight of twisted river the dawn was fast approaching there would be the dam to deal with when they reached the pontook reservoir then wherever they went next they would be on route which ran north and south along the androscoggin exactly how much time remained to them in their more immediate future would be determined by what they found at dead woman damand how long they would need to linger there not too long dominic would hope as he drove are we ever going to tell ketchum young dan asked his dad sure we are his father answered though the cook had no idea how he might get the necessary message to ketchumone that would be safe yet somehow manage to be clear for now the wind had dropped and the rain was letting up ahead of them the haul road was slick with tirerutted mud but the sun was rising it shone in the driversside window giving dominic baciagalupo a bright albeit unrealistic view of the future only hours ago the cook had been worried about finding angels bodyspecifically how the sight of the dead canadian youth might affect his beloved daniel since then the twelveyearold had killed his favorite babysitter and both father and son had wrestled with her bodybringing injun jane the notinconsiderable distance from the upstairs of the cookhouse to her nearfinal resting place at constable carls whatever the cook and his dear boy would find at dead woman dam dominic was optimistically thinking how bad could it really be under stress as he was the cook had uncharacteristically thought of the place by its illgotten name as the chieftain came closer to the pontook reservoir the boy and his dad could see the seagulls although the pontook was more than one hundred miles from the ocean there were always sea gulls around the androscoggin it was such big water theres a kid in my class named halsted danny was saying worriedly i think i know his father the cook said his dad kicked him in the face with his caulk boots onthe kid has holes in his forehead young dan reported that would definitely be the halsted i know dominic replied ketchum says someone should stick a sawdust blower up halsteds ass and see if the fat bastard can be inflatedketchum means the dad danny explained ketchum recommends the sawdust blower for no small number of assholes the cook said ill bet you were going to miss ketchum wicked the boy said obsessively ill bet you we do his father agreed wickedly ketchum says you cant ever dry out hemlock danny talked on and on the twelveyearold was clearly nervous about where they were goingnot just dead woman dam but where they might go after that hemlock beams are good for bridges dominic countered hook your whiffletree as close to the load as possible young dan recited from memoryfor no apparent reason success pond has the biggest fucking beaver pond there is danny continued are you going to quote ketchum the whole way his dad asked him the whole way where the twelveyearold asked anxiously i dont know yet daniel hardwoods dont float very well the boy replied apropos of nothing yes but softwoods float pretty high dominic baciagalupo was thinking those had been softwoods in the river drive when angel went under the logs and with the wind last night some of the topmost logs might have been blown outside the containment boom those logs would be eddying in the overflow spillway to either side of the sluice dam the stray logs mostly spruce and pine would make it hard to get angel out of the circling water both the highwater shoreline and the more slowly moving water in the millpond had been formed by the dam with any luck they might find angels body there in the shallows who would kick his own kid in the face with a caulk boot the distraught boy asked his dad no one well ever see again dominic told his son the sawmill at dead woman dam looked abandoned but that was just because it was sunday tell me once more why they call it dead woman dam danny said to his father you know perfectly well why they call it that daniel i know why you dont like to call it that the boy quickly rejoined mom was the dead womanthats why right the cook parked the pontiac next to the loading dock at the mill dominic wouldnt answer his son but the twelveyearold knew the whole historyperfectly well as his dad had said both jane and ketchum had told the boy the story dead woman dam was named for his mother but danny never ceased wanting his father to talk about itmore than his father ever would why does ketchum have a white finger what does the chainsaw have to do with it young dan started up he simply couldnt stop talking ketchum has more than one white finger and you know what the chainsaw has to do with it his father said the vibration remember oh right the boy said daniel please relax lets just try to get through this and move on move on where the twelveyearold shouted daniel pleaseim as upset as you are his father said lets look for angel lets just see what we find okay we cant do anything about jane can we danny asked no we cant his dad said what will ketchum think of us the boy asked dominic wished he knew thats enough about ketchum was all the cook could say ketchum will know what to do his old friend was hoping but how would they manage to tell ketchum what had happened they couldnt wait at dead woman dam until nine oclock in the morning if it took half that long to find angel they couldnt even wait until they found him it all depended on when constable carl woke up and discovered janes body at first the cowboy would surely think he was the culprit and the cookhouse never served breakfast on a sunday morning an early supper was the only meal served on sundays it would be midafternoon before the kitchen helpers arrived at the cookhouse when they learned that the cook and his son were gone they wouldnt necessarily tell the constable not right away the cowboy would have no immediate reason to go looking for ketchum either dominic was beginning to think that it might be all right to wait for ketchum at dead woman dam until nine oclock in the morning from what the cook knew about constable carl it would be just like him to bury janes body and forget about herthat is until the cowboy heard that the cook and his son were gone most people in twisted river would conclude that injun jane had left town with them only the constable would know where jane was and under the circumstances the guiltylooking premature burial the cowboy wouldnt be likely to dig up janes body just to prove what he knew or was this wishful thinking on dominic baciagalupos part constable carl wouldnt hesitate to bury injun jane if he believed he killed her what would be wishful thinking on the cooks part was to imagine that the cowboy might feel contrite about killing janeenough to blow his brains out one could only hope that would be wishful thinkingto dream of a penitent constable carl as if the cowboy could even conceive of contrition to the right of the flashboards and the sluice spillway outside the containment boom the water was eddying against the dam in a clockwise direction a few windblown logs some stray red pine and tamarack among the spruce circling in the open water young dan and his dad couldnt spot a body there where the main water passed through the sluice spillway the containment boom bulged with tangled logs but nothing stood out from the wetbark darkwater tones the cook and his son carefully crossed the dam to the open water on the left side of the boom here the water and some stray logs were eddying in a counterclockwise direction a deerskin glove was twirling in the water but they both knew angel hadnt been wearing gloves the water was deep and black with floating slabs of bark to dominics disappointment and relief they didnt see a body there either maybe angel got out danny said but his dad knew better no one that young slipped under moving logs and got out it was already past seven in the morning but they had to keep looking even the family angel had run away from would want to know about their boy it would take longer to search the broader reaches of the millpondat some distance from the damalthough the footing would be safer there the closer they were to the dam and the containment boom the more the cook and his son worried about each other they werent wearing caulk boots they werent ketchumthey werent even rivermen of the greenest kind they simply werent loggers it would be half past eight before they found angels body the longhaired boy in his red white and green plaid shirt was floating facedown in the shallows close to shorenot one log was anywhere around him danny didnt even get his feet wet bringing the body ashore the twelveyearold used a fallen branch to hook angels royal stewart shirt young dan called to his dad while he towed the canadian youth to within his grasp together they got angel to higher ground on the riverbank lifting and dragging the body was light work compared to toting injun jane they unlaced the young loggers caulk boots and converted one of the boots to a pail to bring fresh water ashore they used the water to wipe the mud and pieces of bark from angels face and hands which were a pale pearl color tinged with blue danny did his best to run his fingers like a comb through the dead youths hair the twelveyearold was the first to find a leech as long and thick as ketchums oddly bent index finger it was what the locals called a northern bloodsuckerit was attached to angels throat the cook knew it wouldnt be the only leech on angel dominic baciagalupo also knew how ketchum hated leeches the way things were working out dominic might not be able to spare his old friend the sight of angels body butwith daniels helpthey might spare ketchum the bloodsuckers by nine oclock they had moved angel to the loading dock at the sawmill where the platform was at least dry and partly sunnyand in view of the parking lot they had stripped the body and removed almost twenty leeches theyd wiped angel clean with his wet plaid shirt and had managed to redress the dead boy in an anonymous combination of the cooks and his sons unrecognizable clothes a tshirt that had always been too big for danny fit angel fine an old pair of dominics dungarees completed the picture for ketchums sake if ketchum ever showed up at least the clothes were clean and dry there was nothing they could do about the pearlgray bluish tint to angels skin it was unreasonable to hope that the weak april sun would return the natural color to the dead youth but somehow angel looked warm are we waiting for ketchum danny asked his dad for just a little while longer the cook replied his dad was the anxious one now young dan realized the thing about time dominic knew was that it was relentless the cook was wringing out angels soakingwet and dirty clothes when he felt the wallet in the leftfront pocket of the canadians dungareesjust a cheap imitationleather wallet with a photo of a pretty heavylooking woman under a plastic window which was now fogged by its immersion in the cold water dominic rubbed the plastic on his shirtsleeve when he could see the woman more clearly her resemblance to angel was apparent surely she was the dead boys mothera woman a little older than the cook but younger than injun jane there wasnt much money in the walletjust some small bills only american dollars dominic had expected to find some canadian dollars too and what appeared to be a business card from a restaurant with an italian name this confirmed the cooks earliest impression that angel was no stranger to working in a kitchen though it might not have been the boys foremost career choice however something else was not as dominic baciagalupo had expected the restaurant wasnt in toronto or anywhere else in ontario it was an italian restaurant in boston massachusetts and the name of the restaurant was an even bigger surprise it was a phrase that the illegitimate son of annunziata saetta knew well because hed heard his mother utter it with a bitterness born of rejection vicino di napoli nunzi had saidin reference to where dominics absconding father had goneand the boy had thought of those hill towns and provinces in the vicinity of naples where his dad had come from and allegedly gone back to the names of those towns and provinces that annunziata had said in her sleep benevento and avellino came to dominics mind but was it possible that his deadbeat dad had run no farther than an italian restaurant on hanover street what nunzi had called the main drag of the north end of boston because according to the business card in angels wallet the restaurant was called vicino di napoliclearly a neapolitan placeand it was on hanover street near cross street the street names themselves were as familiar to dominics childhood as nunzis oftrepeated recommendations for parsley prezzémolo or her frequent mention of mother annas and the europeotwo other restaurants on hanover street nothing struck the cook as too coincidental to be believednot on a day when twelveyearold daniel baciagalupo had killed his fathers lover with the same skillet the cook had put to such legendary use who would believe hed once saved his nowdead wife from a bear even so dominic was unprepared for the last item he discovered in angel popes wallet as near as the cook could tell this was a summer pass to boston s streetcar and subway systema transit pass dominic had heard his mother call it the pass declared that the bearer was under the age of sixteen in the summer of and there was angels date of birth to prove it the boy had been born on february which meant that angel had only recently turned fifteen the youth would have had to have run away from home when he was only fourteenif he had really run away and of course there was no way of knowing if boston was still the dead boys home although the transit pass and the business card from vicino di napoli strongly suggested that this was so what would most convincingly catch dominic baciagalupos attention was angels real nameit wasnt exactly angel pope angelù del popolo who danny asked when his father read the name on the streetcar and subway pass out loud the cook knew that del popolo meant of the people and that pope was a common americanization of the sicilian name while del popolo was probably but not necessarily sicilian the angehloo was definitely sicilian which the cook knew too had the boy worked in a neapolitan restaurant at fourteen a parttime job was permitted but what had made him run away from the photograph it appeared he had still loved his mom but all the cook said to his son was it seems that angel wasnt who he said he was daniel dominic let danny look over the transit passit and the business card from vicino di napoli in the north end were all they had to go on if they were going to try to find angelù del popolos family naturally there was a more pressing problem where the hell was ketchum dominic baciagalupo was wondering how long could they afford to wait what if constable carl hadnt been all that drunk what if the cowboy had found injun janes body but hed known in an instant that he hadnt laid a hand on herat least not last night it was hard to imagine what written message the cook could leave for ketchum on angels body because what if ketchum didnt find angel first wouldnt the message have to be in code surprise angel isnt canadian and by the way jane was in an accident nobody did itnot even carl well just how could the cook leave a note like that are we still waiting for ketchum young dan asked his dad it was with notably less conviction that his father replied for just a little while longer daniel the song on the radio in ketchums badly livedin truck reached them on the loading dock of the sawmill before the truck itself appeared on the haul roadmaybe it was jo stafford singing make love to me but ketchum turned off the radio before the cook could be sure about the song ketchum was on his way to becoming chainsawdeaf the radio in his truck was always overloud the windowsnow that it was what passed for springusually open dominic was relieved to see that sixpack hadnt come along for the ride that would have seriously complicated matters ketchum parked his rattling heap a discreet distance from the pontiac he sat in the cab with his white cast resting on the steering wheel his eyes looking past them on the platform to where angel was reclining in the uncertain sunlight you found him i see ketchum said he looked away toward the dam as if he were counting the logs in the containment boom as always both predictable and unaccountable things were transported in the back of ketchums pickup truck a homemade shelter covered the bed of the pickup turning the entire truck into a wanigan ketchum carried his chainsaws around together with an assortment of axes and other toolsand under a canvas tarp an inexplicable halfcord of firewood in case the suddenly urgent need to build a bonfire possessed him daniel and i can put angel in the back of your pickup where you dont have to see him dominic said why cant angel ride with you in the chieftain ketchum asked because were not going back to twisted river the cook told his old friend ketchum sighed his eyes coming slowly to rest on angel the river driver got out of his truck and walked with an unexplained limp to the loading dock dominic wondered if ketchum was limping to mock him ketchum picked up the dead youths body as if it were a sleeping baby the logger carried the fifteenyearold to the cab of his truck where danny had run ahead to open the door i guess i might as well see him now as wait till i have to unload him back in town ketchum told them i suppose these are your clothes on him he asked young dan mine and my dads the twelveyearold said the cook limped over to the truck carrying angels wet and dirty clothes he put them on the floor of the cab by the dead boys feet angels clothes could stand some washing and drying he told ketchum ill have jane wash and dry his clothes ketchum told them jane and i can clean angel up a little toothen well dress him in his own clothes jane is dead ketchum the cook told him it was an accident he was about to add but his beloved daniel was quicker i killed her with the skilletthe one dad hit the bear with danny blurted out i thought jane was a bear the boy told ketchum the cook confirmed the story by immediately looking away from his old friend ketchum put his good arm around dannys shoulders and pulled the boy against him young dan buried his face in the stomach of ketchums woolflannel shirtthe same green and blue black watch plaid that sixpack pam had been wearing to the twelveyearold the commingled smells of ketchum and sixpack inhabited the shirt as confidently as their two strong bodies raising his cast ketchum pointed to the pontiac christ cookie you havent got poor jane in the chieftain have you we took her to constable carls danny said i dont know if carl had passed out in another room or if he wasnt home but i left jane on his kitchen floor the cook explained with any luck the cowboy will find her body and think he did it of course hell think he did it ketchum thundered ill bet he buried her an hour ago or hes digging the damn hole as we speak but when carl hears that you and danny have left town hell begin to think he didnt do it hell think you did it cookieif you and danny dont get your asses back to twisted river bluff it out you mean dominic asked whats to bluff ketchum asked for the rest of his rotten life the cowboy will be trying to remember exactly how and why he killed janeor hell be looking for you cookie youre assuming he wont remember last night the cook said thats a pretty big assumption isnt it sixpack told me you paid us a visit last night ketchum told his old friend well do you think i remember you being there probably not dominic answered but what youre suggesting is that i gamble everything it was both unconscious and uncontrollable that when the cook said everything he looked straight at young daniel you go back to the cookhouse i help you unpack the chieftain you and danny are completely settled in by the time the kitchen helpers show up this afternoon then around suppertime ketchum continued you send dot or mayor one of those worthless fucking sawmill workers wivesto constable carls you have her say wheres jane cookies going crazy without his dishwasher thats bluffing it out you win that bluff hands down ketchum told him the cowboy will be shitting his pants hell be shitting them for yearsjust waiting for some dog to dig up the injuns body i dont know ketchum the cook said its a huge bluff i cant take a chance like thatnot with daniel youre taking a bigger chance if you leave his old friend told him shit if the cowboy blows your head off ill take good care of danny young dans eyes kept moving from his father to ketchum and back to his father again i think we should go back to the cookhouse the twelveyearold told his dad but the cook knew how changeany changemade his son anxious of course daniel baciagalupo would vote to stay and bluff it out leaving represented a more unknown fear look at it this way cookie ketchum was saying his white cast leveled at his friendas heavy as the cowboys coltif im wrong and carl shoots you he wont dare lay so much as a finger on danny but if im right and the cowboy comes after you he could kill you bothbecause youd both be fugitives well thats what we arewere fugitives dominic said im not a gambler ketchumnot anymore youre gambling now cookie ketchum told him either way its a gamble isnt it give ketchum a hug danielwe should be going his dad said danny baciagalupo would remember that hug and how he thought it strange that his father and ketchum didnt hug each otherthey were such old friends and such good ones big changes are coming cookie ketchum tried to tell his friend they wont be moving logs over water much longer those dams on the dummer ponds will be gonethis dam here wont last either he said with a wave of his cast indicating the containment boom but choosing to leave dead woman dam unnamed dummer pond and little dummer and twisted river will just flow into the pontook i suspect the old boom piers on the androscoggin will last but they wont be using them anymore and the first time theres a fire in west dummer or twisted river do you think anyone will bother to rebuild those sorry settlements who wouldnt rather move to milan or errolor even berlin if you were old and feeble enough ketchum added all you have to do is stay and outlast this miserable place cookieyou and danny but the cook and his son were making their way to the chieftain if you run now youll be running forever ketchum called after them he limped around his truck from the passengers to the drivers side why are you limping the cook called to him shit ketchum said theres a step missing on sixpacks stairsi fucking forgot about it take care of yourself ketchum his old friend told him you too cookie ketchum said i wont ask you about your lip but im familiar with that injury by the way angel wasnt canadian dominic baciagalupo told ketchum his real name was angelù del popolo young dan explained and he came from boston not toronto i suppose thats where youre going ketchum asked them boston angel must have had a familytheres got to be someone who needs to know what happened to him the cook said ketchum nodded through the windshield of his truck the insufficient sunlight was playing tricks with the way angelù del popolo sat up almost straight and faced alertly forward angel not only looked alive but he seemed to be just starting the journey of his young lifenot ending it suppose i tell carl that you and danny are delivering the bad news to angels family you didnt leave the cookhouse looking like you were leaving it for good did you ketchum asked we took nothing anybody would notice dominic said it would appear that we were coming back suppose i tell the cowboy that i was surprised injun jane wasnt with you ketchum asked i could say that if i were jane i would have gone to canada too danny saw how his dad considered this before ketchum said i think i wont say youve gone to boston maybe its better to say if i were jane i would have gone to toronto suppose i say that just dont say too much whatever you say the cook told him i believe ill still think of him as angel if thats okay ketchum said as he climbed into his truck he glanced only briefly at the dead boy quickly looking away ill always think of him as angel young dan called to what extent a twelveyearold is aware or not of the start of an adventureor whether this misadventure had begun long before danny baciagalupo mistook injun jane for a bearneither ketchum nor the cook could say though danny seemed very aware ketchum must have known that he might be seeing them for the last time and he wanted to cast this phase of the gamble the cook was taking in a more positive light danny ketchum called i just want you to know that on occasion i more than once mistook jane for a bear myself but ketchum was not one for casting a positive light for long i dont suppose jane was wearing the chief wahoo hatwhen it happened the logger said to danny no she wasnt the twelveyearold told him damn it janeoh shit jane ketchum cried some fella in cleveland told me it was a lucky hat the river driver explained to the boy this fella said chief wahoo was some kind of spirit he was supposed to look after injuns maybe hes looking after jane now danny said dont get religious on me dannyjust remember the injun as she was jane truly loved you ketchum told the twelveyearold just honor her memorythats all you can do i am missing you already ketchum the boy suddenly cried out oh shit dannyyou best get going if youre going the riverman said then ketchum started his truck and drove off on the haul road toward twisted river leaving the cook and his son to their lengthier and less certain journeyto their next life no less ii boston chapter nom de plume it was almost exactly an unlucky thirteen years since constable carl had tripped over the body of the indian dishwasher in his kitchen and not even ketchum could say for certain if the cowboy was suspicious of the cook and his son who had disappeared that same night to hear it from the most insightful gossips in that area of coos county that is to say all along the upper androscoggin injun jane had disappeared with them according to ketchum it bothered carl that people thought jane had run off with the cookmore than the constable seemed troubled by the likelihood that he had murdered his companion with an unknown blunt instrument the murder weapon was never found and carl must have believed hed killed jane surely hed disposed of her body absolutely no one had seen her her body hadnt turned up either yet ketchum continued to get insinuating inquiries from the cowboy whenever their paths crossed have you still not heard a word from cookie carl would never fail to ask ketchum i thought you two were friends cookie never had a whole lot to say ketchum would point out repeatedly im not surprised i havent heard from him and what about the boy the cowboy occasionally asked what about him dannys just a kid ketchum faithfully answered kids dont write much do they but daniel baciagalupo wrote a lotnot only to ketchum from their earliest correspondence the boy had told ketchum that he wanted to become a writer in that case it would be best not to expose yourself to too much catholic thinking ketchum had replied his handwriting struck young dan as curiously feminine danny had asked his dad if his mom had taught her handwriting to ketchumthis in addition to the dancing not to mention teaching the logger how to read all dominic had said was i dont think so the puzzle of ketchums pretty penmanship remained unsolved nor did dominic appear to give his old friends handwriting much thoughtnot to the degree young dan did for thirteen years danny baciagalupo the wouldbe writer had corresponded with ketchum more than his father had the letters that passed between ketchum and the cook were generally terse and to the point was constable carl looking for them dominic always wanted to know you better assume so was essentially all that ketchum had conveyed to the cook though lately ketchum had had more to say hed sent danny and dominic the exact same letter a further novelty was that the letter was typed somethings up ketchum had begun we should talk this was easier said than doneketchum had no phone he was in the habit of calling both dominic and young dan collect from a public phone booth these calls often ended abruptly when ketchum announced he was freezing his balls off granted it was cold in northern new hampshireand in maine where ketchum appeared to be spending more and more of his timebut over the years ketchums collect calls were almost invariably made in the coldweather months perhaps by choicemaybe ketchum liked to keep things brief ketchums very first typed letter to young dan and his dad went on to say that the cowboy had let slip an ominous insinuation this was nothing newconstable carl was ominous and he was forever insinuating both dominic and danny already knewbut this time thered been specific mention of canada in carls opinion the vietnam war was the reason relations between the united states and canada had soured im not gettin shit in the area of cooperation from the canadian authorities was all the cowboy had said to ketchum who took this to mean that carl was still making inquiries across the border for thirteen years the cop had believed that the cook and his son went to toronto if the cowboy was looking for them he wasnt making inquiries in boston not yet but now ketchum had written that something was up ketchums longago advice to dannynamely if the boy wanted to be a writer he shouldnt expose himself to too much catholic thinkingmay have been a misunderstanding on ketchums part the michelangelo school dannys new school in the north endwas a middle school and a public one the kids called the school the mickey because the teachers were irish but there were no nuns among them ketchum must have assumed that the michelangelo was a catholic school dont let them brainwash you he had written to dannythe them word though probably connected to catholic thinking was forever unclear but young dan was not struck or even remotely influenced by what was catholic about the mickey what he had noticed about the north end from the start was what was italian about it the michelangelo school center had been a frequent site of the mass meetings where italian immigrants gathered for americanization the overcrowded coldwater tenement buildings where so many of dannys schoolmates at the mickey lived had originally been built for the irish immigrants whod come to the north end before the italians but the irish had movedto dorchester and roxbury or they were southies now not all that long ago thered been a small number of portuguese fishermenmaybe there still was a family or two in the vicinity of fleet streetbut in when danny baciagalupo and his dad arrived the north end was virtually all italian the cook and his son were not treated as strangersnot for long too many relatives wanted to take them in there were countless calogeros ceaseless saettas cousins and notreallycousins called the baciagalupos family but dominic and young dan were unused to large familiesnot to mention extended ones hadnt being standoffish helped them to survive in coos county the italians didnt understand standoffish either they gave you un abbràccio an embrace or you were in for a fight the elders still gathered on street corners and in the parks where one heard not only the dialects of naples and sicily but of abruzzi and calabria as well in the warm weather both the young and the old lived outdoors in the narrow streets many of these immigrants had come to america at the turn of the centurynot only from naples and palermo but also from innumerable southern italian villages the street life they had left behind had been recreated in the north end of bostonin the openair fruit and vegetable stands the small bakeries and pastry shops the meat markets the pushcarts with fresh fish every friday on cross and salem streets the barbershops and shoeshine shops the summertime feasts and festivals and those curious religious societies whose streetlevel windows were painted with figures of patron saints at least the saints were curious to dominic and daniel baciagalupo who in thirteen years had failed to find exactly what was catholic or italian within themselves well to be fair perhaps danny hadnt entirely failed with the italian parthe was still trying to lose that northern new hampshire coldness dominic it seemed would never lose it he could cook italian but being one was another matter despite ketchums likely misunderstanding that the michelangelo was a catholic school it had long seemed unfair to danny that his dad blamed ketchum for giving young dan the idea of going away to a boarding school all ketchum had said in one of his earlier letters to dannyin that positively girlish handwritingwas that the smartest fella he ever knew had attended a private school in the vicinity of the new hampshire seacoast ketchum meant exeter not a long drive north of boston and in those days you could take the train what ketchum called the good old boston and maine from boston s north station the boston maine ran to northern new hampshire too hell im sure you can walk from the north end to north station ketchum wrote to young dan even a fella with a limp could walk that far i imagine the fella word was increasingly common in ketchums vocabularymaybe from sixpack though jane had also used the word both danny and his dad said it too the cook had not taken kindly to what he called ketchums interference in daniels secondaryschool education though young dan had argued with his father on that point illogically dominic didnt blame the boys seventhand eighthgrade english teacher at the mickey mr leary whod had far more to do with danny eventually going to exeter than ketchum had ever had for that matter the cook should have blamed himselffor when dominic learned that exeter in those days was an allboys school he was suddenly persuaded to allow his beloved daniel to leave home in the fall of when the boy was only fifteen dominic would be heartbroken by how much he missed his son but the cook could sleep at night secure in the knowledge or as ketchum would say the illusion that his boy was safe from girls dominic let daniel go to exeter because he wanted to keep his son away from girls for as long as possible as he wrote to ketchum well thats your problem cookie his old friend wrote back indeed it was it hadnt been such an apparent problem when theyd first come to the north endwhen young dan was only twelve and he appeared to take no notice of girlsbut the cook saw how the girls already noticed his son among those cousins and notreallycousins in the saetta and calogero clans there would soon be some kissing cousins among them the cook could easily imaginenot to mention all the other girls the boy would meet for the north end was a neighborhood where you met people like crazy the cook and his twelveyearold had never lived in a neighborhood before on that april sunday in father and son had had some difficulty finding the north end andeven back thenit was easier to walk in the north end than it was to drive both driving and parking the pontiac chieftain in that neighborhood had been a taskcertainly not equal to transporting injun janes body from the cookhouse to constable carls kitchen but a task nonetheless when they wove their way on foot to hanover street passing once within view of the gold dome of the sumner tunnel authority which appeared to shine down on them like a new sun on a different planetthey saw two other restaurants the europeo and mother annas near cross street before they spotted vicino di napoli it was late afternoonit had been a long drive from northern new hampshire but it was a warm sunny day compared to the coldmorning light at dead woman dam where theyd left angels bluish body with ketchum here the sidewalks teemed with families people were actually talkingsome of them shoutingto one another thereat dead woman dam and in twisted river on the morning they lefttheyd seen only the slain indian dishwasher the drowned boy and ketchum here from the moment theyd parked the pontiac and started walking danny had been too excited to speak hed never seen such a place except in the movies there were no movies to see in twisted river occasionally injun jane had taken young dan to berlin to see one the cook had said he would never go back to berlin except in handcuffs that april sunday on hanover street when they stopped walking outside vicino di napoli danny glanced at his father who looked as if hed been dragged to the north end in handcuffsor else the cook felt doomed to be darkening the restaurants door was a curse attached to the bearer of sad tidings dominic was wondering what becomes of the man who brings bad news one day does something worse happen to him young dan could sense his dads hesitation but before either father or son could open the door an old man opened it from inside the restaurant come eena come eena he said to them he took danny by the wrist pulling him into the welcoming smell of the place dominic mutely followed them at first glance the cook could tell that the old man was not his despised father the elderly gentleman looked nothing like dominic and he was too old to have been gennaro capodilupo he was as he very much appeared to be both the maître d and owner of vicino di napoli and he had no memory of having met annunziata saetta though hed known nunzi without knowing it and he knew plenty of saettasnor did the old man realize on this particular sunday that it was dominics father gennaro capodilupo whom hed fired gennaro that pig had been an overly flirtatious busboy at vicino di napoli the restaurant was where nunzi and dominics philandering dad had met but the aged owner and maître d had heard of annunziata saetta hed heard of rosina or rosie calogero too scandals are the talk of neighborhoods as young dan and his dad would soon learn as for vicino di napoli the dining room was not big and the tables were small there were redandwhitecheckered tablecloths and two young women and a kid about angels age were arranging the place settings there was a stainlesssteel serving counter beyond which dominic could see a bricklined pizza oven and an open kitchen where two cooks were at work dominic was relieved that neither of the cooks was old enough to be his father were not quite ready to serve but you can sit downhavea something to drink maybe the old man said smiling at danny dominic reached into an inside pocket of his jacket where he felt angelù del popolos walletit was still damp but he had barely taken the wallet out when the maître d backed away from him are you a cop the old man asked the cop word got the attention of the two cooks dominic had spotted in the kitchen they came cautiously out from behind the serving counter the kid and the two women setting the tables stopped working and stared at dominic too cops dont usually work with their children one of the cooks said to the old man this cook was covered with flournot just his apron but his hands and bare forearms were a dusty white the pizza chef probably dominic thought im not a cop im a cook dominic told them the two younger men and the old one laughed with relief the two women and the kid went back to work but i have something to show you dominic said the cook was fishing around in angels wallet he couldnt make up his mind what to show them firstthe boston transit pass with angelù del popolos name and date of birth or the photograph of the pretty but plump woman he chose the streetcar and subway pass with the dead boys actual name but before dominic could decide which of the men to show the pass to the old man saw the photo in the open wallet and grabbed the wallet out of dominics hands carmella the maître d cried there was a boy dominic began as the two cooks hovered over the picture under plastic in the wallet maybe shes his mother dominic got no further the pizza chef hid his face in his hands completely whitening both cheeks angehloo he wailed no no no the old man sang grabbing dominic by both shoulders and shaking him the other cook clearly the principal or first chef held his heart as if hed been stabbed the pizza chef as whitefaced as a clown lightly touched young dans hand with his flourcovered fingers what has happened to angelù he asked the boy in such a gentle way that dominic knew the man must have a child daniels age or that hed had one both cooks were about ten years older than dominic angel drowned danny told them all it was an accident his father spoke up angelù wasa no fisherman the maître d lamented it was a logging accident dominic explained there was a river drive and the boy slipped under the logs the young women and the kid about angels age had bolteddanny hadnt seen them leave it would turn out that they had fled no farther than the kitchen angelù used to work here after school the old man was saying to danny his mama carmellashe works here now the other cook had stepped closer holding out his hand to dominic antonio molinari the principal chef said somberly shaking dominics hand dominic baciagalupo the cook replied i was the cook in the logging camp this is my son daniel giusé polcari the old man said to young dan with downcast eyes nobody calls me giuseppe i also like just plain joe pointing to the pizza chef old polcari said this is my son paul you can call me dan or danny the boy told them only my dad calls me daniel tony molinari had gone to the door of the restaurant he was watching the passersby on hanover street here she comes he said i see carmella the two cooks fled into their kitchen leaving the bewildered baciagalupos with old polcari you gotta tell heri no cana do it giusé or just plain joe was saying i introduce you the maître d said pushing dominic closer to the restaurants door danny was holding his dads hand her husband drowned toothey were a truelove story old polcari was telling them but he was a fishermanthey drown a lot does carmella have other children dominic asked now the three of them could see hera fullfigured woman with a beautiful face and jetblack hair she was not yet forty maybe she was ketchums age or a little older big breasts big hips big smileonly the smile was bigger than injun janes young dan would notice angelù was her one and only giusé answered dominic danny let go of his dads hand because old polcari was trying to give him something it was angels wallet which felt wet and coldthe transit pass stuck out of it crookedly danny opened the wallet and put the pass back in place just as carmella del popolo walked in the door hey joeam i late she asked the old man cheerfully not you carmellayoua always on time maybe this was one of those moments that made daniel baciagalupo become a writerhis first and inevitably awkward attempt at foreshadowing the boy suddenly saw into his fathers future if not so clearly into his own yes carmella was a little older and certainly plumper than the woman in the photo angel had carried in his wallet but in no ones estimation had she lost her looks at twelve danny may have been too young to notice girlsor the girls themselves were too young to get his attentionbut the boy already had an interest in women in injun jane surelyin sixpack pam definitely carmella del popolo forcefully reminded young dan of jane her olivebrown skin was not unlike janes reddishbrown coloring her slightly flattened nose and broad cheekbones were the same as were her darkbrown eyeslike janes carmellas eyes were almost as black as her hair and wouldnt carmella soon have a sadness like janes inside her jane had lost a son too and carmellalike dominic baciagalupohad already lost an adored spouse it was not that danny could see at that moment the slightest indication that his dad was attracted to carmella or she to him it was rather that the boy knew one thing for certain angels mother was the next woman his father would be attached tofor as long as the north end kept them safe from constable carl you gotta sit down carmella old polcari was saying as he retreated toward the kitchen where the others were hiding this is that cook and his son from upa northyou know angelùs buddies the woman who was already radiant brightened even more you are dominic she cried pressing the cooks temples with her palms by the time she turned to danny which she did quickly giusé polcari had disappeared with the other cowards and you must be danny carmella said with delight she hugged him hardnot as hard as jane had hugged him at times but hard enough to make young dan think of jane again dominic only now realized why thered been so little money in angels wallet and why theyd found next to nothing among the dead boys few things angel had been sending his earnings to his mother the boy had begged rides to the post office with injun jane hed told jane that the postage to canada was complicated but hed been buying money orders for his mom hed clearly been faithful about writing her too for she knew how the cook and his son had befriended her boy all at once she asked about ketchum is mr ketchum with you carmella said to danny the boys face held warmly in her hands maybe this moment of speechlessness helped to make daniel baciagalupo become a writer all those moments when you know you should speak but you cant think of what to sayas a writer you can never give enough attention to those moments but it was then that carmella seemed to notice there was no one else in the dining room and no one visible in the kitchen the poor woman took this to mean that they intended to surprise her maybe her angelù had made an unannounced visit to see her were the others hiding her dearest one in the kitchen all of them managing to keep deathly quiet angehloo carmella called are you and mr ketchum here too angehloo years later when hed grown accustomed to being a writer daniel baciagalupo would think it was only natural what happened then back in the kitchen they were not cowards they were just people who loved carmella del popolo and they couldnt bear to see her hurt but at the time young dan had been shocked it was paul polcari the pizza chef who started it angehloo he wailed no no no his elderly father sang angelù angelù tony molinari called more softly the young women and the kid about angels age were crooning the dead boys name too this chorus from the kitchen was not what carmella had hoped to hear they made such a dismal howl that the poor woman looked to dominic for some explanation seeing only the sorrow and panic in his face danny couldnt look at angels momit would have been like looking at injun jane a halfsecond before the skillet struck her a chair had been pulled out from the table nearest themold polcaris departing gesture even before he had bid carmella to sit downand carmella not so much sat in the chair as she collapsed into it the olivebrown color abandoning her face she had suddenly seen her sons wallet in young dans small hands but when shed reached and felt how wet and cold it was she reeled backward and half fell into the chair the cook was quick to hold her there kneeling beside her with his arm around her shoulders and danny instinctively knelt at her feet she wore a silky black skirt and a pretty white blousethe blouse would soon be spotted with her tearsand when she looked into dannys dark eyes she must have seen her son as hed once looked to her because she pulled the boys head into her lap and held him there as if he were her lost angelù not angelù she cried one of the chefs in the kitchen now rhythmically beat on a pasta pot with a wooden spoon like an echo he called out not angelù im so sorry young dan heard his dad say he drowned the boy said from carmellas lap he felt her hold his head more tightly there and once again the immediate future appeared to him for as long as he lived with his dad and carmella del popolo danny baciagalupo would be her surrogate angelù you cant blame the boy for wanting to go away to school ketchum would one day write his old friend blame me if you want to cookie but dont blame danny not drowned carmella screamed over the clamor from the kitchen danny couldnt hear what his father was whispering in the grieving womans ear but he could feel her body shaking with sobs and he managed to slightly turn his head in her lapenough to see the mourners come out of the kitchen no pots and pans or wooden spoonsthey brought just themselves their faces streaked with tears the face of paul the pizza chef was streaked with flour too but daniel baciagalupo already had an imagination he didnt need to hear what his dad was saying in carmellas ear the accident word was surely part of itit was a world of accidents both the boy and his dad already knew these are good people old polcari was saying this sounded like a prayer it was later that danny realized joe polcari had not been praying hed been speaking to carmella about the cook and his son from upa north indeed the boy and his father were the ones who walked carmella home she had needed to slump against them at times close to swooning but she was easy to supportshe had to be more than a hundred pounds lighter than jane and carmella was alive but even before they left vicino di napoli that afternoonwhen dannys head was still held fast in the distraught mothers lapdaniel baciagalupo recognized another trick that writers know it was something he already knew how to do though he would not apply it to his method of writing for a few more years all writers must know how to distance themselves to detach themselves from this and that emotional moment and danny could do thiseven at twelve with his face secure in carmellas warm grip the boy simply removed himself from this tableau from the vantage of the pizza oven perhaps or at least as far removed from the mourners as if he were standing unseen on the kitchen side of the serving counter danny saw how the staff of vicino di napoli had gathered around the seated carmella and his kneeling dad old polcari stood behind carmella with one hand on the nape of her neck and the other hand on his heart his son paul the pizza chef stood in his aura of flour with his head bowed but he had symmetrically positioned himself at carmellas hipperfectly opposite to the hip where dominic knelt beside her the two young womenwaitresses still learning their craft from carmellaknelt on the floor directly behind young dan who from the distance of the kitchen could see himself on his knees with his head held in carmellas lap the other cookthe first or principal chef tony molinaristood slightly apart from the rest of them with his arm around the narrow shoulders of the kid about angels age he was the busboy danny would soon learn being a busboy would be dannys first job at vicino di napoli but at this exact and sorrowful moment daniel baciagalupo took in the whole tableau from afar he would begin writing in the firstperson voice as many young writers do and the tortured first sentence of one of his early novels would refer in part to this virtual pietà on that april sunday in vicino di napoli in the novice writers own words i became a member of a family i was unrelated tolong before i knew nearly enough about my own family or the dilemma my father had faced in my early childhood lose the baciagalupo ketchum had written to them both in case carl comes looking for youbetter change your last name just to be safe but danny had refused daniel baciagalupo was proud of his namehe even took some rebellious pride in what his father had told him of his names history all the years those west dummer kids had called him a guinea and a wop made young dan feel that hed earned his name now in the north end in an italian neighborhood why would he want to lose the baciagalupo besides the cowboyif he came lookingwould be trying to find a dominic baciagalupo not a daniel dominic didnt feel the same way about his surname to him baciagalupo had always been a madeup name after all nunzi had named himhed been her kiss of the wolf when in reality it would have made more sense for him to have been a saetta which he half was or for his mother to have called him a capodilupo if only to shame his irresponsible father thata nogood fuck gennaro as old joe polcari would one day refer to the flirtatious fired busboy whod disappearedonly god knew where and dominic had lots of last names he could have chosen everyone in annunziatas enormous family wanted him to become a saetta whereas rosies innumerable nieces and nephewsnot to mention his late wifes more immediate familywanted him to be a calogero dominic didnt fall into that trap he saw in an instant how insulted the saettas would be if he changed his name to calogero and vice versa dominics nickname at vicino di napoli where he was almost immediately apprenticed to the first chef tony molinari and the pizza chef paul polcari would be gambacortashort leg an affectionate reference to his limpwhich was soon shortened to gamba just plain leg but dominic decided that outside his life in the restaurant neither gambacorta nor gamba was a suitable surnamenot for a cook what about bonvino old giusé polcari would suggest the name meant good wine but dominic didnt drink buonopane good bread would be tony molinaris recommendation whereas paul polcari the pizza chef was in favor of capobianco white headbecause paul was usually white all over due to the flour but these names were too comical for a man with dominics sober disposition their first night in the north end danny could have predicted what his dad would choose for a new last name when father and son walked the widow del popolo to her brick tenement building on charter streetcarmella lived in a threeroom walkup near the old bathhouse and the copps hill burying ground the only hot water was what she heated on her gas stoveyoung dan could see far enough into his fathers future to envision that dominic baciagalupo would so to speak quickly slip into the drowned fishermans shoes although her late husbands shoes didnt actually fit dominic carmella would one day be happy to discover that dominic could wear the unfortunate fishermans clothesboth men were slightly built as was danny who would soon be wearing angels leftbehind clothes naturally enough father and son needed some city attire people dressed differently in boston than they did in coos county it would come as no surprise to danny baciagalupo who wouldnt at first take ketchums advice and change his last name that his dad became dominic del popolo after all he was a cook of the peopleif not on that first night in the north end in carmellas kitchen was a bathtub bigger than the kitchen table which already had the requisite three chairs two large pasta pots were full of waterforever hot but not boiling on the gas stove carmella did next to no cooking in her kitchen she kept the water hot for her baths for a woman who lived in a coldwater tenement she was very clean and smelled wonderful with angels help she had managed to pay the gas bill in the north end in those days there werent enough fulltime jobs for young men of angels age for young men who were strong enough there were more fulltime jobs to be found in the north country in maine and new hampshire but the work there could be dangerousas poor angel had discovered danny and his dad sat at the small kitchen table with carmella while she cried the boy and his father told the sobbing mother stories about her drowned son naturally some of the stories led them to talk about ketchum when carmella had temporarily cried herself out the three of them now hungry went back to vicino di napoli which served only pizza or quick pasta dishes on sunday nights at that time the sunday midday meal was the main one for most italians and the restaurant closed early on sundays the chefs prepared a dinner for the staff after the evenings customers had gone home most other nights the restaurant was open for business fairly late and the cooks fed themselves and the staff in the midafternoon before dinner the aged owner and maître d had been expecting the three of them to return four of the small tables had been pushed together and the place settings were already prepared for them they ate and drank as at a wake pausing only to cryeveryone but young dan criedand to toast the dead boy theyd all loved though neither danny nor his dad would touch a drop of wine there were the oftrepeated hail marys many in unison but there was no open coffin to viewno nightlong prayer vigil either dominic had assured the mourners that ketchum knew angel was italian the river driver would have arranged something catholic with the french canadians danny had given his dad a look because they both knew that the woodsman would have done no such thing ketchum would have kept everything catholic and the french canadians as far away from angel as possible it was quite late when tony molinari asked dominic where he and danny were spending the night surely they didnt want to drive all the way back to northern new hampshire as hed told ketchum dominic wasnt a gamblernot anymorebut he trusted the company he was in and to his own and dannys surprise told them the truth we cant ever go backwere on the run dominic said it was dannys turn to cry the two young waitresses and carmella were quick to comfort the boy saya no more dominicwe donta need to know why or who youre running from old polcari cried yourea safe with us im not surprised dominic anyone can see youve been in a fight paul the pizza chef said patting the cooks shoulder with a sympathetic flourcovered hand thats one uglylooking lip youve gotits still bleeding you know maybe you need stitches carmella said to the cook with heartfelt concern but dominic dismissed her suggestion by shaking his head he said nothing but all of them could see the gratitude in the cooks shy smile danny had given his dad another look but the boy didnt doubt his fathers reasoning for not explaining the circumstances of his lip injury that father and son were on the run had nothing to do with the questionable character and aberrant behavior of sixpack pam you can stay with me tony molinari said to dominic theyll stay with me carmella told molinari i have a spare room her offer was incontestable because she meant angels room even mentioning the room made carmella commence to cry again when danny and his dad walked her back to the coldwater apartment on charter street she told them to take the bigger bedin her room she would sleep in the single bed in her departed angelùs room they would hear her crying herself to sleepthat is she was trying to when the crying had gone on for a long time young dan whispered to his father maybe you should go to her it wouldnt be appropriate daniel its her boy she missesi think you should go to her danny baciagalupo went to angels room where carmella held out her arms to the boy and he got into the narrow bed beside her angehloo she whispered in his ear until she finally fell asleep danny didnt dare get out of the bed for fear he would wake her he lay in her warm arms smelling her good clean smell until he fell asleep too it had been a long violent day for the twelveyearoldcounting the dramatic events of the previous night of courseand young dan must have been tired wouldnt even the way he fell asleep somehow contribute to danny becoming a writer on the night of the same day he had killed the threehundredpluspound indian dishwasher who happened to be his fathers lover daniel baciagalupo would find himself in the warm embrace of the widow del popolo the voluptuous woman who would soon replace injun jane in his fathers next lifehis dads sad but for the time being ongoing story one day the writer would recognize the near simultaneity of connected but dissimilar momentous eventsthese are what move a story forwardbut at the moment danny lost consciousness in carmellas sweetsmelling arms the exhausted boy had merely been thinking how coincidental is this he was too young to know that in any novel with a reasonable amount of forethought there were no coincidences perhaps the photographs of his dead mother were sufficient to make young dan become a writer he had managed to take only some of them from the cookhouse in twisted river and he would miss the books hed kept her photos pressed flat inparticularly those novels that contained passages rosie had underlined the passages themselves were a way for the boy to better imagine his mother together with the photos trying to remember those leftbehind pictures was a way of imagining her too only a few of the photographs he brought to boston were in color and his dad had told danny that the blackandwhite photos were somehow truer to what dominic called the lethal blue of her eyes why lethal the wouldbe writer wondered and how could those blackandwhite pictures be truer to his mothers blue eyes than the standard colorbykodak photographs rosies hair had been dark brown almost black but she was surprisingly fairskinned with sharply angular fragilelooking features which served to make her seem even more petite than she was when young dan would meet all the calogerosamong them his mothers younger sistershe saw that two of these aunts were small and pretty like his mom in the photographs and the youngest of them filomena also had blue eyes but danny would notice that as much as he was drawn to stare at filomenashe must have been about the same age as the boys mother when rosie had died in her midto late twenties in dannys estimationhis father was quick to say that filomenas eyes were not the same blue as his moms not lethal enough maybe the boy could only guess young dan would notice too that his dad rarely spoke to filomena dominic seemed almost rude to her in that he purposely wouldnt look at her or ever comment on what she was wearing was it as a writer that daniel baciagalupo began to notice such defining details had the boy already discerned what could be called a patterninprogress in his fathers attraction in turn to injun jane and to carmella del popoloboth of them big darkeyed women as opposite to rosie calogero as the twelveyearold could imagine for if rosie had truly been the love of his dads life might not dominic purposely be denying himself contact with any woman remotely like her in fact ketchum would one day accuse the cook of maintaining an unnatural fidelity to rosie by choosing to be with women who were grossly unlike her danny must have written ketchum about carmella and the boy probably said she was big because the cook had been carefulin his letters to his old friendto make no mention of his new girlfriends size or the color of her eyes dominic would tell ketchum next to nothing about angels mother and his developing relationship with her dominic wouldnt even respond to ketchums accusatory letter but the cook was angry that the logger had criticized his apparent taste in women at the time ketchum was still with sixpack pamspeaking of women opposite to cousin rosie to remember pam dominic needed only to look in a mirror where the scar on his lower lip would remain very noticeable long after the night sixpack attacked him it would be a surprise to dominic del popolo né baciagalupo that ketchum and sixpack would last as a couple for very long but they would be together for a few years longer than dominic had been with injun janeeven a little longer than the cook would manage to stay with carmella del popolo angels large but lovely mom the first morning father and son would wake up in boston it was to the tantalizing sounds of carmella having a bath in her small kitchen respecting the womans privacy dominic and young dan lay in their beds while carmella performed her seductivesounding ablutions unbeknownst to them shed put a third and fourth pasta pot of water on the stove and these would soon be coming to a near boil theres plenty of hot water she called to them who wants the next bath because the cook had already been thinking about how he might fit albeit snugly in the same big bathtub with carmella del popolo dominic somewhat insensitively suggested that he and daniel could share a bathhe meant the same bathwateran idea that the twelveyearold found repellent no dad the boy called from the narrow bed in angels room they could hear carmella as the heavy woman rose dripping from the bathtub i know boys dannys agethey need some privacy she said yes young dan thoughtnot fully understanding that he would soon need more privacy from his dad and carmella after all danny was almost a teenager while they wouldnt live together for long in the coldwater flat on charter street with the big bathtub in the small kitchen and an absurdly small water closet with just a curtain instead of a doorthe socalled wc contained only a toilet and a diminutive sink with a mirror above itthe apartment they would move into wasnt much larger or half private enough for a teenage daniel baciagalupo though it did have hot water it would be another walkup on what would one day be called wesley placean alley that ran alongside the caffè vittoriaand in addition to having two bedrooms there was a fullsize bathroom with both a tub and a shower and an actual door and the kitchen was large enough for a table with six chairs still the bedrooms were next to each other in the north end there was nothing they could afford that was at all comparable to the spaciousness of the second floor of the cookhouse in twisted river and danny was already too old to overhear his father and carmella trying to keep their lovemaking quietcertainly after the boy with his excitable imagination had heard and seen his dad and injun jane doing it the cook and carmella with young dan increasingly aware of himself as the surrogate angel had an acceptable living arrangement but it was not one that would last it would soon be time for the teenager to create a little distance between himself and his dadand as he grew older danny was made more uncomfortable by another problem if he had once suffered from a presexual state of arousal first inspired by jane and then by sixpack pam the teenager could find no relief from his deepening desire for carmella del popolohis dads injun replacement as ketchum called her dannys attraction to carmella was a more troubling problem than the privacy issues you need to get away ketchum would write to young dan although the boy truly liked his life in the north end in fact he loved it especially in comparison to the life hed had in twisted river at the paris manufacturing company school in particular the michelangelo school thought little of the education danny baciagalupo had received among those phillips brook bumsthose west dummer dolts as ketchum called them the authorities at the mickey made danny repeat a grade he was a year older than most of his classmates by seventh grade when the wouldbe writer first mentioned ketchums exeter idea to his english teacher mr leary the irishman already considered danny baciagalupo to be among his very best students by the time the boy was taking eighthgrade english danny was far and away mr learys teachers pet several of mr learys former pupils had gone on to attend boston latin a few had attended roxbury latinin the old irishmans opinion a somewhat snooty anglo school two boys mr leary had taught had gone to milton and one to andover but no one from mr learys english classes had ever gone to exeter it was farther afield from boston than those other good schools and mr leary knew it was a very good school might it have been a feather in mr learys cap if daniel baciagalupo were accepted at exeter mr leary felt bedeviled by most of the other seventhand eighthgrade boys at the mickey it was notable that danny didnt join in the teasing his teacher took because teasingand other harsher forms of harassmentreminded the boy of his paris school experience mr leary was redfaced from drink he had a potatoshaped nose the veritable image of the alleged staple of his countrymens diet wild white tufts of hair like fur stuck out above his ears but mr leary was otherwise baldwith a pronounced dent in the top of his head he looked like a partially defeathered owl as a child mr leary told all his students i was hit on the head by an unabridged dictionary which doubtless gave me my abundant love of words both the seventhand eighthgrade boys called him o for mr leary had dropped the o from his name these badly behaved boys wrote no end of os on the blackboard when mr leary was out of the classroom they called to him obut only when his back was turned why this tormented the former mr oleary so danny didnt understand nor did daniel baciagalupo think it was any big deal for his teacher to have dropped the o from his name just look at angel pope and everything he had dropped did the italian kids think that only the irish occasionally tried to make less of their ethnicity but mr learys foremost reason for finding daniel baciagalupo such an excellent student was that the boy loved to write and he wrote and wrote in the seventh and eighth grade at the mickey mr leary had never seen anything quite like it the boy seemed possessedor at least obsessed true it would not infrequently disturb mr leary to read what young dan would write about but his storiesmany of them farfetched most of them violent and all of them with an undue amount of sexual content totally inappropriate for a teenagerwere invariably wellwritten and clear the kid simply had a gift for storytelling mr leary just wanted to help him master the grammar and all the rest of the mechanics of writing at exeter mr leary had heard they were sticklers for grammar they made a nutsandbolts business out of writing thereyou had to write every day about something when mr leary wrote to the admissions people at exeter he made no mention of the subject matter of young dans creative writing exeter was not much interested in socalled creative writing anyway the essay mr leary assumed was allimportant there and the michelangelo school where daniel baciagalupo was such an exceptional student was in a neighborhood of italoamericans mr leary was careful not to use the immigrant word though this was very much his meaning these people were prone to laziness and exaggeration mr leary wanted exeter to know the baciagalupo boy was unlike the rest to listen to most of these italians mr leary suggested you would get the impression that they had all lived with rats and other appalling conditions in the steerage class of the ships that brought them to americaall of them orphans or otherwise landing on the docks alone and with no more than a few miserable lira to their names and while many of the teenage girls were beautiful they would all become hopelessly fat as women this was because of the pasta and their unrestrained appetites the latter mr leary suspected were not limited to overeating truth be told these italians were not as industrious as those hardworking earlier immigrantsthe irishand while mr leary didnt exactly say these things to the admissions people at exeter he imparted no small amount of his prejudices while singing in praise of daniel baciagalupos talents and character not to mention citing the difficulties the boy had faced and overcome at home there was a single parenta rather uncommunicative cook as mr leary described him this cook lived with a woman mr leary would describe as a widow who has suffered multiple tragediesto wit if ever there were a worthy candidate for the enviable position of a fullscholarship student at exeter daniel baciagalupo was his name cleverly mr leary was not only aware of his prejudices he wanted to be sure that exeter was aware of his prejudices too he intended to make the north end of boston sound like a place danny needed to be rescued from mr leary wanted someone from exeter to come see the michelangelo school even if this meant seeing how disrespected mr leary was there for surely if a scholarship person met daniel baciagalupo in the company of those badly behaved boys at the mickeyand just as important saw the wouldbe writer in the context of that noisy neighborhood restaurant where both the boys father and the tragic widow workedwell it would simply be obvious how danny baciagalupo stood out the boy did stand out but young dan would have stood out anywherenot only in the north endthough mr leary didnt say this as it would turn out he said enough his letter had its desired effect get a load of this guy meaning mr leary with his abundant prejudices the first person in the admissions office at exeter must have said the letter was passed on to another reader and to another a lot of people at exeter probably read that letter among them the very scholarship person mr leary had in mind all along and that person doubtless said i have to see thismeaning not only the mickey and mr leary but also the underprivileged circumstances of daniel baciagalupos italoamerican life there was much more that mr leary didnt say what need was there for exeter to know about the boys outrageous imagination what had happened to the father in that one story hed been lamed forever crippled by a bearthe bear had eaten one of the fathers feetbut the maimed man had somehow managed to beat back the bear with a frying pan this same maimed man lost his wife in a squaredancing accident thered been a square dance outdoors on a dock the dock had collapsed and all the dancers were drowned the man whod lost his foot to the bear had been spared because he couldnt dance he was just watching from afar if mr leary remembered the story correctlyit was all preposterous stuff but wellwritten very wellwritten there was even a friend of this same fictional family whod been braindamaged by a corrupt cop the victim was an unlikely lumberjackunlikely in mr learys opinion because the lumberjack was described as a great reader even more improbable hed been so badly beaten by the cop that hed forgotten how to read and the women in daniel baciagalupos storieslord have mercy thought mr leary there was a native woman from a local indian tribethe story about the maimed man was set in the boondocks of northern new hampshire and featured a dance hall where there was no dancing come on mr leary had thought when hed read the storywhat would be the point of that but the story had been wellwritten as always and the indian woman weighed three or four hundred pounds and her hair hung below her waist this caused a retarded boy the child of the father whod been attacked by the bear to mistake the indian for another bear the unfortunate retard actually thought that the same bear had returned to eat the rest of his dad when in truth the indian woman was having sex with the cripplein what mr leary could only imagine must have been the superior position but when the teacher had said this to danny i gather the indian woman was in theah wellsuperior position the baciagalupo boy looked uncomprehending the young writer had not understood no she was just on top danny had answered mr leary the teacher had smiled adoringly in mr learys eyes daniel baciagalupo was a geniusinprogress the wonder boy could do no wrong yet what had happened to the overweight indian woman was horrendous the retarded boy had killed her hed hit her with the exact same frying pan his father had used as a weapon against the bear young baciagalupos powers of description were perhaps at their best when he rendered the reposeful posture of the naked dead indian woman the thoughtful father had quickly covered her exposed crotch with a pillowperhaps to spare his damaged son any further misunderstanding but the retarded boy had already seen more than his limited intelligence could stand for years he would be haunted by the sight of the slain womans huge breastshow they had lifelessly slumped into the hollows of her armpits how did the kid keep coming up with details like those mr leary would wonder mr leary would be haunted by the naked dead indian woman too but why say anything to exeter about those questionable elements of the boys imagination which had even upset mr leary those extreme details were mere indulgences the more mature writer would one day outgrow for example the woman who wore a mans woolflannel shirt without a bra she had raped the retarded boy after shed consumed an entire sixpack of beer why did exeter need to know about her mr leary wished he could forget her or the woman in one of the coldwater tenement buildings on charter street near the bathhouse and the copps hill burying groundas mr leary remembered her she had pretty big breasts too this was another baciagalupo story and the woman on charter street was referred to as the stepmother of the retarded boythe same boy from that earlier story but he was no longer called retarded in the new story the boy was described as just plain damaged the father with the eaten foot had confusing dreamsboth of the bear and of the slain indian woman given the voluptuousness of the damaged boys stepmother mr leary suspected the father of having a preternatural attraction to overweight women naturally it was entirely possible that the young writer found big women alluring mr leary was beginning to feel the unwelcome allure of such women himself and the stepmother was italian thus inviting mr learys prejudices to come into play he looked for signs of laziness and exaggeration in the woman finding to his enormous satisfaction a perfect example of the aforementioned unrestrained appetites mr leary had long held italian women accountable for the woman overbathed herself she was so eccentrically devoted to her baths that an oversize bathtub was the centerpiece of the coldwater flats undersize kitchen where four pasta pots were constantly simmeringher bathwater was heated on the gas stove the placement of the bathtub created quite a privacy problem for the indulgent womans damaged stepson who had bored a hole in his bedroom door which opened into the kitchen what further damage was done to the boy by spying on his naked stepmotherwell mr leary could only imagine and to talk about young baciagalupos inventiveness with details when the voluptuary shaved her armpits she left a small spadeshaped patch of hair in one armpit purposely unshaven like an elfs meticulously trimmed goatee young dan had written in which armpit mr leary had asked the beginning writer the left one danny answered without a moments hesitation why the left one and not the right the english teacher asked the baciagalupo boy looked thoughtful as if he were trying to remember a rather complicated sequence of events shes righthanded danny answered shes not as skillful with the razor when shes shaving with her left hand she shaves her right armpit with her left hand he explained to his teacher those are good details too mr leary told him i think you should put those details in the story okay i will young dan said he liked mr leary and did his best to protect his english teacher from the torments of the other boys the other boys didnt bother danny sure there were bullies at the mickey but they werent as tough as those paris manufacturing company thugs if some bully in the north end gave danny baciagalupo any trouble young dan just told his older cousins the bully would get the shit kicked out of him by a calogero or a saetta the older cousins could have kicked the shit out of those west dummer dolts too danny didnt show his writing to anyone but mr leary of course the boy wrote rather long letters to ketchum but those letters werent fiction no one in his right mind would make up a story and try to pass it off on ketchum besides it was for pouring out his heart that young dan needed ketchum many of the letters to ketchum began you know how much i love my dad i really do but and so on like father like son the cook had kept things from his son and danny in grades seven and eight especially was of an age to keep things back he would be thirteen when he began grade seven and first met mr leary the baciagalupo boy would be fifteen when he graduated from eighth grade he was both fourteen and fifteen when he showed his english teacher the stories he made up with everincreasing compulsion despite mr learys misgivings about the subject mattermeaning the sexual content chieflythe wise old owl of an irishman never said an unpraiseworthy word to his favorite pupil the baciagalupo boy was going to be a writer in mr learys mind there was no doubt about it the english teacher kept his fingers crossed about exeter if the boy was accepted mr leary hoped the school would be so rigorous that it might save young baciagalupo from the more unsavory aspects of his imagination at exeter maybe the mechanics of writing would be so thoroughly demanding and timeconsuming that danny would become a more intellectual writer meaning what exactly not quite such a creative one mr leary himself was not entirely sure what he meant by the mystifying thought that becoming a more intellectual writer might make danny a less creative oneif that was what mr leary thoughtbut the teachers intentions were good mr leary wanted all the best for the baciagalupo boy and while he would never criticize a word young dan had written the old english teacher ventured out on a limb in making a bold suggestion well it wasnt that bold a suggestion it merely seemed bold to mr leary this happened to be in that almostmudseason time of dannys eighthgrade yearin march when danny had just turned fifteen and the boy and his teacher were waiting to hear from exeter that mr leary made the aforementioned bold suggestion would years later prompt daniel baciagalupo to write his own version of ketchums periodic claim all the shit seems to happen in mud season ketchum regularly complained in seeming refutation of the fact that the cook and his beloved cousin rosie were married in mud season and young dan had been born just before it of course there was no actual mud season in boston danny mr leary asked tentativelyalmost as if he werent sure of the boys name down the road as a writer you might want to consider a nom de plume a what the fifteenyearold asked a pen name some writers choose their own names instead of publishing under their given names its called a nom de plume in french the boys teacher explained mr leary felt his heart rise to his throat because young baciagalupo suddenly looked as if hed been slapped you mean lose the baciagalupo danny said its just that there are easier names to say and remember mr leary told his favorite pupil i thought that since your father changed his nameand the widow del popolo hasnt become a baciagalupo has shewell i merely imagined that you might not be so terribly attached to the baciagalupo name yourself im very attached to it young dan said yes i can see thatthen by all means you must hang on to that name mr leary said with genuine enthusiasm he felt awful hed not meant to insult the boy i think daniel baciagalupo is a good name for a writer the determined fifteenyearold told his teacher if i write good books wont readers go to the trouble of remembering my name of course they will danny mr leary cried im sorry about the nomdeplume businessit was truly insensitive of me thats okayi know youre just trying to help me the boy told him we should be hearing some word from exeter any day now mr leary said anxiously he was desperate to change the subject from the penname faux pas i hope so danny baciagalupo said seriously a more thoughtful expression had returned to young dans face hed stopped scowling mr leary who was agitated that hed overstepped his bounds knew that the boy went to work at vicino di napoli almost every afternoon after school the wellmeaning english teacher let danny go on his way as he often did after school mr leary did some errands in the neighborhood he still lived in the area of northeastern university where hed gone to graduate school and met his wife he took the subway to the haymarket station every morning and he took it home again but he did his shopping what little there was of it in the north end hed taught at the michelangelo for so long virtually everyone in the neighborhood knew him hed taught either them or their children simply because they teased himafter all he was irishdidnt mean that they didnt like mr leary whose eccentricities amused them the afternoon of his illconceived bold suggestion mr leary paused in the garden at st leonard church once again fretting at the absence of an sobviously to the old english teacher the church should have been named st leonards mr leary did his confessing at st stephens which had a propers he simply liked st stephens better it was more like a catholic church anywhere st leonard was somehow more italianeven that familiar prayer in the garden of the church was translated into italian ora sono qui preghiamo insieme dio ti aiuta now im here lets pray together god will help you mr leary prayed that god would help daniel baciagalupo get a full scholarship to exeter and there was another thing hed never liked about st leonard mr leary thought as he was leaving the garden he hadnt gone inside the church there was a plaster saint inside san peregrine with his right leg bandaged mr leary found the statue vulgar and there was something else he preferred about st stephens the old irishman was musinghow the church was across from the prado where the old men gathered to play checkers in the good weather mr leary occasionally stopped to play checkers with them a few of those old guys were really good but the ones who hadnt learned english irritated mr leary not learning english was either not american enough or too italian to suit him a former pupil a fireman now called to the old teacher outside the fire station on the corner of hanover and charter streets and mr leary stopped to chat with the robust fellow in no particular order mr leary then refilled a prescription at barones pharmacy in the same location he paused at tostis the record store where he occasionally bought a new album the one italian indulgence that mr leary loved was operawell to be fair he also loved the way they served the espresso at the caffè vittoria and the sicilian meat loaf danny baciagalupos dad made at vicino di napoli mr leary made a small purchase at the modern a pastry shop on hanover he bought some cannoli to take home for his breakfastthe pastry cylinders were filled with sweetened ricotta cheese nuts and candied fruits mr leary had to confess to loving those italian indulgences too he didnt like to look up hanover street in the direction of scollay square though he walked in that direction to take the subway home from the haymarket station every school day south of the haymarket was the casino theatre and in the near vicinity of the scollay square subway station was the old howard at both establishments mr leary tried to see the new striptease shows on the nights they openedbefore the censors saw the shows and inevitably trimmed them his regular attendance at these striptease joints made mr leary feel ashamed although his wife had died long ago his wife probably wouldnt have cared that he went to see the strippersor she would have minded this indulgence less than if hed remarried which he hadnt yet mr leary had seen a few of these strippers perform so many times in a way he occasionally felt that he was married to them he had memorized the mole if it was a mole on peaches the socalled queen of shake lois dufeewhose name mr leary believed was incorrectly spelledwas six feet four and had peroxideblond hair sally rand danced with balloons and there was another dancer who used feathers precisely what he saw these and other strippers do was the usual subject of what he confessed at st stephensthat and the repeated acknowledgment that he didnt miss his wife not anymore hed once missed her butlike his wife herselfthe missingher part had left him it was a relatively new habit of mr learyssince he had written to exeterthat before he finally left the north end every school day afternoon he would stop back at the michelangelo and see if there was anything in his mailbox he was thinking to himself that he had a new confession to make at st stephensfor it weighed on him like a sin that hed proposed a nom de plume to the baciagalupo boywhen he sorted through the mail which had arrived late in the day yet what a good name for a writer daniel leary would have been the old irishman was thinking then he saw the pearlgray envelope with the crimson lettering and what very classy lettering it was phillips exeteracademy do you finally believe mr leary thought to himself no prayer in a churchyard was ever wastedeven in that ultraitalian garden at st leonard god will help youdio ti aiuta the crafty old irishman said aloud in english and italian just to be on the safe side before he opened the envelope and read the letter from the scholarship person at exeter mr carlisle was coming to boston he wanted to visit the michelangelo school and meet mr leary mr carlisle very much looked forward to meeting daniel baciagalupoand the boys father the cook and the boys stepmother too mr leary realized that he may have overstepped his bounds once more by referring to the widow del popolo as dannys stepmother to the english teachers knowledge the cook and the curvy waitress werent married naturally mr leary had overstepped himself in a few other areas as well while young dan had told his english teacher that his dad was reluctant to let the boy leave home and go away to schooland carmella del popolo had actually cried at the very ideamr leary had already submitted his favorite students transcripts to the venerable academy hed even persuaded a couple of other teachers at the mickey to write recommendations for young baciagalupo mr leary had virtually applied for admission on behalf of daniel baciagalupoall without telling the boys father what he was up to now in mr carlisles letter there were references to the familys need to submit financial statementssomething the rather remote cook might be opposed to it occurred to mr leary who was hoping he had not overstepped his bounds again to the degree that hed utterly failed with the penname plan the nom de plume had been an embarrassing mistake oh my mr leary was thinkingtime to pray more but he courageously took the exeter letter in hand together with his little parcel of pastries from the modern and he once more sallied forth on hanover streetthis time not to the garden in the churchyard at st leonard but to vicino di napoli where he knew he would find the baciagalupo boy together with the rather remote cook as mr leary thought of dannys dad and that overweight woman the widow del popolo the voluptuous waitress had once come to a teachers conference with mr leary her late son angelù had been an open and friendly presence in mr learys seventhgrade english class angelù had never been among those badly behaved boys who tormented mr leary for dropping the o from his given name the del popolo boy had been quite a good reader toothough he was easily distracted as mr leary had told his mother then angelù had dropped out of school and gone to work in that godforsaken north country where the lad had drowned like his father before him quite a convincing argument for staying in school if mr leary had ever heard one but ever since that teachers conference with the widow del popolo mr leary had suffered the occasional dreams about her probably every man whod met that woman suffered those dreams the old english teacher imagined nevertheless her name had more than once come up in his confessions at st stephens if carmella del popolo had ever been a stripper at either the casino theatre or the old howard they would have packed the place every night with the exeter letter returned to its envelope and in his haste to beat a path to the little italian restaurant which had become mr leary knew one of the most popular eating places in the north end the owlish irishman failed to notice the giant white o that one of those badly behaved boys at the mickey had rubbed with chalk onto the back of the teachers navyblue trench coat mr leary had not worn the trench coat on his earlier errands in the neighborhood but now he donned the coat unseeing thus he went on his eager but anxious way marked from behind with a chalkwhite o as identifiable from a block away as a bullseye when it was mud season in coos county in daniel baciagalupo the writer was living in iowa city iowa they had a real spring in iowa no mud seasons there but danny who was twentyfive with a twoyearold sonhis wife had just left himwas very much in a mudseason frame of mind he was also writing at this moment and trying to remember precisely what they had been talking about in vicino di napoli when mr leary with the letter from exeter in his jacket knocked fervently on the door which was locked the staff was finishing its midafternoon meal its the irishman let him eena cried old polcari one of the young waitresses opened the door for mr learydannys cousin elena calogero she was in her late teens or early twenties as was the other young waitress assisting carmella teresa dimattia carmellas maiden name had been dimattia as the widow del popolo was fond of saying she was a twicedisplaced neapolitanthe first time because shed come as a child with her family to the north end from sicily her grandparents had long before moved from the vicinity of naples and the second time because shed married a sicilian by her own strange logic carmella had gone on displacing herself the writer daniel baciagalupo thought because angelù was sicilian for angelo and carmella had attached herself to dominic but in the chapter danny was writing which hed titled going away to school he was adrift and had lost his focus too much of the crucial moment in the chapterwhen the father is fighting back tears at the same time he is giving his son permission to go off to boarding schoolwas in the point of view of the boys wellmeaning but meddlesome english teacher hi mike tony molinari had said that afternoon in the restaurant or had paul polcari the pizza chef greeted mr leary first old joe polcari who used to play checkers with mr leary in the prado always addressed the english teacher as michaelas my dad did danny baciagalupo remembered it was a bad night for danny to try to writeperhaps this scene especially the wife of three years whod just left him had always said she wouldnt stay but he hadnt believed herhe hadnt wanted to believe her as ketchum had pointed out young dan had met katie callahan when he was still an undergraduate at the university of new hampshire hed been a junior when katie was a senior but theyd both been models in the lifedrawing classes when she told him she was leaving katie said i still believe in you as a writer but the only stuff we ever had in common doesnt travel very far what stuff is that hed asked her were completely at ease being naked in front of strangers and total fuckheads shed told him maybe thats part of what being a writer entails danny baciagalupo found himself thinking on that rainy spring night in iowa city he wrote mostly at night when little joe was sleeping absolutely everyone but not katie called the twoyearold joe like the maître d he was named after the boy was never a joseph old polcari had liked giusé or just plain joe as for being naked in front of strangers and total fuckheads katie meant this more literallyin her own case his senior year in durham when katie had been pregnant with joe shed still modeled for the lifedrawing classes and had slept with one of the art students now in iowa citywhen danny was about to graduate from the writers workshop at the university of iowa with an mfa in creative writingkatie was still modeling for lifedrawing classes but this time she was sleeping with one of the faculty yet that wasnt why she was moving on shed told her husband she had proposed marrying danny and having a baby before his graduation from college you dont want to go to vietnam do you shed asked him actually danny had thought at the time that he did want to gonot because he didnt oppose the war politically though he would never be as political as katie ketchum called her a fucking anarchist it was as a writer that daniel baciagalupo thought he should go to vietnam he believed he should see a war and know what one was like both his dad and ketchum had told him his thinking was full of shit on that subject i didnt let you go away from me to goddamn exeter to let you die in a dumb war dominic had cried ketchum had threatened to come find danny and cut a few fingers off his right hand or your whole fucking hand ketchum had thunderedfreezing his balls off in a phone booth somewhere both men had promised young dans mother that they would never let her boy go to war ketchum said he would use his browning knife on dannys right hand or on just the fingers the knife had a footlong blade and ketchum kept it very sharp or ill put a deer slug in my twelvegauge and shoot you pointblank in one of your knees daniel baciagalupo would accept katie callahans suggestion instead go on knock me up katie had said ill marry you and have your kid just dont expect me to stay around for longim not anybodys wife and im not mother material but i know how to have a baby its for a good causekeeping one more body out of this fucking war and you say you want to be a writer well you have to live to do that dont you fuckhead it was never the case that she deceived him hed known from the first what she was like they met when they were undressing together for a lifedrawing class whats your name shed asked him and what do you want to be when you grow up im going to be a writer danny said even before he told her his name if you think you are capable of living without writing do not write katie callahan said what did you say he asked her rilke said that fuckhead if you want to be a fucking writer you ought to read him she said now she was leaving him because shed met in her words another stupid boy who thinks he should go to vietnam just to fucking see it katie was going to get this other boy to knock her up then one day she would move on againuntil this fucking war is over she would eventually run out of time mathematically speaking there were a limited number of wouldbe soldiers she could save from the war in this fashion they called young dads like danny baciagalupo kennedy fathers in march president kennedy had issued an executive order expanding paternity deferment it would exist only for a little whilethat having a child was a workable deferment from the draftbut it had served for daniel baciagalupo the writer hed gone from s the student deferment to afathers maintaining a bona fide relationship with a child were deferred having a kid could get you out of the war eventually the fuckers would close that door too but danny had walked right through it whether it would work or not for this other stupid boy she had metwell at the time not even katie could say she was leaving anyway whether or not she made a baby for the new wouldbe soldier and regardless of how many more babies she would or wouldnt get to make for such a noble cause let me see if i have this right were among dannys last words to his departing wife whod never really been a wife and who had no further interest in being a mother if i stay any longer fuckhead the twoyearold is going to remember me katie had said shed actually called her own child the twoyearold his names joe danny had reminded her that was when hed said let me see if i have this right youre not just an antiwar activist and a sexual anarchist youre also this radical chick who specializes in serial baby making for draft dodgershave i got that right put it in writing fuckhead katie had suggested and these were her last words to her husband maybe itll sound better in writing both ketchum and his dad had warned him i think letting me cut a few fingers off your right hand would be easier and less painful in the long run ketchum had said how about just your fucking trigger finger they wont draft you ill bet if you cant squeeze a trigger dominic had taken a dislike to katie callahan on the mere evidence of the first photograph daniel showed him she looks way too thin the cook commented scowling at the photo does she ever eat anything he should talk danny had thought both danny and his dad were thin and they ate a lot are her eyes really that blue his father asked actually her eyes are even bluer danny told his dad what is it about these preternaturally small women dominic found himself thinking remembering his notreallyacousin rosie had his beloved daniel succumbed to one of those littlegirl women whose petite appearance was deceiving even that first photograph of katie conveyed to the cook the kind of childlike woman some men feel compelled to protect but katie didnt need protection she didnt want it either the first time they met the cook couldnt look at herit was the same way he had treated still treated dannys aunt filomena i should never have shown you your mothers photographs dominic said when danny told him he was marrying katie i suppose i should have married some nice fat person daniel baciagalupo found himself thinking instead of working ahead on the chapter he was writing but the war in vietnam would drag on and on nixon would win the election by promising voters an end to the war but the war would continue until on april issuing his own executive order president nixon put an end to the a paternity deferment for new fathersif the child was conceived on or after that date in the last five years of the war another us soldiers would be killed and daniel baciagalupo would finally come to realize that he should have thanked katie callahan for saving his life so what if she was a serial baby maker for draft dodgers ketchum would write to danny she saved your ass sure as shit and i wasnt kiddingi would have chopped off your right hand to spare you getting your balls blown off if she hadnt saved you a finger or two anyway but that april night in when he kept trying to write in the rain in iowa city daniel baciagalupo preferred to think that it was his twoyearold little joe whod saved him probably no one could have saved katie many years later daniel baciagalupo would read prime green remembering the sixties a memoir by the fiction writer robert stone life had given americans so much by the midsixties that we were all a little drunk on possibility stone would write things were speeding out of control before we could define them those of us who cared most deeply about the changes those who gave their lives to them were i think the most deceived well that certainly rang true for katie callahan danny would think when he read that passage but that book by robert stone wouldnt be written in time to save katie so she wasnt looking for protection and she couldnt be saved butin addition to her looks which were both wanton and seemingly underageno small part of her appeal and what made her most desirable to danny was that katie was a renegade she also had the edginess of a sexual deserter you never knew what she would do next because katie didnt know either sit down michael sit downeat something old polcari had kept urging mr leary but the agitated irishman was too worked up to eat he had a beer and then a glass or two of red wine poor mr leary couldnt look at carmella del popolo danny knew without imagining that spadeshaped elfs goatee shed possibly left unshaven in her left armpit and when dominic limped off to the kitchen to bring mr leary a slice of the english teachers favorite sicilian meat loaf danny baciagalupo the writerinprogress saw the old owl looking at his dads limp with new and startled eyes maybe a bear did that to the cooks foot mr leary might have been thinking maybe there really had been a threeor fourhundredpound indian woman whose hair had hung below her waist there was one other thing mr leary had lied about to exeter the part about these immigrants being prone to exaggeration hadnt mr leary said that the baciagalupo boy was unlike the rest in the area of writerly exaggeration daniel baciagalupo was a born exaggerator and danny was still at it on that rainy night in iowa city though he was sorely distracted he was still a little bit in love with katie callahan too danny was only beginning to understand what his father had meant by the color hed called lethal blue how did that johnny cash song go hed first heard it six or seven years ago danny was guessing oh i never got over those blue eyes i see them everywhere more distractions the writer thought it was as if he were determined to physically remove himself to detach himself from that night in vicino di napoli with dear mr leary it had taken mr leary a third or fourth glass of red wine and most of the meat loaf before he was brave enough to take the pearlgray envelope out of his inside jacket pocket from across the table danny spotted the crimson lettering the fifteenyearold knew what exeter s school colors were and its all boys dominic the writer could still hear mr leary saying the old english teacher had indicated with a nod of his head the attractive calogero girl dannys older cousin elena and her overripe friend teresa dimattia those girls were all over danny whenever the afterschool busboy was trying to change into his black busboy pants back in the kitchen give danny some privacy girls tony molinari would tell them but they wouldnt let up with their ceaseless vamping in addition to dear mr leary maybe danny had those girls to thank for his dads decision to let him go to exeter the hard parts to write about were the tears in his fathers eyes when he said well daniel if its a good school like michael says and if you really want to go therewell i guess carmella and i can come visit you there on occasion and you can come home to boston on the occasional weekends his dads voice had broken on the occasion and occasional words daniel baciagalupo would remember on that rainy night when he absolutely could not writebut he kept trying toin iowa city danny remembered too how hed gone off to the back of the kitchen at vicino di napoli so that his father wouldnt see him start to cryby then carmella was crying too but she was always cryingand danny took a little extra time in the kitchen to wet a dishcloth unobserved by mr leary who was overly fond of red wine danny wiped clean the back of his teachers trenchcoat the chalkwhite o had been easy to erase easier to erase than the rest of that evening danny would never forget lying in his bedroom later that night in the wesley place apartment hearing his dad cry and crywith carmella crying too as she tried to comfort him finally young dan had knocked on the wall between their bedrooms i love you and ill come home a lotevery weekend i can i love you his dad had blubbered back i love you too carmella had called well he couldnt write that scenehe could never get it right daniel baciagalupo was thinking the chapter titled going away to school was part of the twentyfiveyearold writers second novel he had finished his first novel at the end of his first year in the iowa writers workshop and hed spent much of his second and final year revising it he had been lucky enough in his senior year at the university of new hampshire to have one of the writersinresidence in the english department introduce him to a literary agent and his first novel was bought by the first publisher the book was sent to it would be several years before daniel baciagalupo would realize how fortunate hed been possibly no other student graduating from the writers workshop that year already had a novel accepted for publication it had made danny the envy of some other students but he hadnt made many friends among those students he was one of the few who was married and had a child so hed not been a regular at the parties danny had written to ketchum about the book he hoped that the logger would be among the first to read it the novel wouldnt be published until december of or maybe not until the new year and though it had a northern new hampshire setting daniel baciagalupo assured ketchum and his dad that they werent in it its not about either of you or about meim not ready for that hed told them no angel no jane ketchum had asked hed sounded surprised or perhaps disappointed its not autobiographical danny had told them and it wasnt maybe mr leary would have called the novel rather remote had that dear man been alive to read it but mr leary had passed away thinking of that exeterletter afternoon in vicino di napoli as daniel baciagalupo was he remembered that old giusé polcari had died too the restaurant itself had moved twicefirst to fleet street then to north square where it was nowand tony molinari and paul polcari took turns at being the maître d thus giving themselves a break from the kitchen dominic with his limp was not maîtred material though he subbed as the first or principal chef and dannys dad also took turns at the pizzachef positionwhenever paul polcari was the maître d carmella as before was the most soughtafter waitress in the place there were always a couple of younger women under her supervision in those summers he was home from exeter and unhthat is until he married katiedanny had worked as a waiter at vicino di napoli and he would sub as the pizza chef when paul needed a night off or when his dad did if he hadnt become a writer daniel baciagalupo could have been a cook that rainy night in iowa when the second novel wasnt going so well and the first novel wasnt yet published danny was in a low enough mood to imagine that he might end up being a cook after all if the writing didnt work out at least he could cook as for the upcoming academic year danny already had a jobteaching creative writing and some other english courses at a small liberal arts college in vermont he had never heard of the college before hed applied for the job but with a first novel being published by random house and an mfa from a prestigious writing program like iowa swell danny was going to be a college teacher the young writer was happy about returning to new england hed missed his dad and carmellaand who knows he might actually get to see more of ketchum danny hadnt seen ketchum but once since that terrible april sunday when the boy and his dad had fled from twisted river ketchum had shown up in durham when danny was starting his freshman year at the university of new hampshire the veteran logger was in his midforties by then and hed come to dannys dorm with a gruff announcement your dad tells me you never learned how to drive on a real road ketchum we didnt have a car in boston we sold the chieftain the same week we arrivedand you dont have any time to take driving lessons at a place like exeter danny explained constipated christ ketchum said a college kid who cant get a drivers license is no one i want to be associated with ketchum then taught danny how to drive his old truck those were hard lessons for a young man whose driving experience heretofore had been with automatic transmission on the haul roads around twisted river for the week or more that ketchum was in durham he lived in his truckjust like the wanigan days the woodsman said the parking authorities at unh twice gave ketchum parking tickets when the logger was sleeping in the back of his truck ketchum gave the tickets to danny you can pay these ketchum told the young man the driving lessons are free it upset danny that he hadnt seen the woodsman but once in seven years now it had been six more years how can you not see someone as important to you as that daniel baciagalupo was thinking in the iowa spring rain more perplexing his father had not seen ketchum once in thirteen years what was the matter with them but half of dannys mind was still unfocusedlost in the runamuck chapter he was blundering about in the young writer had jumped ahead to his familys first meeting with mr carlisle the scholarship person at exeter once again in vicino di napoli maybe danny also had carmella to thank for getting him into the academy because mr carlisle had never laid eyes on anyone quite like carmellanot in exeter new hampshire surelyand the smitten man must have thought if the baciagalupo kid doesnt get into exeter i might never see this woman again mr carlisle would be crushed that carmella wasnt with danny when the boy first visited the prep school dominic didnt make the trip either how could they in boston march wasnt only st patricks day the young irish puking green beer in the streets was an annual embarrassment to mr leary it was also evacuation day a big deal in the north end because in or danny could never remember the correct year actually it was the artillery was set up in the copps hill burying ground to escort the british ships out of boston harbor you got a day off from school on evacuation day and on bunker hill day if you lived in boston that year evacuation day had come on a sunday monday was the school holiday and mr leary had taken danny on the train to exeter the evacuation day holiday was an impossible day for dominic and carmella to be away from the restaurant the writers unfocused mind had once more jumped ahead to that train ride to exeter with mr learyand what would be their first look at the venerable academy mr carlisle had been a most welcoming host but it must have killed him not to see carmella and despite his promise to come home a lotevery weekend he coulddanny wouldnt do that he rarely came home to boston on his exeter weekendsmaybe twice a term tops and then he would meet his exeter friends on a saturday night in scollay square usually to see the strippers at the old howard you had to fake your age but that was easy they let the kids in most nights you just had to be respectful to the ladies on one of those nights at the old howard danny ran into his former english teacher that was a sad night for mr leary who loved latin it was an errare humanum est nighta to err is human night for both the revered teacher and his prize student talk about jumping ahead he would have to write about that unhappy night or some version of it one day daniel baciagalupo supposed his first novel was dedicated to mr leary because of the irishmans love of latin danny had written michael leary in memoriam it was from mr leary that hed first heard the phrase in medias res mr leary had praised young dans writing by saying that as a reader he liked how danny often began a narrative in the middle of the story rather than at the chronological beginning whats that calledis there a name for it the boy had innocently asked mr leary had answered i call it in medias res which in latin means in the middle of things well that was kind of where he was at this moment in his life daniel baciagalupo was thinking he had a twoyearold son whom hed inexplicably not named after his father hed lost his wife and had not yet met another woman he was struggling to begin a second novel while the first one was not yet published and he was about to go back to new england to his first noncooking notinakitchen job if that wasnt in medias res daniel baciagalupo thought what was and continuing in latin when danny had first gone to exeter hed gone with mr leary who was with the boy in loco parentisthat is in the place of a parent maybe that was why the first novel was dedicated to mr leary not to your dad ketchum would ask danny carmella would ask the young writer the same question maybe the next one he would tell them both his father never said anything about the dedication to mr leary danny got up from his desk to watch the rain streaking his windows in iowa city he then went and watched joe sleeping the way the chapter was going the writer thought that he might as well go to bed but he generally stayed up late like his dad daniel baciagalupo didnt drink anymore katie had cured him of that habit which was not a story he wanted to think about on a night when his writing wasnt working he found himself wishing that ketchum would call hadnt ketchum said they should talk whenever ketchum called from those faraway phone booths time seemed to stop whenever he heard from ketchum daniel baciagalupo who was twentyfive usually felt that he was twelve and leaving twisted river all over again one day the writer would acknowledge this it was not a coincidence when the logger called on that rainy april night as usual ketchum called collect and danny accepted the call fucking mud season ketchum said how the hell are you so youre a typist now danny said im going to miss your pretty handwriting it was never my handwriting ketchum told him it was pams sixpack wrote all my letters why danny asked him i cant write ketchum admitted i cant read eithersixpack read all your letters aloud to me yours and your dads this was a devastating moment for daniel baciagalupo as the young writer would think of it later it was right up there with his wife leaving him but it would have more serious consequences danny thought of how hed poured out his heart to ketchum of everything hed written to the mannot to mention what ketchum had to have told pam because it was obviously sixpack not ketchum whod replied this meant that sixpack knew everything i thought my mom taught you to read danny said not really ketchum replied im sorry danny so now pam is typing danny asked this was truly hard to imagine thered not been a single typo in the typed letters both danny and his dad had received from ketchum theres a lady i met in the libraryshe turned out to be a schoolteacher danny she typed the letters for me wheres sixpack danny asked well thats kind of the problem ketchum told him sixpack moved on you know how that is he added ketchum knew all about katie moving onthere was no more to say about it sixpack left you danny asked thats not the problem ketchum answered im not surprised she left meim surprised she stayed so long but im surprised that shes moved in with the cowboy ketchum added thats the problem both danny and his dad knew that carl wasnt a constable anymore they also knew there was no more town of twisted river it had burned to the ground and it had been a ghost town before it burned carl was now a deputy sheriff of coos county are you saying sixpack will tell the cowboy what she knows danny asked ketchum not immediately ketchum answered she has no reason to do me any dirtor to do you and your dad any harm as far as i know we parted on good enough terms its whatll happen to her when carl beats her up because he will or when he throws her out because he wont keep her for long you havent seen sixpack in a while dannyshes losing her looks something wicked daniel baciagalupo was counting to himself he knew that ketchum and sixpack were the same age and that they both were the exact same age as carl when he got to fifty danny wrote the number downthat was how old they were he could imagine that sixpack pams looks were going and that the cowboy would one day kick her out carl would definitely beat her even though the deputy sheriff had stopped drinking explain what you mean danny said to ketchum itll be when carl does something bad to pamthatll be when shell tell him dont you see danny ketchum asked him its the only way she can hurt him all these years hes been wondering about you and your dadall these years hes been thinking he killed jane he just cant remember it i think its honestly driven him crazythat he cant remember killing her but he believes he did if he was a better man it might be a relief to the cowboy to learn he didnt kill injun jane and if sixpack had led a gentler life maybe she wouldnt be tempted to use her knowledge of the situation as a weapon at worst pam might blurt out the truth to carleither accidentally or while he was beating her up but ketchum wasnt counting on the cowboy to discover some essential goodness within himself and the river driver knew the life sixpack had led hed led that life too there was nothing gentle about it and the cowboy had driven himself crazynot because he believed hed killed jane he didnt even feel guilty about that much less crazy ketchum was right what made carl crazy was that he couldnt remember killing her ketchum knew the cowboy would have enjoyed remembering that that he couldnt remember was why the sheriff had eventually stopped drinking years ago when ketchum had first told danny and his dad about the new teetotaler in coos county both the cook and his son had laughed about ittheyd positively howled cookies got to get out of boston thats for starters ketchum said now he ought to lose the del popolo too im going to tell him but youve got to tell him too danny your dad doesnt always listen to me ketchum are you saying its inevitable that pam will tell carl everything as inevitable as the fact that one day danny the cowboy is going to beat her up jesus danny suddenly cried what were you and mom doing when she was supposed to be teaching you to read talk to your dad dannyits not my business to tell you were you sleeping with her danny asked him talk to your dad please ketchum said danny couldnt remember ketchum ever saying the please word before does my dad know you slept with her danny asked him constipated christ ketchum shouted into the phone why do you think your dad busted half my head open with the damn skillet what did you just say danny asked him im drunk ketchum told him dont listen to what i say i thought carl cracked your head open with his colt fortyfive danny said hell if the cowboy had cracked my head open i would have killed him ketchum thundered as soon as the logger said this danny knew it was true ketchum would never have tolerated having his head cracked open unless dominic had done it i saw lights on in the cookhouse ketchum began suddenly sounding weary your mom and dad were up late talking andin those daysdrinking i walked in the screen door to the kitchen i didnt know it was the night your mom told your dad about her and me i get it danny said not all of it you dont talk to your dad ketchum repeated did jane know danny asked shit the injun knew everything ketchum told him ketchum danny asked does my dad know that you didnt learn to read im trying to learn now ketchum said defensively i think that schoolteacher lady is going to teach me she said she would does dad know you cant read the young man asked his fathers old friend i suppose one of us will have to tell him ketchum said cookie is probably of the opinion that rosie must have taught me something so that was why you calledwhat you meant by somethings up in your letteris that it danny asked him i cant believe you believed that bullshit about the fucking bear ketchum said the bear story had found its way in a more remote form into daniel baciagalupos first novel but of course it hadnt really been a bear that walked into the kitchenit had just been ketchum and if the bear story hadnt been planted in young dans heart and mind maybe he wouldnt have reached for the eightinch castiron skilletmaybe he wouldnt have imagined that the sound of his father and jane making love was the sound of a maulinginprogress then maybe he wouldnt have killed jane so there wasnt a bear danny said hell theres probably three thousand bears at any given time in northern new hampshire ive seen a bunch of bears ive shot some ketchum added but if a bear had walked into the cookhouse kitchen through that screen door your fathers best way to save himself and rosie would be if the two of them had exited the kitchen through the dining roomnot running either or ever turning their backs on the bear but just maintaining eye contact and backing up real slowly no you dummy it wasnt a bearit was me anybody knows better than to hit a bear in the face with a fucking frying pan i wish i had never written about it was all danny could say theres one more thing ketchum told him its another kind of writing problem jesus danny said again how much have you been drinking youre sounding more and more like your father ketchum told him i just mean that youre publishing a book arent you and have you thought about what it might mean if that book were to become a bestseller if suddenly you were to become a popular writer with your name and picture in the newspapers and magazinesyou might even get to be on television its a first novel danny said dismissively it will have only a small first printing and not much publicity its a literary novel or i hope it is its highly unlikely itll be a bestseller think about it ketchum said anythings possible isnt it dont writers even young ones get lucky like other peopleor unlucky as the case may be this time danny saw it comingsooner than hed seen it in mr learys classroom at the mickey when the old english teacher made his bold suggestion about the boy possibly losing the baciagalupo the penname propositionit was coming again ketchum had first proposed a version of it to both danny and his dad now ketchum was asking dominic to lose the del popolo danny ketchum asked are you still there whats the name for itwhen a writer chooses a name thats not his or her given name that george eliot did it didnt she its called a pen name danny told him just how the fuck did you meet the schoolteacher lady in the library when you cant even read well i can read some of the authors names and the titles ketchum said indignantly i can borrow books and find someone to read them to me oh danny said he guessed that was what ketchum had done with his motherthis in lieu of learning to read what had ketchum called the readingaloud part to dominic foreplay wasnt it actually that had been dominics word for it dannys dad had told his son this funny story a pen name ketchum repeated thoughtfully i believe theres another phrase for it something frenchsounding a nom de plume danny told him thats it ketchum cried a nom de plume well thats what you needjust to be on the safe side i dont suppose you have any suggestions daniel baciagalupo said youre the writerthats your job ketchum told him ketchum kind of goes with daniel doesnt it and its a fine old coos county kind of name ill think about it danny told him im sure you can come up with something better ketchum said tell me one thing danny said if my mom hadnt died that night in the river which one of you would she have left you or my dad i cant talk to my dad about that ketchum shit ketchum cried i heard you call that wife of yours a free spirit katie was a lawless soul a political radical a fucking anarchist and a coldhearted womanyou should have known better danny but rosie was a free spirit she wouldnt have left either of usnot ever your mom was a free spirit dannylike you young people today have never seen shit ketchum cried again sometimes you ask the dumbest questionsyou make me think youre still a college kid who cant properly drive a car or that youre still a twelveyearold one your dad and jane and i could still fool about the world if we wanted to talk to your dad dannytalk to him there was a click followed by a dial tone because ketchum had disconnected the call leaving the young writer alone with his thoughts chapter in medias res in their walkup apartment on wesley place for reasons that defied logic the telephone was on carmellas side of the bed in those years danny was away at boarding school and then at college if the phone ever rang young dan was the reason the cook wanted to answer ithoping it was daniel and not some terrible news about him more often when the phone rang it was ketchum carmella had told danny that he should call home more than he did youre the only reason we have a phone your dad is always telling me the boy was pretty good after that about calling more frequently shouldnt the phone be on my side of the bed dominic had asked carmella i mean you dont want to have to talk to ketchum and if its danielor worse if theres any bad news about daniel carmella wouldnt let him finish if theres bad news about danny i want to know it firstso i can tell you about it and put my arm around your shoulders the way you told me and held me she said to him thats crazy carmella the cook said but that was the way it had worked out the phone stayed on carmellas side of the bed whenever ketchum called collect carmella always accepted the call and she usually said hello mr ketchum when am i going to get to meet you i would very much like to meet you one day ketchum wasnt very talkativenot to her anyway she would soon pass the phone to dominicgamba she fondly called him but that spring of when the news came about dannys miserable marriagethat awful wife of his the dear boy had deserved betterand thered been more collect calls than usual from up north most of them about that menacing cop ketchum had scared carmella dominic would later think that ketchum probably meant to when shed said the usual to the old woodsmancarmella was about to hand the phone across the bed to dominicketchum said i dont know that you want to meet me ever because it might not be under the best of circumstances that had given carmella quite a chill shed been upset enough with the way things were that spring and now mr ketchum had frightened her and carmella wished that danny was as relieved as she was that katie had left him it was one thing to leave the man you were withcarmella could understand thatbut it was a sin for a mother to walk away from her own child carmella was relieved that katie had left because carmella believed that katie wouldnt have been any kind of mother if shed stayed of course carmella and dominic had never liked katie callahan theyd both seen their share of customers like her in vicino di napoli you can smell the money on her carmella had said to the cook its not exactly on her its under her the cook had commented he meant that the money in katies family was a safety net for the wild girl she could behave in any fashion she wanted because the family money was there to catch her if she fell dominic felt certain as ketchum did that katie callahans socalled free spirit was a fraud danny had misunderstood his dad the boy thought that the cook didnt like katie strictly because the young woman looked like rosie dannys unfaithful mother but katies looks had little to do with what dominic and ketchum didnt like about her it was how she was not like rosie calogero that had bothered them from the beginning katie was nothing but a renegade young woman with a money cushion under her a mere sexual outlaw ketchum had called her whereas rosie had loved both a boy and a man shed been trapped because she had genuinely loved the two of themhence theyd been trapped too by comparison the callahan whore had just been fucking around worse with her highminded politics katie thought she was above such mundanities as marriage and motherhood carmella knew it pained dominic that danny believed his mother had been the same sort of lawless creature katie was though dominic had gone to great lengths to explain the threesome with rosie and ketchum to carmella she had to confess that she didnt understand it much better than danny did carmella could understand the reason for it happening but not for it continuing the way it had danny didnt get that part of it either carmella also had been mad at her dear gamba for not telling the boy about his mother sooner danny had long been old enough to know the story and it would have been better if his dad had told him before the cat got let out of the bag in that conversation danny had had with mr ketchum carmella had been the one whod answered the phone on that early morning danny called to talk about it secondo she said when she heard his voice on the phone that had been dannys nickname all the years hed worked at vicino di napoli secondo angelo old polcari had first named himliterally second angel all of them had been careful to call him angelo never angelù and around carmella they would shorten the nickname to just plain secondothough carmella herself was so fond of danny that she often spoke of him as her secondo figlio her second son in restaurant language secondo also means second course so it was the name that had stuck but now carmellas secondo angelo was in no mood to speak to her i need to talk to my dad carmella he said ketchum had warned the cook that danny would be calling im sorry cookie that call from ketchum had begun i fucked up on the april morning danny called carmella knew that the young man would be angry at his dad for not telling him all those things of course she heard mostly dominics side of the conversation but she could nevertheless tell how the phone call was goingbadly im sorryi was going to tell you the cook started carmella could hear dannys response to that because he shouted into the phone at his father what were you waiting for maybe for something like this to happen to you so you might understand how difficult it can be with women dominic said there in the bed carmella punched him the this referred to katie leaving of courseas if that relationship which was wrongheaded from the start was at all comparable to what had gone on with rosie and ketchum and why had they lied to the boy about the bear for so long carmella couldnt understand it she certainly didnt expect danny to she lay there listening to the cook tell his son about that night in the cookhouse kitchen when rosie had confessed to sleeping with ketchumand then ketchum had walked through the screen door when all of them were drunk and dominic had hit his old friend with the skillet luckily ketchum had been in enough fights he never entirely believed that there was anyone alive who wouldnt take a swing at him the big mans reactions were ingrained he must have deflected the skillet with a forearm slightly turning the weapon in dominics hand so that only the castiron edge of the frying pan hit himand it hit him in the dead center of his forehead not in the temple where even a partially blocked blow from such a heavy implement might have killed him thered been no doctor in twisted river and there wasnt even a sawmill and a socalled millpond at what would become dead woman dam where there would later be an absolute moron of a doctor rosie had stitched up ketchums forehead on one of the diningroom tables shed used the ultrathin stainlesssteel wire the cook kept on hand for trussing up his chickens and turkeys the cook had sterilized the wire by boiling it first and ketchum had bellowed like a bull moose throughout the process dominic had limped around and around the table while rosie talked to the two of them she was so angry that she was rough with the stitches i wish i was stitching the two of you up she said looking at dominic before telling them both how it was going to be if there is ever another act of violence between the two of you i will leave you bothis that clear enough shed asked them if you promise never to hurt each otherin fact you must always look after each other like good brothersthen i will never leave either of you not until the day i die she told them so you can each have half of me or you can both have none of mein the latter case i take danny with me is everything understood they could tell she was totally serious about it i suppose your mother was too proud to go back to boston when she had the miscarriageand she thought i was too young to be left alone when my mother died carmella heard dominic telling danny rosie must have thought she had to take care of me and of course she knew that i loved her i dont doubt that she loved me too but i was still just a nice boy to her and when she met ketchumwell he was her age ketchum was a man we had no choice but to put up with it danielboth ketchum and i adored her and in her own way i believe she loved the two of us what did jane think of it danny asked his dad because ketchum had said that the injun knew everything well exactly what you would expect jane to think of it his father told him she said all three of us were assholes jane thought we were all taking a terrible chancethe indian said it was a big gamble that any of it would work out i thought so too but your mother wasnt giving us another optionand ketchum was always a bigger gambler than i was you should have told me earlier his son said i know i should have danielim sorry carmella heard the cook say later dominic would tell carmella what danny had said to him then i dont care that much about the bearit was a good story danny said to his dad but theres another thing youre wrong about you told me you suspected that ketchum killed lucky pinette you and jane and half those west dummer kidsthats what you all told me i think ketchum may have killed him daniel i think youre wrong lucky pinette was murdered in his bedin the old boom house on the androscoggin hed had his head bashed in with a stamping hammer when they found himisnt that the story daniel baciagalupo the writer asked his father thats it exactly his dad answered lucky pinettes forehead was indented with the letter h coldblooded murderright dad it sure looked like it daniel then it wasnt ketchum danny told him if ketchum found it so easy to murder lucky pinette in bed why doesnt he just kill carl therere any number of ways ketchum could kill the cowboyif ketchum were a murderer dominic knew that daniel was right maybe the boy really is a writer the cook would say when he told carmella the story because if ketchum were a murderer the cowboy would already be dead ketchum had promised rosie he would look after dominicthey had both promised to look after each otherand under the circumstances what better way to look after dominic was there just kill the cowboyin bed or wherever the woodsman could catch carl napping dont you get it dad danny had asked if pam tells carl everything and the cowboy cant find you or me why wouldnt he go after ketchum hed know that ketchum always knew everythingsixpack will tell him but both father and son knew the answer to that if the cowboy came after ketchum then ketchum would kill himboth ketchum and carl knew that like most men who beat women the cowboy was a coward carl probably wouldnt dare go after ketchum not even with a rifle with a scope the cowboy knew that the logger would be hard to killnot like the cook dad danny asked when are you getting the hell out of boston by the guilty frightened way dominic turned in bed to look at her carmella must have known what the new topic of conversation was they had discussed dominic leaving boston but the cook either couldnt or wouldnt tell carmella when he was going when dominic first told carmella everything he made one point particularly clear if carl ever came after him and the cook had to go on the run again carmella couldnt come with him shed lost her husband and her only child she had been spared just one thingshed not seen them die if carmella went on the run with dominic the cowboy might not kill her too but she would watch the cook get killed i wont allow it dominic had told her if that asshole comes after me i go alone why cant you and danny just tell the police carmella had asked him what happened to jane was an accident cant you make the police understand that carl is crazy and that hes dangerous it was hard to explain to someone who wasnt from coos county in the first place the cowboy was the policeor what passed for the police up there in the second place it wasnt a crime to be crazy and dangerousnot anywhere but especially not in northern new hampshire nor was it much of a crime that carl had buried or otherwise disposed of janes body without telling anyone the point was the cowboy didnt kill herdanny did and the cook had been old enough to know better than to have run away the first time when if hed stayed and simply told the truth to someonewell maybe then it might have worked out or dominic could have just gone back to twisted river with daniel the cook could have bluffed it out as ketchum had wanted him toas young dan also had wanted of course it was too late to change any of that now it was early enough in their relationship when the cook had told carmella all this shed accepted the terms now that she loved him more than a little she regretted what shed agreed to not going with him if dominic had to go would be very hard for her naturally dominic knew he would miss carmellamore than hed missed injun jane maybe not as much as both he and ketchum still missed rosie but the cook knew that carmella was special yet the more he loved carmella the more dead set dominic was against her going with him as carmella lay in bed she thought about the places she could no longer go in the north end first because shed gone there with the fisherman and thenmore painfullybecause she associated specific areas of the neighborhood with those special things shed done with angelù now where would she no longer be able to go when dominic her dear gamba had left her the widow del popolo wondered after angelù drowned carmella took no more walks on parmenter street specifically not in the vicinity of what had been cushmans the elementary school where angelù had gone to the early grades had been torn down in or maybe in carmella couldnt remember in its place there would one day be a library but carmella wouldnt ever walk by that library because shed always been a waitress at vicino di napoliit had been her first job and became her only oneshe was free most mornings when the little kids at cushmans took their school trips in the neighborhood carmella had always volunteered to be one of the parents who went alongjust to help the teachers out therefore she no longer went anywhere near the old north church where she and angelùs class of schoolchildren had been shown the steeple that was restored in by the descendants of paul revere it was an episcopal churchone carmella wouldnt have attended because she was catholicbut it was famous foremost for its role in paul reveres ride enshrined under glass were the bricks from the cell where the pilgrim fathers had been imprisoned in england on two counts could carmella not walk past the mariners house on north square and this was awkward for her because it was so close to vicino di napoli but it was the landmark of the boston port and seamens society dedicated to the service of seafarers the schoolchildren in angelùs class had visited the mariners house but carmella had skipped that school tripafter all shed lost a fisherman at sea it was just plain silly how more innocent connections to the fisherman and angelù haunted her but they did she loved the caffè vittoria but avoided that room with the pictures of rocky marciano because both the fisherman and angelù had admired the heavyweight champion and shed eaten with her husband and son at the grotta azzurra on hanover street where enrico caruso used to eat too now there was no more going there the fisherman had told her that no sailor had ever been mugged on hanover street or ever would be it was a safe walk for even the drunkenmost sailors all the way from the waterfront to the old howard and back in addition to the striptease places there were cheap bars frequented by the sailors and the arcades around scollay square of course this would all change scollay square itself would go but the world carmella had lived in with her drowned husband and drowned son was both sacred and haunted to herthe whole length of hanover street even the scavenging seagulls over the haymarket reminded her of the saturday peoplewatching she had done there with angelù holding her hand now she looked with caution at that restaurant on fleet street where stellas used to be she occasionally ate there with dominic on the nights vicino di napoli was closed they ate at the europeo toodominic usually had the fried calamari but never new yorkstyle hold the red saucei like it just with lemon the cook would say would she no longer be able to eat in these places after her gamba was gone carmella wondered she would certainly have to move into a smaller apartment would it be so hot in the apartment in the summer that she would become like one of those old ladies in the tenement building on charter street they took their chairs out of their apartments so they could sit on the sidewalk where it was cooler those coldwater tenements had been bedecked with streamers for the saints feasts in the summer carmella suddenly recalled angelù as a little boy sitting on the fishermans shoulders hanover street had been closed for a procession it was the feast of san rocco carmella was remembering nowadays she didnt like to watch the processions in giusé polcari had been a young man he remembered the molasses explosion which killed twentyone people in the north endincluding the father of some kid joe polcari had known he wasa boiled to death in a tidal wave of hot molasses old joe had said to danny though the war was over those whod heard the explosion thought the germans were comingthat boston harbor was being bombed or something i saw a whole piano floating in the molasses old polcari told young dan in the kitchen of vicino di napoli was a blackandwhite photograph of nicola sacco and bartolomeo vanzetti the two anarchist immigrants were handcuffed together sacco and vanzetti were sent to the electric chair for the murder of a paymaster and a guard at a shoe company in south braintree old polcariin his final addlebrained dayscouldnt remember all the details but he remembered the protest marches sacco and vanzetti were framed a stool pigeon in the charlestown street jail fingered them and the state of massachusetts gavea the stool pigeon a free ride back to italy old joe had said to danny thered been a procession for sacco and vanzetti that started on hanover street in the north end and went all the way to tremont street where the mounted police had broken up the crowd there were thousands of protesters joe polcari among them if you or your son ever have a problem gamba you tell me giusé polcari said to dominic i knowa some guysthey feexa your problem for you old polcari meant the camorra the neapolitan version of the mafianot that dominic could truly understand the distinction when hed behaved wildly as a kid nunzi had called him her camorrista but it was dominics impression that the mafia was more or less in control of the north end where both the mafia and the camorra were called the black hand when dominic told paul polcari that the cowboy might be coming after him paul said if my dad were alive hed call his camorra buddies but i dont know about those guys i dont know about the mafia either tony molinari told dominic if they do something for you then you owe them i dont want to involve you in my troubles dominic said to them im not asking the mafia to help me or the camorra the crazy cop wont come after carmella will he paul polcari asked the cook i dont knowcarmella bears watching dominic answered well watch her all right molinari said if the cowboy comes here to the restaurantwell weve got knives cleavers wine bottles paul polcari suggested dont even think about it dominic told them if carl comes here looking for me hell be armedhe wouldnt go anywhere without that colt fortyfive on him i know what my dad would say paul polcari said hed say a colt fortyfive isa nothingnot if youve ever tried to geta cozy with one of those women who work as stitchers in the shirt factory even naked they gota needles on em joe polcari meant the leopold morse factory in the old prince macaroni building his son paul said giusé must have banged some tough broad who worked there or hed tried to the three cooks laughed they made an effort to forget about the deputy sheriff up in coos county what else could they do but try to forget about him old polcari had had a hundred jokes like that one about the shirtstitchers do you remember the one about the woman who worked the night shift at the boston sausage and provision company dominic asked paul and tony both chefs roared yeah she worked in the skinlessmeat department paul polcari said she had this sneaky little knife for cutting the skin off the frankfurters molinari remembered she could peela your penis like it was a grape the three cooks shouted almost in unison then carmella came into the restaurant and they stopped laughing more dirty jokes she asked them they were just firing up the pizza oven and waiting for the dough to rise it was late morning but the marinara sauce was already simmering carmella saw how worried they suddenly seemed and they wouldnt look in her eyes you were talking about carl werent you she asked them they were like boys whod been caught beating off maybe you should do what ketchum saysmaybe gamba you should listen to your old friend she said to dominic two months had passed since ketchums warning but the cook still couldnt or wouldnt tell carmella when he was leaving now none of them could look at their beloved gambacorta the cook who limped maybe you should go if youre going carmella said to dominic its almost summer she suddenly announced do cops get summer vacations she asked them it was junevery nearly the last day of school they all knew that was a tough time of year for carmella all at once there was nowhere she could go in the north end the freedfromschool children were everywhere they reminded carmella of her angelù primù her first angel the deputy sheriff had been with sixpack for these slowly passing two months yes it was still a relatively new relationship butas ketchum had pointed outtwo months was a long time for carl to go without whacking a woman the cook couldnt remember a time when one week went by and the cowboy didnt hit injun jane there were things carmella had never told her dear gamba about his beloved daniel how the boy had managed to get laid before he even went off to exeter for example carmella had caught danny doing it with one of her niecesone of those dimattia girls teresas younger sister josie carmella had gone out to work in the restaurant but shed forgotten something and had to go back to the wesley place apartment now she couldnt even remember what it was shed forgotten it was dannys day off from his busboy job he already knew he had a full scholarship to exeter maybe he was celebrating of course carmella knew that josie dimattia was older than danny probably josie had started it and all along dominic had suspected that teresa dimattiaor her friend elena calogero definitely a kissing cousinwould sexually initiate danny why was gamba so worried about that carmella wondered if the boy had had more sexshe meant in those years when he was a student at exeter maybe he wouldnt have become so infatuated with that callahan girl when he went to college and if hed fucked a few more of his kissing cousinscalogeros and saettas or for that matter every female in the dimattia familypossibly he would have knocked up someone a whole lot nicer than katie but because dominic had obsessed about elena calogero and teresa dimattia when carmella came into the apartment and saw danny fucking someone on her bed she first assumed it was teresa who was initiating the frightenedlooking fifteenyearold naturally young dan was frightened because carmella had caught them at it teresa you whore carmella cried she actually called the girl a troiafrom that notorious trojan womanbut the word meant whore of course im josie teresas sister the girl said indignantly she must have been miffed that her aunt didnt recognize her well yes you are carmella replied and what are you doing using our bed danny youve got your own bed you disgraziato jeez yours is bigger josie told her aunt and i hope youre using a condom carmella cried dominic used condoms he didnt mind and carmella preferred it maybe the boy had found his fathers condoms when it came to condoms it was a dumb world carmella knew at barones pharmacy they kept the condoms hidden completely out of sight if kids asked for them the pharmacist would give them shit about it yet any responsible parent who had a kid that age would tell the kid to use a condom where exactly were the kids supposed to get them was it one of your dads condoms carmella asked danny while the boy lay covered by a sheet he looked mortified that shed discovered him the dimattia girl on the other hand hadnt even bothered to cover her breasts she just sat sullenly naked staring at her aunt with defiance are you going to confess this josie carmella asked the girl how are you going to confess this i brought the condomsteresa gave them to me josie said ignoring the larger question of confession now carmella was really angry just what did that troia teresa think she was doing giving her kid sister condoms how many did she give you carmella asked but before the girl could answer carmella asked danny dont you have any homework to do then carmella seemed to realize that she was guilty of a certain hypocrisy in her hasty judgment of teresa shouldnt teresa be thanked for giving her kid sister condoms yet had the condoms enabled josie to seduce secondo jeez do you want me to count them or something josie asked her aunt about the condoms poor danny just looked like he wanted to die carmella would always remember well you kids be carefuli have to go to work carmella told them josie carmella had cried as she walked out of the apartment just before shed slammed the door you wash my sheets you make my bedor ill tell your mother carmella wondered if they had fucked all afternoon and evening and if theyd had enough condoms she was so upset about it she forgot that shed gone back to the apartment because shed forgotten something her dear gamba had wanted his son to be safe from girlsand how the cook had cried when danny went away to exeter yet carmella could never tell him that sending the boy to boarding school hadnt really worked not in the way dominic had hoped dominic had also been overly impressed by the list of the colleges and universities many exeter graduates attended the cook couldnt understand why danny hadnt been a good enough student at the academy to get into one of those ivy league schools the university of new hampshire had been a disappointment to dominic as were his sons grades at exeter but the academy was a very hard school for someone coming from the mickey and danny had demonstrated little aptitude for math and the sciences mainly the boys grades werent great because he wrote all the time mr leary had been right socalled creative writing wasnt valued at exeter but the mechanics of good writing was and there were individual english teachers there whod played the mr leary role for dannythey read the fiction that young baciagalupo showed them they hadnt once suggested a nom de plume either the other thing danny did at exeter was all that insane running he ran crosscountry in the fall and ran on the track teams both winter and spring he hated the required athletics at the school but he liked running he was a distance runner primarily it just went with his body with his slightness he was never very competitive he liked to run as hard and as fast as he could but he didnt care about beating anybody he had never been able to run before going to exeter and you could run yearround there thered been nowhere to run in the north endnot if you liked running any distance and in the great north woods there was nowhere safe to run you would trip over something trying to run in those woods and if you ran on one of the haul roads a logging truck would mow you down or force you off the road the logging companies owned those roads and the asshole truck driversas ketchum called themdrove as if they owned them of course there was also the deer hunting both bow season and the firearm season if you tried running in the woods or on a haul road during deer season some asshole hunter might shoot you or run you through with a hunting arrow when danny wrote ketchum about his running at exeter ketchum wrote the boy back as follows hell danny its a good thing you didnt do all that running around twisted river most places im familiar with in coos county if i see a fella running i assume hes done some dirt and is running away it would be a safe bet to shoot most fellas you see running around here danny loved the indoor track at exeter the thompson cage had a sloped wooden track above a dirt one it was a good place to think about the stories he was imagining he could think very clearly when he ran danny discovered especially when he started to get tired when he left exeter with b grades in english and history and c grades in just about everything else mr carlisle told dominic and carmella that perhaps the boy would be a late bloomer but as a writer to publish a first novel less than a year after he left the iowa workshop was a fairly earlybloomer thing to do of course mr carlisle had been speaking strictly academically and dannys grades at unh were excellent compared to exeter the university of new hampshire had been easy the hard part about durham was meeting katie callahan and everything that had happened with herboth in durham and in iowa city neither carmella nor her dear gamba could talk about that young woman without feeling sick almost poisoned and here you were gamba worried about a few hot italian girls in the north end carmella had once exploded at him what you should have seen coming was that university of new hampshire iceberg a cold cunt ketchum had called katie it was all the writing too dominic had replied to carmella all that damn imagining all the timeit couldnt have been good for daniel youre crazy gamba carmella told him danny didnt make up katie and would you really have wanted him to go to vietnam instead ketchum wouldnt have let that happen dominic told her ketchum wasnt kidding carmella daniel would have become a writer with some missing fingers on his writing hand maybe she didnt want to meet mr ketchum after all carmella found herself thinking the writer daniel baciagalupo received his mfa degree from the iowa writers workshop in june together with his twoyearold son joe the writer left for vermont almost immediately upon his graduation despite his troubles with katie danny had liked iowa city and the writers workshop but iowa was hot in the summer and he wanted to take his time about finding a place to live in putney vermont where windham college was it would also be necessary to set up a proper daycare situation for little joe and to hire a regular babysitter for the boythough perhaps one or two of dannys students at the college would be willing to help out he told only one of his teachers and no one else at iowa about the nomdeplume ideathe writer kurt vonnegut who was a kind man and a good teacher vonnegut also knew about dannys difficulties with katie danny didnt tell mr vonnegut the reason he was considering a pen name just that he was unhappy about it it doesnt matter what your name is vonnegut told him he also told the young writer that family life in coos county dannys first book was one of the best novels hed ever read thats what mattersnot what name you use mr vonnegut said the one criticism the author of slaughterhousefive would make of the young writer was what he called a punctuation problem mr vonnegut didnt like all the semicolons people will probably figure out that you went to collegeyou dont have to try to prove it to them he told danny but the semicolons came from those oldfashioned nineteenthcentury novels that had made daniel baciagalupo want to be a writer in the first place hed seen the titles and the authors names on the novels his mother had left behindthe books his father had bequeathed to ketchum in twisted river danny would be at exeter before he actually read those books but hed paid special attention to those authors therenathaniel hawthorne and herman melville for example they wrote long complicated sentences hawthorne and melville had liked semicolons plus they were new england writers those twothey were dannys favorites and the english novelist thomas hardy naturally appealed to daniel baciagalupo whoeven at twentyfivehad seen his share of what looked like fate to him hed been somewhat alone among his fellow workshop students at iowa in that he loved these older writers far better than most contemporary ones but danny did like kurt vonneguts writing and he liked the man too danny was lucky with the teachers he had for his writing beginning with michael leary youll find someone vonnegut said to danny when they said goodbye in iowa city his teacher probably meant that danny would meet the right woman eventually and kurt vonnegut added maybe capitalism will be kind to you that last thought was the one danny drove back east with maybe capitalism will be kind to us he said several times to little joe en route to vermont you better find a place with a spare room for your dad ketchum had told him when theyd last talked although vermont isnt far enough away from new hampshire not in my opinion couldnt you get a teaching job out west somewhere for christs sake danny had said southern vermont is about the same driving distance from coos county as boston is isnt it and we were far enough away in boston for thirteen years vermont s too closei just know it is ketchum told him but right now its a lot safer for your father than staying in boston i keep telling him danny said i keep telling him too but hes not listening worth shit the woodsman said its because of carmella danny told ketchum hes very attached to her he should take her with himi know shed go if he asked herbut he wont i think carmella is the best thing that ever happened to him dont say that danny ketchum told him you didnt get to know your mother danny kept quiet about that with ketchum he didnt want the old logger to hang up on him well it looks to me like ill just have to haul cookies ass out of boston one way or another ketchum said after there was silence for a while how are you going to do that danny asked him ill put him in a cage if i have to you just find a house in vermont thats big enough danny ill bring your dad to it ketchumyou didnt kill lucky pinette did you of course i didnt ketchum shouted into the phone lucky wasnt worth murdering i sometimes think that carl is worth murdering the writer daniel baciagalupo ventured he just floated that idea out there i find that i keep thinking about it ketchum admitted i wouldnt want you to get caught danny told him thats not the problem im having with it the woodsman said i dont imagine that carl would care if he got caughti mean for killing your dad whats the problem then danny asked i would like him to try to kill me first ketchum answered then i wouldnt have a problem with it it was just as the writer daniel baciagalupo had imagined the conundrum was that although the cowboy was exceedingly stupid he was smart enough to stay alive and hed stopped drinkingthat meant carl wouldnt completely lose control of himself that might have been why he hadnt beaten up sixpack in two whole months or at least he hadnt beaten her enough for her to leave him and tell him what she knew sixpack still drank ketchum knew she could easily and completely lose control of herselfthat was also a problem i worry about something danny told ketchum you havent stopped drinking arent you afraid youll pass out dead drunk and thats when carl will come after you you havent met my dog dannyhes a fine animal i didnt know you had a dog danny said hell when sixpack left me i needed someone to talk to what about that lady you met in the librarythe schoolteacher whos teaching you how to read danny asked the logger she is teaching me but its not a very conversational experience ketchum said youre actually learning to read danny asked yes i amits just slower going than counting coon shit ketchum told him but im aiming to be ready to read that book of yours when its published there was a pause on the phone before ketchum asked hows it going with the nom de plume have you come up with one my pen name is danny angel the writer daniel baciagalupo told ketchum stiffly not daniel your dad is real fond of the daniel i like the angel part ketchum said dad can still call me daniel danny said danny angel is the best i can do ketchum hows that little joe doing ketchum asked he could tell that the young writer was touchy about the nomdeplume subject on the trip back east danny mostly drove at night when little joe was sleeping he would find a motel with a pool and play with joe most of the day danny took a nap in the motel when his twoyearold did then he drove all night again the writer danny angel had lots of time to think as he drove he could think the whole night through but even with his imagination danny couldnt quite see a woodsman like ketchum coming to boston not even danny angel né daniel baciagalupo could have imagined how the fearsome logger would conduct himself there that windham college would turn out to be a funny sort of place wouldnt matter much to danny angel whose first novel family life in coos county would be published to fairly good reviews with modest hardcover sales the young author would sell the paperback rights and he sold the movie rights too though no film was ever made from the bookand the two novels that followed the first would receive more mixed reviews and sell fewer copies novels two and three wouldnt even be published in paperback and there was no interest in the movie rights for either book but all of that wouldnt matter much to danny who was consumed by the task of keeping his father from harmall the while trying to be a good dad to joe danny just kept writing and writing he would need to keep teaching to support himself and his young sonall the while saying to little joe maybe capitalism will be kind to us one day it hadnt been too tough to find a house to rent in putney one big enough to include his fatherand carmella if she ever came to vermont it was a former farmhouse on a dirt road which danny liked because a brook ran alongside it the road also crossed the brook in a couple of places the running water was a reminder to daniel baciagalupo of where hed come from as for the farmhouse it was a few miles from the village of putney which was little more than a general store and a grocerycalled the putney food coopand a convenience store with a gas station that was diagonally across from the old paper mill on the road to the college when danny first saw the paper mill he knew that his dad wouldnt like living in putney the cook came from berlin he hated paper mills windham college was an architectural eyesore on an otherwise beautiful piece of land the faculty were a mix of moderately distinguished and notsodistinguished professors windham had no academic virtues to speak of but some of its faculty were actually good teachers who could have been working at better colleges and universities but they wanted to live in vermont many of the male students might not have been attending college at all if there hadnt been a war in vietnam four years of college was the most widely available deferment from military service that young males of draft age had windham was that kind of placenot long for this world but it would last as long as the war dragged onand as the source of dannys first notinarestaurant job it wasnt bad danny wouldnt have many students who were genuinely interested in writing and the few he had werent talented or hardworking enough to suit him at windham you were lucky if half the students in your classroom were interested in reading but as a first novelist whod been saved from the vietnam war which daniel baciagalupo knew was his case he was a lenient teacher danny wanted everyonehis male students especiallyto stay in school if as some cynics said windham s sole justification for existence was that it managed to prevent a few young men from going to vietnam that was okay with danny angel hed grown up enough politically to hate the war and he was more of a writer than a teacher danny didnt really care how academically responsible or not windham college was the teaching was just a job to himone that gave him enough time to write and to be a good father danny let ketchum know as soon as he and joe had moved into the old farmhouse on hickory ridge road danny didnt care who was reading the loggers letters to him now the young writer assumed it was the library lady the schoolteacher whose workinprogress was teaching ketchum how to read theres plenty of room for dad danny wrote to the woodsman the writer included his new phone number and directions to the putney house from both coos county and boston it was nearly the end of june maybe youll show up for the fourth of july danny wrote to ketchum if so i trust you to bring the fireworks ketchum was a big fireworks fan thered once been a fish he couldnt catch i swear its the biggest damn trout in phillips brook hed declared and the smartest hed blown up the fish and no small number of nearby brook trout with dynamite dont bring any dynamite danny had added as a postscript just the fireworks it wasnt principally fireworks that ketchum brought to boston the first leg of his trip the north station was in that part of the west end that bordered on the north end ketchum got off the train carrying a shotgun over one shoulder and a canvas duffel bag in the other hand the duffel bag looked heavy but not the way ketchum was toting it the gun was in a leather carrying case but it was clear to everyone who saw the woodsman what the weapon wasit had to be either a rifle or a shotgun the way the carrying case was tapered you could tell that ketchum was holding the barrel of the weapon with the buttend over his shoulder the kid who was then the busboy at vicino di napoli had just put his grandmother on a train he saw ketchum and ran ahead of him back to the restaurant the busboy said it appeared that ketchum was taking the long way aroundmeaning that the logger must have looked at a map and hed chosen the most obvious route which was not necessarily the fastest ketchum must have come along causeway street to prince street and then intersected with hanovera kind of roundabout way to get to north square where the restaurant was but the busboy alerted them all that the big man with a gun was coming which big man dominic asked the busboy i just know hes got a gunhes carrying it over his shoulder the busboy said everyone who worked at vicino di napoli had been forewarned that the cowboy might be coming and hes definitely from up northhes fucking scarylooking dominic knew that carl would have the colt concealed it was big for a handgun but no one carried a revolver over his shoulder it sounds like you mean a rifle or a shotgun the cook said to the busboy jesus and mary tony molinari said hes got a scar on his forehead like someone split his face with a cleaver the busboy cried is it mr ketchum carmella asked dominic it must be the cook told her it cant be the cowboy carl is big and fat but hes not especially scarylooking and theres not much of the north country about him he just looks like a copeither in or out of uniform the busboy was still babbling hes wearing a flannel shirt with the sleeves cut off and hes got a huge hunting knife on his beltit hangs almost to his knee that would be the browning dominic said its definitely ketchum in the summer he just cuts the sleeves off his old flannel shirtsthe ones that have torn sleeves anyway whats the gun for carmella asked her dear gamba maybe hes going to shoot me before carl gets a chance to dominic said but carmella didnt see the humor in itnone of them did they went to the door and windows to look for ketchum it was that time of the afternoon they had to themselves they were supposed to be eating their big meal of the day before they started the dinner service im setting a place for mr ketchum carmella said and she started to do so the two younger waitresses were checking themselves out in a mirror paul polcari held a pizza paddle in both hands it was the size of a giant tennis racquet put the paddle down paul molinari told him you look ridiculous theres a lot of stuff in the duffel bag hes carryingammunition maybe the busboy said dynamite possibly the cook said the way the man looks someone might arrest him before he gets here the busboy told them all why did he come why didnt he call first carmella asked her gamba the cook shook his head they would all just have to wait and see what ketchum wanted hes coming to take you gamba isnt he carmella asked the cook probably dominic answered even so carmella smoothed the little white apron over her black skirt she unlocked the door and waited there someone should greet mr ketchum she was thinking what will i do in vermont the cook thought to himself who cares about eating italian there ketchum would waste little time with them i know who you are he told carmella pleasantly your boy showed me your picture and you havent changed much she had changed in the thirteenplus years since that wallet photo had been takenshe was at least twenty pounds heavier they all knewbut carmella appreciated the compliment are you all here ketchum asked them or is someone in the kitchen were all here ketchum the cook told his old friend well i can see you are cookie ketchum said and from your disapproving expression you dont look too happy to see me ketchum didnt wait for a response he just walked into the back of the kitchen until they couldnt see him can you see me he called to them they hollered noall but the cook well i can still see youthis is perfect ketchum told them when he came out of the kitchen he had the shotgun out of its carrying case to a one the cook included they recoiled from it the gun had a foreign smellthe gun oil maybe and the oilstained leather casebut there was another smell something truly foreign even to cooks even in a restaurants dining room and kitchen maybe the smell was death because guns are designed to do just one thingkill this here is an ithaca twentygaugea single shot no safety its as sweet and simple as a shotgun comes ketchum told them even a child can shoot it he broke open the shotgun allowing the barrel to fall almost to a fortyfivedegree angle theres no safety because you have to cock it with your thumb before itll firetheres no halfcock either the woodsman was saying they watched fascinatedall but dominic everything ketchum said about the gun made no sense to them but ketchum kept patiently repeating himself he showed them how to load it and how to take out the empty shellhe showed them again and again until even the busboy and the young waitresses could have done it it broke the cooks heart to see the rapt attention carmella gave to the old logger even carmella could have loaded and fired the damn shotgun by the time ketchum had finished they didnt really comprehend the gravity of the demonstration until ketchum got to the part about the two kinds of ammunition this here is buckshot you keep the ithaca loaded at all times with buckshot ketchum held up a big hand in front of paul polcaris flourwhitened face from back there where i was standing in the kitchen the buckshot would make a pattern about this size on a target standing here they were getting the idea you just have to see how it goes if carl is believing your storyand you all have to tell the cowboy the same storymaybe hell leave without incident no shots need to be fired ketchum was saying what story is that the cook asked his old friend well its about how you walked out on this lady ketchum said indicating carmella not that even a fool would mind youbut thats what you did and everyone here hates you for it they would like to kill you themselves if they could find you do any of you have trouble remembering that story ketchum asked them they shook their headseven the cook but for a different reason just so theres one of you back in the kitchen ketchum continued i dont care if the cowboy knows youre back therejust so he cant quite see you you can be banging pots and pans around all you want to if carl asks to see you and he will just tell him youre busy cooking which one of us should be back in the kitchen with the gun paul polcari asked the woodsman it doesnt matter which one of you is back therejust so you all know how to work the ithaca ketchum answered you know carl will come here i suppose dominic asked him its inevitable cookie hell want to talk to carmella most of all but hell come here to talk to everyone if he doesnt believe your story and theres any troublethats when one of you shoots him ketchum said to them all how will we know theres going to be trouble tony molinari asked how will we know if he believes our story well you wont see the colt fortyfive ketchum answered believe me hell have it on him but you wont know theres going to be trouble until you see the weapon when carl lets you see the colt he intends to use it then we shoot him paul polcari asked whoevers in the kitchen should call out to him first ketchum told them you just say something like hey cowboyjust so he looks at you it would seem to me molinari said that wed have a better chance just to shoot himi mean before hes looking in the direction of the shooter no not really ketchum told him patiently if the cowboy is looking in your direction assuming you take aim at his throat youll hit him in the face and chestbothand youll probably blind him the cook looked at carmella because he thought she might faint the busboy appeared to be feeling sick when the cowboy is blind you dont have to be in as big a hurrywhen you take the empty shell out and put the deer slug in the buckshot blinds him but the deer slug is the killshot ketchum explained to them first you blind him then you kill him the busboy dashed for the kitchen they could hear him barfing in the overlarge sink the dishwasher used to scour pots and pans maybe hes not the one to be back in the kitchen ketchum said softly to the others hell we used to jacklight deer in coos county just like this shine the light on them till the deer stared right at you first the buckshot then the deer slug but here the woodsman paused before continuing well with a deerif youre close enoughthe buckshot will suffice with the cowboy we dont want to take any unnecessary chances i dont think we can kill anybody mr ketchum carmella said we simply dont know how to do that i just showed you how ketchum told her that little ithaca is the simplest gun i own i won it in an armwrestling match in milan you remember dont you cookie i remember the cook told his old friend it had turned into something more serious than an armwrestling match as dominic remembered it but ketchum had walked away with the singleshot ithaca there was no disputing that hell just work on your story ketchum told them if the story is good enough maybe you wont have to shoot the bastard did you come all this way just to bring us the gun the cook asked his old friend i brought the ithaca for them cookieits for your friends not for you i came to help you pack weve got a little traveling to do dominic reached back for carmellas handhe knew she was standing behind himbut carmella was quicker she wrapped her arms around her gambas waist and burrowed her face into the back of his neck i love you but i want you to go with mr ketchum she told the cook i know dominic told her he knew better than to resist her or ketchum what else is in the duffel bag the busboy asked the logger the kid had come out of the kitchen and was looking a little better fireworksfor the fourth of july ketchum said danny asked me to bring them he told dominic carmella went with them to the walkup on wesley place the cook didnt pack many things but he took the eightinch castiron skillet off the hook in their bedroom carmella supposed that the skillet was mostly symbolic she walked with them to the carrental place they would drive the rental car to vermont and ketchum would bring the car back to boston then he would take the train back to new hampshire from north station ketchum hadnt wanted his truck to be missing for a few days he didnt want the deputy sheriff to know he was away besides he needed a new truck ketchum told them with all the driving he and dominic had to do ketchums truck might not have made it for thirteen years carmella had been hoping to meet mr ketchum now shed met him and his violence she could see in an instant what her angelù had admired about the man andwhen ketchum had been youngercarmella could easily imagine how rosie calogero or any woman her age might have fallen in love with him but now she hated ketchum for coming to the north end and taking her gamba away she would even miss the cooks limp she told herself then mr ketchum said something to her and it completely won her over if one day you ever want to see the place where your boy perished i would be honored to show you ketchum said to her carmella had to fight back tears she had so wanted to see the river basin where the accident happened but not the logs she knew the logs would be too much for her just the riverbank where the cook and young dan had stood and seen it happenand maybe the exact spot in the wateryes she might one day want to see that thank you mr ketchum carmella said to him she watched them get into the car ketchum of course was the driver if you ever want to see me carmella started to say to dominic i know the cook said to her but he wouldnt look at her compared to the day her gamba left the day carl came to vicino di napoli was almost easy for carmella it had again been at the time of their midafternoon meal and it was nearly the end of that summersometime in august when theyd all started to imagine or hope that the cowboy wasnt ever coming carmella saw the cop first it was just as gamba had told her when carl was out of uniform he still looked like he was wearing one of course ketchum had remarked on the jowls and the way the cowboys neck was bunched in folds maybe all cops have bad haircuts ketchum had said to her someone go back in the kitchen carmella said standing up from the table the door was locked and she went to unlock it it was paul polcari who went back in the kitchen the second the cowboy came inside carmella found herself wishing it had been molinari back there you would be the del popolo woman the deputy sheriff asked her he showed them all his badge while saying massachusetts is out of my jurisdictionactually everythin outside coos county is out of my jurisdictionbut im lookin for a fella i think you all know hes got some answerin to doname of dominic a little guy with a limp carmella started to cry she cried easily but in this case she had to force herself that prick molinari said if i knew where he was id kill him me too paul polcari cried from the kitchen can you come out of there the deputy called to paul i like to see everyone im busy cooking paul screamed pots and pans were banging the cowboy sighed they all remembered how the cook and ketchum had described carl theyd said the cop never stopped smiling but it was the most insincere smile in the world look the cowboy said to them i dont know what the cooks done to you but hes got some explainin to do to me he walked out on her molinari said pointing to carmella he stole her jewels the busboy cried the kid is an idiot the others thought even the cop might be smart enough to know that carmella wasnt the sort of woman who had jewels i didnt figure cookie for a jewel thief carl said are you people bein honest with me you really dont know where he is no one of the young waitresses cried out as if her companion waitress had stabbed her that prick molinari repeated what about you the cowboy called into the kitchen paul seemed to have lost his voice when the pots and pans commenced to banging again the others took this as a signal to move a little bit away from the cop ketchum had told them not to scatter like a bunch of chickens but to get some necessary separation between the cowboy and themselvesjust to give the shooter a decent shot at the bastard if i knew where he was i would cook him paul polcari shouted he held the ithaca in his heavily floured hands which were shaking he sighted down the barrel till he found the cowboys throatwhat he could manage to see of it under carls multiple chins can you come out of there where i can see you the cop called to paul squinting into the kitchen wops the cowboy muttered that was when tony molinari got a glimpse of the colt carl had put his hand inside his jacket and molinari saw the big holster that was awkwardly at an angle under the deputys armpit the fat mans fingers just grazing the grip of the longbarreled handgun the handle of the colt was inlaid with what looked like bone it was probably deer antler for christs sake paul molinari was thinking the cowboys already looking at youjust shoot him to her surprise carmella was thinking the same thingjust shoot him she had all she could do not to cover both ears with her hands paul polcari just wasnt the one for the job the pizza chef was a sweet gentle man now he found that his throat felt as if a cup of flour had clogged it he was trying to say hey cowboy the words wouldnt come and the cowboy kept squinting into the kitchen paul polcari knew that he didnt have to say anything he could just pull the trigger and carl would be blinded but paul couldntmore to the point he didntdo it well shit the deputy sheriff said he was moving sideways toward the restaurant door molinari was worried because the cowboy was out of sight from pauls spot in the back of the kitchen then carl reached inside his jacket again and they all froze here comes the colt molinari was thinking but now they saw it was just a small card that the cowboy had pulled out of his pocket he handed it to carmella call me if that little cripple calls you carl said to her he was still smiling from the sound of the pots and pans falling in the kitchen molinari imagined that paul polcari had passed out back there it should have been you in the kitchen tony carmella told molinari later but i cant blame poor paul paul polcari would blame himself however he would never shut up about it it took tony molinari almost an hour to clean the ithaca of all the flour too but the cowboy wouldnt come back maybe just having the gun in the kitchen had helped as for the story ketchum had told them to stick to carl must have believed it when their ordeal was over carmella cried and cried theyd all assumed she was crying from the terrible tension of the moment but her gamba leaving had hurt her more carmella was crying because she knew that her gambas ordeal was not over contrary to what she had said to ketchum she would have fired the ithaca herself if shed been back in the kitchen one look at the cowboyand as ketchum had forewarned her the way hed looked at herhad convinced carmella that she could have pulled the trigger but that chance wouldnt come to her or to any of them again in truth carmella del popolo would miss dominic more than she ever did the fisherman and she would miss secondo too she knew about that hole the boy had bored in his bedroom door in the coldwater charter street apartment maybe she bathed more modestly after she knew about the hole but carmella had let young dan see her nonetheless with the fisherman dead and angelù gone thered been no one to look at her for too long when dominic and danny came into her life carmella didnt really mind that the twelveyearold watched her in the bathtub in the kitchen she only worried what an influence the sight of her might have on the boy later on carmella didnt mean on dannys writing of all the people who were surprised puzzled disappointed or indifferent regarding what the writer daniel baciagalupo would choose for a nom de plume carmella del popolo was without a doubt the most pleased for when family life in coos county by danny angel was published carmella was sure that secondo had always known he was her surrogate sonjust as surely as everyone in vicino di napoli knew carmella most of all that absolutely no one could replace her cherished but departed angelù iii windham county vermont chapter benevento and avellino the building was old and much abused by its proximity to the connecticut river a few of the apartments had been abused too but not exclusively by the river back in the sixties a couple of windham college kids had made a mess of one of them once cheap the apartments were slightly more expensive now the connecticut had been cleaned up and the town of brattleboro was much improved by it the cooks secondfloor apartment was in the back of the old main street building overlooking the river most mornings dominic would go downstairs to his empty restaurant and the deserted kitchen to make himself some espresso the kitchen was also in the back with a good view of the river on the ground floor there had always been a storefront or some kind of restaurant on the main street side of the weatherbeaten apartment building which was across the street from an armynavy clothing store and the local movie theater known as the latchis if you walked down the hill on main street past the latchis you would come to canal street and the market where the cook did most of his shopping from there heading out of town you could find your way to the hospital and a shopping malland out by interstate a bunch of gas stations and the usual fastfood places if you walked north on main street up the hill you came to the book cellarquite a good bookstore where the nowfamous author danny angel had done a reading or two and his share of book signings the cook had met a couple of his vermont lady friends in the book cellar where they all knew dominic del popolo né baciagalupo as mr angelthe celebrated novelists father and the ownerchef of the best italian restaurant around after daniel chose that nom de plume dominic had had to rename himself too shit i suppose you should both be angelsmaybe that much is clear ketchum had said like father like sonand all that goes with that but ketchum had insisted that the cook lose the dominic too how about tony danny had suggested to his dad it was the fourth of july and ketchum had nearly burned down the putney farmhouse with his fireworks display little joe continued to scream for five minutes after the last cherry bomb went off the name tony still sounded italian but was nicely anonymous danny was thinking while dominic liked the name because of his fondness for tony molinari only a few nights away from boston the cook already knew how much he was going to miss molinari tony angel previously dominic del popolo previously bacigalupo would miss paul polcari toonor would the cook think any less of paul when he heard about what happened in august of that same summer tony angel would blame ketchum for the mishap of the cowboy getting out of vicino di napoli alivenot paul polcari poor paul could never have squeezed the trigger it was ketchums fault in the cooks opinion because ketchum had told them all that it didnt matter which one of them was back in the kitchen with the shotgun come on for someone who knew guns as well as ketchum did he should have known that of course it mattered who was taking aim and would or would not pull the trigger tony angel would never blame sweet gentle paul you blame ketchum too much for everything danny would tell his dad more than once but that was just the way it was if molinari had been back in the kitchen dominic del popolo would have changed his name back to dominic baciagalupoand he would have gone back to boston to carmella the cook would never have had to become tony angel and the writer danny angel whose fourth novel was his first bestsellernow in his fifth novel had already been translated into more than thirty foreign languageswould have gone back to calling himself as he dearly wanted to daniel baciagalupo damn it ketchum the cook had said to his old friend if carmella had been back in the kitchen with your blessed ithaca she would have shot carl twice while he was still squinting at her if the idiot busboy had been back there i swear he would have pulled that trigger im sorry cookie they were your friendsi didnt know them you should have told me there was a nonshootera fucking pacifistamong them stop blaming each other danny would tell them repeatedly after all it had been sixteen yearsor it would be this coming augustsince paul polcari failed to pull the trigger of ketchums singleshot gauge it had all worked out hadnt it the cook was thinking as he sipped his espresso and watched the connecticut river run by his kitchen window they had once run logs down the connecticut in the dining room of the restaurant which looked out upon main street and the marquee with the name of whatever movie was currently playing at the latchis theatre the cook had framed a big blackandwhite photograph of a logjam in brattleboro the photo had been taken years ago of course they werent moving logs over water in vermont or new hampshire anymore river driving had lasted longer in maine which was why ketchum had worked so much in maine in the sixties and seventies but the last river drive in maine was in from moosehead lake down the kennebec river naturally ketchum had been in the thick of it hed called the cook collect from some bar in bath maine not far from the mouth of the kennebec im trying to distract myself from some asshole shipyard worker who is sorely tempting me to cause him a little bodily harm ketchum began just remember youre an outofstater ketchum the local authorities will take the side of the shipyard worker christ cookiedo you know what it costs to move logs over water i mean getting them from where you cut them to the millabout fifteen fucking cents a cord thats all a river drive will cost you the cook had heard this argument too many times i could hang up tony angel thought but he stayed on the phoneperhaps out of pity for the shipyard worker itll cost you six or seven dollars a cord to get logs to the mill over land ketchum shouted most roads in northern new england arent worth shit to begin with and now therell be nothing but asshole truck drivers on them you may think its already a world of accidents cookie but imagine an overloaded logging truck tipping over and crushing a carload of skiers ketchum had been right thered been some terrible accidents involving logging trucks in northern new england it used to be that you could drive all over the placeaccording to ketchum only a moose or a drunken driver could kill you now the trucks were on the big roads and the little ones the asshole truck drivers were everywhere this asshole country ketchum had bellowed into the phone itll always find a way to make something that was cheap expensive and to take a bunch of jobs away from fellas in the process there was an abrupt end to their conversation in that bar in bath the sounds of an argument rose indistinctly a violent scuffle ensued no doubt somebody in the bar had objected to ketchum defaming the entire countryin all likelihood the aforementioned asshole shipyard worker some asshole patriot ketchum later called the fella the cook liked listening to the radio when he started his pizza dough in the morning nunzi had taught him to always let a pizza dough rise twice perhaps this was a silly habit but hed stuck to it paul polcari a superb pizza chef had told tony angel that two rises were better than one but that the second rise wasnt absolutely necessary in the cookhouse kitchen in twisted river the cooks pizza dough had lacked one ingredient he now believed was essential long ago hed said to those fat sawmill workers wivesdot and may those bad old broadsthat he thought his crust could stand to be sweeter dot the one whod tricked him into feeling her up said youre crazy cookieyou make the best pizza crust ive ever eaten maybe it needs honey the then dominic baciagalupo had told her but it turned out that he was out of honey hed tried adding a little maple syrup instead that was a bad ideayou could taste the maple then hed forgotten about the honey idea until may reminded him shed bumped him on purpose with her big hip while handing him the honey jar the cook had never forgiven may for her remark about injun janewhen shed said that dot and herself werent injun enough to satisfy him here cookie may had said its honey for your pizza dough i changed my mind about it he told her but the only reason he hadnt tried putting honey in his dough was that he didnt want to give may the satisfaction it was in the kitchen at vicino di napoli where paul polcari first showed tony angel his pizzadough recipe in addition to the flour and water and the yeast nunzi had always added a little olive oil to the doughnot more than a tablespoon or two per pizza paul had shown the cook how to add an amount of honey about equal to the oil the oil made the dough silkyyou could bake the crust when it was thin without its becoming too dry and brittle the honeyas the cook himself had nearly discovered back in twisted rivermade the crust a little sweet but you never tasted the honey part tony angel rarely started a pizza dough without remembering how hed almost invented the honey part of his recipe the cook hadnt thought of big dot and even bigger may in years he was fiftynine that morning he thought of them in his brattleboro kitchen how old would those old bitches be tony angel wondered surely theyd be in their sixties he remembered that may had a slew of grandchildrensome of them the same age as her children with her second husband then the radio distracted tony from his thoughts he missed what he imagined as the dominic in himself and the radio reminded him of all he missed it had been better back in boston both the radio station theyd listened to in vicino di napoli and the music the music had been awful in the fifties the cook thought and then it got so unbelievably good in the sixties and seventies now it was borderline awful again he liked george strait amarillo by morning and you look so good in lovebut this very day theyd played two michael jackson songs in a row billie jean and beat it tony angel detested michael jackson the cook believed it was beneath paul mccartney to have done the girl is mine with jackson they had played that song too earlier in the morning now it was duran duran on the radiohungry like the wolf the music really had been better in boston in the sixties even old joe polcari had sung along with bob dylan paul polcari would bang on the pasta pot to i cant get no satisfaction and in addition to the rolling stones and all the dylan there were simon and garfunkel and the beatles tony imagined he could still hear how carmella sang the sound of silence they had danced together in the kitchen at vicino di napoli to eight days a week and ticket to ride and we can work it out and dont forget thered been penny lane and strawberry fields forever the beatles had changed everything the cook shut off the radio in his brattleboro kitchen he tried to sing all you need is love to himself instead of listening to the radio but neither dominic del popolo né baciagalupo nor tony angel had ever been able to sing and it wasnt long before that beatles song began to resemble a song by the doors light my fire which gave the cook a most unwelcome memory of his former daughterinlaw katie shed been a big fan of the doors and the grateful dead and jefferson airplane the cook kind of liked the doors and the dead but katie had done a grace slick impersonation that made it impossible for tony angel to like jefferson airplanesomebody to love and white rabbit especially he remembered that time just before daniel and his wife and the baby had left for iowa when daniel brought joe to boston to stay with the cook and carmella daniel and katie were going to a beatles concert at shea stadium in new york someone in katies ladida family had gotten her the tickets it was august over fifty thousand people had attended that concert carmella loved taking care of little joehed been a march baby like his father so the boy had been only five months old at the timebut both katie and daniel were drunk when they came to the north end to pick up their baby they must have been smashed when they left new york and theyd driven drunk the whole way to boston dominic would not let them take joe youre not driving back to new hampshire with the babynot in your condition the cook told his son that was when katie did her sluttish swaying and singingvamping her way through somebody to love and white rabbit neither carmella nor the cook could bear to look at grace slick after katies lewd provocative performance come on dad danny said to his father were fine to drive let little joe come with uswe cant all sleep in this apartment youll just have to daniel his father told him joe can sleep in our room with carmella and me and you and katie will just have to find a way to fit in the single bed in your roomneither one of you is a large person the cook reminded the young couple danny was angry but he held his temper it was katie who behaved badly she went into the bathroom and peed with the door openthey could all hear her daniel gave his dad a look that said well what did you expect carmella went into her bedroom and closed the door little joe was already asleep in there when katie came out of the bathroom she was naked katie spoke to danny as if her fatherinlaw werent there come on if we have to do it in a single bed lets get started of course the cook knew that his son and katie didnt really have noisy sex then and there but thats what katie wanted dannys dad and carmella to believe she carried on like she was having an orgasm every minute both danny and his wife were so drunk that they slept right through little joes nightmare later that night the cook and his son didnt speak to each other when daniel left with his wife and child the next day carmella didnt look at katie but shortly before the wouldbe writer daniel baciagalupo took his family to iowa the cook had called his son if you keep drinking the way you are you wont write anything worth reading the next day you wont even remember what you wrote the day before the young writers father told him i stopped drinking because i couldnt handle it daniel well maybe its geneticmaybe you cant handle drinking either tony angel didnt know what had happened to his son in iowa city but something had made daniel stop drinking tony didnt really want to know what had happened to his beloved boy in iowa because the cook was certain that katie had had something to do with it when he finished with the pizza doughthe dough was having its first rise in the big bowls the cook covered with damp dish towelstony angel limped up main street to the book cellar he was fond of the young woman who ran the bookstore she was always nice to him and she often ate in his restaurant tony would buy her a bottle of wine on occasion he cracked the same joke whenever he came into the book cellar have you got any women to introduce to me today tony always asked her someone about my ageor a little younger maybe the cook really liked brattleboro and having his own restaurant he had hated vermont those first few yearsbetter said it was putney hed hated putney had an alternative style about it putney is an alternative to a town the cook now liked to say to people tony had missed the north endsomething wicked as ketchum would sayand putney was full of selfadvertising hippies and other dropouts there was even a commune a few miles out of town the name of it had the word clover in it but tony couldnt remember what the rest of it was he believed it was a womenonly commune which led the cook to suspect they were all lesbians and the butcher in the putney food coop kept cutting herself or himself cutting yourself wasnt what a butcher was supposed to do and tony thought the butchers sex was indeterminable for gods sake dad the butcher is clearly a woman danny told his father with exasperation you say she is but have you taken all her clothes offjust to be sure his dad asked him yet tony angel had opened his own pizza place in putney and despite the cooks constant complaints about windham collegeit didnt look like a real college to him never mind that hed not been to college and all the college kids were assholesthe pizza place did very well largely because of the windham students constipated christ dont call it angels pizzaor anything with the angel name in it ketchum had told the cook in retrospect ketchum had grown increasingly uncomfortable with danny and his father choosing the name angelin case carl ever remembered that the death of the original angel had been coincident with the cook and his son leaving town in the first place as for little joes name danny had chosen it though hed wanted to name his son after his daddominic jr katie hadnt liked either the dominic or the junior but danny had refused to give little joe the writers nom de plume joe had remained a baciagalupo the boy didnt become an angel both danny and the cook remembered that carl hadnt been able to pronounce baciagalupo they told ketchum it was unlikely the cowboy could spell it eithernot even to save his own fat ass so what if joe was still a baciagalupo ketchum just had to live with it and now ketchum kept complaining about the angel name the cook often dreamed of that asshole gennaro capodilupo his runaway father tony angel could still hear the names of those two hill towns which were also provinces in the vicinity of naples those words his mother nunzi had murmured in her sleep benevento and avellino tony believed that his father really had gone back to the vicinity of naples where hed come from but the truth was the cook didnt care when someone abandons you why should you care and dont get cute and call the pizza place vicinity of naples ketchum had told the cook i know the cowboy doesnt speak italian but any fool might one day figure out that vicino di napoli or however the fuck you say it means in the vicinity of naples so the cook had called his putney pizza place benevento it was always the first of the two towns or provinces annunziata had uttered in her sleep and no one but tony angel had heard his mother say it the goddamn cowboy couldnt possibly come up with any connections to benevento shit it sure sounds italianill give you that cookie ketchum had said the putney pizza place had been right on route just before the fork in the center of town where route continued north past the paper mill and a tourist trap called basketville windham college was a little farther north up route the lefthand fork where the putney general store wasand the putney food coop with the selflacerating butcher of indeterminable sexwent off in the direction of westminster west out that way was the putney schoola prep school danny disdained because he thought it wasnt up to exeters standardsand on hickory ridge road where the writer danny angel still lived there was an independent elementary school called the grammar school which had been very much up to dannys standards hed sent joe there and the boy had done well enough to get into northfield mount hermona prep school danny did approve of nmh as the school was called was about half an hour south of brattleboro in massachusettsand an hours drive from dannys property in putney joe who was a senior in the spring of saw quite a lot of his dad and his grandfather in his brattleboro apartment the cook had a guest bedroom that was always ready for his grandson tony had torn out the kitchen in that apartment but hed kept the plumbing intact he had built quite a spacious bathroom which overlooked the connecticut the bathtub was big and reminded the cook of the one carmella had had in her kitchen in that coldwater charter street apartment tony still didnt know for certain that daniel had spied on carmella in that bathtub but hed read all five of his sons novels and in one of them theres a lusciouslooking italian woman who luxuriates in taking long baths the womans stepson is of an age where hes just beginning to masturbate and the boy beats off while watching his stepmother bathe the clever kid bores a hole in the bathroom wall his bedroom is conveniently next to the bathroom while there were these little details of a recognizable kind in danny angels novels the cook more often noticed things that he was sure his son must have made up if carmella had put in an identifiable bathtub appearance the character of the stepmother in that novel was definitely not based on carmella nor could the cook find any but the most superficial elements of himself in daniels novels or much of ketchum a minor characters broken wrist is mentioned in passing in one novel and theres a different characters penchant for saying constipated christ in another both ketchum and tony angel had talked about the absence of anyone in the novels who revealed to them their quintessential and beloved daniel where is that boy hiding himself ketchum had asked the cook because even in danny angels fourth and most famous novel which was titled the kennedy fathers the main characterwho escapes the war in vietnam with the same paternity deferment that kept danny out of the warbears little essential resemblance to the daniel that ketchum and the cook knew and loved there was a character based on katie in the kennedy fatherscaitlin danny angel named hera little sprite of a thing with a disproportionately oversize capacity for serial infidelities she saves a truly hardtobelieve number of kennedy fathers from the vietnam war the caitlin character races through numerous husbands with the same casual frankness both the cook and ketchum associated with the way katie probably gave blow jobsyet caitlin wasnt katie shes way too nice tony angel told his old friend ill say she is ketchum agreed you even end up liking her all her husbands end up liking caitlin tooor they cant get over her if that amounts to the same thing and all those babies who are born and get abandoned by their motherwell we never find out what they think of their mother the novel concludes when president nixon puts an end to the a deferment while the war will drag on for five more years and the caitlin character just kind of disappears she is a lost soul in the last chapter of the kennedy fathers theres something that doesnt bode well about how she phones all her husbands and asks to speak to her kids who have no memory of her thats the last we hear about caitlinits a sympathetic moment ketchum and the cook knew very well that katie had not once called daniel and asked to speak to joe it seemed that she simply hadnt cared enough about them to even inquire how they were doing though ketchum always said that danny might hear from katie if he ever became famous when the kennedy fathers was published and danny did become famous he still didnt hear from katie he did however hear from a few other kennedy fathers most of the letters about the novel were favorable danny believed there was some shared guilt among such fathers whod all felt at one time in their lives that they probably should have gone to vietnam or like danny theyd actually wanted to go now of course they all knew they were lucky that they hadnt gone to the war the novel was praised for seeing yet another dimension of how the war in vietnam did permanent damage to america and how the country would long be divided by that war the young fathers in the novel might or might not turn out to be good fathers and it was too soon to say if those childrenthose tickets out of vietnam as danny called themwould be damaged most reviewers thought that caitlin was the novels most memorable character and the real hero of the story she sacrifices herself to save these young mens lives even though she leaves themand quite possibly her own childrenfeeling haunted but the novel really pissed off ketchum and the cook they had hoped to read a hatchet job on katie but danny didnt do that instead hed turned his awful exwife into a fucking hero one letter danny received from a kennedy father was worth saving and he would show it to his sonthis was several years after the kennedy fathers was first published in the spring of joes junior year at northfield mount hermon when the boy had been driving for only a year and had just turned seventeen at young joes suggestion danny also showed the letter to his dad and ketchum while danny and joe had talked about the letterboth about what it meant and what it didnt sayketchum and the cook were careful in their responses to danny the older men knew that dannys feelings for katie were a little different from theirs the letter was from a selfdescribed single parent living in portland oregon a man named jeff reese the letter began like you i am a kennedy fatherone of the stupid boys katie callahan saved im not sure how many of us there are i know of at least one otheri mean in addition to you and meand i am writing him too i regret to inform you both that katie couldnt save herselfjust a few of us stupid boys i cant tell you more but i know it was an accidental overdose he didnt say of what perhaps jeff reese assumed that danny would have known what substance katie was abusing but theyd not done any serious drugs together only the occasional marijuana in their case the drinking and a little pot had been more than enough there wasnt a word about the kennedy fathers though one would guess that jeff reese had somewhat belatedly read it maybe hed read just enough of the book to see for himself that the caitlin character wasnt really katie and if katie had read the kennedy fathers or any of danny angels other novels jeff reese didnt say at least katie must have known that daniel baciagalupo had become danny angel for how else would jeff reese have made the connection danny had driven down to northfield mount hermon for an impromptu visit with joe at his sons school the old james gym was emptyit wasnt wrestling seasonand they sat together on the sloped wooden track reading and rereading the letter about joes mother maybe the boy had thought he would one day hear from his mom danny had never expected to hear from katie but the writer in him had thought she might try to make contact with her son at seventeen joe baciagalupo often looked like he needed a shave and he had the more defined facial features of a young man in his early twenties yet there was something expectant and open in his expression that reminded his father of a more childlike joe or of the little joe the boy had been this might have made danny say to him im sorry that you didnt have a mother or that i didnt find someone who could have done a good job in that role for you but its not just a role is it joe asked his dad he was still holding the letter about his mother dying from an overdose and danny would later think that the way the seventeenyearold looked at the letter it was as if it were foreign currencya curiosity exoticlooking but of no particular use at the moment i mean i had youyouve always been there joe continued and your dadwell you know hes like a second dad to me and then theres ketchum yes was all the writer could say when he talked to young joe danny sometimes didnt know if he was talking to a child or a man was it part of the same anxiousness danny had felt as a twelveyearold that he suspected joe kept things from him or was it what ketchum and the cook had kept from danny that made him wonder about how forthcoming or not joe was i just want to be sure youre okay danny said to joe but the seventeenyearoldchild or man or bothsurely knew that by the okay word his father was implying much more than okay the writer meant thriving danny also meant safe as if regular fatherson conversations could possibly ensure joes safety the childs or the mans yet as danny would one day consider maybe this was a writers peculiar burdennamely that the anxiety he felt as a father was conflated with the analysis he brought to bear on the characters in his fiction the day he showed joe the letter about katie it struck danny angel that the news of katies death had an offstage unreal quality the distant report from a stranger had the effect of turning katie into a minor fictional character and if danny had kept up the drinking with her he would have turned out the same wayeither an accident or a suicide the finale disappointingly offstage his dad had been right about the drinking maybe not being able to handle it was as his father had suggested genetic at least he hasnt written about rosienot yet ketchum wrote to his old friend tony angel had liked ketchums letters better before the old logger who was now sixtysix had learned to read that lady hed met in the librarythe schoolteacher was all ketchum ever called herwell shed done the job but ketchum was even crankier now that he could read and write and the cook was convinced that ketchum no longer listened as attentively when you dont read you have to listen maybe those books the woodsman had heard were the books hed understood best now ketchum complained about almost everything he read it also might have been that tony angel missed sixpacks handwriting in ketchums opinion by the way the cook had gotten crankier too danny definitely missed sixpack pams influence on ketchum possibly his dependence on pam had made ketchum less lonely than he seemed to danny now and danny had long ago accepted sixpacks role as a gobetween in ketchums correspondence with the young writer and his dad danny was fortyone in when men turn forty most of them no longer feel young but joeat eighteenknew he had a relatively young dad even the girls joes age and younger at northfield mount hermon had told the boy that his famous father was very goodlooking maybe danny was goodlooking but he wasnt nearly as goodlooking as joe the young man was almost eight inches taller than his dad and grandfather katie the boys mother had been a noticeably small woman but the men in the callahan family were uniformly tallnot heavy but very tall their height went with their patrician airs the cook had declared he and carmella had hated the wedding theyd felt snubbed the whole time it had been a lavish affair at an expensive private club in manhattan katie was already a couple of months pregnantand for all the money the party cost the food had been inedible the callahans werent food people they were the kind of icecube suckers who had too many cocktails and filled themselves with endless hors doeuvres they looked like they had so much money that they didnt need to eatthat was what tony angel told ketchum who was still driving logs on the kennebec at the time hed told danny he had too much to do in maine and couldnt come to the wedding but the real reason ketchum hadnt gone to the wedding was that the cook had asked him not to come i know you ketchumyoull bring your browning knife and a twelvegauge youll kill every callahan you can identify katie included and then youll go to work on a couple of dannys fingers with the browning i know you feel the same way i do cookie yes i do the cook admitted to his best friend and carmella even agrees with us but weve got to let daniel do this his way the callahan whore is going to have someones baby and that baby will keep mine out of this disastrous war so ketchum had stayed in maine the logger would later say it was a good thing cookie had gone to the wedding when joe turned out to be tall the cook might have been inclined to believe that his beloved daniel couldnt have been the boys father after all katie fucked anyone she wanted to she could easily have been knocked up by someone else and then married daniel but the wedding offered proof that there was a gene for tall men in the callahan family and joe turned out to be the spitting image of danny it was just that the top of his dads head came up only to the top of the young mans chest joe had the body of an oarsman but he wasnt a rower for the most part hed grown up in vermont the boy was an experienced downhill skier his dad didnt much care for the sport as a runner he preferred crosscountry skiing when he skied at all danny had continued to run it still helped him to think and to imagine things joe was a wrestler at northfield mount hermon though he didnt have the body of a wrestler it was probably ketchums influence that made joe choose wrestling the cook thought ketchum was just a barroom brawler but wrestling came closer to describing ketchums favorite kind of fight than boxing did usually ketchum didnt hit people until he got them down on the ground the first time ketchum had gone to one of joes wrestling matches at nmh the barroom brawler hadnt understood the sport very well joe had scored a takedown and his opponent lay stretched out on his side when ketchum shouted now hit himhit him now ketchum danny said theres no hitting allowedits a wrestling match christ thats the best time to hit a fella ketchum said when youve got him stretched out like that later in that same match joe had his opponent in a nearpin position joe had sunk a half nelson around the other wrestlers neck and was tilting him toward his back joes got his arm around the wrong side of the neck ketchum complained to the cook you cant choke someone with your arm around the back of a fellas neckyouve got to be on his fucking throat joes trying to pin that guy on his back ketchumhes not trying to choke him tony angel told his old friend choking is illegal danny explained joe won his match and after all the matches were over ketchum went to shake the boys hand that was when ketchum stepped on a wrestling mat for the first time when the woodsman felt the mat yield under his foot he stepped quickly back to the hardwood floor of the gym it was as if hed stepped on something alive shit thats the first problem ketchum said the mats too softyou cant really hurt a guy on it ketchum youre not trying to hurt your opponentjust pin him or beat him on points danny tried to explain but the next thing they knew ketchum was attempting to show joe a better way to crank someone over on his back you get him down on his belly and pull one of his arms behind his back ketchum said with enthusiasm then you get a little leverage under the fellas forearm and you drive his right elbow till it touches his left ear believe me hell turn overif he doesnt want to lose his whole shoulder you cant bend someones arm past a fortyfivedegree angle joe told the old logger submission holds and choke holds used to be legal but nowadays you cant make someone yield to painthats called a submission holdand you cant choke anyone those things arent legalnot anymore constipated christits like everything else ketchum complained they take what was once a good thing and fuck it up with rules but after ketchum had seen a few more of joes matches he grew to like high school wrestling hell to be honest with you cookie when i first saw it i thought it was a sissy way to fight but once you get the idea of it you can actually tell who would win the match if it was taking place in a parking lot and there was no referee joe was surprised by how many matches ketchum attended the old woodsman drove all over new england to see joe and the nmh team wrestle they had a pretty good team in joes senior year in joes four years at northfield mount hermon ketchum definitely saw more of the boys wrestling matches than his father or grandfather did the matches were on wednesdays and saturdays tony angels brattleboro restaurant was closed wednesday so that tony could see some of his grandsons wrestling matches but the cook could never find the time to see joe wrestle on a saturday and it seemed that the more important matchesthe seasonending tournaments for examplewere on the weekends danny angel got to see more than half of his sons matches but the writer took a lot of publishingrelated trips it was ketchum who went to almost all of joes fights as the logger was inclined to call them you missed a good fight ketchum would say when he called the cook or danny to tell them the results of young joes wrestling matches until he had a bestseller with the kennedy fathers danny didnt know that publishing houses had publicity departments now that his publishers were promoting his books danny felt an obligation to do some traveling on the books behalf and the translations were published at different times rarely simultaneously with the englishlanguage editions this meant that it was unusual for a year to go by without danny going somewhere to do a book tour when it wasnt wrestling season and his dad was traveling joe often spent weekends at his grandfathers apartment in brattleboro sometimes his friends from northfield mount hermon would have their parents take them out to dinner at tony angels italian restaurant occasionally joe would help out in the kitchen it was like old times and not like them the cook would thinkseeing his grandson instead of his son in a working kitchen or busing tables tony né dominic was reminded that hed not seen as much of daniel in those prepschool years as he now saw of joe because of this there was something bittersweet about the cooks relationship with his grandson almost magically there were times when tony angel got to relax with joewithout once judging the boy the way the cook had felt compelled to judge and criticize daniel the other guys on joes wrestling team had grown fond of ketchum is he your unclethat toughlooking man with the scar the wrestlers would ask joe no ketchums just a friend of the familyhe was a river driver joe would tell them one day joes wrestling coach asked him did that big man with the hard handshake ever wrestle he kind of looks like he might have or could have not officially joe answered what about that scar the coach asked joe thats a nasty onebetter than your average headbutt anyway that was no headbuttthat was a bear joe told the coach a bear just dont ever ask ketchum about it joe said its a terrible story ketchum had to kill the bear but he didnt want to he likes bears generally there was a bit of the writer danny angel in joe baciagalupo clearlya deeper ingredient than a physical resemblance but danny worried that there was something reckless about his son it wasnt a baciagalupo recklessness of the imagination either it also wasnt the wrestling which was nothing danny had ever wanted to doand the cook couldnt have imagined doing it not with that limp in fact the wrestling seemed safe enoughonce joe had learned a little about it there was another element in young joe that danny didnt recognize as coming from himself or his dad if there was an active katie callahan gene in the boy maybe it was his penchant for risktaking he skied too fast he drove a car too fast and he was more than fast with girls it seemed to his writer father that joe just took too many chances maybe thats the katie in him danny had said to his dad maybe the cook replied tony angel didnt like to think that anything of that awful woman had gotten into his grandson then again it might be your mother daniel rosie was a risktaker after alljust ask ketchum in the time hed spent looking at those photographs of his mother danny could have written a novelthough hed stopped looking at the photos for a while after he learned the truth about his mom and ketchum and his father hed once tried to give the photos to his dad but tony angel wouldnt take them no theyre yoursi can see her very clearly daniel his father tapped his temple up here maybe ketchum would like the photos danny said ketchum has his own pictures of your mother daniel the cook told him over time a few of those photos danny had pressed flat between the pages of the novels left behind in twisted riversome of them but no way near all of themhad been sent to him by ketchum here i found this picture in one of her books the accompanying letter from ketchum would say i thought you should have it danny albeit reluctantly danny had kept the photos joe liked to look at them perhaps the cook was right maybe joe got some of his risktaking or reckless instincts from his grandmother not from katie when danny looked at his moms pictures he saw a pretty woman with intense blue eyes but the drunken rebel whod dosidoed two drunken men on the black ice of twisted riverwell that element of rosie baciagalupo née calogero wasnt evident in the photos her son had kept just keep an eye on his drinking the cook had told his sonhe meant young joes drinking it was tony angels way of inquiring if his eighteenyearold grandson was drinking yet i suppose theres the occasional party danny told his dad but joe doesnt drink around me the kind of drinking joe might do around you isnt the kind we need to worry about the cook said joes drinking would bear watching the writer danny angel imagined as for his sons genetic package danny knew more than he cared to remember about the boys mom katie callahan shed had one whale of an alcohol problem and in katies case shed done more than the occasional marijuana when she and danny had been a coupleshed smoked more than a little pot danny knew it could be argued that windham college was in its death throes before the end of the vietnam war decreasing enrollment and an inability to meet a loan repayment would force the college to close in but danny angel sensed that there were signs of trouble ahead for windham well before then the writer would resign from the college in when he accepted a teaching job back at the writers workshop in iowa hed not written the kennedy fathers yet danny still had to teach for a living and for teachingwriting jobs iowa is as good as they get you have students who are serious and busy with their own writing which means you get lots of time to write danny angel would publish his second novel and write his third when he was again in iowa city in those years before joe was a teenager iowa city was a great town for dannys son toopretty good schools as one would expect in a university town and a semblance of neighborhood life iowa city wasnt the north end to be surenot when it came to restaurants especiallybut danny had liked being back there the writer gave his dad a choice tony angel could come to iowa city or he could stay in putney danny wanted to keep the vermont farmhouse hed bought the rental property on hickory ridge road just before he accepted the iowa offer and resigned from windham because he wanted his father to be able to stay in windham county if the cook wanted to in the cooks mind carmella was the question for the five years tony angel ran the benevento pizza place in putney hed taken a lot of shopping trips to boston it was more than a twohour drive each waykind of far for shopping dannys dad claimed that he had to buy his pizza sausages at the abruzzese meat market in the north endand while he was in his old neighborhood he might as well stock up on his cheeses his olives and his olive oil but danny knew that his dad was trying to stock up on as much of carmella as he could they hadnt really been able to break things off cleanly the cook had invested very little in benevento compared to where hed worked before in both coos county and boston a pizza place in a poor mans college town had been relatively easy hed bought the building from an aging hippie whod called himself the sign painter it had looked to tony angel like a failing small business and there was a rumor in town that the sign painter was responsible for the misspelling of the theatre word on the latchis theatre in brattleboro the word on the marquee of the main street movie house was spelled theater not theatre for years the latchis had sought funds to correct the mistake it was no rumor that the sign painters wife an allegedly flaky potter had recently run out on him all shed left the miserable sign painter was her kiln which gave the cook the idea for his brick pizza oven at the time danny invited him to come to iowa city tony was a little tired of running his own restauranta pizza place wasnt quite the kind of restaurant the cook wanted to own anywayand things with carmella had pretty much run their course seeing each other only occasionally shed told the cook had made her feel she was in an illicit relationship instead of a legitimate one the illicit word sounded to tony like something that might have come up when carmella had been confessing her sinseither at st leonard or st stephens wherever carmella did her confessing confessing ones sins was a catholic thing that had never caught on with the cook why not just see what the midwest was like tony angel thought if he sold it now the cook could get a little money for benevento whereas if he waited and if windham college was going under which danny said it was what would anyone want with a pizza place in putney why dont you just let a fire get out of control in your pizza oven and then collect the insurance ketchum had asked his old friend did you burn down twisted river the cook asked ketchum hell it was a ghost town when it burnedit was nothing but an eyesore cookie those buildings my cookhouse among them werent nothing ketchum shit if thats how you feel about a little fire maybe you should just sell your pizza place the cooks old friend told him it was hardly a little fire that took down what had been the town of twisted river ketchum had planned the torching to perfection he chose a windless night in march before mud season it was before carl had stopped drinking too which was why ketchum got away with it no one was able to find the deputy sheriff in all probability you couldnt have woken up the cowboy if youd found him if thered been any wind ketchum would have had to light only one fireto burn both the town and the cookhouse but he might have started a forest fire in the processeven in what had been a typically wet month of march when there was still a lot of snow on the ground ketchum wasnt taking any chances he liked the forestit was the town of twisted river and the cookhouse that he hated the night rosie died ketchum had almost cut off his left hand in the cookhouse kitchen hed heard cookie crying himself to sleep while jane had stayed upstairs with the cook and little danny the night twisted river burned ketchum must have had threequarters of a cord of firewood in his truck he divided the wood between the two bonfires he builtone at the abandoned sawmill in town the other in what had been the cookhouse kitchen he set both fires within minutes of each other and watched them burn to the ground before morning he used some fancy pinescented lamp oil to ignite the bonfires either kerosene or gasoline might have left some residue of themselves and surely both would have left a taint in the air but thered been nothing left of the lamp oil with its innocent pine scentnot to mention the wellseasoned firewood hed used to start both fires you know anythin bout that fire in twisted river last night ketchum carl asked him the following day after the hungover deputy sheriff had driven to the site of the devastation the tire tracks back in there looked like your truck to me oh i was back in there all right ketchum told the cop it was a helluva fire cowboyyou should have seen it it burned damnnear all night i just took a beer or two and drove back in there to watch it it was a pity that the deputy had stopped drinking ketchum would say in later years they were not on friendlier terms these daysthe cowboy and ketchumnow that carl knew the baciagalupo boy had killed injun jane with a skillet and all the rest of it janes death had been an accident the deputy sheriff understood according to ketchum her death probably didnt matter all that much to carl though the cop was pissed at ketchum for never telling him the truth what really mattered to the cowboy was that cookie had been fucking janeat a time when jane belonged to carl that was why carl wanted to kill the cook the deputy had made himself clear to ketchum on that point i know you wont tell me where cookie is ketchum but you tell that little cripple for meim gonna find him the cowboy said and you better watch your back if you know whats good for you im always watching my back carl ketchum told him the old woodsman didnt say a word about his dog that fine animal if the cowboy came after ketchum the veteran logger wanted the dog to be a surprise naturally everyone who lived yearround on the upper androscoggin must have known that ketchum had a dogcarl included the animal rode around in ketchums truck it was the dogs ferocity that ketchum had managed to keep secret of course it couldnt have been the same fine animal protecting ketchum for sixteen years the present watchdog had to have been the son or grandson of that first fine animal the dog whod replaced sixpack pam i told you ketchum would say to both danny and his dad new hampshire is next to vermont thats too close for comfort in my opinion i think its a terrific idea for you both to go to iowa im sure little joe will love it out there too its another injun name iowa isnt it boy those injuns were once all over werent they and just look what this country did to them it kind of makes you wonder about our countrys intentions doesnt it vietnam wasnt the first thing that made us look bad and where this asshole country is headedwell maybe those injuns lying underground in iowa and all over might just say that were one day going to get whats coming to us how would one describe ketchums politics the cook was thinking as he limped down brattleboro s main street making his slow way back to his restaurant from the book cellar live free or die thats what it said on the new hampshire license plates ketchum was clearly a livefreeordie man and hed always believed that the country was going to hell but tony angel was wondering if his old friend had ever even voted the woodsman was disinclined to trust any government or anyone who took part in it in ketchums opinion the only justification for having lawsfor abiding by any rules reallywas that the assholes outnumbered the sensible fellas and of course the laws didnt apply to ketchum hed lived without rules except those of his own making the cook stopped walking and looked admiringly down the hill at his very own restaurantthe one hed always wanted avellino italian cooking avellino was that other hill town also a province in the vicinity of naples it had always been the second word nunzi murmured in her sleep and the sign said cooking not cuisinefor the same reason that tony angel thought of himself and called himself a cook not a chef he would always be just a cook tony thought he believed he wasnt good enough to be a chef deep in his bones the former dominic baciagalupohow he missed the dominicwas just a milltown loggingcamp kind of cook tony molinari was a chef the cook was thinkingpaul polcari too tony angel had learned a lot from those twomore than nunzi ever could have taught himbut the cook had also learned he would never be as good as molinari or paul you have no feeling for fish gamba molinari had told him as sympathetically as possible it was true there was only one fish dish on the menu at avellino and sometimes the only seafood of the day was a pasta dishif the cook could get calamari he stewed it slowly for a long time in a spicy marinara sauce with black olives and pine nuts but in brattleboro the calamari he could get generally came frozen which was all right and the most reliable fresh fish was swordfish which tony molinari had taught him to prepare with lemon and garlic and olive oileither under the broiler or on a grillwith fresh rosemary if the cook could get it or with dried oregano he didnt do dolci it was paul polcari whod gently made the point that the cook had no feeling for desserts eithermore to the point italian desserts tony angel was thinking what he did do well was the regular milltown and loggingcamp farepies and cobblers in vermont you couldnt go wrong with blueberries and apples at avellino the cook served a fruitandcheese course too many of his regular customers preferred that to dessert the admiration of his very own restaurant had distracted tony angel from his thoughts about ketchums politics which he returned to while he made his gimpy way downhill to avellino when it came to what other people called progressmost engines and machinery of all sortsketchum was a bit of a luddite not only did he miss the river drives he claimed hed liked logging better before there were chainsaws but ketchum was overly fond of guns the cook was thinkingguns were in a category of machinery the old woodsman would approve of neither a liberal nor a conservative ketchum could best be described as a libertarianwell the logger was a libertine too tony angel considered and in the woodsmans younger days something of a rake and a profligate why was it that every time he thought of ketchum the cook couldnt help thinking of the logger in sexual terms the former dominic baciagalupo knew why that was of course it just always depressed him when his thoughts about ketchum went there ketchum had been furious when father and son and grandson all came back to vermont from iowa but the writers workshop had been generous to let danny teach there for as long as they did theyd offered him only a twoyear contract danny had asked to stay a third year and they let him but in the summer of when joe was ten the family returned to windham county danny loved his old farmhouse in putney his father would have nothing to do with living there the vietnam war was over windham college s death throes were more apparent besides tony angel had never liked putney while neither dannys second nor third novel would make him any money the cook had increased his savings in iowa enough to buy the old storefront space with the apartment above it on brattleboro s main street that was the year avellino was bornwhen danny was commuting to mount holyoke college in south hadley massachusetts it was the closest collegeteaching job that the writer could find but the distinguished and somewhat staid womens college was well over an hours drive nearly two from putneya long commute in the winter months if it was snowing still living in putney mattered to danny no small part of it was his high opinion of the grammar schoolwithin walking distance of homewhere joe would finish the eighth grade before going off to northfield mount hermon the cook was shaking his head as he limped into his restaurant because he was thinking that daniel truly must love living in the country tony angel didnt the north end had made a city man out of him or at least he was a neighborhood kind of guy but not daniel hed made the commute to that womens college for three years before the kennedy fathers was published in the novels success had freed him from ever having to teach again of course thered been more money suddenly and the cook had worriedhe still worriedabout what effect it might have on young joe daniel was old enough thirtysix when the bestseller business found him to not be affected by either the fame or the good fortune but when joe was only thirteen the boy woke up one morning with a famous father couldnt this have made an unwelcome mark on any kid that age and then there were the women daniel went throughboth before and after he was famous the writer had been living with one of his former windham college students when he tony and joe moved to iowa city the girl with a boys nameits franky with a y she liked to say with a pouthadnt made the move with them thank god for that the cook thought at the time franky was a ferallooking little thing a virtual wild animal she wasnt my student when i began to sleep with her danny had argued with his dad no but franky had been one of his writing students only a year or two before she was one of many windham college students who never seemed to leave putney they went to windham they graduated or they quit school but continued to hang aroundthey wouldnt leave the girl had dropped in on her former teacher one day and shed simply stayed what does franky do all day his dad had asked danny shes trying to be a writer danny said franky likes hanging around and shes nice to joehe likes her franky did some housecleaning and a little cookingif you could call it that the cook thought the wild girl was barefoot most of the timeeven in that drafty old farmhouse in the winter months when daniel heated the whole place with a couple of woodstoves putney was the kind of town that worshipped woodstoves tony angel had observed there was even an alternative to heating in that town the cook simply hated the place franky was a dirtyblonde with lank hair and a slouchy posture she wore funny oldfashioned dresses of the kind the cook remembered nunzi wearing except franky never wore a bra and her underarmswhat the cook saw of themwere unshaven and franky couldnt have been more than twentytwo or twentythree when shed lived with daniel and little joe daniel had just turned thirty when they went to iowa thered been more young women in the writers life in iowa city one of his workshop students among them and while there was no one special nownor had there been anyone longlasting since danny angel became famousjoe by the time he was a teenager had seen his dad with numerous young women and three or four notably older women the cook was remembering two of those ladies were among daniels foreign publishers the putney property was a virtual compound these days the writer had turned the old farmhouse into his guesthouse hed built a new house for himself and joe and there was a separate building where danny did his writing his writing shack daniel called it some shack tony angel thought the building was small but it had a halfbathroom in it there was also a phone a tv and a small fridge danny may have liked living in the country but he wasnt exactly reclusivehence the guesthouse in his life as a writer hed gotten to know a number of city people and they came to visit himthe occasional women included had joes exposure to his famous fathers casual relationships with women made the teenager something of a playboy at prep school tony angel wondered he worried about his grandsonas much as if not more than the boys dad did yes the eighteenyearolds drinking would bear watching the cook knew joe had the mischievous insouciance of a boy who liked to party with the war in vietnam they would lower the drinking age in many states to eighteen the logic being that if they could send mere boys off to die at that age shouldnt the kids at least be allowed to drink after the war was over the drinking age would go back up to twentyone againbut not until though nowadays tony knew many kids joes age had fake ids the cook saw them all the time at avellino he knew his grandson had one it was how joe was more than fast with girls that really worried tony angel going too fast too soon with girls could get you in as much trouble as drinking the former dominic del popolo né baciagalupo knew it had gotten the cook in trouble in his opinionand daniel too despite carmellas best efforts tony knew all about her catching her niece josie with daniel the cook was sure that his son had banged more than one of those dimattia girls and even a saetta and a calogero or two but young joe had at least seen if not actually overheard his father in a few more adult relationships than whatever foolishness daniel had been up to with his kissing cousins and his grandfather knew that joe had spent more than a few nights in the girls dorms at nmh it was a wonder the boy hadnt been caught and kicked out of school now in the spring term of his senior year maybe he would be there were things joes dad didnt know but his grandfather did in his frantic last night in twisted river the cook had prayedfor the first and only time until now please god give me time tony angel had prayed long agoseeing his twelveyearolds small face behind the waterstreaked windshield of the chieftain deluxe daniel had been waiting in the passenger seat as if hed never lost faith that his father would safely return from leaving injun janes body at carls for all the talking the cook and ketchum did about danny angels novelsnot only about what was in them but more important what the writer seemed to be purposely leaving outthe one thing the men noticed without fail was how much the books were about what danny feared maybe the imagination does that tony thought as he peeked under the damp towels covering his pizza dough the dough hadnt risen enough for him to punch it down danny angels novels had much to do with what the writer feared might happen the stories often indulged the nightmarishnamely what every parent fears most losing a child there was always something or someone in a danny angel novel that was ominously threatening to children or to a child young people were in perilin part because they were young tony angel wasnt much of a reader anymorethough hed bought innumerable novels on his sons and ketchums recommendations at the book cellar hed read a lot of first chapters and had just stopped something about ketchums relationship with rosie had kicked the reading right out of the cook the only novels he actually finishedand he read every wordwere his sons tony wasnt like ketchum whod read or heard everything the cook knew his sons worst fears daniel was absolutely terrified of something happening to his loved ones he simply obsessed about that subject that was where the writers fearful imagination came fromchildhood terrors the writer danny angel seemed driven to imagine the worst things that could happen in any given situation in a way as a writerthat is to say in his imaginationthe cooks son at fortyone was still a child in his quiet kitchen in his cherished avellino the cook prayed that he be allowed to live a little longer he wanted to help his grandson survive being a teenager maybe boys arent out of the woods until their late twenties tony consideredafter all daniel had been twentytwo when he married katie certainly that had been taking a risk what if joe had to be thirty before he was safe and if anything did happen to joe the cook prayed he would still be alive to look after daniel he knew how much help his son would need then tony angel looked at the silent radio he almost turned it on just to help him banish these morbid thoughts he considered writing a letter to ketchum instead of turning on the radio but he didnt do either of these things he just kept praying it seemed that the praying had come to him out of nowhere and he wished he could stop doing it there in his kitchen next to his cookbooks were various editions of danny angels novels which the cook kept in chronological order there was no more revered place for those novels than among his dads cookbooks danny knew but it didnt calm the cook down to look at his famous sons books after family life in coos county the cook knew that daniel had published the mickey but was that in or the first novel had been dedicated to mr leary but the second one should have been given its subject matter as hed more or less promised however danny had dedicated his second novel to his dad for my father dominic baciagalupo the dedication read which was a little confusing because the authors name was danny angeland dominic was already called tony or mr angel isnt that sort of like letting the nomdeplume cat out of the nomdeplume bag ketchum had complained but it had turned out for the better when danny became famous for his fourth novel the issue of him writing under a nom de plume had long been defused almost everyone in the literary world knew that danny angel was a nom de plume but very few people remembered what his real name wasor they didnt care mr leary had been right to suggest that there were easier names to remember than baciagalupo and how many peopleeven in the literary worldknow what john le carrés real name is danny not surprisingly had defended his decision to ketchum by saying that he doubted the deputy sheriff was very active in the literary world even the logger had to acknowledge that the cowboy wasnt a reader besides very few people read the mickey when it was originally published when his fourth novel made danny famous and readers went back to the earlier books that was when everyone read the mickey a secondary but major character in the mickey is a repressed irishman who teaches english at the michelangelo school the novel focuses on the main characters last encounter with his former english teacher at a striptease show in the old howard to the cook it seemed a slight coincidence to build a whole book aroundthe mutual shame and embarrassment of the former student now an exeter boy with a bunch of his exeter friends and the character who was clearly modeled on mr leary probably the episode at the old howard had actually happenedor so the novelists father believed the third novel came along in just after theyd all moved back to vermont from iowa the cook would wonder if his was the only family to have mistakenly assumed that kissing cousins meant cousins who were sexually interested in or involved with one another dannys third novel was called kissing kin originally socalled kissing kin meant any distant kin who were familiar enough to be greeted with a kiss it didnt mean what dannys dad had always thought the cook was relieved that his sons third book wasnt dedicated to dannys cousins in the saetta and calogero families because the irony of such a dedication might not have been appreciated by the male members of those families the story concerns a young boys sexual initiation in the north end he is seduced by an older cousin who works as a waitress in the same restaurant where the boy has a parttime job as a busboy the older cousin in the novel was clearly modeled the cook knew on that slut elena calogerobetter said the physical description of the character was true to elena yet both carmella and the cook were pretty sure that daniels first sexual experience had been with carmellas niece josie dimattia the novel might have been pure fantasy or wishful thinking the cook supposed but there were details that particularly bothered the writers dadfor example how the older cousin breaks off the relationship with the young boy when hes going off to boarding school the waitress tells the kid that all along she wanted to be fucking the boys fathernot the boy little is written about the character of the dad hes rather distantly described as the new cook in the restaurant where his son is a busboy the rejected boy goes off to school hating his father because he imagines that the older cousin will eventually seduce his dad surely this couldnt be truethis was outrageous tony angel was thinking as he searched in the book for that passage where the train is pulling out of north station and the boy is looking out the window of the train at his father on the station platform the boy suddenly cant bear to look at his dad his attention shifts to his stepmother i knew that the next time i saw her she would probably have put on a few more pounds danny angel wrote how could you write that about carmella the cook had yelled at his writer son when hed first read that hurtful sentence its not carmella dad daniel said okaymaybe the character of the stepmother in kissing kin wasnt carmella but danny angel dedicated the novel to her i suppose its just tough luck being in a writers family ketchum had told the cook i mean we get mad if danny writes about us or someone we know but we also get mad at him for not writing about us or for not really writing about himselfhis true self i mean not to mention that he made his damn exwife a better person than she ever was all that was true the cook thought somehow what struck him about daniels fiction was that it was both autobiographical and not autobiographical at the same time danny disagreed of course after his schoolboy attempts at fiction writing which hed shown only to mr learyand those stories were nothing but a confusing mix of memoir and fantasy both exaggerated and nearly as confusing to danny as they were to the late michael learythe young novelist had not really been autobiographical at all not in his opinion the cook couldnt find the passage he was searching for in kissingkin he put his sons third novel back on the bookshelf his eyes passing quickly over the fourth onethe famemaker ketchum called it tony angel didnt even like to look at the kennedy fathersthe one with the fake katie in it as he thought of it the novel had not only made his son famous it was an international bestseller and the first one of daniels books to be made into a movie almost everyone said that it wasnt a bad movie though it was not nearly as successful as the novel danny didnt like the film but he said he didnt hate it either he just wanted nothing to do with the moviemaking process he said that he never wanted to write a screenplay and that he wouldnt sell the film rights to any of his other novelsunless someone wrote a halfway decent adaptation first and danny got to read the screenplay before he sold the movie rights to the novel the writer had explained to his dad that this was not the way the movie business worked generally speaking the rights to make a film from a novel were sold before a screenwriter was even attached to the project by demanding to see a finished screenplay before he would consider selling the rights to his novel danny angel was pretty much assuring himself that no one would ever make another movie of one of his booksnot while he was alive anyway i guess danny did hate the movie of the kennedy fathers after all ketchum had said to the cook but the logger and the authors dad had to be careful what they said about the kennedy fathers around young joe danny had dedicated the novel to his son ketchum and the cook were at least pleased to see that the book wasnt dedicated to katie naturally danny was aware that the two old friends werent exactly fans of his famous fourth novel it was only natural one of daniels publishers had told the cookshe was one of the foreign ones one of the older women the writer had slept withthat whatever novel danny angel wrote after the kennedy fathers was going to get criticized for not living up to the breakthrough book and runaway bestseller that the famous fourth novel was even so danny didnt help himself by writing a fifth novel that was both dense and sexually disturbing and as more than one critic wrote the writer loved semicolons to excess hed even put one in the title it was simply stupid that titlethe spinster or the maiden aunt daniel had called it constipated christ ketchum had shouted at the bestselling author couldnt you have called it one thing or the other in interviews danny always said that the title reflected the oldfashioned nineteenthcentury kind of story that the novel was bullshit the cook had said to his son that title makes you look like you cant make up your mind whatever you call them they look like someone smashed a fly over the comma ketchum said to danny about all the semicolons the only writing i do are letters to you and your dad but ive written rather a lot of them and in all those letters i dont believe ive ever used as many of those damn things as you use on any one fucking page of this novel theyre called semicolons ketchum the writer said i dont care what theyre called danny the old woodsman said im just telling you that you use too damn many of them but of course what really pissed off ketchum and the cook about danny angels fifth novel was the fucking dedicationkatie in memoriam all tony angel could say about it to ketchum was that callahan cunt broke my sons heart and abandoned my grandson it was not a good time ketchum knew to point out to his old friend that shed also kept his son out of the war and had given him the grandson not to mention what the spinster or the maiden aunt was about the cook was thinking as he looked with suspicion at the novel on his kitchen bookshelf its another north end story but this time the boy who is coming of age is sexually initiated by one of his auntsnot an older cousinand the maiden aunt and spinster is a dead ringer for rosies youngest sister the unfortunate filomena calogero surely this hadnt happened the cook hoped but had daniel once wished that it hador had it almost happened once again as in any danny angel novel the graphic detail was quite convincing and the sexual descriptions of the boys petite auntshe was such a pathetic selfpitying womanwere painful for the cook though hed read every word critics also made the point that the perhaps overrated writer was repeating himself daniel had been thirtynine when his fifth novel was published in and all the criticism must have stung him though you wouldnt know it if the cousin in kissing kin tells the boy shes breaking up with that she always wanted to sleep with his father instead in the novel about the neurotic aunt she tells the boy that she imagines shes having sex with his father whenever she has sex with the son what manifestation of selftorture is this the cook had wondered when hed first read the spinster or the maiden aunt maybe it did happen the man who missed the dominic in himself now imagined hed always thought that rosies sister filomena was completely crazy he couldnt look at her without feeling she was a grotesque mask of rosiea rosie imposter hed once described her to ketchum but daniel had seemed improbably infatuated with filomena the boy couldnt stop himself from staring at her and it was not as an aunt that he appeared to be regarding her had the flighty filomena who was still miserable and unmarried or so the cook assumed actually accepted or even encouraged her smitten young nephews adoration why dont you just ask danny if the crazy aunt popped his cherry ketchum had inquired of the cook that was a vulgar coos county expression and the cook hated it if hed paid closer attention to the conversations around him in boston the cook might have realized that cherrypopping was a vulgar north end expression too there was one part of the spinster or the maiden aunt that both tony angel and ketchum had loved the wedding at the end the boy has grown up and hes marrying his college sweetheartan indifferent bride if you ever met one and closer to a reallife katie character than caitlin in the kennedy fathers ever was also danny had nailed those icecubesucking callahan men dead between their eyesthose tightassed patrician republicans who danny believed had made katie the anarchist rulebreaker she was she was a trustfund kid whod reinvented herself as a radical but shed been a faux revolutionary katies only revolution had been a small sexual one there was one book danny angel had written that was not on the kitchen bookshelf in avellino that was his sixth novel which had not yet been published but the cook had almost finished reading it a copy of the galleys was upstairs in tony angels bedroom ketchum also had a copy both men felt ambivalent about the novel and neither was in any hurry to finish it east of bangor was set in an orphanage in maine in the swhen abortion was still illegal virtually the same damn boy from those earlier danny angel novelsa boy from boston who ends up going away to boarding schoolgets two of his north end cousins pregnant one when hes still a student at exeter before hes learned to drive and the second after hes gone off to college he goes to the university of new hampshire naturally theres an old midwife in the maine orphanage who performs abortionsa deeply sympathetic woman who struck the cook as being modeled on the unlikely fusion of sweet gentle paul polcari the fucking pacifist as ketchum insisted on calling him and injun jane the first cousin who goes off to maine has the baby and leaves it behind she is so devastated by having a child and not knowing what has become of it that she tells the other pregnant cousin not to do what she did the second pregnant cousin also goes to maine to the very same orphanage but to have an abortion the problem is that the old midwife might not live long enough to perform the procedure if the young midwifeintraining ends up doing the d c the cousin might suffer the consequences the young midwife doesnt know enough about what shes doing both ketchum and the cook were hoping that the novel was going to turn out well and that nothing too bad would happen to the second pregnant cousin but knowing danny angels novels the two old readers had their fearsand something else was worrying them over a year ago joe had gotten a girl in trouble at northfield mount hermon because his father was famousfor a writer danny angel was very recognizableand because joe already knew something about the subject of the novel his dad was writing the boy hadnt asked for his fathers help those antiabortion people picketed most clinics or doctors offices where you could get an abortion joe didnt want his dad taking him and the unfortunate girl to one of those places where the protesters were what if some socalled righttolifer recognized his famous father smart boy ketchum said to joe when dannys son had written him young joe hadnt wanted to tell his grandfather either but ketchum insisted that the cook come along with them theyd driven to an abortion clinic in vermont together ketchum and the cook sat up front in the cooks car joe and the sad frightened girl were in the backseat it had been an awkward situation because the couple were no longer boyfriend and girlfriend theyd broken up almost a month before the girl discovered she was pregnant but they both knew joe was the babys father they were doing the right thing in the cook and ketchums opinion but it was difficult for them ketchum tried to console them butketchum being ketchumit came out a little clumsily the logger said more than he meant to theres one thing to be happy about he told the miserablelooking couple in the backseat when the same thing happened to your dad and a girl he knew joe abortion wasnt legaland it wasnt necessarily safe had the old woodsman forgotten the cook was in the car so thats why you took danny and that dimattia girl to maine tony angel cried i always thought so you said you wanted to show them the kennebec the last great riverdriving river you called it or some such bullshit but that dimattia girl was so dumbshe told carmella youd driven her and danny somewhere east of bangor i knew bangor was nowhere near the kennebec ketchum and the cook had argued the whole way to the abortion clinic where thered been picketers joe had been right not to involve his famous father with the protesters and all the way homethe exgirlfriend and joe were spending the weekend in brattleboro with the boys grandfatherjoe had held the girl in the backseat where she sobbed and sobbed she couldnt have been older than sixteenseventeen tops youre going to be all right joe who was not yet seventeen kept saying to the poor kid ketchum and the cook hoped so and now the two older men had stopped themselves in the last chapter of east of bangor danny angels abortion novel as it would be called the cook could see that there was something of ketchum in the character who drove the boy and his first pregnant cousin to maine by the description the friendly older man also reminded the cook of tony molinari danny angel calls him the principal chef in the north end restaurant where the two pregnant cousins work as waitresses its the way the man handles the truck they drive to maine inthat was what led tony angel to see the socalled chef as the ketchum character the molinari likeness was a disguise danny gave to the character because of course the writer didnt know when he was finishing the final draft of his abortion novel that ketchum had already told his dad about danny getting the dimattia girl pregnantand how the logger drove the two of them to an orphanage somewhere east of bangor maine the book was dedicated to those two chefs danny angel and his dad both loved tony molinari and paul polcariun abbràccio for tony m and paul p the author had written allowing the two men some measure of privacy an embrace for them from the former busboywaitersubstitute pizza and sous chef in vicino di napoli both those chefs the cook knew were retired vicino di napoli was gone and another restaurant with another name had taken its place in north square tony angel still drove periodically to the north end to do a little shopping he would meet molinari and paul at the caffè vittoria for some espresso they always assured him that carmella was doing well she seemed reasonably content with another fella it came as no surprise to the cook that carmella would end up with someone she was both beautiful and lovable east of bangor might be a difficult novel for young joe to read whenever he got around to it joe had no time to read his fathers novels when he was at northfield mount hermon to the cooks knowledge his grandson had read only one of his dads books the kennedy fathers of courseif only in the hope he would learn a little about what his mother had been like given ketchums opinion of the katie character what young joe would learn about his mother from that novel wasnt worth a pinch of coon shitaccording to the logger well here i amback to worrying about young joe again and all that that leads tothe cook was thinking he looked under the damp dish towels covering his pizza dough the dough was ready to punch down which the cook did tony angel wet the dishcloths once more he wrung them only partially dry before recovering the bowls for his pizza doughs second rise he thought his next letter to ketchum might begin theres so much to worry about i cant seem to stop myself from doing it and youd laugh at me ketchum because ive even been praying but the cook didnt begin that letter he felt strangely exhausted and hed shot the whole morning doing almost nothingjust starting his pizza dough and limping to the bookstore and back it was already time to go shopping avellino wasnt open for lunchjust dinner tony angel shopped at midday his staff showed up in the early afternoon as for worrying the cook wasnt alone danny worried a lot too and neither of them was as worried as ketchum even though it was almost juneway past mud season in southern vermont and theyd been mudfree for several weeks in northern new hampshire ketchum had been known to feel almost exhilarated in those first few weeks after mud season had passed but not now and truly not since the cook had come back to vermont from iowa with his son and grandson ketchum didnt like them to be anywhere near new hampshireparticularly not his old friend with the new and hardtogetusedto name the funny thing was that the cook for all his worrying didnt give the slightest thought to that so much time had passed it had been sixteen years since hed moved out of boston and twentynine since his last eventful night in twisted river dominic del popolo né baciagalupo who was now tony angel wasnt as worried about an angry old cowboy in coos county as he was about other things the cook should have been more worried about carl because ketchum was right vermont was next door to new hampshire too close for comfort and the deputy sheriff who was sixtysix had retired he had lots of time on his hands and that cowboy was still looking for the little cripple whod stolen his injun jane chapter dead dog remembering maos from the famous writers compoundas the putney locals and the writers own father were inclined to call it hickory ridge road climbed for over a mile the road both crossing the brook and running parallel to the water the socalled back road from putney to westminster west was dirt and at a point less than midway between danny angels property in putney and his best friends house in westminster west there was quite a pretty farm with horses at the end of a long steep driveway in the warm weatherafter hed opened his swimming pool in may and before he winterized the pool every octoberdanny called his friend in westminster west and told him when he was starting out on a run it was four or five miles maybe six or seven danny was such a daydreamer that he didnt keep track of the distance of his runs anymore the pretty farm at the end of the long uphill driveway seemed to focus the writers reveries because an older woman with snowwhite hair and the body of a dancer in her twenties lived there danny had had an affair with her some years agoher name was barrett she wasnt married and hadnt been at the time there was no scandal attached to their relationship nevertheless in the writers imaginationat about the twomile mark of his rundanny always foresaw his own murder at the place where this womans steep driveway met the road he would be running on the road just a halfsecond past her driveway and barrett would come gliding down the hill her car coasting in neutral with the engine off so that by the time he heard her tires scattering the loose gravel on the road it would be too late for him to get out of the almostsilent cars path a spectacular way for a storyteller to die danny had imagineda vehicular homicide with the famous novelists exlover at the wheel of the murder weapon that barrett had no such designs on ending the writers life didnt matter it would have been a good story in fact shed had many affairs and in dannys estimation barrett harbored no homicidal feelings for her exlovers the writer doubted that barrett would go out of her way to run over any of them she was exclusively focused on caring for her horses and maintaining her youthful physique when there was a conceivably interesting movie playing at the latchis in brattleboro danny would often ask barrett to see the film with him and they would have dinner at avellino that barrett was much closer in age to dannys dad than she was to danny had provided the cook with grounds for complaining to his writer son nowadays danny frequently found it necessary to remind his father that he and barrett were just friends danny could run five or six miles at a pace of seven minutes per mile usually running the last mile in closer to six minutes at fortyone hed had no injuries and was still slight of build at five feet seven he weighed only pounds his dad was a little smaller and perhaps the limp made him seem shorter than he was because of the occasional bad dog on the back road to westminster west danny ran with a couple of sawedoff squash racquetsjust the handles if a dog attacked him when he was running danny would stick one of the racquet handles in the dogs faceuntil the dog chomped on it then with the other sawedoff handle he would hit the dogusually on the bridge of the nose danny didnt play squash his friend in westminster west was the squash player when armando desimone broke one of his racquets he gave it to danny who sawed off the racquet head and kept the handle armando had grown up in the north end about a decade before danny and his dad moved there like the cook armando still drove to his beloved boston periodically to shop armando and danny enjoyed cooking for each other theyd been colleagues in the english department at windham and when the college folded armando took a job teaching at the putney school his wife mary had been joes english and history teacher at the grammar school when danny angel became rich and famous he lost a few of the old friends hed had but not the desimones armando had read all but the first of danny angels novels in manuscript for five out of six novels hed been dannys earliest reader you dont lose a friend like that armando had built a squash court in an old barn on his westminster west property he talked about building a swimming pool next but in the meantime he and mary swam in dannys pool nearly every afternoon when it wasnt raining the writer would run to the desimones house in westminster west then armando and mary would drive danny back to putney and theyd all swim in the pool danny would make drinks for them and serve the drinks at the pool after they swam danny had stopped drinking sixteen years agolong enough so that he had no problem having alcohol in his house or fixing drinks for his friends and he wouldnt dream of having a dinner party and not serving wine though he could remember that when hed first stopped drinking he was unable to be around people who were drinking anything alcoholic at the time in iowa city that had been a problem as for the writers second life in iowa city with his dad and little joewell that had been a peaceful interlude for the most part except for the unwelcome reminders of dannys earlier time in that town with katie in retrospect danny thought those last three years in iowa in the early seventies when joe had been in the second third and fourth grades and the greatest danger the boy faced was what might happen to him on his bicycleseemed almost blissful iowa city had been safe in those years joe was seven when hed gone back to iowa with his dad and grandfather and was still only ten when theyd returned to vermont maybe those ages were the safest ages the writer was imagining as he ran possibly iowa city had had nothing to do with it childhood and how it forms youmoreover how your child hood is relived in your life as an adultthat was his subject or his obsession the writer danny angel daydreamed as he ran from the age of twelve he had become afraid for his father the cook was still a hunted man like his dad but for different reasons danny had been a young fatherin reality hed also been a single parent even before katie left him now at fortyone danny was more afraid for young joe than he was for his dad maybe it was more than the katie callahan gene that put joe at risk nor did danny necessarily believe that the source of the wildness in his son was the boys freespirited grandmother that daring woman whod courted disaster on the latewinter ice of twisted river no when danny looked at young joe at eighteen it was himself at that dangerous age he saw from all theyd read into and had misread in danny angels novels the cook and ketchum couldnt have fathomed the perilous configuration of the various bullets danny had dodgednot only in his life with katie but long before her it hadnt been josie dimattia whod sexually initiated danny at the age of fifteen before he went off to exeter furthermore carmella may have caught them at it but josie wasnt the one who got pregnant ketchum had indeed driven danny to that orphanage with the obliging midwife in maine but with the oldest dimattia girl teresa perhaps teresa had given so many condoms to her younger sisters that shed forgotten to save some for herself and neither teresa nor dannys equally older cousin elena calogero had provided danny with his first sexual experiencethough the boy was much more attracted to those older girls than he was to any girl his own age including josie whod been only a little older thered also been an older saetta cousin giuseppina whod seduced young dan but giuseppina wasnt his first seducer no indeedthat instructive and most formative experience had been with the boys aunt filomena his mothers youngest sister when danny had been only fourteen had filomena been in her late twenties or might she already have turned thirty when the assignations with her young nephew began danny was wondering as he approached the final two miles of his run it was still may the blackflies were bad but not at the pace he was running which he began to pick up as he ran he could hear his heart and his own breathing though these elevated functions didnt seem to danny as loud or urgent as the beating of his heart or his gasps for breath whenever the boy had been with his insane aunt filomena what had she been thinking it was dannys dad shed adored and the cook wouldnt look at her had the way her nephew doted on herdanny couldnt take his eyes off herseemed a sufficient consolation prize to filomena shed been only the second woman in the saetta and calogero clans to attend college but filomena had shared another distinction with her older sister rosienamely a certain lawlessness with men filomena might have been only a preteenat most thirteen or fourteenwhen rosie had been sent away to the north country shed loved rosie and had looked up to heronly to see her disgraced and displayed as a bad example to the younger girls in the family filomena had been sent to sacred heart an allgirls catholic school near the paul revere house on north square shed been kept as safe from boys as was humanly and spiritually possible as danny angel picked up the pace in his long run he considered that this might have been why his aunt filomena had been more interested in him a boy than she appeared to be interested in men her sacred sisters widower excludedyet filomena must have known that the cook was a closed door to her an unfulfilled fantasy whereas danny who had not yet started to shave had his fathers long eyelashes and his mothers fair almost fragile skin and it must have made an impression on filomena that at fourteen the boy worshipped his small pretty aunt according to dannys dad filomenas eyes werent the same lethal blue as rosies but his aunts eyes and all the rest of her were dangerous enough to do danny some longlasting harm for one thing filomena managed to make all girls dannys age uninteresting to himthat is until he met katie the cook and ketchum had jumped to the conclusion that young daniel had seen something of his mother in katie what the boy had seen perhaps was that combination of a repressed girlhood in an angry young woman of wanton selfdestructiveness katie had been a younger more political version of his aunt filomena the difference between them was that filomena had been devoted to the boy and her sexual efforts to outdo the mere girls in dannys life were entirely successful denied any demonstrable expression of her sexuality as a girl filomena in her late twenties and well into her thirties was a woman possessed by the time danny met her katie callahan was almost indifferent to sex that shed had a lot of sex didnt mean that she actually liked it by the time danny met her katie already thought of sex as a way of negotiating in dannys prepschool years his aunt filomena would book a room at the exeter inn almost every weekend the boys trysts in that musty brick building were the unparalleled pleasures of his life at exeter and a contributing reason why he spent so few of his exeter weekends at home in the north end carmella and the cook always worked hardest at vicino di napoli on friday and saturday nights while the boy banged his youthful auntoften in a colonial fourposter bed beneath a gauzywhite canopy he was a runner runners have stamina with filomenas considerable and licentious assistance danny had achieved an adult independencefrom both his actual and his exeter families how could the boy possibly have had any interest in exeter s dances with various girls schools how could a closely chaperoned and chaste hug on the dance floor ever compete with the ardent sweatslicked contact hed maintained with filomena on an almost weekly basisnot only throughout his exeter years but including dannys first two years of college in durham and all the while those calogeros and saettas took pity on poor filomena pretty as she was she struck them as an eternal wallflower both a maiden aunt and a spinsterinthemaking little did they know that for seven hungry years the woman was indulging the ceaseless sexual appetites of a teenage boy on his way to becoming a young man in those seven years that his aunt filomena dominated dannys sexual life she more than made up for lost time that she was a teacher at sacred heartin the same catholic and allgirls environment where the younger filomena had been held downwas a perfect disguise all those other calogeros and the saettas thought of filomena as patheticthose were his fathers very words for her danny remembered as he ran harder and harder outwardly filomena had seemed the picture of propriety and catholic repression butohnot when she shed her clothes lets just say i keep them busy at confession she told her spellbound nephew for whom filomena had set a standard the young women who followed filomena in dannys life couldnt match his aunts erotic performance filomena was in her midto late thirtiestoo old to have a baby in her estimationwhen the issue of danny going to vietnam or not was raised she might have been happier with ketchums solution if danny had lost a finger or two he might have stayed with his aunt a little longer filomena was insane but she was no fool she knew she wouldnt get to keep her beloved young dan forever she liked the sound of katie callahans idea better than she ever warmed to ketchums planafter all in her own odd way filomena loved her nephew and she had not met katie had filomena met that most vulgar young woman she might have opted for ketchums browning knife instead but ultimately that decision wasnt hers filomena felt fortunate to have captured such a vital young mans almost complete attention for the seven years shed held him in her thrall dannys dalliances with those dimattia girls or several of his kissing cousins didnt bother her filomena knew that danny would always come back to her with renewed vigor those clumsy sluts couldnt hold a candle to hernot in the boys fond estimation anyway nor would katie ever become the younger filomena danny may have desiredor once upon a time wished her to be filomena would be in her midto late fifties now the writer knewrunning harder filomena had never married she was no longer at sacred heart but she was still teaching his novel with the semicolon in the titlethe one everyone had scorned the spinster or the maiden aunthad received one favorable review which the writer danny angel appreciated in her letter filomena wrote i warmly enjoyed your novel as you no doubt intendeda generous amount of homage with a justifiable measure of condemnation yes i took advantage of youif only in the beginning that you stayed with me so long made me proud of myself as i am proud of you now and im sorry if for a time i made it hard for you to appreciate those inexperienced girls but you must learn to choose more wisely my dearnow that youre a little older than i was when we went our separate ways shed written that letter two years agothe spinster or the maiden aunt had been published in hed often thought of seeing her again but how could danny revisit filomena without having unrealistic expectations a man in his early forties his unmarried aunt in her midto late fiftieswell what sort of relationship could exist between them now nor had he learned to choose more wisely as filomena had recommended perhaps hed purposely decided against choosing to be with anyone who so much as hinted at the promise of permanence and the writer knew he was too old to still hold his aunt accountable for introducing him to sex when he was too young whatever reluctance danny felt for involving himself in a permanent relationship couldnt be blamed on filomenacertainly not anymore it was the baddog part of dannys run if there was going to be trouble it would happen here danny was looking for the differenteyed dog in the narrow flat driveway lined with abandoned vehiclesdead cars some minus tires trucks without engines a motorcycle on its side and missing its handlebarswhen the big male dog emerged from a volkswagen bus without any doors a huskyshepherd mix he came into the road on a dead runno bark not a growl all business the patter of the pads of his paws on the dirt road was the only sound the dog made he hadnt yet begun to breathe hard danny had had to beat him off with the squashracquet handles before and hed had words with the animals nolessaggressive ownera young man in his twenties possibly one of those former windham college students who wouldnt move away the guy had a hippie appearance but was no pacifist he might have been one of the countless young men living in the putney area who called themselves carpenters if so he was a carpenter who either didnt work or was always at home mind your dog danny had called up the driveway to him that previous time fuck you run somewhere else the hippie carpenter had yelled back now here was the unchained dog again snapping at the runner danny moved to the farright side of the road and tried to outrun the dog but the huskyshepherd quickly gained on him danny stopped diagonally across the road from the hippie carpenters driveway and the dog stopped toocircling him his head low to the ground his teeth bared when the dog lunged at his thigh danny jabbed him in the ear with one of the sawedoff squash racquets when the huskyshepherd seized the racquet handle in his teeth danny hit the animal as hard as he could with the other handle both on the bridge of the nose and between the eyes one of his eyes was the lightblue color of a siberian huskys eyes and the other was the darkbrown more penetrating eye of a german shepherd the dog yelped and let go of the first racquet handle danny hit him on one ear then the other as the animal momentarily retreated leave my dog alone you son of a bitch the hippie carpenter yelled he was walking down his driveway between the rows of wrecked vehicles mind your dog was all danny told him he had started to run again before he saw the second dogso similarlooking to the first that danny thought for a moment it was the same dog then suddenly he had two dogs snapping at him the second one was always at his back call your dogs danny shouted to the hippie carpenter fuck you run somewhere else the guy said he was walking back up his driveway he didnt care if his dogs bit danny or not the dogs tried hard to bite him but danny managed to jam one of the racquet handles deep down the throat of the first dog and a lucky backhand swing caught the second dog in the facelashing one of its eyes as it was about to bite danny in the calf he kicked the dog choking on the squashracquet handle in the throat as the dog turned to run danny struck him behind one ear the dog fell but quickly got up again the second dog was slinking away the hippie carpenter was nowhere to be seen now that his dogs drew back to their territory in the driveway when danny had first moved to windham county thered been a bad dog on the back road between dummerston and the putney school danny had called the state police it was a similar hostiledogowner situation a state trooper had driven out there just to talk to the dog owner and when the dog attacked the trooper hed shot it deadright in the driveway what did you say to the dog owner danny had asked the trooper his name was jimmy theyd since become friends i told him to mind his dog jimmy had answered danny had been saying that ever since but with less authority than a state trooperclearly now without further incident he ran to the desimones house but danny didnt like it when hed had to break the pace hed picked up in his last couple of miles he told armando about the two dogs and the hippie carpenter call your friend jimmy armando said but danny explained that the state trooper would probably be forced to shoot both dogs why dont we kill just one of them armando suggested then maybe the hippie carpenter will get the idea that seems harsh danny said hed understood what armandos proposed method of killing one of the huskyshepherds would entail the desimones dog was a purebred german shepherd male named rooster even as a puppy rooster had stuck out his chest and strutted stifflegged and threatening in the presence of other male dogshence his name but rooster hadnt been bluffing fullgrown he was a dogkillerrooster hated other male dogs at least one of the dogs whod attacked danny was a male the writer couldnt be sure about the second dog because it had come at him from behind armando desimone was more than what amounted to danny angels only literary friend in putney armando was a real reader and he and danny argued about what they read in a reasonably constructive way but there was something innately confrontational in armando who reminded danny of a more civilized version of ketchum danny had a tendency to avoid confrontation which he often regretted people who picked an argument or a fight with the writer got the idea that he would never fight back they were surprised or their feelings were hurt when danny did come back at themthough not until the third or fourth provocation what danny had learned was that these people whod grown used to baiting or goading him were always indignant to discover that the writer had been keeping score armando didnt keep score when attacked he attacked backthe first time danny believed this was healthierfor a writer especiallybut it was not in his nature to be like armando in the disturbing case of the undisciplined dogs it was only because he believed armandos way was better that danny angel allowed himself to be persuaded then maybe the hippie carpenter will get the idea armando had reasoned the only way that would happen the writer should have known was if rooster bit the hippie carpenter yet rooster wasnt wired that way rooster never bit people just one dog armandoyou promise his wife mary said when they were all in the car with rooster driving back to dannys house tell roostermake him promise armando said hed been a boxer back when colleges and universities had boxing teams armando drove with danny up front in the passenger seat of the vw beetle seemingly longsuffering mary sat in the back with the panting german shepherd mary often seemed at odds with or put out by her husbands combativeness but danny knew that armando and mary were a formidable coupleat heart they were unassailably supportive of each other maybe mary was more like armando than armando danny remembered her remark when a fellow teacher had been fireda former colleague of marys at the grammar school and later of armandos at the putney school because justice is so rare its such a delight mary had remarked now danny wondered did mary only seem to disapprove of her husband appointing rooster as executioner in the end danny angel could only have said in his own defense that he did not acquiesce to the assassination of the dogeven a dog whod attacked himlightly yet somehow whenever armando was involvedon matters of moral authority especiallydanny did acquiesce oh you mean this asshole armando said when danny indicated the driveway with the dead cars you know him danny asked you know him armando said im sure he was one of your students at windham of course at windham armando said i didnt recognize him i dont think he was ever a student of mine danny told his friend do you remember all your mediocre students danny mary asked him hes just another hippie carpenteror noncarpenter as the case may be danny said but even to himself he didnt sound too sure about it perhaps hes a writer carpenter armando suggested danny hadnt considered that the young man might have known who danny angel was there were almost as many wouldbe writers in putney as there were hippies calling themselves carpenters the animosity or envy you encountered as a writer in vermont was often of a backroad mentality a huskyshepherd mix is generally no match for a purebred german shepherd but there were two of them then again maybe no two dogs were ever a match for rooster danny got out of the vw and pulled his seatback out of the way to let rooster out of the rear of the car the german shepherd had hardly touched the ground with his forepaws when the two mixed breeds attacked him danny just got back in the volkswagen and watched rooster killed one dog so quickly that neither danny nor the desimones could ascertain if the second dog was male or female it had crawled under the vw beetle where rooster couldnt get it the german shepherd had seized the first dog by the throat and had snapped his neck with a couple of shakes armando called rooster and danny let the german shepherd back into the beetle the hippie or writer carpenter had come out of his house and was staring at his dead dog he hadnt yet figured out that his other dog was cringing under the little car mind your dog danny said to himas armando slowly backed up over the remaining huskyshepherd mix there was just a bump when one of the front wheels rolled over the dog and a corresponding grunt from the dog the shepherdhusky got up stiffly and shook itself it was another male danny could see he saw the dog walk over to his dead mate sniffing the body while the asshole hippie watched the volkswagen beetle back out of his driveway but was this what mary or armando meant by justice maybe calling jimmy would have been a better idea danny thoughteven if the state trooper had wound up killing both dogs it was the dog owner someone should have shot and killed the writer believed that would have been a better story there are things ill miss about vermont if i ever have to leave danny angel was thinking but most of all he would miss armando and mary desimone he admired their certainty as the three friends swam in the pool at dannys putney property the dogkiller german shepherd watched over them rooster didnt swim but he did drink from a large bowl of cold water that danny had given him while the writer made gin and tonics for armando and mary looking back it would be dannys sharpest memory of roosterthe dog was panting with apparent satisfaction near the deep end of the pool the big shepherd loved little children but hated other male dogs something in the animals history must have made this so something neither danny nor the desimones ever knew rooster would one day be killed on a back roadstruck by a car while he was mindlessly chasing a schoolbus violence begets violence as ketchum and the cook already knew as one nearly forgotten hippie carpenter with one dead dog and one momentarily alive might one day figure out danny didnt know it but hed taken his last run on the back road between putney and westminster west it was a world of accidents right perhaps it was wise not to be too confrontational in such a world both their husbands had retired from the spruce mill in milan a world of small engine repair and other tinkering lay ahead of them the fat sawmill workers wivesdot and may those bad old broadstook every occasion that presented itself no matter how much driving was involved to leave town and their tiresome husbands retired men made a nuisance of themselves the two old ladies had discovered dot and may preferred their own company to anyone elses now that mays younger children and her older grandchildren were producing more children she used the excuse of being needed when whatever mother and whoevers new baby came home from the hospital wherever home was it was a way to get out of milan dot was always the driver they were both sixtyeight a couple of years older than ketchum whom they spotted occasionallyketchum lived in errol farther up the androscoggin the old logger never recognized dot or may nor would he have paid them any attention if he did recognize them but everyone noticed ketchum the woodsmans reputation as a wild man had marked him as surely as the scar on his forehead was a vivid advertisement of his violent history but dot had put on another sixty pounds or so and may another eighty they were whitehaired with those weatherworn faces you see in the north country and they ate their way through every day the way some people in cold climates do as if they were constantly starving theyd come across northern new hampshire on the groveton road through starkmuch of the way they were following the ammonoosucand in lancaster they crossed the connecticut into vermont they intersected i just below st johnsbury and followed the interstate south they had a long drive ahead of them but they were in no hurry to get there mays daughter or granddaughter had given birth in springfield massachusetts if dot and may arrived in time for supper they would necessarily get themselves involved in feeding a bunch of little kids and cleaning up after them the two old ladies were smarter than thattheyd decided they would stop somewhere for supper en route that way they could have a nice big meal by themselves and arrive in springfield well after suppertime with any luck someone else would have done the dishes and put the littlest kids to bed about the time those bad old broads were passing mcindoe falls on i the cook and his staff were finishing their midafternoon meal at avellino to have fed his staff a good meal and to watch everyone cleaning up and readying themselves for the evenings dinner service always made tony angel nostalgic he was thinking about those years in iowa city in the seventiesthat interlude from their life in vermont as both the cook and his son remembered it in iowa city tony angel had worked as a sous chef in the cheng brothers chinese restaurant out on first avenue what the cook called the coralville strip the cheng brothers might have had more business if theyd been closer to downtown they were too upscale for coralville overlooked among its fastfood joints and cheap motels but the brothers liked their proximity to the interstate and on those big ten sports weekends when an iowa team was competing at home the restaurant attracted lots of outoftowners it was too expensive for most students anywayunless their parents were payingand the university faculty whom the chengs considered their target clientele all had cars and werent limited to the bars and restaurants nearer the center of the campus downtown in tony angels opinion the name of the chengs restaurant was another questionable business decisionmaos might have worked better with politically disenchanted students than it did with their parents or the outoftown sports fansbut the cheng brothers were completely caught up in the antiwar protests of the time public opinion especially in a university town had turned against the war from till there were many demonstrations outside the old capitol on the iowa campus admittedly maos might have worked better in madison or ann arbor out on the coralville strip a passing patriotin a quickly disappearing car or pickup truckwould sometimes lob a brick or a rock through the restaurants window a warrior farmer said ah gou cheng dismissively he was the elder brother ah gou was shanghai dialect for big brother he was a terrific chef hed gone to cooking school at the culinary institute of america and hed grown up working in chinese restaurants born in queens hed moved to long island and then to manhattan a woman hed met in a karate class had lured ah gou to iowa but shed left him there by then ah gou was convinced that maos could make it in iowa city ah gou was just old enough to have missed the vietnam war but not the us army hed been an army cook in alaska no authentic ingredients there except the fish hed told tony angel ah gou had a fu manchu mustache and a black ponytail with a dyed orange streak in it ah gou had coached his younger brother on how to stay out of the vietnam war in the first place the little brother hadnt waited to be draftedhed volunteered just say you wont kill other asians ah gou had advised him otherwise sound gung ho the younger brother had said he would drive any vehicle anywhere and cook for anyone show me the combat ill drive into an ambush ill cook in a mortar attack i just wont kill other asians it was a gamble of coursethe army still might have taken him good coaching aside tony angel considered the younger brother didnt have to pretend to be crazyhe was certifiable that hed saved his little brother from the vietnam warand from killing or being killed by other asiansgave ah gou a certain chip on his shoulder maos did classic french or a mix of asian styles but ah gou kept the asian and french food separatedwith some exceptions maos version of oysters rockefeller was topped with panko japanese bread crumbs and ah gou used grapeseed oil and shallots to make the mayonnaise for his crabcakes the crab was tossed in the japanese bread crumbs with some chopped tarragon the panko didnt get soggy in the fridge the way other bread crumbs did the problem was they were in iowa where was ah gou going to get pankonot to mention oysters grapeseed oil and crabs that was where the crazy younger brother came in he was a born driver xiao dee meant little brother in shanghai dialect the xiao was pronounced like shaw xiao dee drove the cheng brothers refrigerated truckcomplete with two freezer unitsto lower manhattan and back once a week tony angel made the ambitious road trips with him it was a sixteenhour drive from iowa city to chinatown to the markets on pell and mott streets where the cook and xiao dee shopped if a woman in a karate class had lured ah gou to iowa xiao dee had two women driving him nutsone in rego park the other in bethpage the cook didnt really care which woman little brother was seeing tony angel missed the north end and he was equally fond of the small chinese communities in queens and on long island the people were friendly to him and affectionate with one another personally the cook would have preferred the rego park girlfriend whose name was spicy to the one in bethpage whose name he could neither remember nor pronounce and tony loved the shopping in chinatowneven the long drive back to iowa on i the cook shared the driving on the interstate with little brother but he let xiao dee do the driving around new york city they would leave iowa on a tuesday afternoon driving all night till dawn they emerged from the holland tunnel onto hudson and canal streets before the wednesday morning rush hour they were parked in the pell street or mott street area of chinatown when the markets opened they spent wednesday night in queens or on long island and left before the morning rush hour on thursday they would drive all day back to iowa city and unload the new goods at maos after dinnertime thursday evening the weekends were big at maos even the oysters and mussels and fresh fish from chinatown would still be fresh on friday nightif they were lucky on saturday night too the cook had never felt stronger hed been fortyeight fortynine and fifty in those iowa years but loading and unloading xiao dees refrigerated truck gave him the muscles of a professional mover there was a lot of heavy stuff on board the cases of tsingtao beer the vat of salt water with the smoking blocks of dry ice for the mussels the tubs of crushed ice for the oysters on the way back they would usually stop for more ice at a discountliquor store in indiana or illinois they kept the flounder the monkfish the sea bass the scottish salmon the scallops the shrimp the lap xuong sausage and all the crabs on ice too the whole way west the truck melted and sloshed one of the freezers always smelled like squid they kept the calamari frozen the big brown crocks of tianjin preserved vegetable from china had to be wrapped in newspaper or they would crack against themselves and break it was asking for bad luck to pack the japanese dried anchovies anywhere near the chinese preserved duck eggs xiao dee said once when they were crossing the bridge over the mississippi at east moline they swerved to avoid a bus with a blownout tire and all the scents of asia followed them home the broken jars of golden boy fish sauce for the green thai curry the shattered remains of the chinese soybean sauce fermented bean curd and formosa pork sung the many jagged edges from the thai mae ploy bottles of sweet chili sauce and red and green curry paste the truck was awash with sesame oil and soy sauce but it was mainly the hong kong chili garlic sauce that had endured the aura of garlic was somehow permeated with the lasting essence of japanese bonito tuna flakes and dried chinese shrimp black shiitake mushrooms turned up everywhere for weeks the cook and xiao dee had pulled off i immediately west of davenportjust to open the rear door of the truck and survey the spillage from the nearcollision over the mississippibut an indescribable odor forewarned them not to risk opening the truck until they were back at maos something undefined was leaking under the trucks rear door what does it smell like xiao dee asked the cook it was a brownish liquid with beer foam in itthey could both see that much everything tony angel answered kneeling on the pavement and sniffing the bottom of the door a motorcycle cop drove up and asked them if they needed assistance little brother kept all the receipts from their shopping in the glove compartment in case they were ever stopped and suspected of transporting stolen goods the cook explained to the policeman how theyd swerved on the bridge to avoid the incapacitated bus maybe we should just keep going and inspect the damage when we get to iowa city tony said the babyfaced cleanshaven xiao dee was nodding his head his glossy black ponytail tied with a pink ribbon some trifle of affection either spicy or the other girlfriend had given him it smells like a chinese restaurant the motorcycle cop commented to the cook thats what it is tony told him both little brother and the cook could tell that the cop wanted to see the mess inside now that theyd stopped they had no choice but to open the trucks rear door there was asia or at least the entire continents culinary aromas the pot of lychee nuts with almondmilk gelée the pungent shock of the strewn fresh ginger and the mitoku trading companys brand of miso leavesthe latter giving a fungal appearance to the walls and ceiling of the truck there was also a ghoulish monkfish staring at them from a foul sea of soy sauce and darkbrown icea contender for the title of ugliest fish in the world under the best of circumstances sweet jesus whats that the motorcycle cop asked monkfish the poor mans lobster xiao dee explained whats the name of your restaurant in iowa city the cop asked maos xiao dee answered proudly that place the motorcycle cop said you get the driveby vandalism right occasionally the cook admitted its because of the war xiao dee said defensively the farmers are hawks its because of the name the cop said maosno wonder you get vandalized this is the midwest you know iowa city isnt berkeley back in the truck that would forever smell like all of pell and mott streets on a bad morning such as when there was a garbage strike in lower manhattan the cook said to little brother the cop has a point you know about the name i mean xiao dee was hopped up on chocolateespresso balls which he kept in the glove compartment with all the receipts and ate nonstop when he drovejust to keep himself fanatically awake if the cook had more than two or three on the sixteenhour drive his heart would race until the following dayhis bowels indicating the pending onset of explosive diarrheaas if hed had two dozen cups of double espresso whats the matter with this country mao is just a name xiao dee cried this country has been getting its balls cut off in vietnam for ten years what does mao have to do with itits just a name the provocative pink ribbon spicy or the other girl had tied around his ponytail had come undone xiao dee resembled a hysterical woman weightlifter driving an entire chinese restaurant where you would surely be foodpoisoned to death lets just get home and unload the truck the cook proposed hoping to calm little brother down tony angel was trying to forget the image of the monkfish swimming through sesame oil and everything else that was afloat in the back of the truck the vat of sea water had spilled theyd lost all the mussels there would be no sakesteamed mussels in blackbean sauce that weekend no oysters rockefeller either to add insult to injury by the time xiao dee and the cook got back to iowa city ah gou had already chopped the spinach and diced the bacon for the oysters rockefeller the sea bass had perished en route but the monkfish was salvageablethe tail was the only usable part anyway and ah gou served it sliced in medallions the cook had learned to test the freshness of the scottish salmon by deboning it if the bones were hard to pull out ah gou said the fish was still pretty fresh the lap xuong sausage the fresh flounder and the frozen squid had survived the near collision with the bus but not the shrimp the scallops or the crabs ah gous favorite mascarpone and the parmesan were safe but the other cheeses had to go the bamboo mats or nori rollsfor rolling out the sushihad absorbed too much sesame oil and tsingtao beer xiao dee would hose out the truck every day for months but it would always smell of that near accident over the mississippi hed loved that time in iowa city including those road trips with xiao dee cheng tony angel was thinking every night on the menu at avellino was an item or two the cook had acquired from working with ah gou at maos at avellino the cook indicated the french or asian additions to his menu by writing simply something from asia or something from france hed learned this from ah gou at maos in an emergency when all the fish and the oysters and mussels had perished before saturday night ah gou asked the cook to do a pasta special or a pizza something from italy the menu at maos would then say the longdistance truckers who stopped off the interstate would invariably complain whats this fucking something from italy about i thought this was a chinese place were a little of everything xiao dee would tell themlittle brother was usually the weekend maître d while the cook and ah gou slaved away in the kitchen the rest of the staff at maos was a fiercely intelligent and multicultural collection of asian students from the universitymany of them not from asia but from seattle and san francisco or boston or new york tzumin ah gous relatively new girlfriend was a chinese lawschool student whod been an undergraduate at iowa just a couple of years before shed decided to stay in iowa city and not go back to taiwan because of maos and ah gou and the law school on thursday nights when xiao dee was still suffering the jazzedup aftereffects of the chocolateespresso balls tzumin would sub as the maître d they didnt have a radio at maos tony angel was remembering as he surveyed the place settings at avellino which on that latespring night was not quite open for business but soon would be at maos ah gou had kept a tv in the kitchenthe cause of many cut fingers and other knife or cleaver accidents in the cooks opinion but ah gou had liked sports and news sometimes the iowa football or basketball games were televised and that way the kitchen knew in advance whether to expect a celebratory or dejected crowd after the game in those years the iowa wrestling team rarely lostleast of all at homeand those dual meets brought an especially firedup and hungry crowd to maos daniel had taken young joe to most of the home matches the cook suddenly remembered maybe it had been the success of the iowa wrestling team that made joe want to wrestle when he went off to northfield mount hermon quite possibly ketchums reputation as a barroom brawler had had nothing to do with it tony angel had a garland eightburner stove with two ovens and a broiler in his kitchen at avellino he had a steam table for his chicken stocks too at maos at their busiest they could seat eighty or ninety people in an evening but avellino was smaller tony rarely fed more than thirty or forty people a nightfifty tops tonight the cook was working on a redwine reduction for the braised beef short ribs and he had both a light and a dark chicken stock on the steam table in the something from asia category he was serving ah gous beef satay with peanut sauce and assorted tempurajust some shrimp haricots verts and asparagus there were the usual pasta dishesthe calamari with black olives and pine nuts over penne among themand two popular pizzas the pepperoni with marinara sauce and a wildmushroom pizza with four cheeses he had a roast chicken with rosemary which was served on a bed of arugula and grilled fennel and a grilled leg of spring lamb with garlic and a wildmushroom risotto too greg the cooks young sous chef had been to cooking school on ninetysecond street in manhattan and was a fast learner tony was letting greg do a sauce grenobloise with brown butter and capers for the chicken paillardthat was the little something from france for the evening and tonys two favorite waitresses were on hand a single mother and her collegestudent daughter celeste the mom had worked for the cook since and the daughter loretta was more mature than the usual brattleboro high school kids he hired as waitresses busboys and dishwashers loretta was older than most college students shed had a baby her senior year in high school loretta was unmarried and had cared for the child in her moms house until the little boy was old enough four or five to not drive celeste crazy then loretta had gotten into a nearby community collegenot the easiest commute but shed arranged all her classes on a tuesdaythursday schedule she was back home in brattleboro still living with her mom and young son from every thursday night till the following tuesday morning since the cook had been sleeping with celesteonly for the last year going on eighteen monthsthe arrangement had worked well for tony angel he stayed in celestes house with celeste and her firstgrade grandson only two nights a weekon one of which every wednesday the restaurant was closed the cook moved back into his apartment whenever loretta came home to brattleboro it had been more awkward last summer when celeste moved into tonys small apartment above avellino for upwards of three or four nights at a time a redhead with very fetching freckles on her chest she was a big woman though not nearly the size of either injun jane or carmella celeste at fifty was as many years older than the cooks son danny as she was younger than the cook there was no hankypanky between them in the kitchen at avellino at their mutual insistencethough everyone on the staff loretta of course included knew that tony angel and celeste were a couple the lady friends the cook had met at the book cellar had since moved on or they were married now the old joke tony cracked to the bookseller was no longer acted upon it was an innocent joke when the cook asked the bookseller if she knew any women to introduce him to she either didnt or she wouldnt not with celeste in the picture brattleboro was a small town and celeste was a popular presence in it it had been easier to meet women in iowa tony angel was remembering granted he was older now and brattleboro was a very small town compared to iowa city where danny had invited his dad to all the writers workshop parties those women writers knew how to have a good time danny had treated his workshop students to an evening at maos on many occasionsnot least the celebration of the chinese new year every january or february when ah gou had presented a tencourse prixfixe menu for three nights in a row just before the chinese new year in it was the year of the ox the cook rememberedxiao dees truck had broken down in pennsylvania and tony angel and little brother almost hadnt made it back to iowa city with the goods in time in the year of the tiger tony thoughtxiao dee had convinced spicy to ride along to iowa city with them all the way from queens spicy was fortunately small but it was still a tight squeeze in the trucks cab and somewhere in indiana or illinois spicy figured out that xiao dee had been seeing a woman in bethpagethat nassau county cunt spicy called her the cook had listened to them argue the rest of the way somehow thinking of iowa city and maos had made tony angel consider that avellino lacked ambition but one of the things the cook loved about his brattleboro restaurant was that it was relatively easy to run real chefs like ah gou cheng and tony molinari and paul polcari might find avellino unambitious but the cook at fiftynine wasnt trying to compete with them one sadness was that tony angel wouldnt invite his old friends and mentors to come visit him in vermont and have a meal at avellino the cook felt that his brattleboro restaurant was unworthy of these superior chefs whod taught him so much though they probably would have been touched and flattered to have seen their obvious good influences on the menu at avellino and they surely would have supported the cooks pride in having his very own restaurant whichalbeit only in brattleborowas a local success since molinari and polcari were retired they could have come to vermont at their convenience it might have been harder for the cheng brothers to find the time ah gou and xiao dee had moved back east this on the good counsel of tzumin the young chinese lawyer whod married big brothershed given him some solid business advice and had never gone back to taiwan connecticut was closer to lower manhattan where little brother needed to shop it made no sense for the chengs to kill themselves while striving for authenticity in iowa the first name of their new restaurant baozi meant wrapped in chinese the cook remembered the golden pork spring rolls and braised pork baozi that ah gou made every chinese new year the steamed dough balls were split like a sandwich and filled with a braised pork shoulder that had been shredded and mixed with chinese fivespice powder but tzumin was the businessperson in the cheng family she changed the name of the restaurant to lemongrass which was both more marketable and more comprehensible in connecticut one day tony angel thought maybe daniel and i can drive down to connecticut and eat at lemongrass we could spend the night somewhere in the vicinity the cook missed ah gou and xiao dee and he wished them well whats the matter tony celeste asked him the cook was crying though hed not been aware of it nothings the matter celeste in fact im very happy tony said he smiled at her and bent over his redwine reduction savoring the smell hed blanched a sprig of fresh rosemary in boiling water just to draw out the oil before putting the rosemary in the red wine yeah well youre crying celeste told him memories i guess the cook said greg the sous chef was watching him too loretta came into the kitchen from the dining room are we going to unlock the place tonight or make the customers find a way to break in she asked the cook oh is it time tony angel asked he must have left his watch upstairs in the bedroom where hed not yet finished the galleys of east of bangor whats he crying about loretta asked her mother i was just asking him celeste said memories i guess good ones huh loretta asked the cook she took a clean dish towel from the rack and patted his cheek even the dishwasher and the busboy two brattleboro high school kids were watching tony angel with concern the cook and his sous chef were not rigid about sticking to their stations though normally greg did the grilling roasting and broiling while tony watched over the sauces you want me to be the saucier tonight boss greg asked the cook im fine tony told them all shaking his head dont you ever have memories danny calledi forgot to tell you loretta said to the cook hes coming in tonight yeah danny sounds like he had an exciting dayfor a writer celeste told tony he got attacked by two dogs rooster killed one he wanted a table at the usual time but just for one he said that barrett wouldnt appreciate the dog story he said tell pop ill see him later the pop had its origins in iowa city the cook liked it barrett was originally from england though shed lived in the united states for years her english accent struck tony angel as sounding more and more english every time he heard it people in america were overly impressed by english accents the cook thought perhaps english accents made many americans feel uneducated tony knew what his son had meant by barrett not appreciating the dog story although danny had been bitten by dogs when he was running barrett was one of those animal lovers who always took the dogs side there were no bad dogs only bad dog owners the vermont state police should never shoot anyones dog if danny didnt run with the squashracquet handles maybe the dogs wouldnt try to bite him and so forth but the cook knew that his son ran with the racquet handles because hed been bitten when he ran without themhed needed stitches twice but the rabies shots only once tony angel was glad that his son wasnt coming to dinner with barrett it bothered the cook that daniel had ever slept with a woman almost as old as his own father but barretts englishness and her belief that there were no bad dogs bothered tony more well wasnt an unexamined love of dogs to be expected from a horse person the cook asked himself tony angel used an old stanley woodstove from ireland for his pizzas he knew how to keep the oven at six hundred degrees without making the rest of the kitchen too hot but it had taken him two years to figure it out he was refilling the woodbox in the stanley when he heard loretta unlocking the front door and inviting the first customers into the dining room there was another phone call greg told the cook tony hoped that daniel hadnt changed his mind about coming to dinner or that his son hadnt decided to bring barrett with him but the other message was from ketchum the old logger had gone on and on to greg about the miraculous invention of the fax machine god knows for how long fax machines had been invented the cook thought but this was not the first hed heard about ketchum wanting one danny had been to new york and seen some rudimentary fax machine in operation in the production department of his publishing house in daniels estimation his father recalled it had been a bulky machine that produced oily scraps of paper with hardtoread writing but this didnt deter ketchum the formerly illiterate woodsman wanted danny and his dad to have fax machines then ketchum would get one and they could all be instantly in contact with one another dear god the cook was thinking there would be no end of faxes ill have to buy reams of paper and there will be no more peaceful mornings tony angel thought he loved his morning coffee and his favorite view of the connecticut like the cook ketchum was an early riser tony angel had never seen where ketchum lived in errol but hed envisioned something from the wanigan daysa trailer maybe or several trailers formerly mobile homes perhaps but no longer mobileor a volkswagen bus with a woodstove inside it and without any wheels that ketchum at sixtysix had only recently learned to read but now wanted a fax machine was unimaginable not that long ago ketchum hadnt even owned a phone the cook knew why he had cried his memories had nothing to do with it as soon as hed thought of taking a trip with his son to see the chengs in their connecticut restaurant tony angel had known that daniel would never do it the writer was a workaholic to the cooks thinking a kind of logorrhea had possessed his son that daniel was coming to dinner at avellino alone was fine with tony angel but that his son was alone and probably would remain so made the cook cry if he worried about his grandson joefor all the obvious dangers any eighteenyearold needed to be lucky to escapethe cook was sorry that his son daniel struck him as a terminally lonely melancholic soul hes even lonelier and more melancholic than i am tony angel was thinking table of four loretta was saying to greg the sous chef one wildmushroom pizza one pepperoni she told the cook celeste came into the kitchen from the dining room dannys here alone she said to tony one calamari with penne loretta went on reciting when it was busy she just left the two cooks her orders in writing but when there was almost no one in avellino loretta seemed to enjoy the drama of an outloud presentation the table of four doesnt want any first courses greg asked her they all want the arugula salad with the shaved parmesan loretta said youll love this one she paused for the full effect one chicken paillard but hold the capers christ greg said a sauce grenobloise is all about the capers just give the bozo the redwine reduction with rosemaryits as good on the chicken as it is on the braised beef tony angel said itll turn the chicken purple tony his sous chef complained youre such a purist greg the cook said then give the bozo the paillard with a little olive oil and lemon danny says to surprise him celeste told tony she was watching the cook closely shed heard him cry in his sleep too well that will be fun the cook said finally theres a smilealbeit a small oneceleste was thinking may was a talkative passenger while dot droveher head nodding but usually not in rhythm to whatever junk was playing on the radiomay read most of the road signs out loud the way children whove only recently learned to read sometimes do bellows falls may had announced as theyd passed that exit on imaybe fifteen or more minutes ago who would want to live in bellows falls you been there dot asked her old friend nope it just sounds awful may said its beginnin to look like suppertime isnt it dot asked i could eat a little somethin may admitted like what dot asked oh just half a bear or a whole cow i guess may said cackling dot cackled with her even half a cow would hit the spot dot more seriously proposed putney may read out loud as they passed the exit sign what kinda name is that do you suppose not injun from the sound of it dot said nope not injun may agreed the three brattleboro exits were coming up how bout a pizza dot said bratelburrow may enunciated with near perfection definitely not an injun name dot said and the two old ladies cackled some more theres gotta be a pizza place in brattleboro dontcha think may asked her friend lets have a look dot said she took the second brattleboro exit which brought her onto main street the book cellar may read out loud as they drove slowly past the bookstore on their right when they got to the next traffic light and the steep part of the hill they could see the marquee for the latchis theatre a couple of the previous years movies were playinga sylvester stallone double feature rocky iii and first blood i saw those movies dot said proudly you saw them with me may reminded her the two ladies were easily distracted by the movie marquee at the latchis and dot was driving dot couldnt drive and look at both sides of the street at the same time if it hadnt been for may her hungry passenger and compulsive signreader they might have missed seeing avellino altogether the avellino word was a tough one for may she stumbled over it but managed to say italian cooking where dot asked they had already driven past it back there park somewhere may told her friend it said italiani know it did they ended up in the supermarket parking lot before dot could gather her driving wits about her now well just have to hoof it she said to may dot didnt like to hoof it she had a bunion that was killing her and caused her to limp which made may recall cookies limp so that cookie had been on the bad old broads minds lately also the injun conversation in the car might have made them remember their longago time in twisted river i would walk a mile for a pizza or two may told her old friend one of cookies pizzas anyway dot said and that did it oh werent they good may exclaimed they had waddled their way to the latchis on the wrong side of the street and were nearly killed crossing main street in a haphazard fashion maybe milan was more forgiving to pedestrians than brattleboro both dot and may gave the finger to the driver whod almost hit them what was it cookie wanted to put in his pizza dough dot asked may honey may said and they both cackled but he changed his mind about it may remembered i wonder what his secret ingredient was dot said didnt have one maybe may replied with a shrug they had stopped in front of the big picture window at avellino where may struggled out loud to say the restaurants name it sure sounds like real italian dot decided the two women read the menu that was posted in the window two different pizzas dot observed im stickin to the pepperoni may told her friend you can die eatin wild mushrooms the thing about cookies crust was that it was really thin so you could eat a lot more pizza without gettin filled up dot was remembering inside a family of four was finishing their mealdot and may could see that the two kids had ordered pizzas there was a goodlooking man maybe fortyish sitting alone at a table near the swinging doors to the kitchen he was writing in a notebookjust a lined notebook of the kind students use the old ladies didnt recognize danny of course hed been twelve when theyd last seen him and now he was a whole decade older than his father was when dot and may had last seen the cook danny had looked up when the old ladies came in but hed quickly turned his attention back to whatever he was writing he might not even have remembered what dot and may looked like in twentynine years later danny didnt have the slightest idea who those bad old broads were just the two of you ladies celeste asked them it always amused dot and may when anyone thought of them as ladies they were given a table near the window under the old blackandwhite photograph of the longago logjam in brattleboro they used to drive logs down the connecticut dot said to may this must have been a mill town in its day may remarked sawmills paper maybetextiles too i suppose theres an insane asylum in this town i hear dot told her friend when the waitress came to pour them water dot asked celeste about it is the loony bin still operatin here its called the retreat celeste explained thats a sneaky fuck of a name for it may said she and dot were cackling again when celeste went to get them menus shed forgotten to bring the old biddies menus when she brought them their water celeste was still distracted by the cooks crying a young couple came in and dot and may observed a younger waitresscelestes daughter lorettashowing them to their table when celeste came back with the menus dot said well both have the pepperoni pizza she and may had already had a look at the menu in the window one each or one to share celeste asked them just looking at these two celeste knew the answer one each may told her would you like a salad or a first course celeste asked the old ladies nope im saving room for the apple pie may answered dot said i imagine ill be havin the blueberry cobbler they both ordered cokesreal ones may emphasized to celeste for the drive ahead not to mention the slew of children and grandchildren dot and may wanted all the caffeine and sugar they could get i swear may said to dot if my kids and grandkids keep havin more kids you can check me into that socalled retreat ill come visit you her friend dot told her if the pizzas any good she added in the kitchen at avellino maybe the cook had heard the old ladies cackling two pepperoni pizzas celeste told him two probable pie and cobbler customers who are they the cook asked her he wasnt usually so curious a couple of locals a couple of bad old broads if you ask melocals or otherwise celeste said it was almost time for the red sox game on the radio boston was playing at home in fenway park but greg was listening to some sentimental crap called the oldiebutgoldie hour on another station the cook hadnt really been paying attention but the featured recording from was surrealistic pillowthe old jefferson airplane album when tony angel recognized grace slicks voice singing somebody to love he spoke with uncharacteristic sharpness to his sous chef time for the game greg the cook said just lemme hear the sous chef started to say but tony abruptly switched stations everyone had heard the impatience in his voice and seen the angry way hed reached for the radio all the cook could say for himself was i dont like that song with a shrug celeste said to them all memories i guess just one thin wall and two swinging doors away were two more old memories unfortunately the cook would not get rid of dot and may as easily as hed cut off that song on the radio chapter the fragile unpredictable nature of things out on the coralville strip within sight of maos thered been a pizza place called the greeks kalamata olives and feta cheese was the favorite topping as dannys dad had said at the time it isnt bad but it isnt pizza in downtown iowa city was an imitation irish pub called orourkespool tables green beer every st patricks day bratwurst or meatball sandwiches to danny orourkes was strictly a student hangoutan unconvincing copy of those boston pubs south of the haymarket in the vicinity of hanover street the oldest of these was the union oyster house a clam bar and restaurant which would one day be across the street from a holocaust commemoration site but there was also the bell in hand tavern on the corner of union and marshall streetsa pub where the underage daniel baciagalupo had gotten drunk on beer with his older saetta and calogero cousins those taverns had not been far enough out of the north end to have escaped the cooks attention one day hed followed daniel and his cousins to the bell in hand when the cook saw his young son drinking a beer hed pulled the boy out of the tavern by his ear as the writer danny angel sat working away in his notebook at avellinowaiting for his dad the cook to surprise himhe wished that his humiliation in the bell in hand in front of his older cousins had been sufficient to make him stop drinking before he really got started but in order to stop himself danny had needed a greater fright and subsequent humiliation than that earlier misadventure in a boston bar it would come but not before he was a father if becoming a parent doesnt make you responsible the cook had once said to his son nothing will had danny been thinking as a father when hed typed a onepage message to the hippie carpenter and had driven out the back road to westminster west in order to put the message in the asshole dog owners mailbox before driving to brattleboro and his surprise dinner at avellino was this what the writer would have wanted young joe to do if his son were to find himself in a similarly hostile situation i am truly sorry your dog is dead danny had typed i was angry you take no responsibility for your dogs and you wont acknowledge that a public road is not your dogs territory but i should have held my temper better than i did ill run somewhere else youve lost a dog ill give up my favorite run enough is enough okay it was just a plain piece of typing paper the writer didnt include his name if armando was rightif the asshole was a writer carpenter andor one of dannys former students at windham then of course the infuriating dog owner already knew that the runner with the squashracquet handles was the writer danny angel but danny saw no reason to advertise this he didnt put the piece of paper in an envelope either hed just folded it twice and put it in the dog owners mailbox out where the driveway lined with dead vehicles met the road now as he sat writing in avellino danny knew what armando would say you dont try to make peace with assholes or words to that effect but armando didnt have children did that make armando more unafraid the very idea of an altercation escalating out of controlwell wasnt that high on the list of things to protect your children from in the notebook where danny was scribbling to himself the phrase a nameless fear stood out with an identifying awkwardness in several unfinished sentences as a boy and as a young man danny had always assumed that his dad and ketchum were different chiefly because his dad was a cook and ketchum was a river drivera logger tougher than his caulk boots an intemperate woodsman who would never back down from a fight but ketchum was estranged from his children hed already lost them it wasnt necessarily true that ketchum was braver or more bold than the cook ketchum wasnt a father not anymore he didnt have as much to lose danny only now understood that his dad had been doing his best to look out for him leaving twisted river had been a fathers decision and the cook and his son were both trying to look out for young joe their mutual fear for the boy had brought danny and his dad closer together hed felt close to his father in iowa city too the writer was remembering their asian interlude as danny thought of iowa that second time around his dads steadiest girlfriend those years in iowa city had been an er nurse at mercy hospital yiyiing was chinese she was dannys agein her early thirties almost twenty years younger than the cookand she had a daughter who was joes age back in hong kong her husband had left her upon the daughters birthhed wanted a sonand yiyiing had trusted her mother and father to care for her child while shed made a new life for herself in the midwest the nursing career had been a good choice and so had iowa city the doctors at mercy hospital had declared that yiyiing was indispensable she had her green card and was on track to become a us citizen of course yiyiing would hear the occasional gook wordthe most common insult from a prejudiced patient in the emergency room and from an unseen driver or passenger in a moving car but it didnt faze her to be mistaken for the war bride of a vietnam vet she had a harder uphill task ahead of hernamely moving her daughter and her parents to the united states but she was well on her way to unraveling the red tape that was involved yiyiing had her own reasons for remaining undistracted from achieving her goal shed been assured it would be easier to bring her family to the united states once the war in vietnam was over it was only a matter of time a reliable authority had told her what yiyiing had said to tony angel was that it wasnt the time for her to be romantically involved maybe this was music to his dads ears danny had thought at the time quite possibly given yiyiings heroic undertaking the cook was a consoling and undemanding partner for her with so much of his life lost to the past tony angel wasnt exactly seeking socalled romantic involvement either moreover that the cooks grandson was the same age as yiyiings daughter gave the nurse a motherly affection for young joe danny and his dad always had to think about joe before including new women in their lives danny had liked yiyiingno small part of the reason being how sincerely shed paid attention to joethough it was awkward that yiyiing was dannys age and that the writer was attracted to her in those three years danny and his dad had rented three different houses on court street in iowa city all from tenured faculty on sabbaticals court street was treelined with large threestory houses it was a kind of residential faculty row the street was also within safe walking distance of the longfellow elementary school where joe would attend second third and fourth grades court street was somewhat removed from downtown iowa city and danny never had to drive on iowa avenue where hed earlier lived with katienot in any case on his way to and from the englishphilosophy building on the iowa river the epb as it was called was where dannys office at the writers workshop was as big as the rental houses on court street were danny didnt write at homelargely because yiyiing worked irregular hours in the er at mercy hospital she often slept in the cooks bedroom until midday when she would come down to the kitchen and fix herself something to eat in her silk pajamas when she wasnt working at the hospital yiyiing lived in her slinky hong kong pajamas danny liked walking joe to school and then going to write at the englishphilosophy building when his office door was closed his students and the other faculty knew not to bother him yiyiing was small of stature short but surprisingly heavyset with a pretty face and long coalblack hair she had many pairs of the silk pajamas in a variety of vibrant colors as danny recalled even her black pajamas appeared to vibrate this parenthetical non sequitur long after hed begun his mornings writingan alluring image of yiyiing in her vibrating pajamas asleep in his fathers bedwas a lingering distraction yiyiing and her pajamas or their enticing presence traveled to the englishphilosophy building with danny i dont know how you can write in such a sterile building the writer raymond carver said of the epb ray was a colleague of danny angels at the workshop in those years its not as sterile as you may think danny said to ray another writer colleague john cheever compared the epb to a hotelone catering to conventioneersbut danny liked his fourthfloor office there most mornings the offices and classrooms of the writers workshop were deserted no one but the workshops administrative assistant was ever there and she was good about taking messages and not putting through any phone callsnot unless there was a call from young joe or dannys dad the aesthetics of a given workplace notwithstanding writers tend to love where they work well for as much of the day as joe was safe in school danny grew to love the epb the fourth floor was silent a virtual sanctuaryprovided he left by midafternoon usually writers dont confine their writing to the good things do they danny angel was thinking as he scribbled away in his notebook at avellino where iowa city was foremost on his mind the baby in the road he had writtena chapter title possibly but there was more to it than that hed crossed out the the and had written a baby in the road but neither article pleased himhe quickly crossed out the a too above where he was writing on the same page of the notebook was more evidence of the writers reluctance to use an articlethe blue mustang had been revised to blue mustang maybe just baby in the road was the way to go to anyone seeing the fortyoneyearold writers expression this exercise was both more meaningful and more painful than a mere title search to dot and may the troubledlooking young author seemed strangely attractive and familiar waiting for their food they both watched him intently in the absence of signs to read out loud may was at a momentary loss for words but dot whispered to her friend whatever hes writin hes not havin any fun doin it i could give him some fun doin it may whispered back and both ladies commenced to cackling in their inimitable fashion at this moment in time it took a lot to distract danny from his writing the blue mustang and the baby in the road had seized the writers attention almost completely that one or the other might make a good title was immaterial both the blue mustang and the baby in the road were triggers to dannys imagination and they meant much more to him than titles yet the distinctive cackles of the two old ladies caused danny to look up from his notebook whereupon dot and may quickly looked away theyd been staring at himthat much was clear to danny who would have sworn that hed heard the fat womens indelible and derisive laughter before but where and when too long ago for danny to remember obviously seized as he was by those fresher more memorable details the speeding blue mustang and that helpless baby in the road danny was a far distance from the twelveyearold hed been in the cookhouse kitchen where and when dot and mays cackling had once been as constant as punctuation the writer returned his attention to his notebook he was imagining iowa city but he was closer to that time in twisted river than he could have known their first year on court street danny and his dad and joe gradually grew used to sharing the house with yiyiing and her vibrant pajamas shed arranged her schedule at the hospital so that she was usually in the house when joe came home from school this was before joes bikeriding began in earnest and what girlfriends danny had were transient the writers passing acquaintances rarely spent the night in the court street house the cook left for the kitchen at maos every midafternoonthat is when he wasnt driving to lower manhattan and back with xiao dee cheng those two nights a week when tony angel was on the road yiyiing didnt stay in the court street house shed kept her own apartment near mercy hospital maybe she knew all along that danny was attracted to heryiyiing did nothing to encourage him it was the cook and young joe who received all her attention though shed been the first to speak to danny when joe started riding his bike to school by then theyd all moved into the second house on court street it was nearer the commuter traffic on muscatine avenue but there were only small backstreets between court street and the longfellow elementary school even so yiyiing told danny that he should make joe ride his bike on the sidewalkand when the boy had to cross a street he should walk his bike she said kids on bikes get hit by cars all the time in this town yiyiing told danny he tried to overlook whichever pair of pajamas she was wearing at the moment he knew he should focus on her experience as an emergencyroom nurse i see them all the timethere was one in the er last night she said some kid was riding his bike at night danny asked her he got hit on dodge street when it was still daylight but he was in the er all night yiyiing said is he going to be all right danny asked yiyiing shook her head she was making tea for herself in the kitchen of the second court street house and a thin piece of toast dangled like a cigarette from her lower lip joe was home sick from school and danny had been writing at the kitchen table just make joe ride his bike on the sidewalk yiyiing said and if he wants to go downtownor to the pool or the zoo in city parkfor gods sake make him walk or take the bus okay danny told her she sat down at the table with him with her tea and the rest of her toast what are you doing home yiyiing asked him im here arent i im awake you should go write in your office im a nurse dannyi can look after joe okay danny said again just how safe could joe get the writer was wondering the boy had an er nurse taking care of him not to mention two japanese babysitters most nights both the cook and his emergencyroom nurse were working either danny stayed home with joe or one of the japanese twins looked after the boy sao and kaoris parents were from yokohama originally but the twins had been born in san francisco and theyd grown up there one night the cook had brought them home from maos hed woken up danny to introduce him to the twins and hed taken sao and kaori into joes room to allow them to observe the sleeping boy see tony whispered to the twins while danny lay bewildered and barely awake in his bed this child is an angelhes easy to look after the cook had disapproved of danny asking his workshop students to babysit for joe dannys students were writershence easily distracted or preoccupied in tony angels opinion young writers lived in their imaginations didnt they the cook had asked his son danny knew that his dad had always distrusted imagination furthermore these young writers were graduate students many of them were older than the usual graduate students too theyre too old to be competent babysitters the cook had said his dads theory was new to danny but he liked sao and kaori the identical twinsthough he could never tell them apart over time joe could and wasnt that all that mattered the yokohamas as danny thought of the twinsas if yokohama were their family namewere undergraduates and parttime waitresses at maos therefore iowa city had a decidedly asian flavor not only for the cook but for danny and young joe the twins spoke japanese to each other which joe loved but danny found distracting most nights when sao worked at maos kaori was joes babysitteror vice versa in which case no japanese was spoken the yokohamas had at first maintained a distant respect for yiyiing whose er schedule did not often allow her to coincide in the house with either sao or kaori they were more likely to run into one another at maos where yiyiing occasionally came late and by herself to dinnerthough she preferred the allnight shift in the emergency room to working daytime hours one night when xiao dee was the maître d he mistook yiyiing for one of the waitresses who worked at maos youre late he told her im a customeri have a reservation yiyiing told little brother oh shityoure tonys nurse xiao dee said tonys too young to need a nurse yet yiyiing replied later the cook tried to defend xiao dee hes a good driverhes just a shitty maître d but yiyiing was sensitive the americans think im vietnamese and some shanghai clown from queens thinks im a waitress she told tony unfortunately one of the japanese twins who was a waitressat this moment she was also young joes babysitteroverheard yiyiing say this whats so bad about being a waitress sao or kaori asked the nurse the japanese twins had also been mistaken for vietnamese war brides in iowa city most people in their native san francisco either sao or kaori had explained to danny could tell the japanese and vietnamese apart apparently this was not the case in the midwest to this shameful lumping together what could danny truthfully say after all he still couldnt tell sao and kaori apart and after yiyiing used the waitress word as an epithet the yokohamas formerly distant respect for the nurse from hong kong grew more distant were all one happy family danny would later try to explain to one of his older workshop students youn was a writer from seoul she came into dannys fiction workshop the second year he was back in iowa city there were some vietnam vets among the workshop students in those yearsthey too were older and there were a few women writers whod interrupted their writing lives to get married and have children and get divorced these older graduate students had an advantage over the younger writers whod come to the writers workshop right out of college the older ones had something to write about youn certainly did shed been a slave to an arranged marriage in seoul virtually arranged was how she first described the marriage in the novel she was writing danny had criticized the virtually either it was an arranged marriage or it wasnt right hed asked youn her skin was as pale as milk her black hair was cut short with bangs under which her big darkbrown eyes made her appear waifish though youn was over thirtyshe was exactly dannys ageand her efforts to get her reallife husband to divorce her so she wouldnt be dragged through the korean rigmarole of trying to divorce him gave her novelinprogress a labyrinthine plot if you could believe either her actual story or her novel the writer danny angel had thought when hed first met her and had read the early chapters danny didnt know if he could trust hereither as a woman or as a writer but hed liked her from the beginning and dannys developing attraction to youn at least alleviated his inappropriate fantasizing about his fathers girlfriend in her countless pairs of pajamas well the cook had said to his son after danny introduced him to youn if theres a chinese nurse and two japanese girls in the house why not a korean writer too but they were all hiding something werent they certainly the cook and his son were in hidingthey were fugitives his dads chinese nurse gave danny the impression that there was something she wasnt saying as for dannys korean writer he knew she exhibited a seemingly willful lack of clarityhe didnt mean only in her prose there was no fault to be found with the japanese babysitters whose affection for young joe was genuine and whose fondness for the cook stemmed from the camaraderie of them all working together in the ambitious chaos of asian and french cuisine at maos not that yiyiings rapt attention to joe was insincere the er nurse was a truly good soul it was her relationship with the cook that amounted to a compromise perhaps to them both but tony angel had long been wary of women and he was used to hedging his bets it was yiyiing who shouldnt have tolerated tonys shortterm flings with those traveling women he met at the writers workshop parties but the nurse accepted even this from the cook yiyiing liked living with a young boy the same age as her missing daughter she liked being a mother to someone being a part of the cooks allmale family may also have struck yiyiing as a bohemian adventureone she might not find so easy to slip into once her daughter and parents finally joined her in america to those bold young doctors at mercy hospital who would inquire as to her statuswas she married or did she have a boyfriend they wanted to knowyiyiing always said to their surprise i live with the writer danny angel she must have liked saying this for reasons beyond it being a conversationstopper because it was only to her closer friends and acquaintances that yiyiing would bother to add well actually im dating dannys father hes a cook at maosnot the chinese one but the cook understood that it was complicated for yiyiinga woman in her thirties with an unsettled life living so far away from her native land and with a daughter she knew only from photographs once at a party someone who worked at mercy hospital said to danny oh i know your girlfriend what girlfriend danny had asked this was before youn came into his fiction workshop and before long had moved into the second house on court street yiyiingshes chinese a nurse at shes my dads girlfriend the writer quickly said oh whats going on with yiyiing danny had later asked his father some people think shes living with me i dont question yiyiing daniel she doesnt question me the cook pointed out and isnt she terrific with joe his dad asked him both of them knew very well that this was the same point danny had made to his father about his former windham college student franky back in vermontyet it was strange nonetheless danny thought was the cook who was turning fifty more of a bohemian than his writer son at least until youn moved into that second court street house and what was it that was wrong about that house it had been big enough for them all that wasnt it there were enough bedrooms so that everyone could have slept separately youn used one of the extra bedrooms as a place to write and for all her things for a woman over thirty whod had no children and endured an incomprehensible korean divorceat least it was incomprehensible in her novelinprogress or so danny thoughtyoun had remarkably few things had she left everything behind in seoul not just her truly terrifyingsounding former husband im a student shed said to danny that is what is so liberating about being a student againi dont have any things it was a smart answer the writer thought but danny didnt know if he believed her in the fall of when joe was starting third grade the cook kept a crate of apples on the back porch of their iowa city house the porch overlooked a narrow paved alley it ran the length of the long row of houses that fronted court street the alley didnt appear to be used for anything except for picking up garbage only an occasional slowmoving car passed andmore often even constantlykids on bicycles there was some loose sand or gravel on the littleused pavement which meant the kids could practice skids on their bikes joe had fallen off his bike in that back alley yiyiing had cleaned the scrape on the boys knee a porch off the kitchen faced the alley and something was eating the apples that the cook left out on the porcha raccoon danny at first suspected but it was a possum actually and one early evening when young joe went out on the porch to fetch an apple for himself he put his hand in the crate and the possum scared him it growled or hissed or snarled the boy was so scared that he couldnt even say for sure if the primitivelooking animal had bitten him all danny kept asking was did it bite you he couldnt stop examining joes arms and hands for bite marks i dont know the boy wailed it was white and pinkit looked awful what was it a possum danny kept repeating hed seen it slink away possums were uglylooking creatures that night when joe fell asleep danny went into the boys bedroom and examined him all over he wished yiyiing was home but she was working in the er she would know if possums were occasionally rabidin vermont raccoons often wereand the good nurse would know what to do if joe had been bitten but danny couldnt find a bite mark anywhere on his sons perfect body youn had stood in the open doorway of the boys bedroom shed watched danny looking for any indication of an animal bite wouldnt joe know if he was bitten she asked he was too startled and too scared to know danny answered her youn was staring at the sleeping boy as if he were a wild or unknown animal to her and danny realized that she often looked at joe with this puzzled fromanotherworld fascination if yiyiing doted on joe because she longed to be with her daughter of that same age youn looked at joe with what appeared to be incomprehension it was as if shed never been around children of any age before then again if one could believe her story or her novel her success in obtaining a divorce from her husbandmost important in getting him to initiate the allegedly complicated procedurewas due to her failure to get pregnant and have a child that was her novels tortuous plot how her husband presumed she was trying to get pregnant when all along shed been taking birthcontrol pills and using a diaphragmshe was doing all she could not to get pregnant and to never have a child youn was writing her novel in english not korean and her english was excellent danny thought her writing was good though certain korean elements remained mystifying what was korean divorce law anyway why was the charade of pretending to try to get pregnant necessary and according to youn shed hated taking birthcontrol pills the husbandultimately danny assumed the exhusbandin youns novel was a kind of gangster businessman perhaps he was a wellpaid assassin or he hired lesser hit men to do his dirty work in dannys reading of youns novelinprogress this wasnt clear that the husband was dangerousin both youns real life and her novelseemed obvious danny could only wonder about the sexual detail there was something sympathetic about the husband despite youns efforts to demonize him the poor man imagined it was his fault that his scheming wife couldnt get pregnant it didnt help that in bed at night youn told danny the worst details of her miserable marriageher husbands tireless need for sex included but he was trying to get you pregnant wasnt he danny wanted to ask though he didnt maybe sex had felt like a duty to youns unfortunate husband and to youn the things she told danny in the dark and the details of her novels were becoming blurredor were they interchangeable shouldnt the fictional husband the coldbloodedkiller executive in her novel have a different name from her actual exhusband danny had asked youn what if her former husband ever read her novel assuming she could get it published wouldnt he then know how shed deceived himby deliberately trying not to get pregnant when they were married my previous life is over youn answered him darkly she did not seem to associate sex with duty now though danny couldnt help but wonder about that too youn was extraordinarily neat with her few belongings she even kept her toilet articles in the small bathroom attached to the unused bedroom where she wrote her clothes were in the closet of that bedroom or in the lone chest of drawers that was there once when youn was out danny had looked in the medicine cabinet of the bathroom she used he saw her birthcontrol pillsit was an iowa city prescription danny always used a condom it was an old habitand given his history of occasionally having more than one sexual partner not a bad one but youn had said to him one time almost casually thank you for using a condom ive taken a lifetime of birthcontrol pills i dont ever want to take them again but she was taking them wasnt she well if dannys dad didnt question yiyiing why should danny expect answers to everything from youn hadnt her life been complicated too it was into this careless world of unasked or unanswered questionsnot only of an asian variety but including some longstanding secrets between the cook and his writer sonthat a blue mustang brought them all to their senses albeit only momentarily regarding the fragile unpredictable nature of things on saturday mornings in the fall when there was an iowa home football game danny could hear the iowa band playinghe never knew where if the band had been practicing in kinnick stadium across the iowa river and up the hill could he have heard the music so far away on court street on the eastern side of town that saturday it was bright and fair and danny had tickets to take joe to the football game hed gotten up early and had made the boy pancakes friday had been a late night for the cook at maos and the saturday night following a home football game would be later that morning dannys dad was still in bed so was yiyiing whod finished her usual night shift at mercy hospital danny didnt expect to see the pajama lady before noon it was joes neighborhood friend max an iowa faculty kid in joes thirdgrade class at longfellow elementary whod first referred to yiyiing as the pajama lady the eightyearold couldnt remember yiyiings name danny was washing his and joes breakfast dishes while joe was playing outside with max they were riding their bicycles in the back alley again theyd taken some apples from the crate on the porch but not to eat them the boys were using the apples as slalom gates danny would later realize he liked max but the kid rode his bike all over town it was a source of some friction between danny and joe that joe wasnt allowed to do this max was a fanatical collector of posters stickers and sewon insignia all advertising brands of beer the kid had given dozens of these to joe who had yiyiing sew the various insignia on his jean jacket the stickers were plastered to the fridge and the posters hung in joes bedroom it was funny danny thought and totally innocent after all the eightyearolds werent drinking the beer what danny would remember foremost about the car was the sudden screech of tires he saw only a blue blur pass by the kitchen window the writer ran out on the back porch where hed previously thought the only threat to his son was a possum joe danny called but there was no answeronly the sound of the blue car hitting some trash barrels at the farthest end of the alley mr angel danny heard max calling the boy was almost never off his bike but this time danny saw him running several of the apples placed as slalom gates had been squashed flat in the alley danny saw that both boys bikes were lying on their sides off the pavement joe lay curled up in a fetal position next to his bike danny could see that joe was conscious and he appeared more frightened than hurt did it hit you did the car hit you he asked his son the boy quickly shook his head but otherwise wouldnt move he just stayed in a tight ball we crashed trying to get out of the waythe mustang was coming right at us max said it was the blue mustangit always goes too fast max told danny its gotta be a customized jobits a funny blue youve seen the car before danny asked clearly max knew cars yeah but not herenot in the alley the boy said go get the pajama lady max danny told the kid you can find her shes upstairs with my pop danny had never called his dad a pop before where the word came from must have had something to do with the fright of the moment he knelt beside joe almost afraid to touch him while the boy shivered he was like a fetus willing himself back to the womb or trying to the writer thought joe his father said does anything hurt is anything broken can you move i couldnt see a driver it was just a car the boy saidstill not moving except for the shivering probably the sunlight had been reflecting off the windshield danny thought some teenager ill bet danny said there was no driver joe insisted later max would claim to have never seen the driver though hed seen the speeding blue mustang in the neighborhood before pajama lady danny heard max calling pop the cook had sat up in bed beside the drowsy yiyiing whos pop do you suppose he asked her im guessing that im the pajama lady yiyiing answered sleepily you must be pop quite a commotion ensued when yiyiing and the cook learned that joe had fallen off his bike and thered been a car involved max would probably take to his grave the image of how fast the pajama lady ran barefoot to the scene of the accident where joe was now sitting uprocking back and forth in his fathers arms the cook with his limp was slower to arrive by then youn had interrupted her novelinprogress to see what was the matter the elegantly dressed dame at the farthest end of the alleyher trash barrels had been knocked over by the vanishing blue mustangapproached fearfully she was elderly and frail but she wanted to see if the boys on their bicycles were all right like max the regal old woman had seen the blue mustang in the neighborhood beforebut never the driver what kind of blue danny asked her not a common blueits too blue the old dame said its a customized job mr angeli told you max said youre all right youre all right yiyiing kept saying to joe she was feeling the boy all over you never hit your head did you she asked him he shook his head then she began to tickle him maybe to relieve them both her hong kong pajamas this morning were an iridescent fishscale green everythings fine isnt it youn asked danny the korean divorcée probably wanted to get back to her writing no everything isnt fine the writer danny angel was thinkingnot with the driverless blue mustang on the loosebut he smiled at her youn was also barefoot wearing a tshirt and jeans and at his worriedlooking father the cook must have limped naked into the upstairs hall before he realized he lacked clothes because he was wearing just a pair of dannys running shorts danny had left them on the railing at the top of the stairs are you taking a run pop danny asked his dad the new word seeming strangely natural to them bothas if a bullet dodged marked a turning point or a new beginning in both their lives and young joes maybe it did colby was the cops name officer colby the cook kept calling him in the kitchen of the court street houseperhaps in mock respect of that other longago policeman in his life except for the bad haircut the young iowa city cop in no way resembled carl colby was fairskinned with scandinavianblue eyes and a neatly trimmed blond mustache he apologized for not responding sooner to dannys call about the dangerous driver but those weekends when the iowa football team played at home kept the local police busy the policemans demeanor was at once friendly and earnestdanny liked him immediately the writer could not help but observe how observant the policeman was colby had an eye for small details such as those beer stickers on the fridge officer colby told danny and his dad that hed received previous reports of a blue mustang as max had said the car was probably a customized job but there were some inconsistencies in the various sightings the hood ornament was either the original mustang oraccording to a hysterical housewife in the parking lot of a supermarket near fairchild and dodgean obscene version of a centaur other witnesses identified a nonspecific but clearly outofstate license plate while a university student whod been run off dubuque street on his motorcycle said that the blue mustang definitely had iowa plates as officer colby told the cook and his writer son there were no descriptions of the driver the boys will be home from school any minute danny said to the cop whod politely glanced at his watch you can talk to them i saw nothing but an unusual shade of blue may i see your sons room the officer asked a curious request danny thought but he saw no reason to object it took only a minute and colby made no comment on the beer posters the three men returned to the kitchen to wait for the kids as for the back alley where the blue mustang had almost hit the boys on their bikes officer colby pronounced it safe for bikeriding under normal circumstances however the officer seemed to share yiyiings overall feelings about kids on bicycles in iowa city it was better for the kids to walk or take the buscertainly they should avoid riding their bikes downtown there were more and more students driving many of them newcomers to the university townnot to mention the outoftowners on the big sports weekends joe doesnt ride his bike downtownonly in this neighborhoodand he always walks his bike across the street danny told the policeman who looked as if he doubted this no really the writer said im not so sure about max our neighbors eightyearold i think maxs parents are more liberali mean concerning where max can ride his bike here they are the cook said hed been watching the back alley for joe and max to appear on their bicycles the eightyearolds seemed surprised to see officer colby in the kitchen like the third graders they were and almost as if they were passing a secret message in class they looked quickly at each other and then stared at the kitchen floor the beertruck boys colby said maybe you boys should keep in mind that the blue mustang has been seen all over town the officer turned his attention to danny and his dad theyre good kids but they like getting beer stickers and posters and those sewon badges from the beertruck drivers i see these boys at the bars downtown i just remind them that they cant go inside the bars and i occasionally have to tell them not to follow the beer trucks from bar to barnot on their bikes clinton and burlington streets are particularly bad for bikes joe couldnt look at his dad or grandfather the beertruck boys the cook repeated i gotta go home max said he was that quickly gone when i see these boys in city park colby went on i tell them i hope theyre not riding their bikes on dubuque street its safer to take the footbridge behind the student union and ride their bikes along the hancher side of the river but i suppose it takes you longer to get to the park or the zoo that waydoesnt it officer colby asked joe the boy just nodded his head he knew hed been busted very early the next morning when youn was sound asleep and yiyiing hadnt yet come home from her night shift at mercy hospital danny went into joes bedroom and observed the eightyearold asleep in what amounted to a shrine to various brands of beer wake up he said to his son shaking him gently its too early for school isnt it joe asked maybe youll miss school this morning his father said well just tell the school youre sick but i feel fine the boy said get up and get dressed joeyoure not fine his dad told him youre deadyouve already died they left the house without having any breakfast walking down to muscatine avenue in the early morning there was always traffic on muscatine which turned into iowa avenue a divided highway with a grassy median strip separating the driving lanes of the twoway street when joe had been a baby and a toddler and danny had lived with katie in a duplex apartment on iowa avenue the young couple had complained about the noise of the traffic on the street the residences among them an especially rowdy sorority house nearer the campus and downtown were then slightly upscale offcampus housing for graduate students or welltodo undergraduates but in the fall of when danny walked to iowa avenue with his thirdgrade son the houses along the divided treelined street were even more pricey junior faculty and probably some tenured faculty lived there isnt this the street where you lived with mom joe asked his dad as they walked toward the campus and downtown where we lived with mom you meanyes it is danny said somewhere between the intersections with johnson and gilbert streets the writer recognized the grayclapboard twostory housethe bottom floor of which had been the apartment hed shared with katie and their little boy the house had since been repaintedthered been paleyellow clapboards in the late sixtiesand it was probably a singlefamily dwelling now the gray one joe asked because his dad had stopped walking on the sidewalk in front of the house which was on the downtownheadingtraffic side of the street the cars veering off muscatine onto iowa avenue were more numerous now yes the gray one danny said he turned his back on the house and faced the avenue he noticed that the plantings in the median strip had been prettified in the six years since hed moved away from iowa avenue grandpa said you didnt like iowa avenue that you wouldnt even drive on the street joe said to his dad thats right joe danny said standing close together they just watched the traffic going by whats wrong am i grounded the boy asked his dad no youre not groundedyoure already dead his father told him danny pointed to the street you died out there in the road it was the spring of you were still in diapersyou were only two was i hit by a car joe asked his dad you should have been his father answered but if youd really been hit by a car i would have died too there was one driver in the outbound lane who would see them standing on the other side of iowa avenue yiyiing on her way back to court street from mercy hospital in the incoming lane one of dannys colleagues at the writers workshop the poet marvin bell drove by them and honked his horn but neither father nor son acknowledged him perhaps danny and joe werent really standing on the sidewalk facing the traffic maybe they were back in the spring of at least the writer daniel baciagalupo whod not yet chosen a nom de plume was back there it often seemed to danny that hed never really left that moment in time in avellino loretta brought the writer his surprise first course in the somethingfromasia category the cook had prepared ah gous beef satay with peanut sauce for his son the beef was grilled on wooden skewers there was assorted tempura tooshrimp haricots verts and asparagus loretta also brought danny chopsticks but she hesitated before handing them over do you use these i cant remember she said the writer knew she was lying sure i use them he told her loretta still held on to the chopsticks you know what youre alone too much she told him i am alone too much danny said they flirted with each other but that was as far as it ever went it was simply awful for both of them to contemplate sleeping with each other when lorettas mom and dannys dad were sleeping together too whenever danny had considered it hed imagined loretta saying that would be too much like being brother and sister or something what are you writing loretta asked him as long as she held the chopsticks he would keep looking at her she thought just some dialogue danny told her like were having she asked no its different he said loretta could tell when shed lost his attention she gave him the chopsticks the way the notebook was open on the table loretta could have read the dialogue danny was writing but he seemed edgy about it and she decided not to be pushy well i hope you like the surprise she told him the cook knew it was what danny had ordered at maosmaybe a hundred times tell dad its the perfect choice danny said as loretta was leaving he glanced once at the dialogue he had written in the notebook danny wanted the line to be very literalthe way an eightyearold would phrase a question to his father carefully why would you have died tooif id really been hit by a car the writer had written dot and may who were still waiting for their pizzas had watched everything between danny and loretta it totally killed them that they hadnt been able to hear their dialogue the waitress wants to fuck him but theres a problem dot said yeah hes more interested in what hes writin may said whats he eatin dot asked her old friend its somethin on a stick may said it doesnt look very appetizin i get the feelin our pizzas are gonna be disappointin dot told her yeah i wouldnt be surprised may said now look at him dot whispered hes got food in front of him and he still cant stop writin but the food was good danny liked most of his memories of maos and hed liked all the food there the dialogue hed written was also goodit would work fine danny had decided it was just that the timing was wrong and he wanted to remind himself of the right time to use the line before turning his attention to the beef satay the writer simply circled the dialogue and wrote a note to himself in the margin of the notebook not now danny wrote tell the part about the pig roast first chapter lady sky spring was a big deal in iowa the fields were a special green pig roasts were the rage with the artdepartment types and the writing students danny had avoided most of the writers workshop parties when hed been a student but katie dragged him to the artists parties which in dannys opinion were worse than whatever trouble the writers managed to cause themselves katie knew everyone in the iowa art department because of her modeling for the lifedrawing classes though hed been a lifedrawing model in new hampshire danny hadnt been married at the time in iowa it made him uncomfortable to know that many of the graduate students in artnot to mention some of the facultyhad seen his wife naked danny didnt know most of their names this particular pig roast had been hard to find little joe cried the whole way to tiffin on us but danny who was driving wouldnt let katie take the twoyearold out of his car seat they left the highway in tiffin but were nearer to north liberty when they got lost either buffalo creek road didnt exist or it wasnt marked and by the time they found the dilapidated farmhouse danny had spoken sarcastically on the subject of art students they were either too nonverbal or too abstract to give good directions in his opinion what do you care if we cant find the stupid farm katie had asked him you never want to go to the parties im invited to anyway i never want to go to the parties im invited to either he pointed out to her which makes you loads of fun fuckhead katie said the farmer tended to his pigs in the early morning and once again in the late afternoon he lived in one of those motellooking but expensive ranch houses on rochester avenue in iowa city and he rented his fallingapart farmhouse to four scruffy young men who were graduate students in art katie called them artistsas if theyd already achieved something the writer was more cynically inclined danny thought of the male graduate students on the pig farm as three halfassed painters and one pretentious photographer though danny did know that the halfassed painters had all drawn katie in one or another lifedrawing class he hadnt known that the pretentious photographer had photographed her in the nudethis unwelcome news had emerged in the car when they got lost on their way to the pig roastand danny had been unprepared for the drawings and photos of his naked wife in the graduate students untidy farmhouse joe didnt seem to recognize his mother in the first of the sketches the twoyearold saw in the farmhouse kitchen and dining room some smudged charcoal drawings of katie were taped to the walls nice decor danny said to his wife katie shrugged danny saw that someone had already given her a glass of wine he hoped there was beer danny was always the driver and he drove a little better on beer in the car hed said to his wife i didnt know that the lifedrawing classes were open to photographers they arent katie had told him it was arranged outside class arranged hed repeated god now youre repeating everything shed said like your fucking father while danny looked in vain for a beer in the refrigerator joe told him that he needed to go to the bathroom danny knew that joe wasnt yet toilettrained when the boy said he needed to go to the bathroom he meant that it was time for someone to change his diaper katie usually resented carrying diapers in her purse but she had wanted to go to the pig roast badly enough that she hadnt complaineduntil now its about time the twoyearold was housebroken isnt it she said to danny handing him a clean diaper katie called joe the twoyearold as if the boys age condemned him to denigration in the downstairs bathroom of the farmhouse there was no curtain for the shower stall and the bathroom floor was wet father and son both washed their hands in the grimy sink but finding a towel was no more successful an endeavor than dannys search for a beer we can wave our hands dry danny said to the boy who waved to his dad as if he were saying goodbyethe standard onehanded wave try waving both hands joe lookmommy the boy said he was pointing to the photographs on the wall behind his father there was a blackandwhite contact sheet and half a dozen enlargements thumbtacked to the wall above the empty towel rack katie was naked with her hands hiding her small breasts but her crotch was fully exposed it looked as if her modesty had been purposely manipulated or misplaced someones conscious idea clearlya deliberate statement but of what danny wondered and had it been katies idea or the photographers his name was rolfhe was one of the bearded ones danny only now remembered yes the lady looks a lot like mommy danny said but this strategy backfired joe looked more closely at the photos frowning it is mommy the boy said you think his dad asked hed taken his sons small hand and was leading him out of the filthy bathroom yes its really mommy joe answered gravely danny poured himself a glass of red wine there were no wineglasses left so he used a milk glass there were no plastic cups either in one of the kitchen cabinets he found a coffee mug that looked sturdy enoughif not completely childproofand he gave joe some ginger ale danny wouldnt have trusted any milk in the fridge if hed been able to find some and the ginger ale was the only mixer there that could possibly appeal to a child the party was outside on the lawn near the pigpen given the lateafternoon earlyevening time of day danny assumed that the farmer had already fed his pigs for the day and departed at least the pigs looked contented though they watched the assembled partygoers with almost human curiosity on an average day the pigs probably didnt get to observe a dozen or more artists danny noted that there were no other children at the partynot too many married couples either are there any faculty here he asked katie whod already refilled her wineglassor someone had he knew katie had been hoping that roger would come roger was the faculty member who taught the graduate classes in life drawing he was the lifedrawing instructor katie was sleeping with at the time katie would still be sleeping with roger when she told danny she was leaving but that event was a couple of days away i thought roger would be here but he isnt katie said with disappointment she was standing next to rolf the bearded photographer danny realized shed actually been speaking to him not danny roger also had a beard danny recalled he knew katie was sleeping with roger but it only now occurred to him that she might be sleeping with rolf too maybe she was going through a beard phase the writer imagined looking at rolf danny wondered how and where they had arranged the photographs nice pictures danny told him oh you saw them rolf said casually youre all over the place danny said to katie who just shrugged did you see your mom rolf asked joe bending down to the boy as if he thought the child were hard of hearing he barely talks katie said which was totally untrue joe was exceptionally articulate for a twoyearold as only children tend to be maybe because he was a writer danny talked to the boy all the time mommys right there the boy said pointing at her no i meant the pictures rolf explained theyre in the bathroom thats mommy joe insisted pointing to his mother again see what i mean katie asked the photographer danny didnt yet know about katies plan to save another stupid boy from the war in vietnam that revelation was also a couple of days away but when danny did learn of katies intentions he would remember rolfs attempt to communicate with little joe that day at the pig farm while rolf certainly seemed stupid enough to need saving the beard didnt fit with dannys image of the boy word danny would never know the boy who became katies next kennedy father but the writer somehow didnt picture him with a beard the three graduatestudent painters were circling the fire pit where the pig was roasting danny and joe were standing nearby we started the fucking fire before dawn one of the painters said to danny the pig isnt done yet another painter said he also had a beard which made danny regard him closely they had built a wood fireaccording to the bearded painter a roaring big oneand when it was reduced to coals theyd lowered the springs for a doublebed mattress into the pit theyd found the bedsprings in the barn and the farmer had assured them that the stuff in the barn was junk theyd put the pig on the redhot bedsprings but now they had no way of getting more wood under the bedsprings and the pig when theyd tried to raise the bedsprings the pig started to fall apart because of how utterly destroyed the roasting pig looked danny thought better of calling it to little joes attentionnot when there were live pigs present not that the mess on the smoking bedsprings remotely resembled an actual pignot anymore joe didnt know what it was well just have to wait until the pig is done the third painter told danny philosophically joe held tightly to his dads hand the boy didnt venture near the smoldering fire pit it was bad enough that there was a hole in the ground with smoke coming out of it want to look at the pigs joe asked pulling on his fathers hand okay danny said it seemed that the pigs in the pen were unaware that one of their own was roasting they just kept staring through the slats of the fence at all the people every iowan danny had met said you had to watch yourself around pigs supposedly pigs were very smart but the older ones could be dangerous the writer wondered how you could tell the older pigs from the younger onesjust by their size perhaps but all the pigs in the pen seemed huge that must have been a suckling pig in the fire pit danny thought a relatively small one not one of these enormous creatures what do you think of them danny asked little joe big pigs the boy answered right his dad said big pigs dont touch them because they bite dont stick your hands through the fence okay they bite the boy repeated solemnly you wont get close to them okay his father asked okay joe said danny looked back at the three painters standing around the smoldering fire pit they werent watching the cooking pigthey were staring at the sky danny glanced up at the sky too a small plane had appeared on the horizon to the north of the pig farm it was still gaining altitudethe sound probably wouldnt reach them for a little while the pig farm was due south of cedar rapids where there was an airport perhaps the plane had taken off from there plane not a bird danny heard joe say the boy was also watching the sky a plane yes not a bird his dad repeated rolf passed by refilling dannys milk glass with red wine theres beer you knowi saw some in a tub of ice somewhere the photographer said you drink beer dont you danny wondered how rolf knew that katie must have told him he watched the photographer bring the bottle of wine over to katie without looking up at the airplane rolf pointed at the sky with the wine bottle and katie began to watch the small plane now you could hear it though it was very high in the skytoo high to be a crop duster danny was guessing rolf was whispering in katies ear while katie watched the plane somethings going on the writer thought but danny was thinking that something was going on with katie and rolfhe wasnt thinking about the plane then danny noticed that the three painters at the fire pit were whispering to one another they were all watching the plane too joe wanted to be picked upmaybe the size of the pigs had intimidated him two of the pigs were a muddy pink but the rest had black splotches they look like pinkandblack cows danny said to joe no theyre pigs not cows the boy told him okay danny said katie was coming over to them look at the pigs mommy joe said yuck she said keep watching the plane katie told her husband she was going away again but not before danny caught the scent of marijuana the smell must have clung to her hair hed not seen her smoking any potnot even one tokebut while hed been changing joes diaper she must have had some tell the kid to keep his eyes on the airplane katie said still walking away it sounded wrong how katie called joe the kid danny was thinking it was as if the boy were someone elses kidthats how it sounded the little plane wasnt climbing anymore it had leveled off and was now directly above the farm but still high in the sky it appeared to have slowed down perfectly suspended above them almost not moving were supposed to watch the airplane danny told his small son kissing the boys neck but danny watched his wife instead she had joined the painters at the smoking fire pit rolf was with them they were watching the plane with anticipation but because danny was watching them he missed the moment not a bird he heard little joe say not flying falling by the time danny looked up he couldnt be sureat such a heightexactly what had fallen from the plane but it was dropping down fast straight at them when the parachute opened the painters and rolf cheered the asshole artists had hired a skydiver for entertainment danny was thinking whats coming down joe asked his dad a skydiver danny told the boy a what in the sky the twoyearold said a person with a parachute danny said but this made no sense to little joe a what a parachute keeps the person from falling too fastthe person is going to be all right danny was explaining but joe clung tightly to his fathers neck danny smelled the marijuana before he realized that katie was standing next to them just waitkeep watching she said floating away again a sky something joe was saying a parawhat a skydiver a parachute danny repeated joe just stared openmouthed as the parachute drifted down to them it was a big parachute the colors of the american flag the skydivers breasts were the first giveaway its a lady little joe said yes it is his father replied what happened to her clothes joe asked now everyone was watching even the pigs danny hadnt noticed when the pigs began to be aware of the parachutist but they were aware of her now they must not have been used to flying people dropping down on themor used to the giant descending parachute which now cast a shadow over their pigpen lady sky joe screamed pointing up at the naked skydiver when the first pig squealed and started to run the other pigs all snorted and ran that may have been when lady sky saw where she was going to landin the pigpen the angry skydiver began to swear by then even the drunk and the stoned could see that she was naked fucking art students danny was thinking of course they couldnt just hire a skydiver naturally she had to be a nude katie looked unconcernedquite possibly she was jealous once she realized the skydiver was naked maybe katie wished that she could be the skydiver katie probably didnt like having another nude model at the art students pig roast christ shes going to end up in the fucking pigpen rolf was saying had he only now noticed he must have been the one who was smoking dope with katie rolf was definitely stupid enough to need savingif not from the war in vietnam danny would one day find himself thinking hold him danny said to his wife handing little joe to katie the furious naked woman passed overhead danny jumped and tried to grab her feet but she drifted just above and beyond his reach swearing as she went for all of them on the ground people and pigs a traveling vagina had hovered over themdescending someone should tell her thats an unflattering angle if youre a woman and youre naked katie was saying probably to rolfher remark wouldnt have made any sense to joe katie never had much to say to the kid anyway it was very muddy in the pigpen but danny had run in mud beforehe knew you had to keep your feet moving he paid no attention to where the pigs were he could tell by the way the ground shook that they were also running danny just followed the drifting woman when her heels struck the ground she slid through the shitty mud with her chute collapsing after her she fell on one hip and the chute dragged her sideways on her stomach before danny could catch up to her she was almost as surprised to see him as they both were shocked by the awful smell and by how big the pigs were when they were this close to them there was also the constant grunting one of the pigs trampled over the parachute but the feel of the chute under its hooves appeared to panic the animal it veered squealing away from them she was a big skydiver of amazonian proportionsa virtual giantess danny couldnt have carried her out of the pen but he saw how she was trying to free herself from the harness that attached her to the parachute which was hard to drag through the muck and danny was able to help her with that the naked skydiver was covered with pig shit and mud the back of one of dannys hands brushed against her dirty nipple as he struggled with the strap of the harness that divided her breasts danny only then realized that hed fallen a few times he was spattered with pig shit and mud too no one told me it was a fucking pig farm the skydiver said she had closely cropped hair and shed shaved her pubic hair leaving just a vertical strip but she was a strawberry blonde top to bottom theyre a bunch of asshole artistsi had nothing to do with this danny told her from her scar he could see shed had a cesarean section she looked a decade older than danny in her thirties maybe evidently shed been a bodybuilder her tattoos were indiscernible in the muck but she was definitely not the nude the art students had been imagining maybe she was more than theyd bargained for the writer hoped my names danny he told her amy she said thanks when she was freed from the chute danny put his hand on the small of her back and pushed her ahead of him run to the fencejust keep running he told her he kept his hand against her damp skin the whole way a pig blundered past them as if it were racing them not chasing them possibly it was running away from them they almost collided with another pig this one running in the opposite direction perhaps it was the parachute that had upset the pigsnot the naked lady lady sky danny could hear joe shouting someone else started yelling it lady sky be sure you show me the asshole artists amy said when they reached the perimeter of the pigpen she needed no help getting over the fence danny was looking all around for joe but the little boy wasnt with katie he saw his wife standing with rolf and the three painters those are the four guys you want danny told amy pointing to them the ones with the small woman but not the womanshe wasnt in on it just the two guys with the beards and the two without this pig doesnt bite danny thought he heard his son say in a quiet contemplative voice joe the writer called im right here daddy that was when danny realized that little joe was in the pigpen with him the boy stood next to one of the pinkandblack pigs it must have been running because it was clearly out of breath though it stood very still only its harsh breathing made the big pig move at allexcept for the way it inclined its head toward the boy who had hold of the animals ear maybe it felt good to a pig to have its ear rubbed or gently pulled in any case the more the twoyearold stroked its ear the more the pig tilted its head and lowered its long ear in joes direction pigs have funny ears the boy said joe get out of the penright now his dad said he must have raised his voice more than hed meant to the pig snapped its head in dannys direction as if it deeply resented the earrubbing interruption only a lowtotheground feeding trough separated them and the pig hunched its shoulders on either side of its huge head and squinted at him danny stood his ground until he saw joe climb safely through the slats in the fence the drama with the skydiver and then with joe prevented danny from seeing how low in the sky the small plane had circled the pilot and copilot probably wanted to be sure that amy had touched down without mishap but amy gave the plane the fingerboth fingers in factand the plane dipped a wing to her as if in salutation then flew off in the direction of cedar rapids welcome to buffalo creek farm rolf had said to the skydiver regrettably danny missed seeing this part toohow amy had grabbed the photographer by both his shoulders snapped him toward her and headbutted him in his forehead and the bridge of his nose rolf staggered backward falling several feet from the spot where amy had made contact she knocked down the painter with the beard with a left jab followed by a right hook i dont jump into pigs she shouted at the two painters left standing both danny and joe saw the next bit which one of you artists is going to get my parachute she asked them pointing to the pigpen by now the pigs had calmed down theyd returned to the fence and were once more observing the artistic crowd their snouts poking through the slats the pig whose ear had been stroked to its apparent satisfaction was now indistinguishable from the others way out in the muck the trampled redwhiteandblue parachute lay like a flag fallen in battle the farmer told us never to go in the pigpen one of the graduatestudent painters began danny carried joe over to katie you were supposed to hold him he said to her he peed all over me when you went into the pigpen katie said he has a diaper on danny told her i could still feel how wet he was she said you werent even watching him danny told her amy had the painter whod spoken up in a headlock ill get your fucking parachute katie suddenly told her you cant go in there danny said dont tell me what i cant do hero she said katie had always been competitive that way first the nude skydiver had taken the art students attention away from her then her husbands act of bravado had upstaged her but of course what katie really wanted to do was undress ill just keep the pig shit off my clothes if you dont object she said to danny she began handing her clothes to the one painter whod been untouched by the shitsmeared skydiver i would give them to you she told danny but youre covered with shityou should see yourself it wouldnt be good if something happened to you in front of joe danny started to tell her why she asked him a twoyearold wont remember it only you willyou fuckhead writer seeing her naked and defiant made danny realize that what had once attracted him to katie now repelled him hed mistaken what was brazen about her for a kind of sexual courage shed seemed both sexy and progressive but katie was merely vulgar and insecure what danny had desired in his wife only filled him now with revulsionand this had taken a mere two years to transpire the lovingher part would last a little longer neither danny nor any other writer could ever explain that hed carried joe back to the downstairs bathroom so that they could clean up or try to danny didnt want joe to see his naked mother devoured by a pig surely the twoyearold would remember that if only for a little while is mommy giving lady sky her clothes joe asked mommys clothes wouldnt fit lady sky sweetie danny answered his son amy didnt want any clothes she told the asshole artists that all she wanted was a bath the pilot and copilot were bringing her clothesor they better be the skydiver said i hope your bathroom is cleaner than ours danny said to amy as she was following the unassaulted painter up the farmhouse stairs im not counting on it amy told him was that your wifethat little thing who was going to fetch my parachute the skydiver called down the stairs to danny yes he answered her shes got balls hasnt she amy asked him yesthats katie danny said hed forgotten that there wasnt a towel in the downstairs bathroom but getting the pig shit off himself and little joe was what mattered who cared if they were wet besides the boys clothes had somehow managed to stay clean joes pants were a little damp because hed really peed like crazy in his diaper i guess you liked that ginger ale huh danny asked the boy hed also forgotten to ask katie for a dry diaper but that didnt really matter as much as getting the pig shit off little joes hands there was shit all over danny and his clotheshis running shoes were ruined if his wife could take off all her clothes danny guessed that no one would mind if he wore just his boxers for the remainder of the artists party it was a sunny spring dayapril in iowa warm enough to be wearing only a pair of boxers you call this a clean towel the skydiver was shouting danny undressed himself and little joe and they both got into the shower there was no soap but they used a lot of shampoo instead they were still in the shower when katie came into the downstairs bathroom carrying her clothes and a towel she was not as shitspattered as danny had expected if you dont try to run in that muck you dont fall down fuckhead so you just walked out to the parachute and walked back danny asked her the pigs didnt bother you the pigs were spooked by the chute katie said move overboth of you she got into the shower with them and danny shampooed her hair mommy got pig poo on her too joe asked everyones got pig poo on them somewhere katie said they took turns with the towel and danny put a dry diaper on joe he dressed the little boy before putting on his boxers thats all youre wearing katie asked him im donating the rest of my clothes to the farm danny told her in fact im not touching themtheyre staying right there he said pointing to the pile of clothes on the wet floor katie threw her bra and panties on the pile she slipped into her jeans you could see her breasts through the white blouse she was wearingher nipples especially is that all youre wearing danny asked her katie shrugged i guess i can donate my underwear to the farm if i want to she said is everything a contest katie but she didnt answer him she opened the bathroom door and left them with the pile of clothes and dannys discarded running shoes i lost my sandals somewhere she told them outside the skydiver was wearing just a towel around her waist and was drinking a beer whered you find the beer danny asked her hed already had too much wine on an empty stomach amy showed him the tub of ice rolf was sitting on the ground beside the tub repeatedly dunking his face in the icy water there was blood from his nose everywhere he had a pretty good gash on one eyebrow tooall from the headbutt danny took out two beers wiping the necks of the bottles on his boxers that was a terrific idea rolf danny told the photographer too bad she didnt land in the fire pit shit rolf said standing up he looked a little unsteady on his feet no ones watching the pig in the pitwe got distracted by all the heroics is there an opener danny asked him theres one in the kitchen somewhere rolf answered the bearded painter whod been hit with amys jab and hook was holding a wet tshirt to his face he kept dipping the tshirt in the icy water and then putting it back on his face hows the roast pig coming along danny asked him oh christ the painter said he hurried after rolf in the direction of the smoking hole there was potato salad and a green salad and some kind of cold pasta on the diningroom table together with the wine and the rest of the booze does any of this food look interesting to you danny asked joe the writer hadnt been able to find an opener in the farmhouse kitchen but hed used the handle on one of the kitchen drawers to open both beers he drank the first beer very fast he was already halfway through the second wheres any meat joe asked i guess its still cooking his dad said lets go look at it someone had turned on a car radio so they could have music outdoors donovans mellow yellow was playing rolf and the painter with the beard had managed to lift the bedsprings out of the fire pit the painter with the beard had burned his hands but rolf had taken off his jeans and used them as pot holders rolfs nose and the cut on his eyebrow were still bleeding as he put his jeans back on some of the roast pig had fallen off the bedsprings into the fire but there was plenty to eat and it was certainly cooked enoughit looked very well done in fact what is it joe asked his dad roast porkyou like pork danny told the boy once upon a time it was a pig rolf explained to the twoyearold a pretty small one joe danny told his son not one of your big friends in the pen who killed it joe asked no one answered him but joe didnt noticehe was distracted lady sky was standing over the blackened pig on the bedsprings little joe was clearly in awe of her as if he expected her to take flight again and fly away lady sky the boy said amy smiled at him are you an angel joe asked her she was beginning to look like one to danny well sometimes lady sky said she was distracted too a car was turning in to the long driveway of the pig farmprobably the little planes pilot and copilot danny was thinking amy took another look at the roast pig on the bedsprings but there are other times when im just a vegetarian she said to joe like today merle haggard was singing im a lonesome fugitive on the car radio probably someone had changed the station out on the lawn katie had been dancing by herselfor with her glass of winebut she stopped now everyone was curious about the pilot and the copilot if only to see what would happen when they arrived amy walked over to the car before the two men could get out fuck you georgiefuck you pete the skydiver greeted them we were too high up to see the pigs amywe couldnt see them when you jumped one of the men told her he handed her some clothes fuck you pete amy told him again she took off her towel and threw it at him calm down amy the other man said the guys on the farm should have told us there were pigs yeah welli made that point to them georgie the skydiver told him georgie and pete were surveying the artists in the pigroast crowd they must have noticed that rolf was bleeding and the painter with the beard still held a wet tshirt to his face the pilot and copilot surely knew this was amys work which one ran into the pigpen to help you pete asked her see the small guy in the boxers the little boys daddythats the one amy said my rescuer thanks pete said to danny we appreciate it georgie told the writer lady sky was only slightly less formidablelooking when she was dressed in part because she dressed like a manexcept for her underwear which was black and skimpy amy wore a blue denim workshirt tucked in and jeans with a belt with a big buckle her cowboy boots had a rattlesnake pattern she walked over to where danny was holding little joe if youre ever in trouble ill be back lady sky told the boy she bent over him kissing his forehead meanwhile you take care of your daddy she said to joe katie was dancing by herself again but she was watching how the skydiver made a fuss over her husband and little boy katie never took her eyes off the big woman there was a song from the rolling stones album between the buttons on the radio but danny could never remember which song it was by then hed had a third beer and was working on his fourththis was on top of the red wine and he still hadnt eaten someone had once again changed the station on the car radio the writer had noticed hed watched lady sky kiss his son sensing that the kiss was meant for him amy must have known there was no better way to make an impression on a parent than to be nice to the beloved child but who was she danny wanted to know the scar from her cesarean section must have made her someones mother but danny wondered if one of the stooges with her was her husband or boyfriend can we get anything to eat here georgie was asking believe me georgie we dont want to eat here amy told him not even pete she added without looking at himas if pete couldnt be trusted to make his own food decisions danny didnt think she was sleeping with either of them the pilot and copilot tried to be careful how they stuffed the parachute and the skydivers harness into the trunk of the car but it was impossible not to get some pig shit on themselves in the process amy got into the drivers seat of the car you driving amy georgie asked her it looks like it she told him ill get in the back pete said youll both get in the back amy told them ive smelled enough pig shit today but before the men could get into the car the skydiver said you see that pretty little woman the dancer over there you can see her tits through her shirtthat one danny knew that both georgie and pete had already noticed katie most men did yeah i see her georgie said what about her amy pete asked if you ever lose meif my chute doesnt open or somethingyou can ask her to do anything ill bet you shed do it the skydiver said the pilot and copilot looked uneasily at each other what do you mean amy pete asked you mean shed jump out of an airplane without any clothes onyou mean that kind of thing georgie asked the skydiver i mean shed jump out of an airplane without a parachute amy told them wouldnt you honey she asked katie danny would remember thishow katie liked it when the attention came to her for whatever reason he saw that his wife had found her sandals though she wasnt wearing them she held the sandals in one hand her wineglass in the other and she just kept moving her feetshe was still dancing well that would depend on the circumstances katie said lolling her head and neck to the music but i wouldnt rule it outnot categorically see what i mean amy asked georgie and pete as the two men got into the backseat then the skydiver drove away giving the artists the finger out the window of the car patsy cline was singing on the radio and katie had stopped dancing someone must have changed the station again i dont want to eat the pig joe told his dad okay danny said well try to eat something else he carried the boy over to where his mother had stopped dancing katie was just swaying in place as if waiting for the music to change she was drunk danny could tell but she didnt smell like marijuana anymorehed shampooed every trace of the pot out of her hair under what circumstances would you ever jump out of an airplane without a parachute the writer asked his wife to get out of a boring marriage maybe katie answered him since im the driver id like to leave before dark he told her lady sky is an angel mommy joe said i doubt it katie said to the boy she told us she was an angel sometimes danny said that woman has never been an angel katie told them joe was sick in his car seat on their way into iowa city a johnson county sheriffs car had followed them the whole way on us danny was afraid he might have a taillight out or that hed been driving erratically he was thinking about how much to say hed had to drink if the police car pulled them over when the sheriff turned north on the coralville strip and danny kept driving into downtown iowa city he couldnt remember how much hed actually had to drink in his boxer shorts danny knew he wouldnt have been very convincing to the sheriff danny was thinking he was home free when joe threw up it was probably the potato salad he told the boy dont worry about it well be home in just a couple of minutes let me out of the fucking car katie said here danny asked her you want to walk home from here he saw shed already put on her sandals they were still downtown who said i was coming home she asked him oh danny said just before dark hed seen her talking to someone on the phone in the farmhouse kitchenprobably roger danny now decided he pulled over at the next red light and katie got out of the car lady sky really is an angel mommy joe said to her if you say so katie said shutting the door danny knew she didnt have any underwear on but if it was roger she was seeing what did that matter six years later the earlymorning traffic had subsided on iowa avenue yiyiing had long been back on court streetshe was home from the hospital shed probably told the cook about seeing danny and young joe on iowa avenue at such an early hour of the morning why would you have died tooif id really been hit by a car the eightyearold asked his father because youre supposed to outlive me if you die before i do that will kill me joe danny told his son why dont i remember her the boy asked his dad you mean your mom danny asked my mom the pigs what happened nexti dont remember any of it joe answered what about lady sky his father asked i remember someone dropping from the sky like an angel the boy told him really danny asked i think so you havent told me about her before have you joe asked no i havent danny said then what happened joe asked his dad i mean after mom got out of the car downtown naturally the writer had told young joe an edited version of the pig roast after he drove the twoyearold home from the farm there was less that the storyteller had to censor from the tale no doubt because katie hadnt come home with them in the early eveningit was just after darkonly the occasional passerby and not one of dannys neighbors had seen the writer in his boxer shorts carrying his twoyearold into the groundfloor apartment of the duplex on iowa avenue can you still smell the pigs little joe had asked his dad as they came inside only in my mind the writer answered i can smell them but i dont know where they are the boy said maybe its the throwup you smell sweetie danny said he gave the boy a bath and washed his hair again it was warm in the apartment though the windows were open danny put little joe to bed wearing just a diaper if it got cooler in the night he could put the boys pajamas on then but after joe had fallen asleep danny imagined he could still smell the pigs or the puke he put on a pair of jeans and went out to the car he brought the car seat into the kitchen and washed the vomit off it it probably would have been safer for little joe to have eaten the pig instead of the potato salad his dad was thinking later danny took a shower and had another shampoo it was likely hed had five beers on top of the wine danny didnt feel like another beer but he didnt want to go to bed either and hed had too much to drink to even think about writing katie was gone for the night he felt certain there was some vodkait was what katie drank when she didnt want her breath to smell like shed been drinkingand some rum from barbados danny found a lime in the fridge he cut a chunk out of the lime and put it in a tall glass with ice and filled the glass with rum he was wearing a clean pair of boxers when he sat for a while in the darkened living room by an open window watching the diminishing traffic on iowa avenue it was that time in the spring when the frogs and toads seemed especially loudmaybe because we have missed them all winter the writer was thinking he was wondering what his life might have been like if hed met someone like lady sky instead of katie possibly the skydiver had been closer to dannys age than hed first thought maybe some bad stuff had happened to herthings that made her look older the writer imagined danny didnt mean the scar from her cesarean section he meant worse things danny woke up on the toilet where hed fallen asleep with a magazine on his lap the empty glass with the chunk of lime stared up at him from the bathroom floor it was cooler danny turned the light off in the kitchen where he saw that hed had more than one glass of rumthe bottle was nearly emptythough he didnt remember pouring himself a second or a third drink he wouldnt remember what he did with the nearempty bottle either he thought hed better have a look at joe before he staggered off to bed and perhaps he should put some pajamas on the boy but danny felt he lacked the necessary dexterity to dress the sleeping child instead he closed the windows in the boys bedroom and checked to be sure the rails on the child bed were secure joe couldnt have fallen out of bed with the rails in the lowered position and the boy was that age when he could climb out of the bed if the rails were in either the raised or the lowered position sometimes the rails werent securely latched in either position then the rails could slip pinching the boys fingers danny checked to be sure the rails were locked fast in the raised position joe was sleeping soundly on his back and danny leaned over to kiss him this was awkward to do when the bed rails were raised and danny had had enough to drink that he couldnt manage to kiss his son without losing his balance he left joes bedroom door open to be sure he would hear the boy if he woke up and cried danny left the door to the master bedroom open too it was after three in the morning danny noted the time on the alarm clock on the night table as he got into bed katie wasnt back from seeing roger if thats who she was seeing whenever danny closed his eyes the bedroom began to spin he fell asleep with his eyes openor he imagined that he did because his eyes were open and they felt very dry when he was awakened in the morning by a man shouting theres a baby in the road some idiot was yelling danny could smell the marijuana he must have been half asleep or only half awake because he imagined that the shouting man was stoned but the smell of the pot was beside danny on the nearest pillow katie was sleeping naked there the covers thrown off and her hair redolent of marijuana it was dannys impression that roger smoked dope all the time whose baby is this the man was shouting this babys gotta belong to someone maniacal shouting would occasionally reach them from the noisy sorority house farther west on iowa avenue or from the downtown area but not during what amounted to the morning rush hour baby in the road the maniac kept repeating it was cold in the bedroom too danny only now realized hed passed out with the windows open and whenever katie had come home shed not bothered to close them its not our fucking baby katie said her voice was slurred or she spoke into her pillow our babys in bed with us fuckhead he is danny asked sitting up his head was pounding little joe wasnt in the tousled bed with them well he was katie said she sat up in bed too her cheeks were a little roughed up or redlookingthe way your face can get when youre kissing someone with a scratchy beard the writer supposed the kid was fussing about something so i brought him into bed with us katie was saying danny had already headed down the hall he saw that joes bed was empty with the rails in the lowered position katie was so short she could never lift the boy out of his bed without first lowering the rails the traffic was backed up on iowa avenue all the way east to the bend on muscatine as if thered been an accident in the avenue directly in front of dannys groundfloor apartment danny ran out the front door of the duplex in his boxer shorts given his state of undress the writer must have struck the driver of the dirtywhite van which was blocking the incoming traffic to town as a likely candidate for the neglectful parent is this your baby the van driver screamed at danny the handlebar mustache and bushy sideburns may have frightened little joe as much as the mans ceaseless shoutingthat and the fact that the van driver had managed to corral joe on the grassy median strip in the middle of iowa avenue without actually picking the boy up or even touching him joe stood uncertainly on the grass in his diaper hed wandered out of the house and across the sidewalk into the lane of incoming traffic and the dirtywhite van had been the first vehicle to almost hit him now a woman from the car that was stopped behind the white van ran into the median and scooped the baby into her arms is that your daddy she asked joe pointing to danny in his boxer shorts joe started to cry hes minei was asleep danny told them he crossed the pavement into the median strip but the womanmiddleaged glasses a pearl necklace danny would remember nothing more definitive about herseemed reluctant to give the baby up your baby was in the street pali almost ran over him the van driver told danny the fucking diaper its whiteness just caught my eye it doesnt appear that you were looking for this baby or that you even knew he was missing the woman said to danny daddy joe said holding out his arms does this child have a mother the woman wanted to know shes asleepwe were both asleep danny told her he took little joe from the womans tentatively outstretched arms thank you danny said to the van driver youre still wasted man the driver told him is your wife wasted too thank you danny told him again you should be reported the woman said to him yes i should be danny told her but please dont now cars were honking their horns and joe started to cry again i couldnt see the sky from the house the boy was sobbing you couldnt see the sky his dad asked they crossed the pavement to the sidewalk and went into the house to the continuous honking of horns i couldnt see if lady sky was coming down joe said you were looking for lady sky his father asked i couldnt see her maybe she was looking for me the boy said the divided avenue was wide from the middle of the road or from the median strip danny realized that his twoyearold had been able to see the sky the boy had been hoping that lady sky would descend againthat was all there was to it mommys home joe told his dad as they came into the apartment which the twoyearold called the umpartment from the moment hed begun to talk an apartment was an umpartment yes i know mommys home danny said he could see that katie had fallen back to sleep on the kitchen table the writer also noticed that the rum bottle was empty had he finished it before going to bed or had katie downed what was left in the bottle when shed come home it was probably me danny thought he knew that katie didnt like rum he took joe into the boys room and changed his diaper he had trouble looking at his sons eyesimagining them open and staring unseeing as the twoyearold in his brightwhite diaper lay dead in the road and then you stopped drinking right young joe asked his father for the duration of the long story theyd kept their backs to the house they had lived in with katie the last of that rum was the end of it danny said to the eightyearold but mom didnt stop drinking did she joe asked his dad your mom couldnt stop sweetieshe probably still hasnt stopped danny told him and i am grounded right young joe asked no youre not groundedyou can go anywhere you want on foot or on the bus its your bicycle thats grounded danny said to the boy maybe well give your bike to max ill bet he could use it for a backup or for spare parts joe looked up at the brilliant blue of the fall sky no descending angel was going to get him out of this predicament you never thought lady sky was an angel did you the boy asked his dad i believed her when she said she was an angel sometimes danny said the writer would drive all over iowa city looking for the blue mustang but he wouldnt find it the police would never spot the rogue car either but back on iowa avenue all danny did was put his arm around the eightyearolds shoulders think of it this way he said to his son that blue mustang is still looking for you six years ago when you stood in this streetwith nothing but a diaper onmaybe the blue mustang was stuck in traffic it might have been several cars behind the white van that blue mustang might have been trying to get you even then its not really looking for me is it joe asked you better believe it is his dad told him the blue mustang wants youthats why youve got to be careful okay the eightyearold told his father do you know any twoyearolds danny asked his son no the boy answered not that i can think of well it would be good for you to meet one his dad said just so you can see what you looked like in the road that was when the cook drove down iowa avenue in the incoming lane and pulled over to the curb where the father and son were standing get in you two tony angel told them ill drop joe at school then ill take you home the cook said joe hasnt had any breakfast danny told his dad i made him a big lunchhe can eat half of it on the way to school daniel get in he repeated we have a situation whats wrong pop the writer asked it seems that youn is still married the cook replied as danny and joe got into the car it seems that youn has a twoyearold daughter and that her husband and daughter have come to visit herjust to see how all the writing is going theyre at the house danny asked its good that they came after youn was up she was already in her roomwriting the cook said danny could imagine how shed left their bedroommeticulously without a trace of herself remaining just that pearlgray nightie tucked under her pillow or maybe it was the beige one youn has a twoyearold danny asked his dad i want joe to see the daughter are you crazy the cook said to his son joe should go to school youn is married joe asked she has a kid it appears so danny said he was thinking about the novel youn was writinghow it was so exquisitely written but not everything added up the usually limpid prose notwithstanding something had always been unclear about the book i think you should go to school sweetie danny said you can meet a twoyearold another time but you want me to meet one right joe asked whats this about the cook inquired he was driving to joes school not waiting for contradictory directions its a long story danny told him whats the husband like is he a gangster hes a surgeon in korea he told me tony angel replied hes attending a surgical conference in chicago but he brought his daughter along and they thought theyd surprise mommyand let youn look after the twoyearold for a couple of days while kyung is in meetings some surprise huh the cook asked his name is kyung danny said in the book youn was writing the gangster husband was named jinwoo danny guessed that wasnt the only element of her story shed made up and all along hed thought her novel was too autobiographical her husband seems like a nice guy tony angel said so im going to meet youns twoyearold daughter joe asked as he was getting out of the car eat something the cook told his grandson i already called the school and told them you were coming late it sounds like you may meet the little girl yes danny told the boy but what are you on the lookout for he asked joe as the boy opened his lunch box and peered inside the blue mustang joe answered without hesitation smart boy his father said they were almost back at the court street house before the cook told his son yiyiing and i decided that it should appear you two are a couple why should yiyiing and i be a couple danny said because youre the same age while the husband from korea is around you should just pretend that youre together not even a korean surgeon is going to suspect that im sleeping with his wife the cook said im too old how do we pretend danny asked his dad let yiyiing do the pretending his father said in retrospect the writer was thinking the pretending hadnt been the most difficult part of the impromptu deception yiyiing did a good job of acting as dannys girlfriendthat is while youns husband was there in the court street house the surgeon from seoul struck danny as a sweet man both proud of himself and embarrassed for surprising his writer wife youn for her part could not conceal how happy she was to see her daughter soo the korean writers eyes had sought danny for some reassurance and danny hoped hed provided it he felt relieved actually because hed been looking ahead to their inevitable parting with more than the usual guilt yes he would definitely be in iowa city through this academic yearhed already asked the writers workshop if he could stay another year after thatbut danny knew that he probably wouldnt be staying in town long enough for youn to finish her novel and when danny went back to vermont he had all along been assuming that youn would go back to seoul the surgeon who would be in chicago for only a few days kissed his wife and daughter goodbye all the introductions and goodbyes had happened in the court street kitchen where the cook acted as if he owned the place and yiyiing had two or three times slipped behind danny and encircled him with her armsdrawing him to her once kissing the back of his neck it being a warm fall day the writer wore only a tshirt and jeans and he could feel yiyiings silky pajamas brushing against his back these hugs conveyed a coziness between them the writer supposednot knowing what youn might have made of this intimate contact or if yiyiing and the cook had informed the korean adulteress of their plan that danny and the hong kong nurse should pretend to be a couple the daughter soo was a little jewel shes not wearing a diaper danny asked the surgeon remembering joe at that age girls are toilettrained before boys honey yiyiing told him with what struck the writer as an overacted emphasis on the honey wordbut the cook had laughed and so had youn danny would wonder later if perhaps youn had also been relieved that her relationship with her fiction teacher was so efficiently ended what need was there for any further explanation the days when the korean doctor was in chicago were easy enough and joe could see with his own eyes how innocent a twoyearold really wasabout dangers in the road obviously but about angels falling from the sky too the eightyearold could observe for himself that little soo was capable of believing anything the fragrant nightie under the pillow on youns side of the bed turned out to be the beige one and danny found a discreet moment to give it back to her now no evidence of her remained in his bedroom youn slept with her tiny daughter in her writing room they were both small enough to fit in the bed in that extra bedroom although danny had suggested to youn that she could put soo in the extra extra bedroom hed noticed that youns husband had slept in that room alone a twoyearold shouldnt sleep unattended youn had told danny who realized that hed misread the curiosity with which youn had scrutinized joe shed simply been wondering what changes to expect in her daughter between the ages of two and eight as for what shed written about and why there would never be a satisfactory explanation danny supposed when kyung came back from chicago and the doctor soon left again with his little girlthey went home to seoul togetheryoun wasted no time in finding a place of her own to live and by the next semester she had transferred to someone elses fiction workshop whether she ever finished her novelinprogress was immaterial to the writer danny angel whether youn would one day become a published novelist also mattered little to danny who knew firsthand thatin youns time in iowa city her fiction had been an almost complete success it was yiyiings success at pretending to be dannys girlfriend that would linger a little longer the er nurse was not naturally flirtatious but for months after the need to pretend she and danny were a couple yiyiing would occasionally brush against the writer or trail her fingers or the back of her hand against dannys cheek it seemed she had sincerely forgotten herself for she would instinctively stopas soon as shed started something danny doubted that the cook ever saw her do this if joe saw the eightyearold took no notice would you prefer it if i dressed normally around the house yiyiing would one day ask the writer i mean maybe its enough already with the pajamas but youre the pajama ladythats just who you are danny told her evasively you know what i mean yiyiing said to him she stopped wearing themor perhaps she only slept in them her normal clothes were a safer barrier between them and what had amounted to the occasional contactthe brush of her passing behind his back the touch of her fingertips or the knuckles on her small handsstopped soon after as well i miss yiyiings pajamas joe said to his dad one morning when they were walking to the boys school i do too danny told him but by then the writer was seeing someone else with youn gone from their livesespecially later in their last year in iowa city when they were living in the third house on court streettheir regular habits resumed as if uninterrupted the third house was on the other side of court street near summit where danny conducted a discreet daytime affair with an unhappy faculty wife whose husband was cheating on her the back alley where joe had been tempted to pity himselfwhile he watched max practice skids on his backup bikewas also gone from their lives as was the possum the yokohamas sao and kaori still took turns babysitting for joe and everyoneall of themgathered with a seemingly increasing need or desperation at maos the cook knew in advance how much he would miss the cheng brothersalmost as much as he would miss yiyiing it was never knowing what it might have been like to be with the hong kong nurse that danny would miss though his return to vermont was preceded by another kind of closure as their iowa adventure was concluding so wasat long lastthe war in vietnam the mood at maos was not predisposed to a happy ending operation frequent wind as the helicopter evacuation of saigon was calledoperation more bullshit ketchum had called itturned out to be a devastating distraction from the dinnertime preparations at the asian and french restaurant the tv in the little kitchen off the coralville strip proved to be a magnet for discontent april had been a bad month for business at maos there were four driveby brickthrowingsone of the restaurants windowbreakers was actually a chunk of cement the size of a cinder block and one was a rock fucking patriot farmers xiao dee had called the vandals he and the cook had canceled a shopping trip to chinatown because xiao dee was convinced that maos was under attackor as saigon fell the restaurant would come under heavier siege ah gou was running short of his favorite ingredients with tony angels help there were a few more items from italy on the menu than usual all that year the south vietnamese soldiers were deserting in droves the runaway soldiers had been rounding up their families and converging on saigon where they must have believed the americans would help them escape the country in the last two weeks of april the us had airlifted sixty thousand foreigners and south vietnamese hundreds of thousands more would soon be left to find their own way out it will be sheer chaos ketchum had predicted what did we expect would happen the logger would say later did we care what would happen danny was thinking he and joe had a table to themselves at maos and yiyiing had joined them for dinner shed skipped her shift in the emergency room because she had a cold she didnt want to make a lot of sick or injured people any worse shed told danny and joe im already going to make you two sickyou two and pop she said to them smiling thanks a lot danny told her joe was laughing he adored yiyiing the boy would miss having his own nurse when he was back in vermont and ill miss having a nurse for him the writer was thinking there were two couples at one table and three businessmen types at another it was a quiet night for maos but it was still early the boardedup window didnt improve the looks of the front entrance danny was thinking when one of the yokohamas came out of the kitchen her face as white as her apron and her lower lip trembling your dad says you should see whats on television the japanese girl said to the writer the tvs in the kitchen danny got up from the table but when joe tried to go with him yiyiing said maybe you should stay with me joe yes you stay sao or kaori told the boy you shouldnt see but i want to see what it is joe said do what sao says joeill be right back his dad told him im kaori the japanese twin said to danny she burst into tears why am i getting the feeling that all gooks are the same to you americans whats on the tv yiyiing asked her the two couples had been laughing about something they hadnt heard kaoris outburst but the businessmen types had frozen the gooks word held them poised over their beers ah gous smart girlfriend tzumin was the maître d that night xiao dee was too agitated by the brickthrowing patriot farmers to be safely allowed out of the kitchen go back in the kitchen kaori tzumin told the sobbing girl no crying permitted out here whats on the tv yiyiing asked the maître d joe shouldnt see it tzumin told her danny had already disappeared into the kitchen it was bedlam back there xiao dee was shouting at the television sao the other japanese twin was throwing up in the big sinkthe one the dishwasher scrubbed the pots and pans in ed the dishwasher stood aside a recovering alcoholic he was a world war ii vet with several faded tattoos the cheng brothers had given ed a job at a time when no one else would and ed felt loyal to them though the small coralville kitchen made him feel claustrophobic at times and the political talk at maos was a foreign country to him ed had no use for foreign countries that we were getting out of vietnam was good enough for him hed been in the navy in the pacific now one of the japanese twins was vomiting in his sink and the other one was in tears ed might have been thinking that he had killed their relatives if so he was not sorry about it hows it going ed danny said to the dishwasher its not going too good right now ed told him kissinger is a war criminal xiao dee was screaming henry kissinger had appeared albeit briefly on the television ah gou who was chopping scallions brandished his cleaver at the mere mention of the hated kissinger but now the tv returned to that image of enemy tanks rolling through the streets of saigon the tanks were closing in on the us embassy there or so some nameless voice said it was almost the end of aprilthese were the last airlifts the day before saigon surrendered about seventy american helicopters had been shuttling between the walledoff courtyard of the embassy and the us warships off the coast as many as sixtytwo hundred people were rescued that day the last two helicopters to leave saigon carried away the us ambassador and the embassys marine guards hours later south vietnam surrendered but that wasnt what was hard to watch on the little tv in the kitchen at maos there were more people who wanted to leave saigon than there were helicopters hundreds would be left behind in the embassys courtyard dozens of vietnamese clung to the skids of the last two helicopters to leave they fell to their deaths as the choppers lifted away the television just kept showing it those poor people the cook had said seconds before sao threw up in eds sink theyre not people not to most americanstheyre gooks xiao dee was shouting ah gou was watching the tv instead of the scallions he chopped the first digit off the index finger of his left hand kaori still in tears fainted the cook dragged her away from the stove danny took a dish towel and began to twist it tightly around ah gous upper arm the tip of big brothers finger lay in a pool of blood with the chopped scallions go get yiyiing the cook said to sao ed took a wet towel and wiped the girls face sao was as insubstantiallooking as her fainted twin but she had stopped throwing up and like a ghost she drifted away to the dining room when the swinging door to the dining room opened danny heard one of the businessmen say what kind of crazy fuckedup place is this anyway ah gou cut off his finger he heard sao say to yiyiing then the door swung closed and danny didnt hear how sao or tzumin or yiyiing answered the businessman or if any of the women had tried maos was a crazy fuckedup place that night when saigon was falling the door to the dining room swung open again and they all came into the kitchenyiyiing with young joe tzumin and sao danny was mildly surprised that the three businessmen types and the two couples werent with them though there was no room for anyone else in the chaotic kitchen thank god they all ordered the guinea hen the cook was saying kaori had sat up on the floor the two couples are having the guinea hen she said the business guys ordered the ravioli i just meant the couples tony angel said im feeding them first the business guys are ready to walk outim warning you tzumin told them yiyiing found the tip of ah gous finger in the scallions xiao dee wrapped his arms around ah gou while the cook poured vodka on the stump of his left index finger big brother was still screaming when yiyiing held out the fingertip and tony angel poured more vodka on it then she put the fingertip back where it belonged just hold it on she told big brother and stop screaming danny was sorry that joe was watching the television the tenyearold seemed transfixed by that image of the people clinging to the helicopters skids and then falling off whats happening to them the boy asked his dad theyre dying danny said theres no room for them on the helicopters ed was coughing he went out the kitchen door there was an alley back thereit was used for deliveries and for picking up the trashand they all thought that ed was just stepping out for a cigarette but the dishwasher never came back yiyiing took ah gou out the swinging door and through the dining room he held his severed fingertip in place but now that danny was no longer tightening the towel around his upper arm big brother was bleeding profusely tzumin went with them i guess im going to give everyone in the emergency room my cold after all yiyiing was saying what the fuck is going on one of the businessmen shouted is there anyone working here or what racists war criminals fascist pigs ah gou yelled at them still bleeding in the kitchen the cook said to his son and grandson youre my sous chefs nowwe better get started there are only two tables to deal with popi think we can manage this danny told him if we just ignore the business guys i think theyll leave kaori said nobody leaves xiao dee shouted ill show them what kind of crazy fuckedup place this isand they better like it he went out into the dining room through the swinging doorhis ponytail in that absurd pink ribbon possibly belonging to spicyand even after the door swung shut they could still hear little brother from the kitchen you want to eat the best food you ever had or do you want to die xiao dee was yelling asians are dying but you can eat well he screamed at the businessmen the guinea hen is served with asparagus and a risotto of oyster mushrooms and sage jus the cook was explaining to danny and young joe dont slop the risotto on the plates please where are the guinea hens from pop danny asked from iowa of coursewere out of almost everything that isnt from iowa the cook told him you want to see how your mushroom and mascarpone ravioli gets made xiao dee was asking the businessmen types its done with parmesan and white truffle oil its the best fucking ravioli youll ever have you think white truffle oil comes from iowa he asked them you want to come out in the kitchen and see a bunch of asians dying they are dying on tv right nowif you want to see little brother was shouting tony angel turned to the japanese twins go rescue the business guys from xiao dee he told them both of you the cook accompanied the yokohamas to the dining room where they served the two couples the guinea hens your pasta will be coming right along tony told the businessmen hed wondered why the business guys had so quietly listened to xiao dees tirade now he saw that little brother had taken the bloody cleaver with him into the dining room we need you back in the kitchenwe want you like crazy back there were dying for you the japanese twins were telling xiao dee they had draped themselves on him being careful not to touch the bloody cleaver the businessmen types just sat there waiting even after the cook and xiao dee with kaori and sao had gone back into the kitchen what are the fascist pigs drinking xiao dee was asking the yokohamas tsingtao kaori or sao answered him bring them morekeep the beer coming little brother told them what goes with the ravioli pop danny asked his dad the peas the cook told him use the slotted spoon or there will be too much oil on them joe couldnt get interested in being a sous chef not while the television kept showing the helicopters when the phone rang joe was the only one whose hands werent busy doing something he answered it they all knew there was no maître d in the dining room and they thought it might be yiyiing or tzumin calling from mercy hospital with a report on whether or not they could save ah gous finger its collect from ketchum joe told them say that you accept his grandfather told him i accept the boy said you talk to him danielim busy the cook said but in the passing of the telephone they could all hear what ketchum had to sayall the way from new hampshire this asshole country hi its meits danny the writer told the old logger you still sorry you didnt get to go to vietnam fella ketchum roared at him no im not sorry danny told him but it took him too long to say it ketchum had already hung up there was blood all over the kitchen on the tv the desperate vietnamese dangled from and then fell off the skids of the helicopters the debacle would be replayed for daysall over the world the writer supposed while he watched his tenyearold watching the end of the war his dad hadnt gone to the japanese twins were placating the business guys with more beer xiao dee was standing in the walkin refrigerator with the door open were almost out of tsingtao tony little brother was saying he walked out of the fridge and closed the door then he noticed that the door to the alley was still open what happened to ed xiao dee asked he stepped cautiously into the alley maybe some fucking patriot farmer mistook him for one of us gooks and killed him i think poor ed just went home the cook said i threw up in his sinkmaybe thats why sao said she and kaori had come back to the kitchen to bring the business guys their pasta order can i turn the tv off danny asked them all yes turn it off please one of the yokohamas told him ed is gone xiao dee was shouting from the alley the fuckerpatriots have kidnapped him i can take joe home and put him to bed the other twin said to danny the boy has to eat first the cook said you can be the maître d for a little while cant you daniel sure i can do it the writer told him he washed his hands and face and put on a clean apron when he went into the dining room the businessmen types seemed surprised that he wasnt asianor especially angrylooking whats going on in the kitchen one of the men asked him tentatively he definitely didnt want xiao dee to overhear him its the end of the war on the television danny told them the pasta is terrific in spite of everything another of the businessmen types said to danny compliments to the chef ill tell him danny said some faculty types showed up later and a few proud parents taking their beloved university students out to dinner but if you werent back in the kitchen at maos with the angry asians you might not have known that the war was over or how it ended they didnt show that television footage everywhere or for very longnot in most of america anyway ah gou would get to keep his fingertip kaori or sao took young joe home and put him to bed that night and danny drove home with yiyiing the cook would drive himself home after maos had closed there was an awkward momentafter the japanese babysitter had gone and before the cook came homewhen joe was asleep upstairs and danny was alone in the third court street kitchen with the nurse from hong kong like danny and his dad yiyiing didnt drink she was making tea for herselfsomething allegedly good for her cold so here we are alone at last yiyiing said to him i guess were almost alone anyway she added its just you and me and my damn cold the kettle had not yet come to boil and yiyiing folded her arms on her breasts and stared at him what danny asked her you know what she said to him he was the first to lower his eyes hows it going with that tricky business of moving your daughter and your parents here he asked her finally she turned away im very slowly changing my mind about that yiyiing told him much later the cook would hear that shed gone back to hong kong she was working as a nurse there none of them ever heard what happened to the yokohamas kaori and sao that night the war ended yiyiing took her tea upstairs with her leaving danny alone in the kitchen the temptation to turn on the tv was great but danny wandered outside to the court street sidewalk instead it wasnt very latenot nearly midnightbut most of the houses on the street were dark or the only lights that were on were in the upstairs of the houses people reading in bed or watching television danny imagined from several of the nearby houses danny could recognize that sickly light from a tv setan unnatural bluegreen bluegray shimmer there was something wrong with that color it was warm enough in iowa at the end of april for some windows to be open and while he couldnt make out the exact language on the television danny recognized the drone as the disembodied voice of the newsor so the writer imagined if someone had been watching a love story or another kind of movie how would danny have known if the stars were out danny couldnt see them hed lived on court street for three years thered been nothing ominous about living there except for the driverless blue mustang and now the writer and his family were about to go back to vermont this asshole country ketchum had started to say hed been too angry or too drunk or both to even finish his thought wasnt it too harsh an assessment anyway danny hoped so please look after my dad and my little boy the writer said aloud but to what was he speakingor to whom the starless night above iowa city the one alert and restless soul on court street who might have heard him yiyiingif she was still awakemaybe danny stepped off the sidewalk and into the empty street as if daring the blue mustang to take notice of him please dont hurt my father or my son danny said hurt me if you have to hurt someone he said but who was out there under the unseen heavens to either look after them or hurt them lady sky the writer asked out loud but amy had never said she was a fulltime angel and hed not seen her for eight years there was no answer chapter honey where has my memory gone the cook was thinking he was almost sixty his limp more pronounced tony angel was trying to remember those markets little brother had taken him to in chinatown kam kuo was on mott street kam man on the boweryor was it the other way around it didnt matter the cook concluded he could still recall the more important things how xiao dee had hugged him when theyd said goodbyehow ah gou had twisted the reattached tip of his left index finger to make himself cry she bu de xiao dee had shouted the cheng brothers pronounced this seh boo deh she bu de ah gou cried bending that scarred and slightly crooked first digit chinese immigrants said she bu de to one another xiao dee had explained to the cook during one of their sixteenhour marathons to or from chinatown somewhere out on i you said she bu de when you were leaving your chinese homeland for new york or san francisco or for anywhere far away where you might not see your childhood friends or members of your own family ever again xiao dee had told tony angel that she bu de meant something like i cant bear to let go you say it when you dont want to give up something you have she bu de the cook whispered to himself in his cherished kitchen at avellino whats that boss greg the sous chef asked him i was talking to my calamari tony told him the thing with squid greg is either you cook it just a little or you cook it foreveranything in between and its rubber greg had certainly heard this soliloquy on squid before uhhuh the sous chef said the calamari the cook was preparing for his son daniel was the forever kind tony angel slowly stewed it with canned tomatoes and tomato pasteand with garlic basil red pepper flakes and black olives the cook added the pine nuts and chopped parsley only at the end and he served the squid over penne with more chopped parsley on the side never with parmesannot on calamari he would give daniel just a small arugula salad after the pasta dish maybe with a little goat cheese he had a local vermont chèvre that was pretty good but right now the pepperoni pizzas were ready and the cook pulled them from the oven of his stanley woodstove she bu de he whispered to the old irish stove and greg once more glanced in his direction youre crying againyou know that dont you celeste said to tony you want to talk about it it must be the onions the cook told her bullshit tony she said are those my two pepperonis for the old broads out there without waiting for an answer celeste said they better be my pizzas those old girls are looking hungry enough to eat danny for a first course theyre all yours tony angel told celeste hed already put the penne in the pot of boiling water and he took one out with a slotted spoon and tasted it while he watched every step of celestes dramatic exit from the kitchen loretta was looking at him as if she were trying to decipher a code what the cook said to her mystery man loretta said dannys a mystery man tooisnt he youre as dramatic as your mother the cook told her smiling is the calamari ready or are you telling it your life story loretta asked him out in the dining room dot exclaimed my thats a thinlookin crust its thin all right may said approvingly our cook makes great pizzas celeste told them his crusts are always thin whats he put in the dough dot asked the waitress yeah whats his secret ingredient may asked celeste i dont know if he has one celeste said ill ask him the two old broads were digging inthey ignored her i hope you ladies are hungry celeste added as she turned to go back to the kitchen dot and may just kept eating this was no time to talk danny watched the women eat with growing wonder where had he seen people eat like that he was thinking surely not at exeter where table manners didnt matter but the food was awful at exeter you picked over your food with the greatest suspicionand you talked nonstop if only to distract yourself from what you were eating the old women had been talking and whispering and cackling together like a couple of crows now there wasnt a word between them and no eye contact either they rested their forearms on the table and bent over their plates heads down their shoulders were hunched as if to ward off an attack from behind and danny imagined that if he were closer to them he might hear them emit an unconscious moan or growla sound so innately associated with eating that the women were unaware of it and had long ceased to hear it themselves no one in the north end had ever eaten that way the writer was remembering food was a celebration at vicino di napoli an event that inspired conversation people were engaged with one another when they ate at maos too you didnt just talk over a mealyou shouted and you shared your foodwhereas these two old broads appeared to be protecting their pizzas from each other they wolfed their dinners down like dogs danny knew they wouldnt leave a scrap the red sox just arent reliable greg was saying but the cook was concentrating on the surprise squid dish for his son hed missed what had happened in the game on the radio daniel likes a little extra parsley he was saying to loretta just as celeste came back into the kitchen the two old broads want to know if theres a secret ingredient in your pizza dough tony celeste said to the cook you bet there isits honey tony angel told her i would never have guessed that celeste said thats some secret all right out in the dining room it suddenly came to the writer danny angel where hed seen people eat as if they were animals the way these two old women were eating their pizzas the woodsmen and the sawmill workers had eaten like thatnot only in the cookhouse in twisted river but also in those makeshift wanigans where he and his father had once fed the loggers during a river drive those men ate without talking sometimes even ketchum hadnt spoken a word but these toughlooking broads couldnt have been loggers danny was thinking when loretta interrupted his thoughts surprise the waitress said as she put the squid dish in front of him i was hoping it was going to be the calamari danny told her ha loretta said ill tell your dad may had finished her pepperoni pizza first and anyone seeing the way she eyed the last piece on dots plate might have had reason to warn dot that she should never entirely trust her old friend i guess i liked mine a little better than youre likin yours may said im likin mine just fine dot answered with her mouth full her thumb and index finger quickly gripping the crust of that precious last slice may looked away that writer is finally eatin somethin and it looks pretty appetizin she observed dot just grunted finishing her pizza would you say its almost as good as cookies may asked nope dot said wiping her mouth nobodys pizza is as good as cookies i said almost dot close maybe dot told her i hope you ladies left room for dessert celeste said it looks like those pizzas hit the spot whats the secret ingredient may asked the waitress youll never guess celeste said ill bet its honey dot said both she and may cackled but they stopped cackling when they saw how the waitress was staring at them it didnt happen often that celeste was speechless wait a minute may said it is honey isnt it thats what the cook saidhe puts honey in his dough celeste told them yeah and the next thing youre gonna tell us is that the cook limps dot said that really cracked up the two old broads dot and may couldnt stop cackling over that one not that they missed the message in celestes amazed expression the waitress might as well have told them outright yes indeed the cook limped he limped up a storm but danny had overheard snippets of their conversation before the ladies cackling got out of control hed heard celeste say something about his dad putting honey in the pizza dough and one of the old broads had joked about the cooks limp danny was sensitive about his fathers limp hed heard enough jokes on that subject to last a lifetime most of them from those west dummer dolts at that pisspoor paris manufacturing company school and why did celeste look so stricken suddenly the writer was wondering werent you ladies interested in the pie and the cobbler the waitress asked them wait a minute may said again are you sayin your cooks got a limp he limps a little celeste hesitated to say but in effect shed already said it are you shittin us dot asked the waitress celeste seemed offended but she also looked afraid she knew something was wrong but she didnt know why or what it was neither did danny but to anyone seeing him the writer appeared to be frightened too look our cooks got a limp and he puts honey in his pizza doughits no big deal celeste said to them maybe its a big deal to us may told the waitress is he a little fella dot asked yeah and whats his name may asked i would say our cook is slightly built celeste answered carefully his names tony oh dot said disappointed tony may repeated shaking her head you can bring us one apple pie and one blueberry cobbler dot told the waitress well share em may said it might have ended there if danny hadnt spoken it was his voice that made dot and may look at him more closely when theyd first seen him they must have missed the writers physical resemblance to his father as a young man but it was how wellspoken danny was that reminded both dot and may of the cook in a town like twisted river the cooks enunciationand his perfect dictionhad stood out might i inquire if you two ladies are from around here danny asked those bad old broads sweet jesus may dot said to her friend dont that voice kinda take you back way back may said looking hard at danny dont he look just like cookie too the cookie word was enough to tell danny where these old ladies were from and why they might have been badgering celeste about honey in pizza dough and a little fella of a cookone who limped your name was danny dot said to him have you changed your name too no the writer told them too quickly i gotta meet this here cook may said why dontcha tell your dad to come say hello to us will ya dot asked danny its been so long since we seen one another we got some serious catchin up to do celeste came back with the ladies desserts which danny knew would be only a temporary distraction celeste danny said would you please tell pop that there are two old friends who want to see him tell him theyre from twisted river danny told her our cooks name is tony celeste said a little desperately to the bad old broads shed heard enough about twisted river to make her hope she would never hear anything more about it the cook had told her it would be all over on the day twisted river caught up to him your cooks name is cookie dot said to the waitress just tell him were chokin may told celeste thatll bring him runnin limpin you mean dot corrected her but now their cackles were suppressed if the writer had to guess it seemed that these women had a score to settle with his father you got the same superiorsoundin voice as your daddy may said to danny is the injun around dot asked him no jane is long gone danny told them in the kitchen celeste was still dryeyed when she walked past her daughter i could have used a little help with the party of eight mom loretta was saying to her and then those three couples came in but you just kept talking away to those two old biddies those old biddies are from twisted river celeste told the cook they said to tell you they were chokin cookie celeste had never seen such an expression on tony angels facenone of them hadbut of course shed never called him cookie before is there a problem boss the sous chef asked it was the honey in the pizza wasnt it celeste was saying the honey gave it away i guess dot and may its finished sweetheart tony angel said to celeste she started to cry mom loretta said you dont know me the cook told them all you wont ever know where i go from here he took off his apron and let it fall on the floor youre in charge greg he said to the sous chef they dont know your last name not unless danny tells them celeste managed to say loretta was holding her while she sobbed the cook walked out into the dining room danny was standing between him and the two tough broads they dont know the angel name pop his son whispered to him well thats something to be thankful for his dad said i wouldnt call that a little limpwould you may dot asked her old friend hello ladies the cook said to them but he didnt come any closer the limps gotten worse if you ask me may replied to dot are you just traveling through the cook asked them how come you changed your name cookie dot asked him tony was easier to say than dominic he answered them and it still sounds italian you look awful cookieyoure as white as flour may told him i dont get a lot of sunshine in the kitchen the cook said you look like you been hidin under a rock dot said to him how come you and danny are so spooked to see us may asked him they were always superior to us dot reminded her friend even as a kid you were a superior little snot she said to danny where are you living nowadays the cook asked them he was hoping they lived close bysomewhere in vermont or in new york statebut he could tell by their accents and by just looking at them that they were still living in coos county milan may answered we see your pal ketchum from time to time not that ketchum would say hello to us or nothin dot said you was all so superiorthe three of you and the injun well the cook began his voice trailed away i have a lot to do in the kitchen first you was gonna put honey in the dough and the next minute you wasnt then you changed your mind about it again i guess may said to him thats right the cook said im havin a look in the kitchen dot suddenly said i dont believe a fuckin word these two are tellin us im gonna see for myself if janes still with him neither danny nor his dad did anything to stop her may just waited with them while dot went into the kitchen theres the two waitresses both of em cryin and a young cook and what looks like a busboy and some kid doin the dishesno injun dot announced when she came back boy do you look like youre puttin your pecker somewhere you shouldnt cookie may told him you too she said to danny you got a wife and kids or anythin no wife no children danny told themagain too quickly bullshit dot said i dont believe a fuckin word and i suppose youre not bangin anybody either may asked the cook he didnt answer her he just kept looking at his son daniel their minds were racing far ahead of this moment in avellino how soon could they leave where would they go this time how long before these bad old broads crossed paths with carl and what would they tell the cowboy when they ran into him carl lived in berlin ketchum lived in errol milan was between them if you ask me cookies humpin our waitressthat older one dot said to may shes the one doin most of the cryin the cook just turned and walked back into the kitchen tell them their dinners are on me danielfree pizzas free desserts he said as he was leaving you dont need to tell uswe heard him may said to danny you coulda just been nice to usglad to see us or somethin dot called after the cook but he was gone you dont hafta buy us supper cookie dot hollered into the kitchen but she didnt go after him may was putting money on dannys tabletoo much money for their dinners but danny wouldnt try to stop her and we didnt even eat our pie and cobbler she said to the writer may pointed to his notebook on the table what are you the friggin bookkeeper or somethin you keepin the accounts huh thats right he told her fuck you and your dad dot told him cookie was always holierthanthou and you were always a holierthanthou kid may said to him sorry danny said he just wanted them to leave so that he could concentrate on all that he and his dad had to do and how much or little time they had to do itbeginning with telling ketchum meanwhile there was an unserved party of eight and another table with three astonishedlooking couples everyone had been paying close attention to the confrontation but it was over now dot and may were leaving the women both gave danny the finger as they went out the door for a bewildering momentit was almost as if the sawmill workers wives werent real or they had never found their way to avellino the old ladies didnt appear to know which way to turn on main street then they must have remembered that theyd parked downhill past the latchis theatre when the bad old broads were gone danny spoke to the restaurants uneasy unattended patrons someone will be right with you he told them not knowing if this was even remotely true he knew it wouldnt be true if both loretta and celeste were still in tears back in the kitchen it was worse than danny had expected even the kid doing dishes and the busboy were crying celeste had slumped to the floor where loretta was kneeling beside her stop shouting at me the cook yelled into the telephone i should never have called youthen i wouldnt have to listen to you his father must have called ketchum danny realized tell me what to say greg and ill say it danny said to the sous chef youve got a table of eight and a table of six out there what do i tell them greg was weeping into the rosemary and redwine reduction your dad said avellino is finished greg told him he said this is his last night hes putting the place up for sale but we can run the restaurant ourselves until it sellsif we can manage somehow greg just how the fuck do we manage celeste cried out i didnt say we could greg blubbered get rid of the red sox for starters danny said changing the radio station if youre going to be hysterical you ought to play some music back hereeveryone in the restaurant can hear you yes i know you were always of the opinion that vermont was too fucking close to new hampshire ketchum the cook was shouting into the phone why dont you tell me something useful tell me what to say to the customers greg danny said to the blubbering sous chef tell them they better keep their orders simple greg told him tell them to go home for christs sake loretta said no goddamn ittell them to stay the sous chef said angrily we can manage dont be an asshole greg celeste told him she was still sobbing danny went back into the dining room where the party of eight was already arguing with one anotherabout whether to stay or leave no doubt the three couples at the table for six seemed more resigned to their fate or at least more willing to wait listen danny said to them all theres a crisis in the kitchenim not kidding i would advise you either to leave now or to order something basic the pizzas maybe or a pasta dish by the way the beef satay is excellent so is the calamari he went to the wine rack and picked out a couple of good reds danny angel may have stopped drinking sixteen years ago when he was still daniel baciagalupo but the writer knew the names of the better bottles the wine is on me he told them bringing them glasses too he had to go back to the kitchen to get a corkscrew from either loretta or celeste and one of the party of eight asked him timidly for a beer sure danny said a beers no problem you should try a moretti at least celeste was standing though loretta looked in better shape one moretti for the party of eight i gave wine to everyone elseon me danny said to loretta can you pull the corks yeah i guess im okay loretta told him i can work celeste said unconvincingly you better get your dad off the phone before he has a heart attack greg said to danny im not changing my name again the cook was screaming into the phone im not leaving my country ketchum why do i have to leave the entire country let me speak to him pop danny said he kissed his father on the forehead taking the telephone from him its me ketchum the writer began dot and may ketchum hollered for christs sake dannythose two would talk their heads off to a pinch of coon shit the first time those bitches run into carl the cowboys going to know where to find you how long do we have ketchum danny asked just give me an educated guess you should have left yesterday ketchum told him you have to leave the country as soon as possible the country danny asked youre a famous writer what do you have to live in this asshole country for ketchum asked him you can write anywhere cant you and how long before cookie retires for that matter he can cook anywherecant he just dont let it be an italian place thats what the cowboy will be looking for and cookie needs a new name dot and may never heard the angel name danny told the old logger carl could hear itwhen he comes looking for you two danny no matter how long after youre gone someone could say the angel name to the cowboy so im supposed to change my name too for gods sake ketchumim a writer keep it then ketchum said morosely the cowboys no reader ill grant you that but cookie cant keep the tony angelhed be better off being dominic baciagalupo again danny dont you dare let him cook in any restaurant with an italian namenot even if its out of the country i have a son ketchumhes american remember danny said to the old woodsman joe is going to be in college in colorado ketchum reminded him this was a sore point with danny that joe would be going to the university of colorado in boulder was something of a disappointment to his dad in dannys opinion his son had gotten into better schools danny believed that joe was going to colorado for the skiing not an education the writer had also read that boulder was a big party town carl doesnt even know you have a child ketchum also reminded danny if youre out of the country ill look after joe in colorado danny asked first things first danny ketchum said get the fuck out of vermont both you and your dad i can look after your boy in the interimbefore he goes off to colorado anyway maybe pop and i could go to colorado too danny suggested its a little like vermont i imaginethere are mountains just bigger ones boulder is a university town and we all liked iowa city writers can fit in in a university town a cook could fit in in boulder couldnt he it wouldnt have to be italian ketchum cut him off you must be as simpleminded as a pinch of coon shit danny you guys ran the first timenow you have to keep running do you think carl cares that youre a family the cowboy doesnt have a familyhes a fucking killer danny and hes on a mission ill let you know our plans ketchum the writer told his fathers old friend carl doesnt know shit about foreign countries ketchum said hell boston wasnt foreign enough for him you think colorado would be too far away for the cowboy to find you colorado s a lot like new hampshire dannythey have guns out there dont they you could be carrying a gun in colorado and no one would look at you twiceisnt that right i suppose so danny said i know you love us ketchum i promised your mom i would look after you ketchum shouted his voice breaking well i guess youre doing it danny told him but ketchum had hung up the writer would remember the song that was playing on the radio it was neil youngs after the gold rush a song from the seventies when danny had switched stations from the red sox game hed inadvertently found gregs oldiebutgoldie music i was thinking about what a friend had said i was hoping it was a lie danny saw that his father was once more stirring his sauces the cook then started rolling out the dough for what looked like three or four more pizzas greg was grilling something but the sous chef paused to take a dish out of the oven neither waitress was in the kitchen but the busboy was busy filling a couple of bread baskets the dishwasher was waiting for more dirty dishes an earnestlooking boy he was reading a paperback probably an assignment for school danny thought nowadays kids didnt read much on their own danny asked the boy what he was reading the young dishwasher smiled shyly showing the author a dogeared massmarket edition of a danny angel novel but that was such a tough night when dot and may made their disruptive appearance in avellino the writer would never remember which book the kid was reading and the bad night was far from over for danny it was just beginning youll find someone kurt vonnegut had said to danny when the young writer was leaving iowa city the first time katie had only recently left him but it hadnt happenednot yet danny supposed there was still time for him to find someone he was only fortyone and he never would have claimed that hed sincerely been trying did he think lady sky was going to drop into his life again just because he couldnt forget her as for what vonnegut also said to the thenunpublished writerthe part about maybe capitalism will be kind to youwell danny was wondering as he drove home to putney from brattleboro how kurt had known on the night of dot and mays visit to avellino when danny and his dad would soon be on the move again the famous writers compound in putney was ablaze with lights to anyone driving by on hickory ridge road the lights that were onin every room in each buildingseemed to advertise just how kind capitalism had been to the bestselling author danny angel was the compound overrun with revelers was every last room of the old farmhouse now the guesthouse occupiedas was evidently the new house that danny had built for himself and joe the lights were also on in the famous writers socalled writing shack as if the partygoers were even partying there but danny had left only the kitchen light on in the new building hed left the other rooms and the other buildings dark the music was loud and conflictingit was coming from both the new building and the guesthouse and every window must have been open it was a wonder that someone hadnt called the police about the noise though the writers compound had no near neighbors almost anyone driving by had to have heard the clashing music danny heard it and saw all the lights ablaze even before he turned in to his driveway where he stopped his car and turned off the engine and his headlights there were no other cars around except joes it was parked in the open garage where joe had left it the last time the boy had been home from school from the far end of his driveway danny could see that even the lights in the garage were on if amy were ever to forgo arriving via parachute the writer was thinking maybe this was how she would announce herself or was it a prank pranks werent armando desimones style other than armando danny had no close friends in the putney areacertainly no one who would have felt comfortable coming on the writers property uninvited had dot and may already called carl but those bad old broads didnt know where danny lived and if the cowboy had somehow managed to find danny angel wouldnt the retired deputy have preferred the dark surely the former constable and deputy sheriff wouldnt have turned on all the lights and the music why would carl have wanted to announce himself furthermore there was no occasion for a surprise partynot that the writer could think of maybe it was armando danny was reconsidering but the choice of music couldnt have been armandos or marys the desimones liked to dance they were beatles people this sounded like eighties musicthe stuff joe played when he was home danny didnt know what the music was but there were two separate soundsboth of them terrible at war with each other the taptap of the flashlight on the driversside window made danny jump in the seat he saw it was his friend jimmy the state trooper jimmy must have turned off the headlights of his patrol car when hed slipped into the driveway and had parked broadside behind dannys car hed cut the police cars engine too not that danny could possibly have heard the troopers arrival over the music whats with the music danny jimmy asked him its a little loud isnt it i think you should turn it down i didnt turn it on jimmy the writer said i didnt turn on the lights or the music whos in your house the trooper asked i dont know danny said i didnt invite anyone maybe theyve come and goneshall i have a look jimmy asked him ill come with you danny told the trooper have you had any letters from a crazy fan lately jimmy asked the writer or any hate mail maybe nothing like that for a while danny told him thered been the usual religious nuts and the assholes who constantly complained about the writers unseemly language or the tooexplicit sex everyones a fucking censor nowadays ketchum had said once he published east of bangor his socalled abortion novelthe hate mail might heat up for a while danny knew but thered been nothing of a threatening nature recently theres nobody out to get youno one you know about right jimmy asked theres someone who thinks he has a score to settle with my dadsomeone dangerous danny said but this cant be about that the writer said danny followed the trooper into the kitchen of the new house first little things were amiss the oven door was open a bottle of olive oil lay on its side on the counter but the cap was screwed on tight and the oil hadnt leaked danny walked into the living room where he could shut off the loudest of the headpounding music and he noted that a coffeetable lamp now lay on the couch but nothing appeared to have been damaged the deliberate but small disturbances signified mischief not vandalism the television had been turned on but without sound though danny had walked through the dining room on his way to the living room which was the source of half the music hed noticed only that one of the chairs at the diningroom table had been upended but jimmy had lingered there at the table when danny turned the music off jimmy said do you know whose dog this is danny i believe its one of a pair of dogs i know out on the back road to westminster west the dogs belong to roland drake maybe you know himhe went to windham the dead dog had stiffened since danny last saw himhe was the huskyshepherd mix the one rooster had killed the dog lay fully extended with a frozen snarl on the diningroom table one of the dogs paws contorted by rigor mortis pressed flat the note danny had composed to the hippie carpenter where danny had typed enough is enough okay the hippie had replied in longhand dont tell melet me guess the writer said to the state trooper ill bet the asshole wrote fuck youor words to that effect thats what he wrote danny jimmy said i guess you know him roland drakethat asshole danny was thinking armando desimone had been right roland drake had been one of dannys writing students at windham college albeit briefly drake had dropped the course after his first teachers conference when danny told the arrogant young fuck that good writing could rarely be accomplished without revision roland drake wrote firstdraft gibberishhe had a halfway decent imagination but he was sloppy he paid no attention to specific details or to the language im into writing not rewriting drake had told danny i only like the creative part but rewriting is writing danny said to the young man sometimes rewriting is the most creative part roland drake had sneered and walked out of dannys office that had been their only conversation the boy hadnt been as hairy then perhaps drake hadnt been as drawn to the hippie persuasion when he was younger and danny had trouble recognizing people he previously knew that was a real problem with being famous you were always meeting people for what you thought was the first time but they would remember that theyd already met you it was probably an additional insult to drake that danny hadnt remembered himnot just that danny had told drake to mind his dog or dogs yes i know roland drake danny said to jimmy he told the state trooper the storyincluding the part about rooster killing the dog that now lay stiffly on the diningroom table from dannys typed note jimmy could see for himself how the writer had tried to make peace with the asshole hippie the writer carpenter as armando had called him didnt know when enough was enoughno more than roland drake knew that rewriting was writing and that it could be the most creative part of the process danny and jimmy went through the rest of the main house turning off lights putting things in order in joes bathroom the bathtub had been filled the water was cold but there was no mess thered been no spills in joes bedroom one of the boys wrestlingteam photos had been removed from the picture hook on the wall and was propped up by a pillow against the headboard of the bed in dannys bathroom one of his suit jackets on a coat hanger had been hung on the showercurtain rod his electric razor and a pair of dress shoes were in the otherwiseempty bathtub all the bath towels were piled at the foot of the bed in the master bedroom drake is just a shitdisturber danny the trooper told him hes a little trustfund fuckthey never dare to do any real damage because they know their parents would end up having to pay for it the same small nuisances were everywhere throughout the house when they went to turn the lights out in the garage danny discovered a tube of toothpaste on the drivers seat of joes car a toothbrush was tucked under the driversside sun visor there was more of the same juvenile mischief in the guesthousethe original farmhousewhere the music had been cranked up as loud as it would go and the soundless tv was on lamps were tipped on their sides a pyramid of lampshades decorated the kitchen table several pictures had been rehung upside down and the beds were unmadein a manner that made you think someone had slept in them this is irritating but its mainly childish danny said to the trooper i agree jimmy said im selling the whole property anyway danny told him not because of this i hope the state trooper said no but this makes it easier the writer answered because danny knew he was moving away and the putney property would have to be sold maybe roland drakes violation of the writers personal effects felt like less of an invasion than it truly wasthat is until danny and jimmy came to the famous authors writing shack yes all the lights were on and some papers had been misplaced but drake had overstepped hed done some actual harm danny had been proofreading the galleys of east of bangor as testimony to the novelists ceaseless need to rewriteto tamper with to endlessly revisedanny had written more than the usual number of notes and queries in the margins of the galleys this demonstrationnamely that danny angel was both a writer and a rewritermust have been too much to take for a failed writer a writer carpenter like roland drake the evidence of rewriting in the galleys of dannys soontobepublished next novel had pushed drake over the edge with a sharpie permanent marker in deep black roland drake had scrawled on the cover of the uncorrected proofs of east of bangor and inside the galleys on every page drake had written his comments with a sharpie finepoint red pen not that the writer carpenters commentary was either insightful or elaborate but drake had taken the time to defile every page there were more than four hundred pages in the galleys of east of bangor danny had proofread three quarters of the novel andnotwithstanding what a rewriter he washed written notes or queries on only about fifteen or twenty of the pages roland drake had crossed out dannys notes and queries hed rendered the authors revisions unreadable drake had purposely made a mess of the galleys but it neednt have cost danny more than two weeks additional worknot even that under normal circumstances though drakes destruction of the writers uncorrected proofs seemed greater than a merely symbolic assault but at a time when the cook and his son were confronted with the chaos of going on the run again roland drakes attack on dannys sixth novel might delay the publication of east of bangor by several monthsconceivably for as long as half a year the novel was scheduled to be published in the fall of maybe not nowpossibly the book wouldnt be published until the winter of with all that was newly happening in dannys life it would take the author a while to remember the revisions hed already made in the galleysand to find the time to proofread the last quarter of the novel revise the chickenshit title drake had scribbled on the cover of east of bangor in deep black change the authors fake name and in red throughout the novel while the writer carpenters criticism demonstrated no great range or indepth perception drake had underlined a phrase or circled a wordon fourhundredplus pagesand hed added a cryptic comment albeit only one per page this sucks and rewrite were the most repeated along with cut and dogkiller less common were lame and feeble more than once lengthy had been scrawled across the entire page only twice but memorably drake had written i fucked franky too perhaps drake had slept with franky danny only now considered that might have contributed to the onetime writing students animosity toward the bestselling author have a look jimmy danny said to the trooper handing him the desecrated copy of the galleys gee this makes more work for you i suppose jimmy said turning the pages year of the dog wouldnt publish this shit the state trooper read aloud with deadpan puzzlement jimmy always looked pained by what he didnt understandat once heartbroken and baffled for a cop whod shot his share of dogs jimmy had the sad droopy eyes of a labrador retriever tall and thin with a long face the trooper looked questioningly at danny for some explanation of roland drakes ravings year of the dog was a small literary magazine danny explained either windham college published it or it was independently published by some windham college studentsi cant remember franky is a girl jimmy asked reading further yes the writer answered that young woman who lived here for a whilethat one right the trooper asked thats her jimmy you write with a limp jimmy read aloud gee drake should bury his own dogdont you think jimmy danny asked the trooper ill take rolands dog back to him well have a little talk jimmy said you could get a restraining order i dont need one jimmyim leaving remember danny said i know how to talk to roland the trooper said just watch out for the other dog jimmyhe comes at you from behind danny warned him i wont shoot him if i dont have to dannyi only shoot them when i have to the trooper said i know danny told him its hard to imagine anyone out to get your dad jimmy ventured i cant conceive of someone having a score to settle with the cook you want to tell me about that danny the cop asked here was another intersection in the road the writer thought what were these junctions where making a sharpleft or sharpright turn from the previously chosen path presented a tempting possibility hadnt there been an opportunity for danny and his dad to go back to twisted river as if nothing had ever happened to injun jane and of course there was the case of putting paul polcari back in the kitchen at vicino di napoli with ketchums singleshot gaugeinstead of putting someone back there who might have pulled the fucking trigger well wasnt this another opportunity to escape the conundrum just tell jimmy everything about injun jane about carl and sixpack pamabout the retired deputy with his longbarreled colt that fucking cowboy short of asking ketchum to kill the bastard what other way out was there and danny knew that if he or his dad asked ketchum outright ketchum would kill the cowboy the old logger hadnt murdered lucky pinette in his bed with a stamping hammer lucky was probably asleep at the time but the killer couldnt have been ketchum or there would be nothing holding ketchum back from killing carl but all danny said to his statetrooper friend was its about a woman a long time ago my dad was sleeping with a loggingcamp constables girlfriend later the camp constable became a county deputy sheriffand when he found out what had happened to his girlfriend he came looking for my dad the deputy is retired now but we have reason to believe he might still be lookinghes crazy a crazy excop thats not good jimmy said the former deputy sheriff is getting oldthats the good part he cant keep looking much longer danny told the trooper who looked thoughtful jimmy also seemed suspicious there was more to the story of course and the state trooper probably could discern this in the writers atypically vague telling of the tale and what trouble could danny have gotten into for killing a woman he mistook for a bear when hed been a twelveyearold but danny didnt say more about it and jimmy could tell that his friend was content to keep the matter to himself and his dad besides there was a dead dog to deal with the business at hand giving roland drake a good talkingto must have seemed more pressing to the state trooper have you got some of those large green garbage bags jimmy asked ill take care of that dog for you why dont you get a little sleep danny we can talk more about the crazy old excop when you want to thanks jimmy danny told his friend just like that the writer was thinking hed driven past the intersection in the road it hadnt even been in the category of a decision but now the cook and his son could only keep driving and how old was the cowboy anyway carl was the same age as ketchum who was the same age as sixpack pam the retired deputy sheriff was sixtysix not too old to squeeze a triggernot yet from his driveway danny watched the taillights of the statepolice patrol car as jimmy drove off on hickory ridge road it wouldnt take the trooper long to get to roland drakes driveway of abandoned vehicles and drakes surviving huskyshepherd mix suddenly it meant a lot to danny to know what was going to happen when jimmy brought the dead dog back to the asshole hippie would that really be the end of it was enough ever enough or did the violence just perpetuatethat is whenever something began violently danny had to know he got in his car and drove up hickory ridge road until he spotted the troopers taillights flickering ahead of him then danny slowed down he could no longer keep the squad cars taillights in sight but he kept following at a distance jimmy had probably seen dannys headlights albeit briefly surely the state policeman would have known he was being followed knowing jimmy he would have guessed it was danny too but danny knew that he didnt need to see what happened when the trooper pulled into roland drakes salvage yard of a driveway the writer knew he needed only to be near enough to hear the shot if there was a shot it turned out that danny and his dad had more time than they knew but they were wise not to count on it they listened to ketchum this time for hadnt ketchum been right the last time vermont wasnt far enough away from new hampshire as the old woodsman had told them would dot and may have wandered into maos in iowa city not likely for that matter danny wondered whether anyone from coos county ever would have found the cook and his son in boulder colorado where joe would soon be going to school also unlikely but the writer was persuaded not to take that chance though leaving the country wouldnt be easynot the way ketchum meant it because the logger had something permanent in mind ketchum also had an idea about where ketchum had called the cook and his son in the loggers hungover or fragile sobriety of the morning following dot and mays calamitous visit to avellino of course ketchum phoned them individually but it was irritating how the woodsman spoke to each of them as if both danny and his dad were there for thirteen years the cowboy believed you two were in toronto because carl thought that was where angel was from right you bet im right ketchum bellowed dear god the cook was thinking in his beloved kitchen at avellino where hed made himself a very strong espresso and was wondering why ketchum couldnt resist shouting to make himself heard according to ketchum dot and may had sizably less imagination than a pinch of coon shit while the gossipfeeding bitches would definitely tell the cowboy what they knew they wouldnt agree with each other about how to tell him or when dot would be in favor of waiting until the retired deputy did something particularly obnoxious or he was behaving in a superior fashion whereas may would want to insinuate that she knew somethinguntil carl was crazy to know what it was in short the old broads habits of meanspirited manipulation might buy danny and his dad a little time on the phone to danny ketchum was more exact heres the point you two now that carl knows you went to boston not toronto and hell know soon enough that you then went to vermont the cowboy would never believe that youre in toronto thats the last place hed lookthats where you should go they speak english in toronto youve got a publisher there dont you danny and i imagine theres lots of jobs for a cooksomething not italian cookie or i swear ill come shoot you myself im not cookie danny almost said but he just held the phone toronto wasnt such a bad idea the writer danny angel was thinking as he waited out the mounting hysteria of ketchums phone call danny had been there on a book tour or two it was a good city he was thinkingto the degree that danny thought about cities at all the cook was more of a city guy than his son canada was a foreign country thus satisfying ketchums criterion but toronto was near enough to the states to make keeping in touch with joe possible colorado would be easy to get to from toronto of course danny wanted to know what joe might think of the ideanot to mention what the cook thought of ketchums suggestion after ketchum ended his call to danny the writers telephone rang almost immediately naturally it was dannys dad there will be no peace while that lunatic has his own phone daniel the cook said to his son and if he ever gets a fax machine we will be doomed to be addressed in capital letters and exclamation points for the rest of our lives but what do you think of ketchums idea dad what about toronto danny asked i dont care where we goim just sorry to have dragged you into this i was only trying to keep you safe his father said then the cook started to cry i dont want to go anywhere tony angel said i love it here i know you doim sorry pop but well be okay in toronto i know we will the writer told his father i cant ask ketchum to kill carl danieli just cant do it the cook told his son i knowi cant ask him either danny said you do have a publisher in canada dont you daniel his dad asked for the first time danny could hear something oldsomething approaching elderlyin his fathers voice the cook was almost sixty but what danny had heard in his dads voice sounded older than that hed heard something more than anxious something almost frail if you have a publisher in toronto his father was saying im sure hell help us get settled in there wont he shemy canadian publisher is a she danny told his dad i know shell help us popitll be easy there and well get a place in colorado where we can visit joeand joe can come visit us we dont have to think of this move as necessarily permanentnot for a while anyway well just see how we like it in canada okay okay the cook said but he was still crying i could leave vermont today the writer was thinking danny did not feel an attachment to his putney property that nearly approximated his dads love of avellino in brattleboro or his fathers life there after dot and mays appearance in the restaurantnot to mention roland drakes visit and drakes dead dog on the diningroom tabledanny felt that he could leave vermont forever and never look back when carl eventually encountered those bad old broads dot and may the cowboy would get to vermont too late with armando and mary desimones help danny had sold the putney property by then there was no writers compound remaining on hickory ridge road and windham college where the writer danny angel had taught was a college with a different name and purpose now landmark college a leading institution for learningdisabled students by the time the cowboy showed up in brattleboro avellino itself would be goneand wherever greg the sous chef went carl wouldnt find him at the cooks urging celeste and her daughter loretta and lorettas kid left town the cowboy would come up empty once again but there was no question that dot and may had blabbed their best to him was it possible that carl was as much of an imbecile as ketchum had at times maintained did the cowboy possess no better detective skills than those of ketchums muchmaligned pinch of coon shit or was it simply that throughout the retired deputys investigations in vermont the angel name had not come up in brattleboro evidently the cowboy had not inquired about the cook and his son at the book cellar you knew cookie was in vermont you knew it all along didnt you ketchum carl would one day ask the old logger cookie is he still around ketchum said to the cowboy i wouldnt have figured that a little fella with a limp like his would be so longlastingwould you carl keep it up ketchumyou just keep it up carl said oh i willill keep it up all right ketchum told the cowboy but danny couldnt wait to leave vermont after the night he and jimmy found the dead dog on the writers diningroom table danny angel wanted to be gone that night hed driven no farther out the back road to westminster west than the bottom of barretts long uphill driveway he had backed his car onto the animal lovers property danny knew that barrett went to bed early and that she wouldnt be aware of a car parked in her drivewayso far away from her horse farm that not even her horses would be disturbed by its presence besides danny had turned off the engine and his headlights he just sat in the car which was facing westminster west with all the windows open it was a warm windless night danny knew he could hear a gunshot for a couple of miles on such a night what he didnt know at first was did he really want to hear it and what would hearing or not hearing that gunshot signify exactly it was more than the survival or the death of roland drakes biteyoufrombehind huskyshepherd mix that the writer was listening for at fortyone danny felt like a twelveyearold all over again it didnt help that it had started to rain he remembered the misty night he and his dad had left twisted river in the pontiac chieftainhow hed sat waiting in the station wagon which was parked near sixpack pams danny had been listening for the discharge of carls colt which would mean his dad was dead upon the sound of that shot the boy would have run up the stairs to sixpacks place he would have begged her to let him in and then ketchum would have taken care of him that had been the plan and danny had done his part hed sat in the car in the falling rain waiting to hear the gunshot that never came though there were times when danny felt he was still waiting to hear it on the back road to westminster westat the foot of his former lovers drivewaythe writer danny angel was listening as alertly as he could he was hoping he would never hear that shotthe earsplitting discharge of the cowboys coltbut it was with that shot in mind that the writer began to indulge the dangerous whatif side of his imagination what if the state trooper didnt have to shoot roland drakes other dogwhat if somehow jimmy could persuade the writer carpenter and his shepherdhusky mix that truly enough was enough might that signify an end to the violence or to the threat of violence it was then that the writer was aware of what he was listening for nothing it was nothing that he hoped he would hear it was the noshot that might mean his dad would be safethat the cowboy like paul polcari might never pull the trigger danny was trying not to think about what jimmy had told himthis was concerning the tube of toothpaste and the toothbrush in joes car possibly theyd not been put there by roland drake maybe the toothpaste and the toothbrush hadnt been part of drakes mischief i hate to tell you this danny but ive busted lots of kids whove been drinking in their cars the trooper had said the kids often have toothpaste and a toothbrush handyso their parents dont smell what theyve been drinking on their breath when they come home but danny preferred to think that the toothpaste and the toothbrush had been more of drakes childish business the writer didnt like to think about his son drinking and driving was danny superstitious most writers who believe in plot are danny didnt like to think about what lady sky had said to joe either if youre ever in trouble ill be back shed said to the twoyearold kissing his forehead well not on a night as dark as this one the writer thought on a night as dark as this one no skydivernot even lady skycould see where to land now the rain had blotted out what little moonlight there was the rain was coming in the open windows of dannys car and the water had beaded on the windshield which made the darkness more impenetrable surely the state trooper had already arrived in drakes junkyard of a driveway and what would jimmy do then danny was wondering just sit in the patrol car until drake had noticed the car was there and came outside to talk to him and would roland have come out alone or would he have brought the backbiting dog with him then again it was raining out of consideration for the hippie carpenter and because it was late the trooper might have gotten out of his car and knocked on drakes door at that thought came a knocking on the passengerside door of dannys car a flashlight shone in the writers face oh heart be stillits just you he heard barrett say his former lover who was carrying a rifle opened the car door and slipped inside to sit beside him she was wearing her kneehigh rubber stable boots and an oilskin poncho shed pushed back the hood when she got into the car and her long white hair was unbraidedas if shed gone to bed hours ago and had suddenly been woken up barretts thighs were bare under the poncho she was wearing nothing danny knew of course that barrett slept naked were you missing me danny she asked him youre up late arent you danny asked her about an hour ago i had to put one of my horses downit was too late to call the bloody vet barrett told him she sat like a man with her knees spread apart the carbine with the barrel pointed to the floor rested between her pretty dancers legs it was an old boltaction remingtona springfield shed explained to him some years ago when shed shown up on his putney property where she was hunting deer barrett still hunted deer there there was an untended apple orchard on the land and barrett had shot more than one deer in that orchard what had the cook called hera selective animal lover was it danny knew more than a few like her im sorry about your horse he told her im sorry about the guni know you dont like guns she said but i didnt recognize your carits new i guessand one should take some precaution when there are strange men parked in ones driveway yes i was missing you danny lied im leaving vermont maybe i was just trying to remember it before i go this last bit was true besides the fiction writer couldnt tell such a selective animal lover the deaddog storynot to mention that he was waiting to hear the fate of a second dognot on such a gloomy night as the one dot and may had created anyway youre leaving barrett asked him why i thought you liked it hereyour dad loves his place in brattleboro doesnt he were both leaving were lonely i guess danny told her tell me about it barrett said she let the butt of the gun rest against her thigh while she took one of dannys hands and guided it under the poncho to her breast she was so smallas petite as katie had been the writer realizedand in the silvery light of the blottedout moon in the neartotal darkness of the cars interior barretts white hair shone like the hair of katies ghost i must have wanted to say goodbye danny said to her he meant it actuallythis wasnt untrue might it not be a comfort to lie in the lithe older womans warm arms and not think about anything else youre sweet barrett said to him youre much too sad for my taste but youre very sweet danny kissed her on the mouth the shock of her extremely white hair casting a ghostly glow on her narrow face which shed turned up to him while she closed her palegray icecold eyes this allowed danny to look past her out the open window of the car he wanted to be sure he saw jimmys statepolice cruiser if it passed by on the road how long did it take to deliver a dead dog to the animals owner and to deliver whatever lecture jimmy had in mind for the asshole hippie danny was wondering almost certainly if the trooper was going to be forced to shoot drakes other dog danny would already have heard the shot hed been listening and listening for it even over his conversation with barrett it was better to kiss her than to talk the kissing was quiet there would be no missing the gunshot if there was one lets go up to my house barrett murmured to him breaking away from the kiss i just shot my horsei want to take a bath sure danny said but he didnt reach for the key in the ignition the squad car hadnt driven past barretts driveway and thered been no shot the writer tried to imagine themjimmy and the writer carpenter maybe the trooper and roland drake that trustfund fuck were sitting at the hippies kitchen table danny tried to envision jimmy patting the huskyshepherd mix or possibly scratching the dogs soft earsmost dogs liked it when you did that but danny had trouble seeing such a scene that was why he hesitated before starting his car what is it barrett asked him the shot was louder than hed expected though drakes driveway was two or three miles away danny had underestimated the sound of jimmys gun hed been thinking that the trooper carried a butnot knowing guns handguns especiallydanny didnt know that jimmy liked a wildey magnum also known as the wildey survivor there was a muffled bangeven bigger than the cowboys colt danny only realized as barrett flinched in his arms her fingers locating but scarcely touching the trigger of her remington some bloody poacherill give jimmy a call in the morning barrett said she had relaxed again in his arms why call jimmy danny asked her why not the game warden the game warden is worthlessthe bloody fool is afraid of poachers barrett said besides jimmy knows who all the poachers are theyre all afraid of him oh was all danny could say he didnt know anything about poachers danny started the engine he turned on his headlights and the windshield wipers and he and barrett put up the windows of the car the writer turned around in the road and headed up the long driveway to the horse farmnot knowing which piece of the puzzle was missing and not sure what part of the story was still ongoing one thing was clear as barrett sat beside him with the carbine now across her lap the short barrel of the lightweight rifle pointed at the passengerside door enough was never enough there would be no stopping the violence iv toronto chapter the blue mustang it was not far from their rosedale neighborhood where the cook shared a threestory fourbedroom house with his writer son to the restaurant on yonge street but at his agehe was now seventysixand with his limp which had noticeably worsened after seventeen years of city sidewalks dominic baciagalupo whod reclaimed his name was a slow walker the cook now limped along the slippery sidewalk winter had never been his friend and today dominic was worrying about those two new condominiums under construction virtually in their backyard what if one or the other of these eclipsed daniels writingroom view of the clock tower on the summerhill liquor store when i can no longer see the clock tower from my desk its time for us to move danny had told his dad whether his son was serious or not the cook was no fan of moving hed moved enough the view from the house on cluny drive was of no concern to dominic hed not had any alcohol for more than fiftysix years the cook couldnt have cared less that a couple of condominiumsinprogress might keep him from seeing the summerhill liquor store was it because daniel was drinking again that he cared about losing his view of the liquor store dominic wondered and for how long would the construction sites be an eyesore the cook was fretting dominic was of an age when anything that made a mess bothered him yet he liked living in rosedale and he loved the restaurant where he worked dominic baciagalupo also loved the sound of tennis balls which he could hear in the warmweather months when the windows were open in the house on cluny drive because the cook and his son lived within sight and sound of the courts belonging to the toronto lawn tennis club where they could also hear the voices of children in the swimming pool in the summer even in the winter months when all the windows were closed they slept to the sound of the slowly moving trains that snaked through midtown toronto and crossed yonge street on the trestle bridge which the cook now saw was adorned with christmas lights enlivening the dull gray gloom of early afternoon it was december in the city the festive lights the decorations the shoppers were all around as he stood waiting for the crossing light on yonge street to change it was a mild shock to dominic to suddenly remember that ketchum was coming to toronto for christmas while this wasnt a recent phenomenon the cook couldnt get used to the unnaturalness of the old logger being in the city it had been fourteen years since the writer danny angel and his dad had spent their christmases in colorado with joe ketchum had not made those trips it was too long a drive from new hampshire to colorado and ketchum steadfastly refused to fly in those winters when joe went to the university in boulder daniel had rented a ski house in winter park the road out of grand lake through rocky mountain national park was closed in the wintertime so it took about two hours to drive from boulderyou had to take i and us over berthoud passbut joe loved the skiing in winter park and his dad had spoiled him or so the cook reflected as he waited for the long light on yonge street to change those christmases in colorado were beautiful but the house in winter park had been too much of a temptation for joeespecially during the remainder of the ski season when the young college students father and grandfather were back in toronto naturally the boy was going to cut some classesif not every time there was fresh snow in the ski area the nearby skiing alone would have tempted any college kid in boulder but having a house in winter park at his disposalit was within walking distance of the ski liftswas almost certainly joes undoing oh daniel what were you thinking dominic baciagalupo thought at last the light changed and the cook limped across yonge street mindful of those harebrained city drivers who were desperate to find a parking place at the summerhill liquor store or the beer store what had his writer son once called the neighborhood the cook tried to remember oh yes dominic recalled shopping for hedonists daniel had said there were some fancy markets there it was trueexcellent produce fresh fish great sausages and meats but ridiculously expensive in the cooks opinionand now in the holiday season it seemed to dominic that every bad driver in town was buying booze he did not fault his beloved daniel for drinking again the cook understood his sons reasons the icy wind whipped the long way up yonge street from lake ontario as dominic fumbled with his gloves and the key to the restaurants locked door the waitstaff and most of the kitchen crew entered the kitchen from crowns lanethe alleyway parallel to yonge street behind the restaurantbut the cook had his own key turning his back to the wind he struggled to let himself in the front door the winters had been colder in coos countyand in windham county vermont toobut the damp penetrating cold of the wind off the lake reminded dominic baciagalupo of how cold hed been in the north end of boston though hed had carmella to keep him warm the cook was remembering he missed herher alone only carmellabut dominic strangely didnt miss having a woman in his life not anymore not at his age why was it that he didnt miss rosie the cook caught himself thinking nowadays cookie ketchum had said i sometimes find myself not missing her can you imagine that yes he could dominic had to admit or was it the tension among the three of themor janes harsh judgment or keeping daniel in the darkthat ketchum and the cook didnt miss inside the restaurant dominic was greeted by the smell of what silvestro the young chef called the mother sauces the veal justhe mother of all mother sauceshad been started during the dinner service last night it underwent both a first and a second boil before a final reduction silvestros other mother sauces were a tomato sauce and a béchamel the cook as he hung up his coat and scarfand halfheartedly attempted to rearrange what joes favorite ski hat had done to his haircould somehow smell all the mother sauces at once the old pro they called him in the kitchen although dominic was content with the role of sous chef to the masterful silvestro who was the saucier and did all the meats kristine and joyce did the soups and the fishthey were the first women chefs the cook had worked withand scott was the bread and dessert guy dominic who was semiretired was the oddjob man in the kitchen he did startup and finishup jobs from each station which included spelling silvestro with the sauces and the meats jack of all trades they called the cook in the kitchen too he was older than any of them by farnot just silvestro their hotshot young chef whom dominic adored silvestro was like a second son to him the cook thoughtnot that he ever would have said so to his beloved daniel dominic had also been careful not to mention the filial nature of his feelings for young silvestro to ketchumpartly because the woodsman was now a veteran and bullying faxer ketchums faxes to the cook and his son were ceaseless and indiscriminate you could sometimes read a page or more without knowing who the fax was for and ketchums faxes arrived at all hours of the day and night for the sake of a good nights sleep danny and his dad had been forced to keep the fax machine in the kitchen of their house on cluny drive more to the point ketchum had issues regarding silvestro the young chefs name was too italian for the old loggers liking it wouldnt be good if ketchum knew that his pal cookie thought of silvestro as a second sonno dominic didnt want to receive a slew of faxes from ketchum complaining about that too ketchums usual complaints were more than enough i thought this was a french place where you were working in your semiretired fashion cookie you wouldnt be thinking of changing the restaurants name would you not to anything italian i presume that new fella the young chef you speak ofsilvestro is that his name well he doesnt sound very french to me the restaurant is still called patrice right yes and no the cook was thinking there was a reason he hadnt answered ketchums most recent fax the owner and maître d of the restaurant patrice arnaud was daniels agefiftyeight arnaud had been born in lyon but grew up in marseilles at sixteen he went to hotel school in nice in the kitchen at patrice there was an old sepiatoned photograph of arnaud as a teenager in chefs whites but arnauds future would lie in management he had impressed the guests in the dining room of a beach club in bermuda where hed met the proprietor of toronto s venerable wembley hotel when the cook had first come to toronto in patrice arnaud was managing maximsa favorite café rendezvous in the bay and bloor area of the city at the time maxims was the third transformation of a caférestaurant in the tired old wembley to dominic baciagalupo who was still quaking from ketchums dire warning that he totally detach himself from the world of italian restaurants patrice arnaud and maxims were clearly firstratebetter yet they were not italian in fact patrice had enticed his brother marcel to leave marseilles and become the chef at maxims which was very french ah but the ship is sinking dominic patrice had warned the cook he meant that toronto was rapidly changing the restaurantgoers of the future would want to venture beyond the staid hotel restaurants after arnaud and his brother left maxims the old wembley hotel became a parking garage for the next decade the cook worked with the arnaud brothers at their own restaurant on queen street westa neighborhood in transition and somewhat seedy for much of that time but the restaurant which patrice named bastringue prospered they were doing fifty covers at lunch and dinner marcel was the master chef then and dominic loved learning from him there was foie gras there were fresh fine de claire oysters from france once again the cook failed to teach himself desserts he never mastered marcels tarte tatin with calvados sabayon bastringueparisian argot for a popular dance hall and bar that served food and winewould even weather the recession they put waxed paper over the linen tablecloths and turned the restaurant into a bistrosteak frites steamed mussels with white wine and leeksbut their lease ran out in after queen street west had gone from seedy to hip to dull mainstream in the space of a decade bastringue became a shoe store marcel went back to france the cook and patrice arnaud stuck together they went to work at avalon for a year but arnaud told dominic that they were just biding time patrice wanted another place of his own and in he bought what had been a failed restaurant on yonge street at summerhill as for silvestro he originally came from italy but he was a calabrese whod worked in london and milan travel was important to arnaud it means you can learn new things patrice told dominic when he decided on young silvestro as his next master chef as for the new restaurants name patricewell what else would arnaud have called it you earned it dominic told patrice dont be embarrassed by your own name for the first few years patricethe name and to a lesser extent the restauranthad worked arnaud and the cook taught silvestro some of marcels standbys the lobster with mustard sabayon the fish soup from brittany the duck foiegras terrine with a spoonful of port jelly the halibut en papillote the côte de boeuf for two the grilled calfs liver with lardons and pearl onions and a balsamic demiglace naturally silvestro added his own dishes to the menuravioli with snails and garlicherb butter veal scallopini with a lemon sauce housemade tagliatelle with duck confit and porcini mushrooms rabbit with polenta gnocchi dominic made a few familiar contributions to the menu too the restaurant at yonge street was new but it wasnt entirely frenchnor was it as big a hit in the neighborhood as arnaud had hoped its not just the name but the name sucks too patrice told dominic and silvestro i have totally misread rosedale this neighborhood doesnt need an expensive french restaurant we need to be easygoing and cheaper we want our clientele to come two or three times a week not every couple of months over the christmas break patrice was normally closedthis year from december until january enough time for the renovations arnaud had planned the banquettes would be brightened completely recovered the lemonyellow walls were to be freshly spackled posters from the old french line would be hung le havre southampton new york compagnie générale transatlantique patrice had announced and hed found a couple of toulouselautrec posters of the moulin rouge dancer la goulue and singer jane avril fish and chips were going to be added to the menu and steak tartare with frites the prices for both food and wine would drop percent it would be back to bistro againlike those fabulous recession days at bastringuethough patrice wouldnt use the bistro word anymore bistro is so overusedit has become meaningless arnaud declared reinvention was the essential game with restaurants arnaud knew but what about the name silvestro had asked his boss the calabrese had his own candidate dominic knew i think patrice is too french patrice had answered its too oldschool too oldmoney it has to go arnaud was smart and suave his style was casual but debonair dominic loved and admired the man but the cook had been dreading this part of the changeoverall to accommodate the preening rosedale snobs you guys know what i think silvestro said with an insincere insouciant shrug he was handsome and confident the way you would want your son to be the young chef had been struck by the effect of the frosted glass on the lower half of the restaurants large front window facing yonge street passersby on the street could not see through the clouded glass the customers seated at their tables were not in view from the sidewalk but the top half of the big pane of glass was clear diners could see the red maple leaf on the canadian flag above the summerhill liquor store across yonge street and eventually those two highrise condominiums under construction in what would be called scrivener square the lower frosted portion of the windowpane had the effect of a curtainsuch was silvestros convoluted reasoning for the restaurants new name la tenda silvestro said with feeling the curtain it sounds ominous to me dominic had told the young chef i wouldnt want to eat in a place with that name i think silvestro you should save this name for the very first restaurant you ownwhen you become an ownerchef which you certainly will arnaud said la tenda silvestro repeated fondly his warm brown eyes watering with tears its too italian dominic baciagalupo told the emotional young man this restaurant may not be strictly french but its not italian either if the former patrice were given an italian name what would ketchum say the cook was thinking while at the same time he saw the absurdity of his argumenthe whose sicilian meat loaf and penne alla puttanesca would after the christmas holiday be added to the more lowkey menu the baffled patrice and the shocked silvestro stared at the cook in disbelief they were all at a standstill dominic thought i should ask daniel to come up with a namehes the writer that was when silvestro broke the silence what about your name dominic the young chef said not baciagalupo the cook cried alarmed if the cowboy didnt kill him dominic knew that ketchum would talk about too italian arnaud said affectionately i mean what your name means dominic silvestro said patrice arnaud hadnt guessed baciagalupos meaning though the words were similar in french kiss of the wolf silvestro said slowlythe emphasis equally placed on both the kiss and the wolf arnaud shuddered he was a short strongly built man with closely cropped gray hair and a sophisticated smilehe wore dark trousers sharply pressed and always an elegant but opennecked shirt he was a man who made ceremony seem natural at once polite and philosophical patrice was a restaurateur who understood what was worthwhile about the oldfashioned while knowing instantly when change was good ah wellkiss of the wolfwhy didnt you tell me dominic arnaud impishly asked his loyal friend now theres a name that is seductive and modern but it also has an edge oh kiss of the wolf had an edge all right the cook was thinkingthough that wouldnt be the most salient response ketchum might make to the restaurants new name dominic didnt want to imagine what the old logger would say when he heard about it mountains of moose shit ketchum might declare or something worse wasnt it risky enough that the cook had taken back his real name in an internet world what danger did it present that there was a dominic baciagalupo back in action at least ketchum was somewhat relieved to learn that at the height of her phonetic sensibilities nunzi had misspelled the baciacalupo word but realistically thinking how would it be possible for a retired deputy sheriff in coos county new hampshire to discover that a restaurant called kiss of the wolf in toronto ontario was the english translation of the phonetically madeup name of baciagalupo and dont forget the cook reassured himselfthe cowboy is as old as ketchum whos eightythree if im not safe now i never will be dominic was thinking as he came into the narrow bustling kitchen of patricesoon to be renamed kiss of the wolf well its a world of accidents isnt it in such a world more than the names would keep changing danny angel wished with all his heart that he had never given up the name daniel baciagalupo not because he wanted to be the more innocent boy and young man hed once beenor even because daniel baciagalupo was his one true name the only one his parents had given himbut because the fiftyeightyearold novelist believed it was a better name for a writer and the closer the novelist came to sixty the less he felt like a danny or an angel that his father had all along insisted on the daniel name made more and more sense to the son not that it was always easy for a stayathome workathome writer who was almost sixty to share a house with his seventysixyearold dad they could be a contentious couple given the disputed presidential election in the united statesthe florida fiasco as ketchum called george w bushs theft of the presidency from al gore the result of a supreme court vote along partisan linesthe faxes from ketchum were often incendiary gore had won the popular vote the republicans stole the election both danny and his dad believed but the cook and his son didnt necessarily share ketchums more extreme beliefsnamely that they were better off being canadians and that america which ketchum obdurately called an asshole country deserved its fate where are the assassins when you want one ketchum had faxed he didnt mean george w bush ketchum meant that someone should have killed ralph nader gore would have beaten bush in florida if nader hadnt played the spoiler role ketchum believed that ralph nader should be bound and gaggedpreferably in a childs defective car seatand sunk in the androscoggin during the second bushgore presidential debate bush criticized president clintons use of us troops in somalia and the balkans i dont think our troops ought to be used for whats called nationbuilding the future president said you want to wait and see how that lying little fucker will find a way to use our troops you want to bet that nationbuilding wont be part of it ketchum had faxed but danny didnt relish america s impending disgracenot from the canadian perspective particularly he and his dad had never wanted to leave their country to the extent it was possible for an internationally bestselling author to not make a big deal of changing his citizenship danny angel had tried to play down his politics though this had been harder to do after east of bangor was published in his abortion novel was certainly political the process of danny and his dad being admitted to canada as new citizens was a slow one danny had applied as selfemployed the immigration lawyer representing him had categorized the writer as someone who participates at a worldclass level in cultural activities danny made enough money to support himself and his father theyd both passed the medical exam while they were living in toronto on visitors visas it had been necessary for them to cross the border every six months to have their visas validated also theyd had to apply for canadian citizenship at a canadian consulate in the united states buffalo was the closest american city to toronto an assistant to the minister of immigration and citizenship had discouraged them from a socalled fasttrack application in their case what was the hurry the famous writer wasnt rushing to change countries was he the immigration lawyer had forewarned danny that canadians were a little suspicious of success they tended to punish it not reward it in fact to escape undue attention the cook and his son had made the slowest possible progress in their application for canadian citizenship the process had taken four almost five years but now with the florida fiasco thered been comments in the canadian media about the writer danny angels defection his giving up on the united states when he did more than a decade ago made the author appear prescientor so the toronto globe and mail had said it didnt help that the film adapted from east of bangor had released in theaters only recentlyin and the movie had won a couple of academy awards in early in the new year a joint session of congress would meet to certify the electoral vote in the states now that there was going to be a us president who opposed abortion rights it came as no surprise to danny and his dad that the writers liberal abortion politics were back in the news and writers were more in the news in canada than in the united states not only for what they wrote but for what they said and did danny was still sensitive to what he read about himself in the american media where he was frequently labeled antiamericanboth for his writing and because of his expatriation to toronto in other parts of the worldwithout fail in europe and in canada the authors alleged antiamericanism was viewed as a good thing it was written that the expatriate writer vilified life in the united states that is in his novels it had also been reported that the americanborn author had moved to toronto to make a statement despite danny angels commercial success he had accepted the fact that his canadian taxes were higher than what hed paid in the states but as a novelist danny was increasingly uncomfortable when he was condemned or praised for his perceived antiamerican politics naturally he couldnt saymost of all not to the presswhy he had really moved to canada what danny did say was that only two of his seven published novels could fairly be described as political he was aware that he sounded defensive in saying this but it was notably true dannys fourth book the kennedy fathers was a vietnam novelit was read as a virtual protest of that war the sixth east of bangor was a didactic novelin the view of some critics an abortionrights polemic but what was political about the other five books dysfunctional families damaging sexual experiences various losses of innocence all leading to regret these stories were small domestic tragediesnone of them condemnations of society or government in danny angels novels the villainif there was onewas more often human nature than the united states danny had never been any kind of activist all writers are outsiders danny angel had once said i moved to toronto because i like being an outsider but no one believed him besides it was a better story that the worldfamous author had rejected the united states danny thought that his move to canada had been sensationalized in the press the presumed politics of their entirely personal decision magnified out of proportion yet what bothered the novelist more was that his novels had been trivialized danny angels fiction had been ransacked for every conceivably autobiographical scrap his novels had been dissected and overanalyzed for whatever could be construed as the virtual memoirs hidden inside them but what did danny expect in the media real life was more important than fiction those elements of a novel that were at least based on personal experience were of more interest to the general public than those pieces of the novelwriting process that were merely made up in any work of fiction werent those things that had really happened to the writeror perhaps to someone the writer had intimately knownmore authentic more verifiably true than anything that anyone could imagine this was a common belief even though a fiction writers job was imagining truly a whole storyas danny had subversively said whenever he was given the opportunity to defend the fiction in fiction writingbecause reallife stories were never whole never complete in the ways that novels could be yet who was the audience for danny angel or any other novelist defending the fiction in fiction writing students of creative writing women of a certain age in book clubs because werent most bookclub members usually women of a certain age who else was more interested in fiction than in socalled real life not danny angels interviewers evidently the first question they always asked had to do with what was real about this or that novel was the main character based on an actual person had the novels most memorable meaning most catastrophic most devastating outcome actually happened to anyone the author knew or had known once again what did danny expect hadnt he begged the question just look at his last book baby in the road what did danny think the media would make of it he had begun that book his seventh novel before hed left vermont danny was almost finished with the manuscript in march it was late march of that year when joe died in colorado it was not yet mud season shit it was almost mud season ketchum would say it was joes senior year in boulder he had just turned twentytwo the irony was that baby in the road had always been about the death of a beloved only child but in the novel danny had almost finished the child dies when hes still in diapersa twoyearold run over in the road much as what might have happened to little joe that day on iowa avenue the unfinished novel was about how the death of that child destroys what the cook and ketchum would no doubt have described as the danny character and the katie character who go their separate but doomed ways naturally the novel would change after the death of his son danny angel didnt write for more than a year it was not the writing that was hard as danny said to his friend armando desimone it was the imagining whenever danny tried to imagine anything all he could see was how joe had died what the writer also endlessly imagined were the small details that might have been subject to change those infinitesimal details that could have kept his son alive if joe had only done this not that if the cook and his son had not been in toronto at that time if danny had bought or rented a house in boulder instead of winter park if joe had not learned to ski if as ketchum had advised theyd never lived in vermont if an avalanche had closed the road over berthoud pass if joe had been too drunk to drive instead of being completely sober if the passenger had been another boy not that girl if danny hadnt been in love well was there anything a writer couldnt imagine what wouldnt danny have thought of if only to torture himself danny couldnt bring joe back to life he couldnt change what had happened to his son the way a fiction writer could revise a novel when after that year had passed danny angel could finally bear to reread what hed written in baby in the road the accidental killing of that twoyearold in diapers which once began the book not to mention the subsequent tormenting of the dead toddlers parents seemed almost inconsequential wasnt it worse to have a child escape death that first time and grow uponly to die later a young man in his prime and to make the story worse in that way in a novelto make what happens more heartbreaking in other wordswell wasnt that actually a better story doubtless danny believed so hed rewritten baby in the road from start to finish this had taken another five almost six years not surprisingly the theme of the novel didnt change how could it danny had discovered that the devastation of losing a child stayed very much the same it mattered little that the details were different baby in the road was first published in eleven years after the publication of east of bangor and eight years after joe had died in the revised version the former twoyearold grows up to be a risktaking young man he dies at joes age twentytwo when hes still a college student the death is ruled an accident though it might have been a suicide unlike joe the character in dannys seventh novel is drunk at the time of his death he has also swallowed a shitload of barbiturates he inhales a ham sandwich and chokes to death on his own vomit in truth by the time he was a senior in college joe seemed to have outgrown his recklessness his drinkingwhat little he did of itwas in control he skied fast but hed had no injuries he appeared to be a good driver for four years he drove a car in colorado and didnt get a single speeding ticket hed even slowed down with the girls a littleor so it had seemed to his grandfather and his dad of course the cook and his son had never stopped worrying about the boy throughout his college years however joe had honestly given them little cause to be concerned even his grades had been goodbetter than theyd been at northfield mount hermon like many kids whod gone away from home to an independent boarding school joe always claimed that college was easier as a novelist danny angel had taken pains to make the arguably suicidal character in baby in the road as unlike joe as possible the young man in the book is a sensitive artistic type hes in delicate healthfrom the beginning he seems fated to dieand hes no athlete the novel is set in vermont not in colorado revised the boys wayward mother isnt wayward enough to be a katie character although like her doomed son she has a drinking problem in the rewrite the danny character the boys grieving father doesnt give up drinking but hes not an alcoholic he is never compromised or incapacitated by what he drinks hes just depressed in the first few years after joe died the cook would occasionally try to talk his son out of drinking again youll feel better if you dont daniel in the long run youll wish you hadnt gone back to it its for research pop danny would tell his dad but that answer no longer appliednot after hed rewritten baby in the road and the book had been finished for more than five years in the new novel that danny was writing the main characters werent drinkers dannys drinking wasnt for researchnot that it ever was but the cook could see that danny didnt drink to excess he had a couple of beers before dinnerhed always liked the taste of beerand not more than a glass or two of red wine with his meal without the wine he didnt sleep it was clear that dominics beloved daniel hadnt gone back to being the kind of drinker he used to be dominic could also see for himself that his sons sadness had endured after joes death ketchum observed that dannys sadness had a look of permanence about it even interviewers or anyone meeting the author for the first time noticed it not surprisingly in many of the interviews danny had done for various publications of baby in the road the questions about the novels main subjectthe death of a childhad been personal in every novel there are parts that hit uncomfortably close to home for the novelist obviously these are areas of emotional history that the writer would prefer not to talk about wasnt it enough that danny had made every effort to detach himself from the personal hed enhanced hed exaggerated hed stretched the story to the limits of believabilityhed made the most awful things happen to characters he had imagined as completely as possible socalled real people are never as complete as wholly imagined characters the novelist had repeatedly said yet danny angels interviewers had asked him almost nothing about the story and the characters in baby in the road instead theyd asked danny how he was dealing with the death of his son had the writers reallife tragedy made him reconsider the importance of fictionmeaning the weight the gravity the relative value of the merely makebelieve that kind of question drove danny angel crazy but he expected too much from journalists most of them lacked the imagination to believe that anything credible in a novel had been wholly imagined and those former journalists who later turned to writing fiction subscribed to that tiresome hemingway dictum of writing about what you know what bullshit was this novels should be about the people you know how many boring but deadeningly realistic novels can be attributed to this lame and utterly uninspired advice but couldnt it be argued that danny should have anticipated the personal nature of his interviewers questions concerning baby in the road even nonreaders had heard about the accident that killed the famous writers son to ketchums relief the cowboy seemed to have missed it thered also been the predictable pieces about the calamitous lives of celebrities childrenunfair in joes case because the accident didnt appear to have been joes fault and he hadnt been drinking yet danny should have anticipated this too before there was verification that alcohol wasnt a factor there would be those in the media who too quickly assumed it had been at first after the accidentand again when baby in the road was publisheddominic had done his best to shield his son from his fan mail danny had let his dad be a first reader understanding that the cook would decide which letters he should or shouldnt see that was how the letter from lady sky was lost you have some weird readers the cook had complained one day and so many of your fans address you by your first name as if they were your friends it would unnerve mehow you have all these people you dont know presuming that they know you give me an example pop danny said well i dont know dominic said i throw out more mail than i show you you know there was one letter last weekshe might have been a stripper for all i know she had a strippers name like what danny had asked his dad lady sky the cook had said sounds like a stripper to me i think her real name is amy danny said he tried to remain calm you know her i know only one lady sky im sorry danieli just assumed she was a wacko what did she say popdo you remember naturally the cook couldnt remember all the detailsjust that the woman seemed presumptuous and deranged shed written some gibberish about protecting joe from pigs shed said she was no longer flying as if shed once been able to fly did she want me to write her back danny asked his dad do you remember where her letter was from well im sure there was a return addressthey all want you to write them back the cook cried its okay popim not blaming you danny said maybe shell write again he didnt really think so and his heart was aching i had no idea you wanted to hear from someone named lady sky daniel the cook said something must have happened to amy danny wondered what it could have been you dont jump naked out of airplanes for no reason the writer thought i was sure she was a crazy person daniel with that the cook paused she said she had lost a child too dominic told his son i thought i would spare you those letters there were quite a lot of them maybe you should show me those letters dad danny said after the discovery that lady sky had written to him danny received a few more letters from his fans whod lost children but hed been unable to answer a single one of those letters there were no words to say to those people danny knew since he was one of them he would wonder how amy had managed it in his new life without joe danny didnt think it would be all that hard to jump naked out of an airplane in danny angels writing room on the third floor of the house on cluny drive there was a skylight in addition to the window with the view of the clock tower on the summerhill liquor store this had once been joes bedroom and it occupied the entire third floor and had its own bathroom with a shower but not a tub the shower was adequate for a college kid like joe but the cook had questioned the extravagant size of the bedroomnot to mention the premier view wasnt this wasted on a young man attending school in the states joe would never get to spend much time in toronto but danny had argued that he wanted joe to have the best bedroom because maybe then his son would be more inclined to come to canada the rooms isolation on the third floor also made it the most private bedroom in the house andfor safetys sakeno thirdfloor bedroom should be without a fire escape so danny had built one the room therefore had a private entrance when joe died and danny converted the boys bedroom into a writing room the novelist left his sons things as they were only the bed had been removed joes clothes stayed in the closet and in the chest of drawerseven his shoes remained all the laces were untied too joe had not once taken off a pair of shoes by untying the laces first hed kicked off his shoes with the laces tied and they were always tightly tied with a double knot as if joe were still a little boy whose shoes often came untied danny had long been in the habit of finding his sons doubleknotted shoes and untying the laces for him it was a few months or more after joe died before danny had untied the last of joes shoelaces what with joes wrestling and skiing photographs on the walls the socalled writing room was a virtual shrine to the dead boy in the cooks mind it was masochistic of his son to choose to write there but a limp like dominics would keep him from investigating that thirdfloor writing room with any regularity dominic rarely ventured there even when daniel was away with the bed gone no one else would sleep thereapparently that was what danny wanted when joe had been with them in toronto both the cook and his son could hear the boys kickedoff shoes drop like two rocks above themor the more subtle creaking of the floorboards whenever joe was walking around even barefoot or in his socks you could also hear that thirdfloor shower from the three bedrooms on the second floor each of the secondfloor bedrooms had its own bath with the cooks bedroom being at the opposite end of the long hall from his beloved daniels bedroomhence father and son had some measure of privacy because the guest room was between them that guest room and its bathroom had recently been spruced upin readiness for ketchums expected arrival the woodsmans nowannual christmas visitand because the bedroom door was open both danny and his dad couldnt help but notice that the cleaning woman had prominently placed a vase of fresh flowers atop the guest rooms dresser the bouquet was reflected in the dressers mirror making it appear from the secondfloor hall as two vases of flowers not that ketchum would have noticed or acknowledged a dozen vases of flowers in his room the writer thought danny guessed that the cleaning woman probably had a crush on ketchum though the cook claimed that lupita must have pitied the logger for how old he was the flowers were in anticipation of how near death ketchum was dominic absurdly saidthe way people put flowers on a grave you dont really believe that danny told his dad but the flowers and lupita were a mystery the mexican cleaning woman never put a vase of flowers in the guest room for any other visitor to the rosedale residence and that guest room in the house on cluny drive was more than occasionally occupiednot only at christmas salman rushdie the author with a death threat against him sometimes stayed there when he was in toronto danny angels other writer friends both from europe and the united states often came to visit armando and mary desimone were visitors to the city at least twice a year and they always stayed with danny and his dad many of dannys foreign publishers had slept in that guest room which reflected the authors international reputation the majority of the books in the room were translations of danny angels novels hanging in that guest bedroom too was a framed poster of the french edition of baby in the roadbébé dans la rue in the connecting bathroom there was an oversize poster of the german translation of that same novelbaby auf der strasse yet in the mind of the mexican cleaning woman only ketchum merited flowers lupita was a wounded soul and she certainly recognized the damage done to others she could not clean dannys thirdfloor writing room without weeping though lupita had never met joe in those years when hed come to canada from colorado joe never stayed for long and danny and his dad had not yet met what the cook called the mexican marvel theyd had a host of unsatisfactory cleaning women in those years lupita was a relatively recent find but she was visibly moved by these two saddened gentlemen whod lost respectively a son and a grandson shed told the cook that she was worried about how danny was doing but to danny she would only say your boy is in heavenhigher up than the third floor señor angel ill take your word for it lupita danny had replied enfermo lupita was always inquiringnot of the seventysixyearold cook but of his depressed fiftyeightyearold son no i am not sick lupita danny never failed to answer her yo sólo soy un escritor i am merely a writeras if that explained how miserable he must have looked to her lupita had lost a child too she couldnt speak of it to danny but shed told the cook there were no details and there was scant mention of the childs father a canadian if lupita had ever had a husband shed also lost him danny didnt think there were many mexicans in toronto but probably more would be coming soon lupita seemed ageless with her smooth brown skin and long black hair though danny and his dad guessed that she was somewhere between their ages in her sixties and while she wasnt a big woman she was heavynoticeably overweight if not fat in a condemnatory way because lupita had a pretty face and she was in the habit of leaving her shoes on the ground floor of the house she crept about the upstairs barefoot or in her socks danny once said to his father that lupita reminded him of injun jane the cook couldnt agree that there was any resemblance dominic had sternly shaken his head at the suggestion either dannys dad was in denial regarding the obvious likeness lupita shared with jane or else dannys memory of the indian dishwasher was misleading himthe way fiction writers are often misled by their memories in the late afternoon when the cook was busy with the dinner prep at patrice danny often left his writing room on the third floorjust as the last of the sun if there was any to speak of was glimmering through the skylight there was no visible sun on this gray december afternoon which made it easier for the novelist to tear himself away from his desk whatever remaining light there was from the west barely managed to penetrate the secondfloor hall in his socks danny padded to his fathers bedroom when the cook was out his son often went into that room to see the snapshots dominic had pinned to the five bulletin boards hanging from the bedrooms walls there was an oldfashioned desk with drawers in his dads bedroom and danny knew there were hundreds more photographs in those drawers with lupitas help dominic constantly rearranged the snapshots on his bulletin boards the cook never threw a photo away but instead returned each removed picture to one of the desk drawers that way twiceused or thriceused photos became new againonce more displayed on the bulletin boards the only telltale signs of their previous use being the excessive number of almost invisible pinpricks on the bulletin boards the snapshots were intricately overlapped in a confusing but possibly thematic patterneither of dominics design or of lupitas because danny knew that without the mexican cleaning womans assistance his dad could not have managed to unpin and repin the photographs with such evident ardor and repetition it was hard work and because of where the bulletin boards were mounted on the walls it was necessary to perch on the arm of a couch or stand on a chair in order to reach the uppermost sectionsnot a labor that the cook with his limp could easily perform given what she weighed and her estimated age danny worried about lupita undertaking such a balancing act on a couch or a chair in spite of his considerable imagination danny angel couldnt fathom his fathers logic the overlapping snapshots defied either a historical or a visual interpretation in an ancient blackandwhite photograph a surprisingly younglooking ketchum appeared to be dancing with injun jane in what danny clearly remembered was the cookhouse kitchen in twisted river that this old photo was juxtaposed with one in color of danny with joe as a toddler in iowa was inexplicableexcept that danny recalled katie being in that photograph and the cook had cleverly overlapped her entirely with a photo of carmella with paul polcari standing in front of the pizza oven in vicino di napoli either tony molinari or old giusé polcari must have snapped the picture thus vermont overlapped boston or vice versa avellino and maos were apparently interchangeableand the asian faces of the cooks own iowa interlude appeared alongside more current torontonians the early days at maxims which gave way to bastringue on queen street west would be captured next to ketchum in one or another of his virtual wanigans of a pickup truck or beside joe as a college student in coloradooften on skis or in a mountainbike raceand there was even one of joes iowa city friend max who together with joe had come close to being killed in that alleyway behind the court street house by the speeding blue mustang the portrait of the two eightyearolds was bafflingly pinned next to one of the young culinary maestro silvestro being kissed on both cheeks by his female sous chefs joyce and kristine was it possible danny wondered that most of the photographs had been pinned to the bulletin boards not only by lupitas plump hands but according to her artless plan that would explain the seeming randomness of the arrangementsif the collages of snapshots had been almost entirely up to lupita if the cook had played next to no part in the overall design that might also explain the writer thought why no picture of ketchum was returned to the desk drawersnot since lupita had come to work for danny and his dad how had the eightythreeyearold logger managed to make such a romantic impression on the sixtysomething mexican cleaning woman danny was thinking the cook seemed to be nauseated by the very idea lupita couldnt have encountered ketchum more than two or three times it must be because of lupitas ardent catholicism dominic had exclaimed to his dads thinking danny knew there could only be superstitious or nonsensical reasons for any woman in her right mind to be attracted to ketchum now in his own bedroom danny changed into his workout clothes there were no photographs of joe in dannys bedroom danny angel had enough trouble sleeping without pictures of his dead son except in the eveningswhen he went out for dinner or to see a moviedanny rarely left the house on cluny drive and most evenings his dad was working dominics idea of semiretirement was that he usually left the restaurant and took himself home to bed by or every night even when patrice was packed that was retired enough for him when danny was on a book tour or otherwise out of town the cook went into his sons bedroomjust to remind himself of what might have been if joe hadnt died it grieved dominic baciagalupo that the only photographs in his beloved daniels bedroom were of the screenwriter charlotte turner who was fifteen years younger than his sonand boy did she look it charlotte was just twentyseven when shed met danielin when hed been fortytwo this was shortly after the cook and his son had come to canada east of bangor had just been published and joe was finishing his freshman year at colorado charlotte was only eight years older than joe and shed been a very younglooking twentyseven she was a younglooking fortythree now the cook reflected it pained dominic to see charlotte s pictures and to reflect on how fond he was of the young woman the cook believed that charlotte would have been the perfect wife for his lonely son but a deal is a deal charlotte had wanted childrenjust one child if thats all you can handle shed told dannyand danny had promised her that he would get her pregnant and give her a child there was only one condition well perhaps the condition word was wrongmaybe it was more of a request would charlotte wait to get pregnant until after joe had graduated from college at the time joe had three years to go at the university of colorado but charlotte agreed to wait she would only be thirty when joe got his undergraduate degree besides as the cook recalled she and daniel had loved each other very much theyd been very happy together those three years hadnt seemed like such a long time at twentyseven charlotte turner was fond of saying dramatically that she had lived in toronto her whole life more to the point shed never lived with anyonenor had she ever kept a boyfriend for longer than six months when she met danny she was living in her late grandmothers house in forest hill her parents wanted to sell the house but shed persuaded them to allow her to rent it the house had been a cluttered messy place when her grandmother lived there but charlotte had auctioned off the old furniture and shed turned the downstairs into her office and a small screening room upstairs where there was only one bathroom shed made a big bedroom out of three smaller practically useless rooms charlotte didnt cook and the house was unsuitable for entertaining shed left her grandmothers antiquated kitchen as it was because the kitchen was sufficient for her none of charlotte s shortterm boyfriends had ever spent the night in that housedanny would be the firstand charlotte never exactly moved in with danny in the house on cluny drive the cook had offered to move out he saw himself as a potential invasion of his sons privacy and dominic desperately wanted daniels relationship with charlotte to succeed but charlotte wouldnt hear of evicting dannys dad as she put itnot until after the wedding which was planned more than two years in advance for june following joes college graduation joe would be dannys best man at the time it had seemed wise to wait on the weddingand on charlotte getting pregnant and on having a new baby in the house danny had wanted to shepherd joe through the boys college yearsthat was the writers word for it but there were those in toronto who knew charlotte s history with men they might have bet that a wedding as much as two years in the offing was unlikely or that after leaving for one of her many trips to la the young screenwriter simply wouldnt come back in the short three years theyd been together charlotte had kept scarcely any clothes in dannys bedroom closet though she more often spent the night in that cluny drive house than danny would at her place in forest hill she did keep her share of toiletries in dannys bathroom and her considerable cosmetics both charlotte and danny were early risers and while charlotte was attending to her hair and her skinshe had the most beautiful skin the cook suddenly remembereddanny made them breakfast then charlotte would take the yonge street subway to st clair where she would walk to her place in forest hill she did a long days work there even after they were married charlotte always said she planned to have an office outside the house on cluny drive besides there isnt room here for all my clothes shed told danny even after your dad moves out ill need at least an officeif not an entire housefor my clothes the clothes could mislead you about charlotte dominic often recalledespecially when he saw pictures of her however like danny with his novels charlotte was a workaholic with her scriptsno less so in the case of her proposed adaptation of east of bangor which was the reason she and danny had met charlotte knew all about danny angels nonnegotiable rules regarding the sale of film rights to his novels shed seen the interviews where danny had said that someone would have to write a halfway decent adaptation before he would part with the movie rights to this or that book the tall twentysevenyearoldshe was a head taller than daniel the cook would remember which made charlotte closer in height and age to joe than she was to danny or his dadhad agreed to write the first draft of a screenplay of east of bangor on spec no money would change hands no film rights would pass if danny didnt like her script charlotte would simply be out of luck you must already see a way to make a movie out of this novel danny had said when they first met he didnt do lunch hed told her they met for dinner at bastringue wherein those daysdanny must have eaten three or four nights a week no i just want to do thisi have no idea how charlotte said she wore darkframed glasses and was very studiouslooking but there was nothing bookish about her body she was not only tall but had a voluptuous figure she must have outweighed daniel by a few pounds as the cook recalled she was a big girl to wear a pink dress danny had thought that first night and her lipstick was a matching pink but charlotte did a lot of business in la even in she looked more like los angeles than toronto danny had really liked the first draft of her screenplay of east of bangorhed liked it well enough to sell charlotte turner the movie rights to his novel for one dollar canadian which at the time was worth about seventyfive cents us theyd worked together on subsequent drafts of the script so danny had seen for himself how hard charlotte worked in those days dannys writing room was on the ground floor of the house on cluny drive where his gym was now he and charlotte had worked there and in her grandmothers house in forest hill it would take fifteen years to get the film made but the screenplay of east of bangor was pulled together in four months time by then charlotte turner and danny angel were already a couple in dannys bedroom which was as much a memorial to charlotte as the thirdfloor writing room was a shrine to joe the cook had often marveled at how well dusted and sparkling clean lupita maintained all the framed photographs of the successful screenwriter most of the photos had been taken during the three years daniel and charlotte were together many of these pictures were from their brief summer months on lake huron like some other toronto families charlottes parents owned an island in georgian bay charlottes grandfather was alleged to have won the island in a poker game but there were those who said hed traded a car for it since charlotte s father was terminally ill and her mother a doctor would soon be retiring charlotte stood to inherit the island which was in the area of pointe au baril station daniel had loved that island the cook would remember dominic had visited georgian bay only once hed hated it the only snapshots of charlotte that the cook continued to recycle on the bulletin boards in his bedroom were those of her with joe because daniel couldnt sleep with pictures of the dead boy in his bedroom the cook admired how charlotte had been unjealously fond of joe and joe could see for himself how happy his father was with her joe had liked charlotte from the start charlotte wasnt a skier yet she tolerated those winter weekends and the christmas holiday in winter park where the cook had made fabulous dinners in the ski house at the base of the mountain the restaurants in winter park werent bad or they were good enough for joe and his college friends but they were beneath the cooks standards and dominic baciagalupo relished the opportunity to cook for his grandson the boy didnt come to canada often enough not in dominics opinion not in the writer danny angels opinion either now what light had lingered in the late december afternoon was entirely gone both the darkness and the contrasting lights of the city were visible in the windows as danny stretched out on the mat in his gym because it had been his writing room before it became his gymand danny wrote only in the daylight hours since hed gotten olderthere were no curtains on the windows in the winter months it was often dark by the time he worked out but danny didnt care if anyone in the neighborhood saw him using the aerobic machines or the free weights both when it was his office and since it had become his gym hed been photographed in that room hed been interviewed there too because he never allowed any journalists in his writing room on the third floor as soon as they were married charlotte had said she was going to put curtains or window shades in the gym but because the wedding was canceledwith all the rest of itthe windows in that room had remained as they were it was an odd gym because it was still surrounded by bookshelves even after hed moved his work to joes former bedroom on the third floor danny had left many of his books in that groundfloor room when danny and his dad had dinner parties in that house on cluny drive everyone put their coats in the gym they draped them on the handrails of the treadmill or over the stairmaster machine or on the stationary bike and they piled them on the weight bench too moreover there were always a couple of clipboards in that room and a ream of blank typing paper with lots of pens sometimes danny made notes to himself when he rode the stationary bike in the late afternoon or when he walked on the treadmill his knees were shot from all the running but he could still walk pretty fast on the treadmill and riding the stationary bike or using the stairmaster didnt bother his knees for a fiftyeightyearold man danny was in halfway decent physical shape he was still fairly slight of build though he had put on a few pounds since hed starting drinking beer and red wine againeven in moderation if injun jane had been alive she would have told danny that for someone who weighed as little as he did even a couple of beers and one or two glasses of red wine were too much well the injun was harsh on the firewater subject ketchum had always said he was not a man who put much stock in moderation even at eightythree there was no telling when ketchum would come for christmas danny was thinking as he settled into a comfortable pace on the stairmaster for christmas ketchum just showed up for someone who fanatically faxed danny or his dad a dozen times a week and who still spontaneously phoned at all hours of the day and night ketchum was extremely secretive about his road tripsnot only his trips to toronto for christmas but his hunting trips elsewhere in canada the hunting tripsnot to quebec but the ones up north in ontario occasionally brought ketchum to toronto too ketchum started his hunting in september the beginning of bear season in coos county the old woodsman claimed that the black bear population in new hampshire was well over five thousand animals and the annual bear harvest was only about five or six hundred critters most of the bears were killed in the north and central regions of the state and in the white mountains ketchums bear hound that aforementioned fine animalby now the grandson or greatgrandson of that first fine animal one would guesswas allowed to hunt with him from the second week of september till the end of october the dog was a crossbreed what ketchum called a walker bluetick he was tall and rangy like a walker foxhound but with the blueticks white coatblotched and flecked with bluish grayand with the blueticks superior quickness ketchum got his walker blueticks from a kennel in tennessee he always chose a male and named him hero the dog never barked but he growled in his sleepketchum claimed that the dog didnt sleepand hero let loose a mournful baying whenever he was chasing a bear in new hampshire the end of the bear season overlapped with the muzzleloader season for deera short time only from the end of october through the first week of november the regular firearm season for deer ran the rest of the month of november into early december but as soon as ketchum killed a deer in coos county he always dropped one with his muzzle loader he headed up north to canada the regular firearm season for deer ended earlier there the old logger had never been able to interest the cook in deer hunting dominic didnt like guns or the taste of venison and his limp was no fun in the woods but after danny and his dad moved to canada and danny met charlotte turner ketchum was invited to charlottes island in lake huron it was the first summer she and danny were a couple when the cook was also invited to georgian bay that was where and whenon turner island in august ketchum talked danny into trying deer hunting dominic baciagalupo despised the imposed rusticity of the summercottage life on those georgian bay islandsin charlotte s family still used an outhouse and while they had propane lights and a propane fridge they hauled what water they needed by the bucket method from the lake furthermore charlottes family seemed to have furnished the main cottage and two adjacent sleeping cabins with the castoff couches chipped dishes and mortally uncomfortable beds that theyd long ago replaced in their toronto home worse the cook surmised there was a tradition among the georgian bay islanders that upheld such stingy behavior anything newsuch as electricity hot water or a flush toiletwas somehow contemptible but what they ate was what the cook most deplored the mainland provisions at pointe au baril stationin particular the produce and anything that passed for freshwere rudimentary and everyone burned the shit out of what they blackened beyond recognition on their outdoor barbecues in his first and only visit to turner island dominic was polite and he helped out in the kitchento the degree this was tolerablebut the cook returned to toronto at the end of a long weekend relieved by the knowledge that he would never again test his limp on those unwelcoming rocks or otherwise set foot on a dock at pointe au baril station theres too much of twisted river hereits not cookies kind of place ketchum had explained to charlotte and danny after dominic went back to the city while the logger said this in forgiveness of his old friend danny was not entirely different from his dad in his initial reaction to island life the difference was that danny and charlotte had talked about the changes they would make on the islandcertainly after if not before her father passed away and her mother was no longer able to safely get into or out of a boat or climb up those jagged rocks from the dock to the main cottage danny still wrote on an oldfashioned typewriter he owned a halfdozen ibm selectrics which were in constant need of repair he wanted electricity for his typewriters charlotte wanted hot watershed long dreamed of such luxuries as an outdoor shower and an oversize bathtubnot to mention several flush toilets a little electric heat would be nice too both danny and charlotte had agreed because it could get cold at night even in the summerthey were that far northand after all they would soon be having a baby danny also wanted to construct a writing shack as he called ithe was no doubt remembering the former farmhouse shed hed written in in vermontand charlotte wanted to erect an enormous screenedin verandah something large enough to link the main cottage to the two sleeping cabins so that no one would ever have to go out in the rain or venture into the mosquitoes which were constant after nightfall danny and charlotte had plans for the place in other wordsthe way couples in love do charlotte had cherished her summers on the island since shed been a little girl perhaps what danny had adored were the possibilities of the place the life with charlotte hed imagined there oh plans plans planshow we make plans into the future as if the future will most certainly be there in fact the couple in love wouldnt wait for charlotte s father to die or for her mother to be physically incapable of handling the hardships of an island in lake huron over the next two years danny and charlotte would put in the electricity the flush toilets and the hot watereven charlotte s outdoor shower and her oversize bathtub not to mention the enormous screenedin verandah and there were a few other improvements that ketchum suggested the old woodsman had actually used the improvements word on his very first visit to georgian bay and turner island in the summer of ketchum had been a spry sixtysevenyoung enough to still have a few plans of his own that summer ketchum had brought the dog the fine animal was as alert as a squirrel from the second he put his paws on the islands main dock there must be a bear around herehero knows bears ketchum said there was a stiffstanding ridge of fur formerly loose skin at the back of the hounds tensed neck the dog stayed as close to ketchum as the woodsmans shadow hero wasnt a dog you were inclined to pat ketchum wasnt a summer person he didnt fish or screw around with boats the veteran river driver was no swimmer what ketchum saw in georgian bay and on turner island was what the place must be like in the late fall and the long winter and when the ice broke up in the spring lots of deer around here ill bet the old logger remarked he was still standing on the dock only moments after hed arrived and before he picked up his gear he appeared to be sniffing the air for bear like his dog injun country ketchum said approvingly well at least it wasbefore those damn missionaries tried to christianize the fucking woods as a boy hed seen the old blackandwhite photographs of a pulpwood boom afloat in gore bay manitoulin island the lumber business around georgian bay would have been at its height about but ketchum had heard the history and hed memorized the yearly cycles of logging in the autumn months you cut your trees you built your roads and you readied your streams for the spring drivesall before the first snowfall in the winter you kept cutting trees and you hauled or sledded your logs over the snow to the edge of the water in the spring you floated your logs down the streams and the rivers into the bay but by the nineties all your forests went rafting down to the statesisnt that right ketchum asked charlotte she was surprised by the question she didnt know but ketchum did it was like logging everywhere after all the great forests had been cut down the mills had burned down or theyd been torn down the mills perished out of sheer neglect as ketchum liked to put it maybe that bears on a nearby island ketchum said looking all around heros not agitated enough for there to be a bear on this island to danny and charlotte the lean hound looked agitated enough for there to be a bear on the dock it turned out that there was a bear on barclay island that summer the water between the two islands was a short swim for a bearboth danny and ketchum discovered they could wade therebut the bear never showed up on turner island perhaps because the bear had smelled ketchums dog burn the grease off the grill on the barbecue after youve used it ketchum advised them dont put the garbage out and keep the fruit in the fridge i would leave hero with you but i need him to look after me there was an uninhabited log cabin the first building to be assembled on turner island near the back dock charlotte gave ketchum a tour of it the screens were a little torn and a pair of bunk beds had first been separated and then nailed together side by side where they were covered with a kingsize mattress that overhung the bed frames the blanket on the bed was motheaten and the mattress was mildewed no one had stayed there since charlotte s grandfather stopped coming to the island it had been his cabin charlotte said and after the old man died no other member of the turner family went near the rundown building which charlotte said was haunted or so shed believed as a girl she pulled aside a wellworn dirty rug she wanted to show ketchum the hidden trapdoor in the floor the cabin was set on cement posts not much taller than cinder blocksthere was no foundationand under the trapdoor was nothing but bare ground about three feet below the floor with the pine trees all around pine needles had blown under the cabin which gave the ground a deceptively soft and comfortable appearance we dont know what granddaddy used the trapdoor for charlotte explained to ketchum but because he was a gambling man we suspect he hid his money here hero was sniffing the hole in the floor when ketchum asked was your granddaddy a hunting man charlotte oh yes charlotte cried when he died we finally threw away his guns ketchum winced well this heres a meat locker ketchum told her your granddaddy came up here in the winter i would bet yes he did charlotte said impressed probably after deer season when the bay was frozen ketchum considered im guessing that when he shot a deerand your mounties would have known when someone was shooting given how quiet it would be here in the winter with all the snowand when the mounties came and asked him what he was shooting i expect your granddaddy told them some story like he was shooting over a red squirrels head because the squirrels chattering was driving him crazy or that a herd of deer had been feeding on his favorite cedars and he shot over their heads so they would go eat all the cedars on someone elses islandwhen the whole time he was talking the deer which granddaddy would have gutted over this hole so there wouldnt be any blood in the snow and where he was keeping the meat cold well do you see what im getting at charlotte ketchum asked her this here hole is a poachers meat locker i told youtheres lots of deer around here ill bet ketchum and hero had stayed in that rundown log cabin haunted or not hell most places ive lived are haunted ketchum had remarked the newer sleeping cabins were not to the old woodsmans liking as for the torn screens in granddaddys cabin ketchum said if you dont get bitten by a mosquito or two you can hardly tell youre in the woods and there was more loon activity in that back bay because there were fewer boats ketchum had figured that out on the first day too he liked the sound of loons besides hero farts something awfulyou wouldnt want him stinking up your sleeping cabins charlotte at the end of the day charlotte wasnt shocked by the idea that her granddaddy had been a poacher hed died destitute and alcoholic gambling debts and whiskey had done him in now at least the trapdoor in the floor had been given a reason for its existence and this rather quickly led ketchum to his suggested improvements it never occurred to the old river driver that charlotte had not once been interested in living on her beloved island in the frigid winter months when the prevailing wind had permanently bent the treeswhen the bay was frozen and piled high with snow and there wasnt a human soul around except the occasional ice fisherman and those madmen who rode their snowmobiles over the lake it wouldnt take a whole lot to winterize the main cottage ketchum began when you put in your flush toilets you just want to be sure you install two septic systemsthe main one and a smaller one that nobody has to know about forget about using the sleeping cabins it would be too expensive to heat them just stick to the main cottage a little electric heat will be enough to keep the toilet and the sinkand the big bathtub you want charlotte from freezing you just have to heatwrap the pipes to the small septic tank that way you can flush the toilet and drain the dishwater out of the sinkand empty the bathtub too you just cant pump water up from the lake or heat any waternot in a propane hotwater heater anyway youll have to cut a hole in the ice and bring your water up by bucket you heat the water on the gas stove for your baths and for washing the dishes you would sleep in the main cottage of courseand most of your heat would come from the woodstove youll need a woodstove in your writing shack too dannybut thats all youll need the back bay nearest the mainland will freeze first you can haul in your groceries on a sled towed by a snowmobile and take your trash to town the same way hell you could ski or snowshoe here from the mainland ketchum said you just might be better off staying away from the main channel out of pointe au baril station i dont imagine that channel freezes over too safely but why would we want to come here in the winter danny asked the old woodsman charlotte just stared at ketchum uncomprehending well why dont we come up here this winter danny ketchum asked the writer ill show you why you might like it ketchum didnt mean winternot exactly he meant deer season which was in november the first deer season that danny met up with ketchum at pointe au baril station the ice hadnt thickened sufficiently for them to cross the back bay from the mainland to turner island not even snowshoes or crosscountry skis would have been safe and ketchums snowmobile surely would have sunk in addition to the snowmobile and a vast array of foulweather gear ketchum had brought the guns but hed left hero at homeactually hed left that fine animal with sixpack pam sixpack had dogs and hero tolerated her dogs ketchum said deer hunting was unsuitable for dogs ketchum also said it didnt matter that they couldnt get to charlotte s island that first year anyway the builder wouldnt be finished with all the improvements before the following summer ketchums clever winterizing would have to wait until then too the builder andy grant was what ketchum affectionately called a local fella in fact charlotte had grown up with himtheyd been childhood friends andy had not only renovated the main cottage for charlotte s parents a few years ago hed more recently restored the two sleeping cabins to charlotte s specifications andy grant told ketchum and danny where the deer were in the bayfield area and ketchum already knew a fella named lablanc who called himself a hunting guide lablanc showed ketchum and danny an area north of pointe au baril in the vicinity of byng inlet and still river but in ketchums case it didnt matter where he hunted the deer were all around at first danny was a little insulted by the weapon ketchum had selected for hima winchester ranger which was manufactured in new haven connecticut in the mideighties and then discontinued it was a gauge repeating shotgun with a slide actionwhat ketchum called a pump what initially insulted danny was that the shotgun was a youth model dont get your balls crossed about it ketchum told the writer its a fine gun for a beginner you better keep things simple when you start hunting ive seen some fellas blow their toes off for the sake of his toes danny guessed ketchum instructed the beginner to always have three rounds in the winchester one in the chamber and two more in the tubular magazine dont forget how many shots youre carrying ketchum said danny knew that the first two rounds were buckshot the third was a deer slug what ketchum called the killshot it made no sense to load more than three rounds no matter what the shotguns capacity was if you need a fourth or a fifth shot youve already missed ketchum told danny the deers long gone at night danny had trouble keeping ketchum out of the bar at larrys tavern which was also a motelsouth of pointe au baril station on route the motels walls were so thin they could hear whoever was humping in the room next door some asshole trucker and a hooker ketchum declared the first night i dont think there are any hookers in pointe au baril danny said its a onenight stand then ketchum replied they sure dont sound married another night there was a prolonged caterwauling of a certain female kind this one sounds different from the night before and the night before that ketchum said whoever the woman was she went on and on im coming im coming she kept repeating are you timing this danny it might be a record ketchum said but he walked naked into the hall and beat on the door of the longest orgasm in the world listen up fella the old river driver said shes obviously lying the young man who opened the door was menacing and in a mood to fight but the fightif you could call it thatwas over in a hurry ketchum put the guy in a choke hold before the fella had managed to throw more than a punch or two i wasnt lying the woman called from the dark room but by then not even the young man believed her it was not how danny had imagined he and ketchum would be camping out or otherwise roughing it while they were hunting deer as for the deer the first buck danny dropped in bayfield required all three roundsincluding the killshot well writers should know its sometimes hard work to die danny was all ketchum told him ketchum got his buck near byng inlet with one shot from his gauge the next deer season in ontario they shot two more bucksboth of them at still river and by then the socalled improvements on charlotte s island were complete including the winterizing ketchum and danny returned to pointe au baril station in early february when the ice on the bay nearest the mainland was two feet thick they followed the snowmobile portage from paynes road out of pointe au baril and went across the ice and drifting snow to the back dock and granddaddys cabin deer season was over but ketchum had brought his gauge just in case he told danny in case what danny asked him were not poaching deer ketchum in case theres some other critter ketchum replied later danny saw ketchum grilling a couple of venison steaks on the barbecue which andy had hooked up to the propane inside charlottes new screenedin verandah the verandah was boarded up in winter to keep out the snow because the outdoor summer furniture and two canoes were stored there unbeknownst to danny ketchum had also brought his bow danny forgot that ketchum was a bow hunter too and that the archery season for deer in new hampshire was three months long ketchum had had a lot of practice thats poaching danny told the logger the mounties didnt hear any shots did they ketchum asked its still poaching ketchum if you dont hear anything its more like nothing danny i know cookies not a fan of venison but i think it tastes pretty good this way danny didnt really like deer huntingnot the killing part anywaybut he enjoyed spending time with ketchum and that february of when they stayed for a few nights in the main cottage on turner island danny discovered that the winter on georgian bay was wonderful from his new writing shack danny could see a pine tree that had been shaped by the wind it was bent at almost a right angle to itself when new snow was falling and there were near whiteout conditionsso that where the rocks on shore ended and the frozen bay began were all oneit struck danny angel that the little tree had a simultaneously tenacious and precarious grip on its own survival danny sat transfixed in his writing shack looking at that windbent pine he was actually imagining what it might be like to live on the island in lake huron for a whole winter of course he knew that charlotte wouldnt have tolerated it for longer than one weekend ketchum had come into the writing shack hed been hauling water from the lake and had brought some pasta pots to a near boil on the gas stove hed come to inquire if danny wanted to take the first bath or the next one do you see that tree ketchum danny asked him pointing to the little pine i suppose you mean the one the wind has fucked over ketchum said yes thats the one danny answered what does it remind you of your dad ketchum told him without hesitation that trees got cookie written all over it but itll be fine dannylike your dad cookies going to be fine ketchum and danny went deer hunting around pointe au baril in november of their third and last deer season togetherand they went camping as they called it on turner island in late january of too at dannys insistence and to ketchums considerable consternation there was no more bow hunting out of season instead of his bow and the hunting arrows ketchum brought hero alongtogether with the justincase gauge which was never fired danny believed that the bear hounds reputation for farting was exaggerated that january ketchum again used the dog as an excuse to sleep in granddaddys log cabin which was unheated with all the winterizing the main cottage was a little too warm and too comfortable for the old woodsman who said he liked to see his breath at nightwhen he could see at all danny couldnt imagine what ketchum could see at night in granddaddys cabin because there was no electricity or propane lamps there the logger took a flashlight with him when he went off to bed but he carried it like a club danny never saw him turn it on ketchum had come to charlotte s island only one time in summer the same time when the cook had also come and gone charlotte never knew that ketchum had the gauge with him then but danny did hed heard ketchum shooting a rattlesnake down at the back dock charlotte had taken the boat into pointe au baril station she didnt hear the shot the rattlesnakes are protectedan endangered species i think danny told the river driver ketchum had already skinned the snake and cut off its rattles in the summer charlotte had her boat serviced at desmasdons the boat works where they drydocked boats in the winter now when danny watched ketchum skinning the snake he was reminded of a poster on the ice cream freezer at desmasdonsit displayed the various snakes of ontario the eastern massasauga rattler among them those rattlesnakes really were protected danny was trying to make ketchum understand but the woodsman cut him off heros smart enough not to get bitten by a fucking snake dannyi dont need to protect him ketchum started in but im not so sure about you and charlotte you walk all over this islandive seen youjust talking to each other and not looking where youre stepping people in love arent looking for rattlers theyre not listening for them either and you and charlotte are going to have a baby isnt that right its not the rattlesnakes that need protection danny with that ketchum cut off the snakes head with his browning knife he drained the venom from the fangs on a rock then he hurled the head off the back dock into the bay fish food he said im a regular environmentalist sometimes he tossed the snakeskin up on the roof of granddaddys cabin where the sun would dry it out he saidadding if the seagulls and the crows dont get it first the birds would get it and they made such a ruckus over the snakeskin early the next morning that ketchum was tempted to fire off his gauge again this time to drive the seagulls and the crows off the roof of the log cabin but he restrained himself knowing charlotte would hear the shot ketchum went outside and threw rocks at the birds instead he watched a gull fly off with the remains of the snakeskin nothing wasted as the logger later described the event to danny that day the mounties came by in their boat to inquire about the gunshot the day before had anyone heard it someone on barclay island said that they thought theyd heard a shot on turner island i heard it too ketchum spoke up getting the two young mounties attention ketchum even recalled the time of day with impressive accuracy but he said that the shooting definitely came from the mainland sounded like a twelvegauge to me the veteran woodsman said but gunfire can be both magnified and distorted over water the two mounties nodded at such a sage assessment the beautiful but unsuspecting charlotte nodded too then joe had died and danny lost what little taste he had for killing things and when danny lost charlotte he and ketchum gave up their deadofwinter trips to turner island in georgian bay there was something about pointe au baril station that stayed with danny though he didnt go there anymore in fact his parting from charlotte had been so civilizedshed even offered to share her summer island with him when they were no longer together maybe he could go there in july and she would go in august she said after all hed put his money into those improvements too charlotte s offer was sincere it wasnt only about the money yet it wasnt georgian bay in the summer that danny had adored hed loved being there with herhe would have loved being anywhere with charlotte but when she was gone whenever he thought about lake huron he thought mostly about that windbent pine in the wintertime how could he ask charlotte for permission to let him have a winter view of that little tree from his writing shackthe weatherbeaten pine he saw now only in his imagination and how could danny have had another child after losing joe hed known the day joe died that he would lose charlotte too because he sensed almost immediately that his heart couldnt bear losing another child he couldnt stand the anxiety or that terrible ending ever again charlotte knew it tooeven before he found the courage to tell her i wont hold you to your promise she told him even if it means that i might have to move on you should move on charlotte he told her i just cant shed married someone else soon after a nice guydanny had met him and liked him he was someone in the movie business a french director living in la he was much closer to charlotte s age too she already had one baby a little girl and now charlotte was expecting a second childone more than danny had promised her charlotte had kept her island in georgian bay but shed moved away from toronto and was living in los angeles now she came back to toronto every september for the film festival and that time of yearearly fallalways seemed to danny like a good time to leave town they still talked on the phonecharlotte was always the one who called danny never called herbut it was probably easier for both of them not to run into each other charlotte turner had been very pregnantshe was about to have her first childwhen she won the oscar for best adapted screenplay for east of bangor at the academy awards in march danny and his dad had watched charlotte accept the statuette patrice was always closed on sunday nights somehow seeing her on televisionfrom toronto when charlotte was in la well that wasnt the same as actually seeing her was it both the cook and danny wished her well it was just bad luck bad timing huh ketchum had said if joe had died three months later its likely danny would have already gotten charlotte pregnant it had been bad timing indeed joe and the girl had taken some of the same courses in bouldershe was a senior at the university tooand their trip to winter park together might have been a belated birthday present that joe decided to give himself according to their mutual friends joe and the girl had been sleeping together for only a short time it was the girls first trip alone with joe to the ski house in winter park though both danny and his dad remembered her staying at the house for a couple of nights over the last christmas holiday when a bunch of joes college friendsgirls and boys with no discernible relationship with one another at least that the cook and his son could seewere also camping out at that winter park house it was a big house after all andas charlotte had said because she was closer in age to joe and his pals than danny and dominic wereit was impossible to tell who was sleeping with whom there were so many of them and they seemed to be lifelong friends that last colorado christmas the kids had taken the mattresses from all the guest bedrooms and theyd piled them in the living room where both the boys and the girls had cuddled together and slept in front of the fire yet even with such a mob of them and amid all the taking turns in the showersit had surprised danny and his dad that some of the girls took showers togetherit was the cook and his son whod noticed something special about that girl charlotte hadnt seen it it was for just the briefest moment and maybe it meant nothing but after joe died with the girl the writer and the cook couldnt forget it she was pretty and petite almost elfin and naturally joe had made a point of telling his father and grandfather that hed first met meg in a lifedrawing class where shed been the model one look at the girl doesnt sufficeit isnt nearly enough the cook would tell ketchum shortly after that christmas it wasnt just because she was an exhibitionist though meg clearly was that as had been the case with katie danny had seen for himself the first time you simply had to look at meg and it was almost painful not to keep looking once you saw her it was hard to look away what a distraction that girl is danny said to his dad shes trouble the cook replied the two older men were making their way along the upstairs hall of that winter park house the wing where the guest bedrooms were was a curious lshaped addition off that hallso architecturally strange that you couldnt pass the junction without at least glancing at the guestwing hallway and that was why danny and dominic noticed the slight commotion then again their heads might have turned in that direction at the piercing shrieks of the young girls laughternot an everyday occurrence in the lives of the cook and his son meg and another girl were emerging from one of the guest bedrooms both of them wrapped in towels their hair was wetthey must have come directly from a showerand they ran awkwardly in their tightly wrapped towels to the door of a different guest bedroom the other girl disappearing into the room before meg who was left alone in the guestwing hallway just as joe came around the corner of the l it all happened so suddenly that joe never saw his father or grandfather and neither did meg she saw only joe and he clearly saw her and before she slipped inside the guest room and closed the doorto more shrieks of laughter from within the roommeg had opened her towel to joe she shook her little titties at him as the cook would later describe the episode to ketchum a distraction indeed was all danny had said at the time it was what charlotte would have called a throwaway linea reference to any extraneous dialogue in a screenplaybut after the accident that killed joe and meg the distraction word lingered why hadnt they been wearing their seat belts for example had the girl been giving him a blow job probably she had joes fly was open and his penis was poking out of his pants when the body was discovered hed been thrown from the car and died immediately meg wasnt so lucky the girl was found alive but with her head and neck at an unnatural angle she was wedged between the brake and the accelerator pedal shed died in the ambulance before reaching the hospital what had led joe and meg to cut two days of classes in boulder and make the drive to winter park at first seemed pretty obvious yet two days of new nonstop snow wasnt the prevailing reason besides it had been a typical latemarch snow wet and heavythe skiing must have been slow the visibility on the mountain treacherous and from the look of the ski house in winter park that is before the cleaning lady rushed in and made some attempt to restore orderjoe and the girl had spent most of their time indoors it didnt appear that theyd done much skiing perhaps it had no more significance than most youthful experiments but the young couple seemed to have made a game out of sleeping in every bed in the house naturally there would remain some unanswerable questions if they werent in winter park to ski why had they waited until the evening of the second day to drive back to boulder joe knew that after midnight and before dawn the ski patrol was in the habit of closing us over berthoud pass whenever there was any avalanche danger with such a heavy wet snow and because it was the avalanche time of year possibly joe hadnt wanted to risk leaving before light the next morning when they might still be blasting avalanches above berthoud pass of course the two lovers could have waited until daylight of the following morning but maybe joe and meg had thought that missing two days of classes was enough it was snowing heavily in winter park when they left but there was next to no ski traffic on us in the direction of i and that highway was well traveled well it was a weekday night for most schools and colleges that had a march break the vacation was over joe and meg must have passed the snowplow at the top of berthoud pass the plowman remembered joes car though hed noticed only the driver apparently the plowman hadnt seen the passenger perhaps the blow job was already in progress but joe had waved to the plowman and the plowman recalled waving back only seconds later the plowman spotted the other carit was coming in the other direction from i and the plowman presumed it was a goddamn denver driver this was because the driver was going much too fast for the nearblizzard conditions in the plowmans estimation joe had been driving safelyor at least slowly enough given the storm and the slickness of the wet snow on the highway whereas the denver carif indeed the driver was from denver was fishtailing out of control as the car came over the pass the plowman had flashed his lights but the other car never slowed down it was just a blue blur the plowman said in his deposition to the police what kind of blue he was asked with all the snow im not really sure about the color the plowman admitted but danny would always imagine the other car as an unusual shade of bluea customized job as max had called it anyway that mystery car just disappeared the plowman never saw the driver the snowplow then made its way downhill over the passin the direction of iand that was when the plowman came upon the wreck on us joes upsidedown car thered been no other traffic over the pass or the plowman would have seen it so the plowmans interpretation of the skid marks in the snow was probably correct the other carits tires spinning its rear end drifting sidewayshad skidded from the uphill lane into the downhill lane where joe was driving from the tracks in the snow the plowman could see that joe had been forced to change lanesto avoid the headon collision but the two cars had never made contact theyd traded lanes without touching on a wet snowy road the plowman knew a car coming uphill can recover from a skidjust take your foot off the gas and the car slows down and stops skidding in joes case of course his car just kept going he hit the huge snowbank that had buried the guardrail on the steep side of us where the drivers coming up berthoud pass dont like to look down its a long way down at that section of the road but the softlooking snowbank was densely packed and frozen hard the snowbank bounced joes car back into the uphill lane of us where the car tipped over from those skid marks the plowman could tell that joes car had slid on its roof down the steepest part of the highway both the driversside door and the door on the passenger side had sprung open how had one of danny angels interviewers asked the question wouldnt you say mr angelregarding how slowly your son was driving and the fact that he didnt hit the other carthat in all likelihood it was an accident your son and the girl would have survived if theyd been wearing their seat belts in all likelihood danny had repeated the police said it was impossible to imagine that the driver of the other car hadnt been aware of joe and megs predicament even with all the fishtailing the socalled denver driver must have seen what had happened to joes car but he didnt stop whoever he or she was if anything according to the plowman the other car had sped upas if to get away from the accident danny and his dad rarely talked about the accident itself but of course the cook knew what his writer son thought to anyone with an imagination to lose a child is attended by a special curse dominic understood that his beloved daniel lost his beloved joe over and over againmaybe in a different way each time danny would also wonder if the other car ever had a driver for surely it was the blue mustang that rogue car had been looking for joe all these years at the time of the accident on berthoud pass it had been almost fourteen years since that near accident in the alleyway in back of the court street house in iowa city when maxwhod seen the blue mustang more than onceand the eightyearold joe himself had sworn there was no driver it was a driverless blue mustang and it had a mission just as danny in his minds eye had once imagined his slain twoyearold in diapers on iowa avenue so had the plowman from winter park found joes actual bodydead in the road chapter kisses of wolves at on a saturday eveningit was december the last night before the restaurant closed for the christmas holidaypatrice was chockfull arnaud was jubilant greeting everyone at each table as if they were family the owners excitement was infectious all the diners were informed of the upcoming changes ahead for the restaurant a more casual atmosphere and menu awaited them in the new year lower prices too arnaud told themshaking hands bussing cheeks when the restaurant reopened even the name would be different no more patrice arnaud announced gliding from table to table the new name is one you wont easily forget it has i think a certain edge the new restaurant is called edge ketchum asked the frenchman suspiciously the old logger was increasingly hard of hearingespecially in his right ear and arnaud was speaking at the woodsmans right side there was a noisy crowd that night and the place was crammed too much gunfire danny angel was thinking ketchum had what he called shooters ear but the writer knew that ketchum was chainsawdeaf in both ears it probably wouldnt have mattered which ear patrice was addressing no nothe name isnt edge its kiss of the wolf arnaud cried loudly enough for the new name to register with ketchum danny and the logger had a window table for two overlooking what they could see of yonge street above the frosted glass when the restaurateur had glided on to the next table ketchum gave danny a penetrating stare i heard what the frenchie said the old river driver began kiss of the fucking wolf shitthat sounds like a name only a writer would have thought up it wasnt me danny told him it was silvestros idea and patrice liked it dad didnt have anything to do with it either mountains of moose shit ketchum said matteroffactly its as if you fellas are trying to get caught were not going to get caught because of the restaurants name danny told the logger dont be ridiculous ketchum the cowboy cant find us that way carl is still looking for youthats all im saying danny i dont know why you want to help the cowboy find you danny didnt say anything he believed it was crazy to think that carl could ever connect kiss of the wolf to the baciagalupo name the retired deputy sheriff didnt speak italian ive seen wolves ive come upon their kill too the old woodsman said to danny ill tell you what a kiss of the wolf looks like a wolf rips your throat out if theres a pack going after you or some other critter they get you turning to face them every which way but theres always one whos getting ready to rip your throat outthats what theyre looking for the throatshot kisses of wolves arent so pretty what do you feel like eating danny asked just to change the subject im fairly torn about it ketchum said he wore reading glassesof all thingsbut they failed to lend him a scholarly appearance the scar from the eightinch castiron skillet was too pronounced his beard too bushy the plaid shirt and fleece vest had too much of twisted river about them to give ketchum even a vestige of city lifenot to mention fine dining i was considering the frenchstyle grilled lamb chops or the calfs liver with yukon frites the woodsman said what the fuck are yukon frites he asked danny big potatoes danny answered theyre yukon gold potatoes cut on the large side the côte de boeuf kind of caught my attention too the logger said the côte de boeuf is for two danny told him thats why i noticed it ketchum said he had been drinking steam whistle on tap but hed switched to alexander keith by the bottle the ale had a little more to it constipated christ ketchum suddenly exclaimed theres a wine that costs a hundred and sixtyeight dollars danny saw that it was a barolo massolino from piedmont lets have it the writer said just so long as youre paying ketchum told him out in the kitchen it was bedlam as usual the cook was helping scott with the profiteroles which were served with caramel ice cream and a bittersweetchocolate sauce dominic was preparing the croutons and the rouille for joyce and kristines fish soup as well it had been the cooks task earlier to make the tagliatelle for the veal scallopini and tonight the pasta would also be served with silvestros duck confit but dominic had made the tagliatelle long before the restaurant and the kitchen got busy hed started a redwine reduction with rosemary too it was noisier in the kitchen than usual that saturday night because dorotea the new dishwasher had a cast on her right wrist and thumb and she kept dropping the pans everyone was taking bets on what ketchum was going to order silvestro had suggested the special cassoulet but dominic said that no sane woodsman would willingly eat beansnot if there was another choice the cook predicted that ketchum would have the côte de boeuf for two joyce and kristine said that the old river driver would probably order both the lamb chops and the liver or hell split the côte de boeuf with daniel and have either the lamb chops or the liver too dominic speculated something about the feel of the warm handle on the skillet with the redwine reduction was distracting him but the cook couldnt locate the true source of his distraction lately hed noticed that his old memories were clearerhe meant more vividthan his more recent memories if that was actually possible for instance hed found himself remembering that rosie had said something to ketchum just before or just after theyd all gone out on the ice together but had ketchum first said give me your hand the cook thought so but he wasnt sure rosie had very distinctly said not that handthats the wrong hand shed quickly created a little distance between herself and ketchum but was this before or somehow during the damn dosidoing dominic did but didnt remember and that was because hed been drunker than rosie and ketchum anyway what was the wronghand business about the cook was wondering he didnt really want to ask ketchum about it besides dominic was thinking how much would the eightythreeyearold logger remember about that longago night after all ketchum was still drinking one of the younger waiters ventured a guess that the old riverman wouldnt order anything for dinner hed already had three steam whistles on tap and a couple of keiths the old logger couldnt possibly have room for dinner but the young waiter didnt know ketchum patrice popped into the kitchen oohlala dominic arnaud said what is your son celebrating danny ordered the barolo massolino im not worried the cook replied daniel can afford it and you can count on ketchum drinking most of the wine it was their last night in the kitchen before the long vacation everyone was working hard but they were all in a good mood for dominic however the unknown source of his distraction lingered he kept feeling the familiar handle of the warm skillet what is it he was wondering whats wrong in the cooks bedroom in the house on cluny drive the bulletin boards with those countless photographs all but eclipsed from view or consideration the eightinch castiron skillet yet that skillet had crossed state boundaries and more recently an international border that skillet surely belonged in the cooks bedroom though its oncelegendary powers of protection had probably passed as carmella once speculated from the actual to the symbolic the eightinch castiron skillet hung just inside the doorway to dominics bedroom where it went almost unnoticed why had the cook been thinking about it so insistentlyat least since ketchum had arrived in his usual unannounced fashion for christmas dominic wasnt aware that danny had lately been thinking about the old frying pan too there was a certain sameness about that skillet it was unchanged the damn pan just hung there in his fathers bedroom it was a constant reminder to the writer but a reminder of what okay it was the same skillet hed used to kill injun jane as such it had set danny and dominics flight in motion it was the same skillet dominic had used to whack a bearor so the myth began in fact it was the same eightinch castiron skillet dannys dad had used to clobber ketchumnot a bear but ketchum had been too tough to kill only ketchum can kill ketchum the cook had said danny and his dad had been thinking about that too even at eightythree only ketchum could kill ketchum the young waiter now came back into the kitchen the big man wants the côte de boeuf for two he announced in awe dominic managed a smile he would smile again when patrice popped into the kitchen a little later just to tell him that his son had ordered a second bottle of the barolo massolino not even a côte de boeuf for two and uncountable bottles of barolo could kill ketchum the cook knew only ketchum and ketchum alone could do it it was so hot in the kitchen that theyd opened the back door to the alleyjust a crackthough it was a very cold night and an uncommonly strong wind repeatedly blew the door wide open in the cold weather crowns lane the alleyway behind the restaurant was a hangout for homeless people the restaurants exhaust fan blew into the alley creating a warm spota goodsmelling one too an occasional homeless person appeared at the door to the kitchen hoping for a hot meal the cook could never remember whether joyce or kristine was the smoker but one of the young women chefs was once startled by a hungry homeless person when she was smoking a cigarette in the alley since then all of those working in the kitchen and the waitstaff were aware of the homeless people seeking warmth and a possible bite to eat in the near vicinity of the kitchen door this was also patrices delivery door though there were never any deliveries at night now dominic once more went to close the door which the bitter wind had again blown wide open and there was oneeyed pedropatrices most popular homeless person because pedro never failed to compliment the chef or chefs for whatever food he was given his real name was ramsay farnham but hed been disowned by the farnham familya fine old toronto family famous patrons of the arts now in his late forties or early fifties ramsay had repeatedly embarrassed the farnhams as a last straw at an impromptu press conference at an otherwise forgettable cultural event ramsay had announced that he was giving away his inheritance to an aids hospice in toronto he also claimed to be finishing a memoir explaining why hed halfblinded himself he said he had lusted after his mother his whole adult life and while hed never had sex with hernor murdered his fatherhe had truly wanted to hence hed blinded himself only in one eye the left one and had renamed himself pedronot oedipus no one knew if pedros eye patch covered an empty eye socket or a perfectly healthy left eye or why hed picked pedro for his new name he was cleaner than most homeless people while his parents would have nothing to do with him perhaps there were other more sympathetic members of the farnham family who allowed ramsay now pedro to have an occasional bath and wash his clothes of course he was insane but hed received an excellent education and was preternaturally wellspoken as for the memoir either it was forever a workinprogress or hed not written a word of it good evening to you dominic oneeyed pedro greeted the cook while dominic was dealing with the windblown kitchen door how are you pedro the cook asked a little hot food might do you some good on a cold night like this one ive been entertaining similar thoughts dominic pedro replied and while im aware that the exhaust fan is most imprecise i believe i detect something special tonightsomething not on the menuand unless my nose deceives me silvestro has outdone himself yet again with a cassoulet dominic had never known pedros nose to deceive him the cook gave the homeless gentleman a generous serving of the cassoulet warning him not to burn himself on the baking dish for the beans in return pedro volunteered to hold the kitchen door openjust a crackwith his foot it is an honor to smell the aromas of patrices kitchen firsthand unadulterated by the exhaust fan pedro told dominic unadulterated the cook repeated quietly to himself but to pedro he said you know were changing our nameafter christmas after christmas is a curious name for a restaurant dominic the homeless man said thoughtfully not everyone celebrates christmas you know the duck is exquisite by the wayand i love the sausage pedro added no nowere not calling the restaurant after christmas the cook cried the new name is kiss of the wolf the homeless man stopped eating and stared at the cook it wasnt my choice dominic told him quickly you have to be kidding pedro said that is a famous porn filmits one of the worst porn films ive ever seen but its famous im certain thats the title you must be mistaken pedro dominic said maybe it sounds better in italian the cook added meaninglessly its not an italian porn film the homeless man cried he handed the unfinished cassoulet back to dominic the baking dish for the beans sliding across the plate of duck and sausage the baking dish briefly burned the cooks thumbs kiss of the wolf cant be a porn film dominic said but pedro was retreating into the alley shaking his huge mane of hair his grizzled beard wagging im going to be sick pedro said i can never forget that filmit was disgusting its not about sex with wolves you know dominic i dont want to know what its about the cook cried im sure youre wrong about the title he called after the homeless man who was disappearing down the dark alleyway there are some things you cant forget dominic pedro called after the cook could no longer see him dreams of incest desiring your motherbad oral sex the crazy man shouted his words whipped by the wind but audible even over the deep drone of the exhaust fan pedro didnt like the cassoulet silvestro asked when the cook brought the full plate and the baking dish back into the kitchen he was bothered by a name was all dominic said but the incident struck the cook as a bad omen for kiss of the wolfeven if pedro had been wrong about the title of the terrible porn film as it would turn out neither the cook nor his writer son could find a porn film called kiss of the wolf not even ketchum had seen such a film and ketchum claimed to have seen everythingat least everything pornographic that was available for viewing in new hampshire i think i would have remembered that title cookie the old logger said in fact im sure i would have sent it to you but what happens in it thats so special the woodsman asked i dont know what happens in iti dont want to know the cook cried i just want to know if it exists well dont get your balls crossed about it ketchum said apparently it doesnt existat least not yet danny told his dad you know that pedro is nuts popyou know that dont you of course i know hes nuts daniel the cook cried poor pedro was just so convincedhe made it sound plausible that saturday night before the christmas breakthe last night that patrice would be patricedanny and ketchum had ordered three bottles of the barolo massolino as the cook had told arnaud ketchum drank most of the wine but ketchum had also been counting you may say you have a couple of beers and one or two glasses of red wine with your dinner danny but youve had four glasses of wine tonight even three glasses of wine on top of two beers is kind of a lot for a little fella there was nothing accusatory in ketchums tonehe was simply setting the record straightbut danny was defensive about it i didnt know you were counting for me ketchum dont be like that danny the logger said its just my job to look after you fellas ketchum had complained about dannys tendency not to lock the house on cluny drive after he came home from dinner but most nights the cook came home later than his son and dominic didnt like fumbling around with the door key the cook preferred to lock the front door after hed come home and before he went to bed but wine makes you sleepy doesnt it danny the woodsman had asked most nights i expect you fall sound asleep in an unlocked housebefore your dad is back home mountains of moose shitas you would say ketchum danny had replied that was just the way they did things in toronto the cook and his son explained to the veteran river driver danny and his dad had locked each other out of the house before it was a nuisance now when they went out they left the house on cluny drive unlocked when they were both back in the house for the night the last one to go to bed locked the damn door its the red wine that troubles me a bit danny ketchum had told the writer with red wine you fall asleep like a rockyou dont hear anything if i drink only beer im awake all night danny told the logger i like the sound of that a little better was all the woodsman had said but the red wine wasnt really the problem yes danny would occasionally drink more than a glass or twoand it did make him sleepy still the wine was no more than a contributing factor and the restaurants new name wasnt part of what went wrong at all the problem was that after all their efforts to elude the cowboyand the dubious name changes which would prove to be pointlessketchum had simply been followed the cowboy had followed ketchum before but carl was none the wiser for it the retired deputy had twice trailed the logger on his hunting trips to quebec carl had even tracked ketchum all the way to pointe au baril station one winter only to assume that the younger man the old woodsman was camping with was just some ontario hick the cowboy had no idea who danny was or what danny did carl had wildly concluded that possibly ketchum was queer and that the younger man was the old loggers lover no little fella with a limp had materialized on these adventures and carl had essentially given up on following ketchum one word would change everythingthe word and the fact that both ketchum and the cowboy did their tire business at the same establishment in milan tires especially winter tires were important in northern new hampshire twitchells was the name of the tire place that ketchum and the cowboy frequented though the grease monkey who did the important talking was a young canuck named croteau that looks like ketchums rig carl had said to the french canadianthis was a week or more before christmas and the cowboy had noticed ketchums truck on the hoist in the garage at twitchells croteau was changing all four tires yup croteau said the retired deputy observed that the canuck was removing ketchums studded tires and replacing them with unstudded snow tires does ketchum have an inside tip that its gonna be a mild winter carl asked croteau nope croteau said he just dont like the sound of the studs on the interstate and its mostly interstates between here and toronto toronto the cowboy repeated but that wasnt the word that would change everything ketchum puts the studded tires back on when he comes home after christmas croteau explained to the deputy but you dont need studs for highway drivinout on the interstates regular snow tires will do ketchum goes to toronto for christmas carl asked the canuck for as long as i can remember croteau said which wasnt very longnot in the cowboys estimation croteau was in his early twenties hed been changing tires only since he got out of high school does ketchum have some lady friend in toronto carl asked or a boyfriend maybe nope croteau replied ketchum said hes got family there it was the family word that would change everything the deputy sheriff knew that ketchum didnt have a familynot in canada anyway and what family hed had the old logger had lost everyone knew that ketchum was estranged from his children ketchums kids were still living in new hampshire carl knew ketchums children were grown up now with kids of their own but they had never moved away from coos county theyd just cut their ties to ketchum ketchum cant have any family in toronto the cowboy told the dumb canuck well thats what ketchum saidhes got family there in toronto croteau insisted stubbornly later danny would be touched that the old logger thought of him and his dad as family yet that was what gave them away to carl the cowboy couldnt think of anyone whom ketchum had absolutely taken toor had seemed at all close to in the manner of familyexcept the cook nor had it been hard for the excop to follow ketchums truck unnoticed that truck burned a lot of oil a black cloud of exhaust enveloped following vehicles and carl had wisely rented an anonymouslooking suv with snow tires that december on the interstate highways of the northeastern united states they would cross into canada from buffalo over the peace bridge the cowboys car was as nondescript as they come after all carl had been a cop he knew how to tail people the cowboy knew how to stake out the house on cluny drive too it wasnt long before he was familiar with all of their comings and goings including ketchums of course the cowboy was aware that ketchum was just visiting while carl must have been tempted to kill all three of them the deputy probably didnt want to risk going up against the old logger carl knew that ketchum was armed the house on cluny drive was never locked during the day or at night eithernot until after the last of them usually the cook had limped home to go to bed it had been easy for the cowboy to get inside and have a good look at the house that way carl knew who was sleeping in each room but there was more that he didnt know the only gun in the house was the one in the guest bedroom where it was clear to carl that ketchum was staying the cowboy thought it was an odd gun or at least an unsophisticated weapon for ketchum to be carryinga youthmodel winchester gauge a friggin kids shotgun carl was thinking how could the deputy have known that the winchester ranger was ketchums christmas present for danny the old logger didnt believe in wrapping paper and the gauge pumpaction shotgun was loaded and stashed under ketchums bedexactly where the cowboy would have hidden a weapon it never occurred to carl that the gauge wouldnt be going back to new hampshire with the veteran river driver whenever it was that ketchum eventually returned to coos county the cowboy would just wait and see when that would bethen make his move carl thought he had several options hed unlocked the door to the fire escape in dannys thirdfloor writing room if the writer didnt notice that the door was unlocked the cowboy could enter the house that way but if danny saw that the door was unlocked and relocked it carl could come into the house through the unlocked front doorat any time of the evening when the cook and his son were out the cowboy had observed that danny didnt go back to his thirdfloor writing room after hed had dinner this was because of the beer and the red wine when the writer had been drinking he didnt even want to be in the same room with his writing whether carl entered the property via the thirdfloor fire escape or walked in the front door he would be safe hiding out in that thirdfloor room the cowboy only had to be careful not to move around too much not until the cook and his son were asleep the floor creaked carl had noticed so did the stairs leading down to the secondfloor hall but the cowboy would be wearing just socks on his feet he would kill the cook first carl was thinkingthen the son carl had seen the eightinch castiron skillet hanging in the cooks bedroom of course the cowboy knew the injunkilling history of that skillet because sixpack had told him carl had amused himself by thinking how funny it would be to be standing in the cooks bedroom after hed shot the little fucker just waiting for the kid to come to his dads rescue with the stupid skillet well if that was how it worked out that would be okay with the cowboy what was important to carl was that he kill them both and that he drive across the u s border before the bodies were discovered with any luck the cowboy could be back in coos county before then the old sheriff was a little worried about encountering the mexican cleaning woman whose comings and goings werent as predictable as the cooksor the nolessobservable habits of his writer son compared to lupita suddenly showing up to do a load or two of laundry or compulsively attacking the kitchen even ketchums routine was reasonably consistent the logger went to a tae kwon do gym on yonge street for a couple of hours every day the gym was called champion centre and ketchum had found the place by accident a few years ago the master instructor was a former iranian wrestler now a boxer and a kickboxer ketchum said he was working on his kicking skills dear god the cook had complained why would an eightythreeyearold man have an interest in learning a martial art its more mixed martial arts cookie ketchum explained its boxing and kickboxingand grappling too im just interested in finding new ways to get a fella down to the ground once i get a guy on the ground i know what to do with him but why ketchum the cook cried how many more fights are you planning to be in thats just it cookieno one can plan on being in a fight you just have to be ready dear god dominic said again to danny it seemed that ketchum had always been getting ready for a war ketchums christmas present to the writer the winchester ranger with which danny had killed three deer appeared to emphasize this point what would i want with a shotgun ketchum danny had asked the old logger youre not much of a deer hunter dannyill grant you thatand you might never go back to hunting deer ketchum began but every household should have a twentygauge every household danny repeated okay maybe this household especially ketchum said you need to have a quickhandling fastaction gun aroundsomething you cant miss with in a close situation a close situation the cook repeated throwing his hands in the air i dont know ketchum danny said just take the gun danny the logger told him see that its loaded at all timesslip it under your bed for safekeeping the first two rounds were buckshot danny knewthe third was the deer slug at the time hed handled the winchester appreciativelynot only to please ketchum but because the writer knew that his acceptance of the shotgun would exasperate his father danny was adept at getting ketchum and his dad riled up at each other dear god the cook started up again i wont sleep at all knowing theres a loaded gun in the house thats okay with me cookie ketchum said in fact i would say it would be idealif you dont sleep at all i mean the winchester ranger had a birchwood forestock and buttstock with a rubber recoil pad that the writer now rested against his shoulder danny had to admit that he loved listening to his dad and ketchum going at it god damn you ketchum the cook was saying one night ill get up to pee and my son will shoot methinking im the cowboy danny laughed come on you twoits christmas lets try to have a merry christmas the writer said but ketchum wasnt in a merry mood dannys not going to shoot you cookie the logger said i just want you fucking fellas to be ready inukshuk danny sometimes said in his sleep charlotte had taught him how to pronounce the indian word or in canada was one supposed to say the inuit word an inuk word danny had also heard he had no idea what was correct danny had heard charlotte say the inuksuk word many times when he woke up the morning after christmas danny wondered if he should move the photograph of charlotte from above the headboard of his bedor perhaps exchange it for a different picture in the photo in question charlotte is standing wet and dripping in a bathing suit with her arms wrapped around herself shes smiling but she looks cold in the distance one can see the islands main dock charlotte was just swimming therebut nearer to her tall figure between her and the dock stands the unreadable inuksuk this particular stone cairn was somewhat manshaped but not really a human likeness from the water it might have been mistaken for a mark of navigation some inuksuit that was the plural form were navigational markers but not this one two large rocks atop each other composed each manlike leg a kind of shelf or tabletop possibly represented the figures hips or waist four smaller rocks composed a potbellied upper body the creature if it was intended to have human features had absurdly truncated arms its arms were as disproportionately short as its legs were overlong the head if it was meant to be a head suggested permanently windswept hair the stone cairn was as stunted as the winterbeaten pines on the georgian bay islands the cairn stood only as tall as charlotte s hips and given the perspective of the photograph above the headboard of dannys bedthat is with charlotte in the foreground of the framethe inuksuk looked even shorter than it was yet it also appeared to be indestructible maybe thats why the word was on dannys lips when he woke up there were countless inuksuit on those islandsand many more out on route between parry sound and pointe au baril where danny remembered a sign that said first nation ojibway territory not far from those summer cottages around moonlight bay where danny had driven in the boat with charlotte one scorching day there were some striking inuksuit near the shawanaga landing indian reserve but what were they exactly the writer now wondered as he lay in bed the morning after christmas not even charlotte knew who had built the inuksuk on her island thered been a carpenter from the shawanaga landing indian reserve on andy grants crew the summer the two sleeping cabins were under construction another summer danny remembered one of the guys who brought the propane tanks to the island had a boat named first nation hed told danny he was a pureblooded ojibway but charlotte said it was unlikely danny hadnt asked her why she was skeptical maybe granddaddy built your inuksuk danny had said to charlotte perhaps hed thought the various indians whod worked on turner island over the years had rebuilt the stone cairn whenever the rocks had fallen down the rocks dont fall down charlotte said granddaddy had nothing to do with our inuksuk a native built itit wont ever fall down but what do they mean exactly danny asked her they imply origins respect endurance charlotte answered but this was too vague to satisfy the writer in danny angel he remembered being surprised that charlotte seemed satisfied with such a nonspecific description as for what an individual inuksuk meantwell shit as ketchum had said it seems to matter which injun you ask ketchum believed that some inuksuit were nothing but meaningless heaps of rocks danny peered under his bed at the winchester per ketchums instructions the loaded shotgun lay in an open case according to ketchum the case should remain unzipped because any fool intruder can hear a zipper it was obvious of course which fool intruder ketchum meantan eightythreeyearold retired deputy sheriff all the way from fucking new hampshire and the safety danny had asked ketchum do i leave the safety off too it made a sound a soft click when you pushed the button for the safety which was slightly forward of the trigger housing but ketchum had told danny to leave the safety on the way the old logger put it was if the cowboy can hear the safety click off hes already too close to you danny looked first at the photograph of charlotte with the inuksuk standing behind her then at the gauge shotgun under his bed perhaps the stone cairn and the winchester ranger both represented protectionthe gauge of a more specific kind he was not unhappy to have the gun danny was thinking though it seemed to him that every christmas ushered in a morbid preoccupationsometimes initiated by ketchum such as the winchester but at other times inspired by danny or his dad this christmas eve for example the cook could be blamed for beginning a downward spiral of gloominess just think of it dominic had said to his son and ketchum if joe were alive he would be in his midthirtiesprobably with a couple of kids of his own joe would be older than charlotte was when i first met her danny chimed in actually daniel his father said joe would be only a decade younger than you werei mean at the time joe died whoa stop this shit ketchum cried and if injun jane were still alive shed be eightyfuckingeight i doubt shed even be speaking to any of usnot unless we somehow managed to elevate our conversation but the very next day ketchum had presented danny with the gauge shotgunnot exactly an elevation of their prevailing conversation or their overriding fixationand the cook had seemingly out of the blue begun to complain about the sheer morbidity of daniels book dedications true baby in the road as might be expected was dedicated as follows my son joein memoriam it was the second dedication to joethe third overall in memoriam dominic found this depressing i cant help it if the people i know keep dying pop danny had said all the while ketchum had continued to demonstrate the sliding action of the winchester the ejected shotgun shells flying all around one of the live shells a deer slug would be lost for a time in the discarded wrapping paper for other christmas presents but ketchum kept loading and unloading the weapon as if he were mowing down a horde of attackers if we live long enough we become caricatures of ourselves danny said aloud to himselfas if he were writing this down which he wasnt the writer was still contorting himself in bed where he was transfixed by the photo of charlotte with the mysterious inuksukthat is when he wasnt drawn to the dangerous but thrilling sight of the loaded shotgun under his bed it was boxing day in canada a writer danny knew always had a party every christmas the cook bought ketchum some outdoor clothingat either eddie bauer or rootsand ketchum wore his new gear to the boxing day party dominic never failed to help out in the kitchen the kitchen anybodys kitchen was ever the cooks home away from home danny mingled with his friends at the party he tried to remain unembarrassed by ketchums political outbursts there was never any need for danny to feel embarrassednot in canada where the old loggers antiamerican ranting was very popular some fella from the cbc wanted me to go on a radio show ketchum told danny and his dad when the cook was driving them home from the boxing day party dear god dominic said again just because youre sober dont think youre a good driver cookieyou best let danny and me handle the conversation while you pay attention to the mayhem in the streets the cowboy could have killed them all that night but carl was a coward he wouldnt risk it not with ketchum in the house the deputy didnt know that the youthmodel gauge was under dannys bed not ketchums nor could carl have guessed how much the old logger had had to drink at the party the cowboy could have shot his way into the house its doubtful that ketchum would have woken up danny wouldnt have woken up either it had been one of those nights when the supposed one or two glasses of red wine with his dinner had in reality turned out to be four or five danny woke once in the night thinking he should look under his bed to be sure that the shotgun was still there he fell out of bed in the process making a resounding thump which neither his dad nor the snoring logger heard ketchum never lingered long in toronto once christmas was over a pity he hadnt brought hero with him and thenfor some reasonleft the dog with the cook and his son after ketchum went back across the border carl couldnt have entered the house on cluny drive or hidden himself in the thirdfloor writing room if hero that fine animal had been there but the dog was in coos county staying with sixpack pamterrorizing her dogs as it would turn outand ketchum left early the next morning for new hampshire when danny got up before his dad he found the note ketchum had left on the kitchen table to dannys surprise it was neatly typed ketchum had gone up to the thirdfloor writing room and used the typewriter there but danny hadnt heard the creaking of the floor above his bedroomhe hadnt heard the stairs creak either both he and the cook had slept through the sound of the typewriter toonot a good sign the old logger could have told them but ketchums note said nothing about that ive seen enough of you fellas for a time i miss my dog and im going to see him by the time im back home ill be missing you too easy on the red wine danny ketchum carl was happy to see ketchums truck leave the cowboy must have been growing impatient but he waited for the mexican cleaning woman to come and go that way the deputy had no doubt with the guest bedroom emptylupita had made it up as good as newcarl was convinced that ketchum wasnt coming back yet the cowboy had to wait another night the cook and his son ate their dinner at home on the evening of december dominic had found a kielbasa sausage in the meat market and had browned it in olive oil and then stewed it with chopped fennel and onions and cauliflower in a tomato sauce with crushed fennel seeds the cook served the stew with a warm fresh loaf of rosemaryandolive bread and a green salad ketchum would have liked this pop danny said ah wellketchum is a good man dominic said to his sons amazement not knowing how to respond danny attempted to further compliment the kielbasa stew he suggested it might make a suitable addition to the more bistrolike or lowkey menu at kiss of the wolf no no the cook said dismissively kielbasa is too rusticeven for kiss of the wolf all danny said was its a good dish dad you could serve it to royalty i think i should have made it for ketchumi never made it for him was all dominic said the cooks last night alive he ate with his beloved daniel at a portuguese place near little italy the restaurant was called chiado it was one of dominics favorites in toronto arnaud had introduced him to it when theyd both been working downtown on queen street west that thursday night december both danny and his dad had the rabbit during ketchums christmas visit it had snowed and it had rainedeverything had frozen and thawed and then it all froze again by the time the cook and his son took a taxi home from chiado it had started to snow once more dominic didnt like to drive downtown the imprints of the cowboys footsteps in the crusty old snow on the outdoor fire escape were faint and hard to see in the daylight now that it was dark and snowing carls tracks were completely covered the excop had taken off his parka and his boots hed stretched out on the couch in dannys thirdfloor writing room with the colt revolver clasped to his chestin the scenario hed imagined the old sheriff had no need of a holster the voices of the cook and his writer son reached carl from the kitchen though well never know if the cowboy understood their conversation at fiftyeight you should be married daniel you should be living with your wife not your father the cook was saying and what about you pop wouldnt a wife be good for you danny asked ive had my opportunities daniel at seventysix i would embarrass myself with a wifei would always be apologizing to her dominic said for what danny asked his dad occasional incontinence perhaps farting certainlynot to mention talking in my sleep the cook confided to his son you should find a wife whos hard of hearinglike ketchum danny suggested they both laughed the cowboy had to have heard their laughter i was being serious danielyou should at least have a regular girlfriend a true companion dominic was saying as they came up the stairs to the secondfloor hall even from the third floor carl could have singled out the distinguishing sounds of the cooks limp on the stairs i have women friends danny started to say im not talking about groupies daniel i dont have groupies popnot anymore young fans then remember ive read your fan mail i dont answer those letters dad youngwhat are they callededitorial assistants maybe young booksellers too daniel ive seen you with one or two all those young people in publishing young women are more likely to be unattached danny pointed out to his dad most women my age are married or theyre widows whats wrong with widows his father asked at that theyd both laughed againa shorter laugh this time im not looking for a permanent relationship danny said i can see that why dominic wanted to know they were at opposite ends of the secondfloor hall at the doorways to their respective bedrooms their voices were raised surely the cowboy could hear every word ive had my opportunities too pop danny told his dad i just want all the best for you daniel the cook told him youve been a good fatherthe best danny said you were a good father too daniel i could have done a better job danny quickly interjected i love you dominic said i love you too dad good night danny said he went into his bedroom and quietly closed the door good night the cook called from the hall it was such a heartfelt blessing its almost conceivable that the cowboy was tempted to wish them both a good night too but carl lay unmoving above them not making a sound did the deputy wait as long as an hour after hed heard them brush their teeth probably not did danny once more dream about the windswept pine on charlotte s island in georgian bay specifically the view of that hardy little tree from what had been his writing shack there probably did the cook in his prayers ask for more time probably not under the circumstances and knowing dominic baciagalupo the cook couldnt have asked for muchthat is if hed prayed at all at best dominic might have expressed the hope that his lonely son find someoneonly that did the floorboards above them creak under the fat cowboys weight once carl decided to make his move not that they heard or if danny heard anything at all he might have happily imagined in his sleep that joe was home from colorado not knowing how dark it might be in the house at night the cowboy had tested those stairs from the thirdfloor writing room with his eyes closed hed counted the number of steps in the secondfloor hall to the cooks bedroom door too and carl knew where the light switch wasjust inside the door right next to the eightinch castiron skillet as it turned out danny always left a light onon the stairs from the kitchen to the secondfloor hall so there was plenty of light in the hall the cowboy slipping silently in his socks padded down the hallway to the cooks bedroom and opened the door surprise cookie carl said flicking on the light its time for you to die maybe danny heard that perhaps he didnt but his dad sat up in bedblinking his eyes in the sudden white lightand the cook said in a very loud voice what took you so long you moron you must be dumber than a dog turd cowboyjust like jane always said without a doubt danny heard that you little shit cookie carl cried danny heard that too he was already kneeling on the floor pulling the winchester out of the open case under his bed dumber than a dog turd cowboy his dad was shouting im not so dumb cookie youre the one whos gonna die carl was hollering he never heard danny click the safety off or the sound of the writer running barefoot down the hall the cowboy took aim with the colt and shot the cook in the heart dominic baciagalupo was blown into the headboard of the bed he died instantly on the pillows there was no time for the deputy to comprehend the cooks curious smile which stretched the white scar on his lower lip and only danny understood what his dad had uttered just before he was shot she bu de dominic managed to say as ah gou and xiao dee had taught himthe she bu de that means i cant bear to let go the chinese was of course meaningless to carl who as he wheeled to face the naked man in the doorway must have half understood why the cook had died smiling not only did dominic know that all the yelling would save his son the cook also knew that his friend ketchum had provided daniel with a better weapon than the eightinch castiron skillet and maybe there was a margin of lastminute recognition in the cowboys eyes when he saw that danny had already taken aim with ketchums winchester the muchmaligned youth model the long barrel of carls colt was still pointed at the floor when the first round of buckshot from the gauge tore away half his throat the cowboy was flung backward into the night table where the lightbulb in the lamp exploded between his shoulder blades dannys second load of buckshot tore away what remained of the cowboys throat the deer slug the socalled killshot wasnt really necessary but dannynow at pointblank rangefired the shotguns third and final round into carls mangled neck as if the gaping wound itself were a magnet if ketchum could be believedthat is if hed been speaking literally about the way wolves killed their preywerent these three shots from the gauge ranger exactly as kisses of wolves should be werent they indeed not so pretty still naked danny went downstairs he called the police from the phone in the kitchen telling them that he would unlock the front door for them and that they could find him upstairs with his father after hed unlocked the door he went back upstairs to his bedroom and put on some old sweatpants and a sweatshirt danny thought of calling ketchum but it was late and there was no reason to be in a hurry when he reentered his dads bedroom there was no overlooking the kisses of wolves that had ripped the cowboy apartleaving him like something sprayed from a hosebut danny only briefly regretted the mess hed made for lupita the bloodsoaked rug the bloodspattered walls the bloodied photographs on the bulletin board above the shattered night tablewell danny didnt doubt that lupita could handle it he knew that something worse had happened to her shed lost a child ketchum had been right about the red wine the writer was thinking as he sat on the bed beside his father if hed been drinking only beer danny thought he might have heard the cowboy a few seconds sooner danny just might have been able to open fire with the shotgun before carl could have pulled the trigger dont beat up on yourself about it danny ketchum would tell him later im the one the cowboy followed i should have seen that coming dont you beat up on yourself about it ketchum danny would tell the old logger but of course ketchum would when the police came the lights in the neighboring houses were all ablaze and lots of dogs were barking normally at that hour of the night rosedale is very quiet most of the residents who lived near the double shooting had never heard gunfire as loud and terrifying as thatsome dogs would bark until dawn but when the police came they found danny quietly cradling his dads head in his lap the two of them huddled together on the bloodsoaked pillows at the head of the bed in his report the young homicide detective would say that the bestselling author was waiting for them in the upstairs of the houseexactly where hed said he would beand that the writer appeared to be singing or perhaps reciting a poem to his murdered father she bu de danny kept repeating in his dads ear neither the cook nor his son had ever known if ah gou and xiao dees translation of the mandarin was essentially correctthat is if she bu de literally meant i cant bear to let gobut what did it matter really i cant bear to let go was what the writer thought he was saying to his father whod kept his beloved son safe from the cowboy for nearly fortyseven years that had been how long ago it was when theyd both left twisted river now at lastnow that the police were theredanny began to cry he just started to let go an ambulance and two police cars were parked outside the house on cluny drive their lights flashing the first policemen to enter the cooks bedroom were aware of the rudimentary story as it had been reported over the phone thered been a breakin and the armed intruder had shot and killed the famous writers father danny had then shot and killed the intruder but surely there was more to the story than that the young homicide detective was thinking the detective had the utmost respect for mr angel and under the circumstances he wanted to give the writer all the time he needed to compose himself yet the damage done by that shotgunrepeatedly and at such close rangewas so excessive that the detective must have sensed that this breakin and murder and the famous writers retaliation had a substantial history mr angel the young homicide detective asked if youre ready sir i wonder if you could tell me how this happened what made dannys tears different was that he was crying the way a twelveyearold would cryas if carl had somehow shot his dad their last night in twisted river danny couldnt speak but he managed to point to something it was in the vicinity of his fathers bedroom doorway the young detective misunderstood yes i know you were standing there in the doorway when you shot the homicide policeman said at least for the first shot then you came closer into the room didnt you danny was violently shaking his head another young policeman had noticed the eightinch castiron skillet hanging just inside the doorway of the bedrooman unusual spot for a frying panand he tapped the bottom of the skillet with his index finger yes danny managed to say between sobs bring that skillet over here the homicide detective said while he didnt relinquish his hold on his fatherdanny continued to cradle the cooks head in his laphe reached with his right hand for the eightinch castiron skillet and when his fingers closed around the handle his crying calmed down the young homicide detective waited he could see there was no rushing this story raising the skillet in his right hand danny then rested the heavy pan on the bed ill start with the eightinch castiron skillet the writer finally began as if he had a long story to tellone he knew well v coos county new hampshire chapter ketchums left hand ketchum had been hunting bear hed driven his truck to wilsons mills maine and he and hero had taken the suzuki atv back into new hampshire crossing the border about parallel to half mile falls on the dead diamond river where ketchum bagged a big male black bear his weapon of choice for bear was the shortbarreled lightweight rifle dannys friend barrett had years ago preferred for deer a remington springfield a carbine what ketchum called my oldreliable boltaction sucker the model had been discontinued in ketchum had some difficulty bringing the bear back across the border the allterrain vehicle notwithstanding lets just say hero had to walk a fair distance ketchum would tell danny when ketchum said walk this probably meant that the dog had to run the whole way but it was the first weekend of bear season when hounds were permitted that fine animal was excited enough to not mind running after ketchums atv anyway counting ketchum and the dead bear thered been no room for hero on the suzuki it might be dark on monday before hero and i get home ketchum had warned danny there would be no locating the old logger over the long weekend danny didnt even try ketchum had gradually accepted the telephone and the fax machine butat eightyfourthe former river driver would never own a cell phone not that there were a lot of cell phones in the great north woods in besides dannys flight from toronto had been delayed by the time hed landed in boston and had rented the car the leisurely cup of coffee hed planned with paul polcari and tony molinari turned into a quick lunch it would be early afternoon before danny and carmella del popolo left the north end of course the roads were in better shape than theyd been in when the cook and his twelveyearold son had made that trip in the other direction but northern new hampshire was still a fair distance as ketchum would say from the north end of boston and it was late afternoon when danny and carmella passed the pontook reservoir and followed the upper androscoggin along route to errol when they drove by the reservoir danny recognized dummer pond road from when it had been a haul roadbut all he said to carmella was well be coming back here with ketchum tomorrow carmella nodded she just looked out the passengerside window at the androscoggin maybe ten miles later she said thats a powerfullooking river danny was glad she wasnt seeing the river in march or april the androscoggin was a torrent in mud season ketchum had told danny that september was the best time of year for them to comefor carmella especially there was a good chance for fair weather the nights were growing cooler the bugs were gone and it was too soon for snow but as far north as coos county the leaves were turning color in late august that second monday in september it already looked like fall and there was a nip in the air by late afternoon ketchum had been worried about carmellas mobility in the woods i can drive us most of the way but it will entail a little walking to get to the right place on the riverbank ketchum had said in his minds eye danny could see the place ketchum meantan elevated site overlooking the basin above the river bend what he couldnt quite imagine was how different it would bewith the cookhouse entirely gone and the town of twisted river burned to the ground but dominic baciagalupo hadnt wanted his ashes scattered where the cookhouse was or anywhere near the town the cook had requested that his ashes be sunk in the river in the basin where his notreallyacousin rosie had slipped under the breaking ice it was almost exactly the same spot where angelù del popolo had gone under the logs that of course was really why carmella had come those many years ago thirtyfour if danny was doing the math correctly ketchum had invited carmella to twisted river if one day you ever want to see the place where your boy perished i would be honored to show you was how ketchum had put it to her carmella had so wanted to see the river basin where the accident happened but not the logs she knew the logs would be too much for her just the riverbank where her dear gamba and young dan had stood and seen it happenand maybe the exact spot in the water where her oneandonly angelù hadnt surfaced yes she might one day want to see that carmella had thought thank you mr ketchum shed said that day when the logger and the cook were leaving boston if you ever want to see me carmella had started to say to dominic i know the cook had said to her but he wouldnt look at her now on the occasion of danny bringing his fathers ashes to twisted river ketchum had insisted that the writer bring carmella too when danny had first met angels mom the twelveyearold had noted her big breasts big hips big smileknowing that only carmellas smile had been bigger than injun janes now the writer knew that carmella was at least as old as ketchum or a little older she would have been in her mideighties danny guessed her hair had turned completely whiteeven her eyebrows were white in striking contrast to her olive complexion and her apparently robust good health carmella was big all over but she was still more feminine than jane had ever been and however happy she was with the new fella in her lifepaul polcari and tony molinari continued to insist that she wasshed held on to the del popolo name perhaps out of respect for the fact that she had lost both the drowned fisherman and her precious only child yet on the long drive north thered been no bewailing her beloved angelùand only one comment from carmella on the cooks passing i lost my dear gamba years ago secondonow youve lost him too carmella had said with tears in her eyes but shed quickly recovered herself for the rest of the trip carmella gave danny no indication that she was even thinking about where they were going and why carmella continued to refer to dominic by his nickname gambajust as she called danny secondo as if danny were in her heart still her surrogate son it appeared shed long ago forgiven him for spying on her in the bathtub he could not imagine doing so now but he didnt say so instead danny rather formally apologized to carmella for his behavior all those years ago nonsense secondoi suppose i was flattered carmella told him in the car with a dismissive wave of her plump hand i only worried that the sight of me would have a damaging effect on youthat you might be permanently attracted to fat older women danny sensed that this might have been an invitation for him to proclaim that he was not and had never been attracted to such women though in truthafter katie who was preternaturally smallmany of the women in his life had been large by the stickfigure standards of contemporary womens fashion danny thought that even charlotte indisputably the love of his lifemight have been considered overweight like his dad danny was small and while the writer didnt respond to carmellas comment he found himself wondering if perhaps he was more at ease with women who were bigger than he was not that spying on carmella in a bathtub or killing injun jane with a skillet had anything to do with it i wonder if youre seeing someone nowsomeone special that is carmella said after a pause of a mile or more no one special danny replied if i can still count youre almost sixty carmella told him danny was fiftynine your dad always wanted you to be with someone who was right for you i was but she moved on danny told her carmella sighed she had brought her melancholy with her in the car what was melancholic about carmella together with her undefined disapproval of danny had traveled with them all the way from boston danny had detected the latters presence as strongly as carmellas engaging scenteither a mild nonspecific perfume or a smell as naturally appealing as freshly baked bread besides danny went on my dad wasnt with anyone specialnot after he was my age after a pause while carmella waited danny added and pop was never with anyone as right for him as you carmella sighed again as if to note ambiguously both her pleasure and displeasureshe was displeased by her failure to steer the conversation where shed wanted it to go the subject of what was wrong with danny evidently weighed on her now danny waited for what she would say next it was only a matter of time he knew before carmella would raise the more delicate matter of what was wrong with his writing all the way from boston hed found carmellas conversation dullthe selfrighteousness of her old age was depressing she would lose her way in what she was saying and then blame danny for her bewilderment she implied that he wasnt paying sufficient attention to her or that he was deliberately confusing her his dad danny realized had remained sharp by comparison while ketchum grew deafer by the minute and his ranting was more explosiveand though the old logger was close to carmellas agedanny instinctively forgave him after all ketchum had always been crazy hadnt the veteran riverman been cranky and illogical when he was young danny was thinking to himself just then in the highcontrast lateafternoon light they drove past the small sign for androscoggin taxidermy my goodnessmoose antlers for sale carmella said aloud attempting to read more minutiae from the sign shed said my goodness every minute of the drive north danny reflected with irritation want to stop and buy a stuffed dead animal he asked her just so long as its before dark carmella answered laughing she patted his knee affectionately and danny felt ashamed for resenting her company hed loved her as a child and as a young man and he had no doubt that she loved himshed positively adored his dad yet danny found her tiresome now and he hadnt wanted her along on this trip it was ketchums idea to show her where angel had died danny realized that hed wanted ketchum for himself seeing his dads ashes sunk in twisted river which was what the cook had wanted mattered more to danny than ketchum making good on his promise to escort carmella to the basin above the river bend where her angelù was lost it made danny feel ungenerous that he thought of carmella as both a burden and a distraction it made him feel unkind but he believed for the first time that paul polcari and tony molinari hadnt been kidding carmella truly must be happywith her new fella and her life nothing but happiness could explain why she was so boring but hadnt carmella lost three loved ones counting the cookher one and only child among them how could danny who had lost an only child himself not see carmella as a sympathetic soul he did see her as sympathetic of course danny just didnt want to be with carmellanot at this moment when the dual missions of sinking his fathers ashes and being with ketchum were entirely enough where are they carmella asked as they drove into errol where are what danny said theyd just been talking about taxidermy did she mean where are the dead stuffed animals where are gambas remainshis ashes carmella asked in a nonbreakable container a jarits a kind of plastic not glass danny answered somewhat evasively in your luggage in the trunk of the car carmella asked him yes danny didnt want to tell her more about the container itselfwhat the contents of the jar used to be and so forth besides they were coming into the townsuch as it wasand while it was still light danny wanted to get his bearings and have a look around that way it would be easier to find ketchum in the morning ill see you bright and early tuesday the old logger had said whats bright and early danny asked before seven at the latest ketchum said before eight if were lucky danny told him danny had his concerns about how bright and early carmella could get up and be fully functioningnot to mention that they were spending the night a few miles out of town there was no proper place for them to stay in errol ketchum had assured danny the logger had recommended a resort hotel in dixville notch from what danny and carmella could see of errol ketchum had been right they took the road toward umbagog past a general store which was a liquor store too there was a bridge over the androscoggin at the east end of town and a fire station just west of the bridge where danny turned the car around driving back through town they passed the errol elementary schooltheyd not noticed it the first time there was also a restaurant called northern exposure but the most prosperouslooking place in errol was a sportinggoods store called l l cote lets have a look inside danny suggested to carmella just so long as its before dark she said again carmella had been one of the earliest erotic stimulations of his life how could she have become such a repetitious old woman danny was thinking they both regarded the sign on the door of the sportinggoods store with trepidation please no loaded firearms inside my goodness carmella said they hesitated albeit briefly at the door l l cote sold snowmobiles and allterrain vehicles inside there were dead stuffed animals the regional species enough to suggest that the local taxidermist was kept busy bear deer lynx fox fisher cat moose porcupine skunka host of critters ketchum would have saidin addition to all the ducks and the birds of prey there were more guns than any other single item carmella recoiled from such a display of lethal weaponry a large selection of browning knives caused danny to reflect that probably ketchums big browning knife had been purchased here there was also quite a collection of scentelimination clothing which danny tried to explain to carmella so that the hunters dont smell like people danny told her my goodness carmella said can i help you folks an old man asked them suspiciously he was an unlikelylooking salesman with a browning knife on his belt and a portly appearance his belly hung over his belt buckle and his redandblack flannel shirt was reminiscent of what ketchum usually worethe salesmans camouflage fleece vest notwithstanding ketchum wouldnt have been caught dead in camouflage its not like a war the woodsman had said the critters cant shoot back i could use some directions maybe danny said to the salesman we have to find lost nation road but not until tomorrow morning it aint called that no morenot for a long time the salesman said his suspicion deepening i was told its off the road to akers pond danny started to say but the salesman interrupted him it is but it aint called lost nationalmost nobody calls it that not nowadays does the road have a new name then danny asked the salesman was eyeing carmella disagreeably it dont have a nametheres just a sign that says somethin about small engine repairs its the first thing you come to off akers pond road you cant miss it the old man said but not encouragingly well im sure well find it danny told him thank you who are you lookin for the salesman asked still staring at carmella mr ketchum carmella answered ketchum would call it lost nation road the salesman said emphatically as if that settled everything that was wrong with the name is ketchum expectin you the old man asked danny yes actually he is but not until tomorrow morning danny repeated i wouldnt pay a visit to ketchum if he wasnt expectin me the salesman said not if i was you thank you again danny told the old man taking carmellas arm they were trying to leave l l cotes but the salesman stopped them only an injun would call it lost nation road he said that proves it proves what danny asked him ketchum isnt an indian ha the salesman scoffed halfbreeds are injuns danny could sense carmellas rising indignationalmost as physically as he could feel her weight against his arm he had managed to steer her to the door of the sportinggoods store when the salesman called after them that fella ketchum is a lost nation unto himself the salesman shouted then as if hed thought better of itand with a certain measure of panic in the afterthoughthe added dont tell him i said so i suppose ketchum shops here from time to timedoesnt he danny asked he was enjoying the fat old salesmans moment of fear his moneys as good as anybodys isnt it the salesman said sourly ill tell him you said so danny said guiding carmella out the door is mr ketchum an indian she asked danny when they were back in the car i dont knowmaybe partly danny answered i never asked him my goodnessive never seen a bearded indian carmella said not in the movies anyway they drove west out of town on route there was something called the errol cream barrel chuck wagon and what appeared to be an immaculately wellkept campground and trailer park called saw dust alley they passed the umbagog snowmobile association too that seemed to be about it for errol danny didnt turn off the highway at akers pond road he simply noted where it was he was sure ketchum would be easy to find in the morninglost nation or no lost nation a moment later just as it was growing dark they drove alongside a field encircled by a high fence naturally carmella read the sign on the fence out loud please do not harass the buffalo well my goodness who would do such a thing she said indignant as ever but they saw no buffaloonly the fence and the sign the resort hotel in dixville notch was called the balsamsfor hikers and golfers in the warmweather months danny supposed in the winter for skiers certainly it was vast and largely uninhabited on a monday night danny and carmella were practically alone in the dining room where carmella sighed deeply after theyd ordered their dinner she had a glass of red wine danny had a beer hed stopped drinking red wine after his dad died though ketchum gave him endless shit about his decision to drink only beer you dont have to lay off the red wine now ketchum had shouted at him i dont care if i cant sleep anymore danny had told the old logger now carmella after sighing appeared to be holding her breath before beginning i guess it goes without saying that ive read all your booksmore than once she began really danny asked her feigning innocence of where this conversation was headed of course i have carmella cried for someone whos so happy what is she angry with me for danny was wondering when carmella said oh secondoyour dad was so proud of you for being a famous writer and everything it was dannys turn to sigh he held his breath for just a second or two and you he asked her not so innocently this time its just that your stories and sometimes the characters themselves are sowhat is the word im looking forunsavory carmella started in but she must have seen something in dannys face that made her stop i see he said danny might have looked at her as if she were another interviewer some journalist who hadnt done her homework and whatever carmella really thought about his writing it suddenly wasnt worth it to her to say this to himnot to her darling secondo her surrogate sonfor hadnt the world hurt him as much as it had hurt her tell me what youre writing now secondo carmella suddenly blurted out smiling warmly at him youve been rather a long time between books againhavent you tell me what youre up to im just dying to know whats next not much later after carmella went to bed some men were watching monday night football at the bar but danny had already gone to his room where he left the television dark he also left the curtains open confident in how lightly he sleptknowing that the earlymorning light would wake him he was only a little worried about getting carmella up and going in the morning danny knew that ketchum would wait for them if they were late the lamp on the night table was on as danny lay in bed and there on the table too was the jar containing his fathers ashes it would be dannys last night with the cooks ashes and he lay looking at themas if they might suddenly speak or give him some other indication of his dads last wishes well pop i know you said you wanted this but i hope you havent changed your mind danny spoke up in the hotel room as for the ashes they were in what was formerly a container of amos new york steak spicethe listed ingredients had once been sea salt pepper herbs and spicesand the cook must have bought it at his favorite fancy meat market in their neighborhood of toronto because olliffe was the name on the label danny had gotten rid of most but not all of the contents after hed placed his fathers ashes in thered been room to put some of the herbs and spices back in as well and danny had done so if someone had questioned him about the container at us customsif theyd opened the jar and had a whiffit still would have smelled like steak spice perhaps the pepper would have made the customs officer sneeze but danny had brought the cooks ashes through us customs without any questioning now he sat up in bed and opened the jar cautiously sniffing the contents knowing what was in the container danny wouldnt have wanted to sprinkle it on a steak but it still smelled like pepper and herbs and spicesit even looked like crushed herbs and a variety of spices not human ashes how fitting for a cook that his remains had taken up residency in a jar of amos new york steak spice dominic baciagalupo his writer son thought might have gotten a kick out of that danny turned out the lamp on the night table and lay in bed in the dark last chance pop he whispered in the quiet room if you dont have anything else to say were going back to twisted river but the cooks ashes together with the herbs and spices maintained their silence danny angel once went eleven years between novelsbetween east of bangor and baby in the road again a death in the family would delay him though carmella had been wrong to suggest that the writer was once more taking rather a long time between books it had been only six years since his most recent novel was published as had happened with joe after the cook was murdered the novel danny had been writing suddenly looked inconsequential to him but this time there was no thought of revising the bookhed simply thrown it away all of it and he had started a new and completely different novel almost immediately the new writing emerged from those months when what remained of his privacy had been taken from him the writing itself was like a landscape suddenly and sharply liberated from a fog the publicity was awful carmella bluntly said at dinner but this time danny had expected the publicity after all a famous writers father had been murdered and the writer himself had shot the killerirrefutably in selfdefense whats more danny angel and his dad had been on the run for nearly fortyseven years the internationally bestselling author had left the united states for canada but not for political reasonsjust as danny always claimed without revealing the actual circumstances he and his dad had been running away from a crazy excop naturally there were those in the american media who would say that the cook and his son should have gone to the police in the first place did they miss the fact that carl was the police of course the canadian press was indignant that american violence had followed the famous author and his father across the border in retrospect this was really a reference to the guns themselvesboth the cowboys absurd colt and ketchums christmas present to danny the winchester gauge that had blown away the deputy sheriffs throat and in canada much was made of the fact that the writers possession of the shotgun was illegal in the end danny wasnt charged ketchums gauge ranger had been confiscatedthat was all that shotgun saved your life ketchum had bellowed to danny and it was a present for christs sake who confiscated it ill blow his balls off let it go ketchum danny said i dont need a shotgun not anymore you have fansand whatever their opposites are calleddont you the old logger pointed out some critters among them ill bet as for the question danny was asked the most by both the american and the canadian media it was are you going to write about this hed learned to be icy in answering the oftrepeated question not immediately danny always said but are you going to write about it carmella had asked him again over dinner he talked about the book he was writing instead it was going well in fact he was writing like the windthe words wouldnt stop this one would be another long novel but danny didnt think it would take long to write he didnt know why it was coming so easily from the first sentence the story had flowed he quoted the first sentence to carmella later danny would realize what a fool hed beento have expected her to be impressed in the closed restaurant after hours the late cooks sonthe maestros sole surviving family memberworked in the dark kitchen and from that mysterious beginning danny had composed the novels title in the afterhours restaurant to the writers thinking carmellas reaction was as predictable as her conversation its about gamba she asked no he tried to explain the story was about a man whos lived in the shadow of his famous father a masterful cook who has recently died and left his only son already in his sixties a lost and furtive soul in the rest of the worlds judgment the son seems somewhat retarded hes lived his whole life with his father he has worked as a sous chef to his dad in the restaurant the wellrespected cook made famous now alone the son has never paid his own bills before hes not once bought his own clothes while the restaurant continues to employ him perhaps out of a lingering mourning for the deceased cook the son is virtually worthless as a sous chef without his fathers guidance soon the restaurant will be forced to fire him or else demote him to being a dishwasher what the son discovers however is that he can contact the dead cooks spirit by cooking up a storm in the nighttime kitchenbut only after the restaurant is closed there long after hours the son secretly slaves to teach himself his dads recipeseverything the sous chef failed to learn from his father when the great cook was alive and when the former sous chef masters a recipe to his dads satisfaction the spirit of the deceased cook advises his son on more practical matterswhere to buy his clothes what bills to pay first how often and by whom the car should be serviced his fathers ghost the son soon realizes has forgotten a few thingssuch as the fact that his somewhat retarded son never learned to drive a car gamba is aghost carmella cried i suppose i could have called the novel the retarded sous chef danny said sarcastically but i thought in the afterhours restaurant was a better title secondo someone might think its a cookbook carmella cautioned him well what could he say surely no one would think a new novel by danny angel was a cookbook danny stopped talking about the story to placate carmella he told her what the dedication was my father dominic baciagalupoin memoriam this would be his second dedication to his dad bringing the number of dedications in memoriam up to four predictably carmella burst into tears there was a certain safety a familiar kind of comfort in her tears carmella seemed almost happy when she was crying or at least her disapproval of danny was somewhat abated by her sorrow as he lay awake in bed now with little confidence that he would fall asleep danny wondered why hed tried so hard to make carmella understand what he was writing why had he bothered okay so shed asked what he was writingshe had even said she was dying to know what was next but hed been a storyteller forever danny had always known how to change the subject as he driftedever so lightlyto sleep danny imagined the son the tentative sous chef in the afterhours kitchen where his fathers ghost instructs him similar to ketchum before the logger learned to read the son makes lists of words he is struggling to recognize and remember this night the son is obsessed with pasta orecchiette he writes means little ears they are small and diskshaped bit by bit the sous chef is becoming a cookif it isnt too late if his dead fathers restaurant will only give him more time to learn farfalle the somewhat retarded son writes means butterflies but my dad also called them bow ties in his halfsleep danny was up to the chapter where the cooks ghost speaks very personally to his son i had so wanted for you to be married with children of your own you would be a wonderful father but you like the kind of woman who is is what danny was thinking a new waitress has been added to the waitstaff in the haunted restaurant she is precisely the kind of woman the cooks ghost is trying to warn his son about but at last the writer fell asleep only then did the story stop the police business concerning the double shooting in toronto was finished even the most egregious morons in the media had finally backed off after all the bloodbath had happened almost nine months agonot quite the duration of a pregnancy only dannys mail had continued to discuss itthe sympathy letters and whatever their opposite was that mail about the cooks murder and the subsequent shooting of his killer had persistedcondolences for the most part though not all the letters were kind danny read every word of them but hed not yet received the letter he was looking fornor did he seriously expect that he would ever hear from lady sky again this didnt stop danny from dreaming about herthat vertical strip of the strawberry blondes pubic hair the bright white scar from her cesarean section the imagined histories of her unexplained tattoos little joe had given her a superheros name but was lady sky an actual warrioror in a previous life had she been one danny could only imagine that amys life had been different once doesnt something have to happen to you before you jump naked out of an airplane and after youve jumped what more can happen to you danny would wonder that amy had written him once after joe died and that shed also lost a childwell that was one of lifes missed connections wasnt it since hed not written her back why would she write him again but danny read his mail all of itanswering not a single letterin the diminishing hope that he would hear from amy danny didnt even know why he wanted to hear from her but he couldnt forget her if youre ever in trouble ill be back lady sky had told little joe kissing the twoyearolds forehead meanwhile you take care of your daddy so much for the promises of angels who drop naked out of the sky thoughto be fairamy had told them she was only an angel sometimes indeed most persistently in dannys dreams lady sky didnt always make herself available as an angelobviously not on that snowy night when joe and the wild blowjob girl met the blue mustang going over berthoud pass i would like to see you again amy danny angel said aloud in the writers fragile sleep but there was no one to hear him in the darkonly his fathers silent ashes evidently in the drama enacted that night in that hotel room the cooks ashesat rest in the jar of amos new york steak spicehad been given a nonspeaking part danny awoke with a start the earlymorning light seemed too bright he thought he was already late for his meeting with ketchum but he wasnt danny called carmella in her hotel room he was surprised at how wide awake she sounded as if shed been anticipating his call the bathtub is much too small secondo but i managed somehow carmella told him she was waiting for him in the vast and almost empty dining hall when he went downstairs for breakfast ketchum had been right about visiting in september it was going to be quite a beautiful day in the northeastern united states even as danny and carmella drove away from the balsams at that earlymorning hour the sun was bright the sky a vivid and cloudless blue a few fallen maple leaves dotted akers pond road with reds and yellows danny and carmella had told the resort hotel that they would be staying a second night in dixville notch maybe mr ketchum will join us for dinner tonight carmella said to danny in the car maybe danny answered her he doubted that the balsams was ketchums kind of place the hotel had an oversize appearance an ambience that possibly catered to conventions ketchum wasnt the conventioneer type they quickly came upon the sign that said small engine repairs with an arrow pointing down an innocuous dirt road im at the end of the road was all ketchum had told danny though there was no sign saying this road was a dead end next came the sign that said with the same neat lettering beware of the dog but there was no dogno house or cars either perhaps the sign was preparing them for an eventualitynamely if they continued farther down the road there would almost certainly be a dog but by then it would be too late to warn them i think i know the dog danny said chiefly to reassure carmella his name is hero and hes not really a bad dognot that ive seen the road went on growing narrowertill it was too narrow to turn around of course it could have been the wrong road danny was thinking maybe there still was a lost nation road and the crazy old salesman in the sportinggoods store had deliberately misled them hed definitely been hostile about ketchum but the old logger had always drawn hostility out of even the most normalseeming people looks like a dead end ahead carmella said she put her plump hands on the dashboard as if to ward off a pending collision but the road ended at a clearing one that could have been mistaken for a dumpor perhaps it was a graveyard for abandoned trucks and trailers many of the trucks had been dissected for their parts several outbuildings were scattered throughout the premises one weatherbeaten shack had the appearance of a logcabin smokehouse from which so much smoke seeped through the cracks between the logs that the entire building looked as if it were about to burst into flames a smaller more focused column of smoke rose from a stovepipe atop a trailera former wanigan danny recognized probably a woodstove was in the wanigan danny shut off the car and listened for the dog he had forgotten that hero didnt bark carmella rolled down her window mr ketchum must be cooking something she said sniffing the air from the bearskin stretched taut on a clothesline between two trailers danny assumed that the skinned bear was in the smokehousenot exactly cooking a fella i know butchers my bears for me if i give him some of the meat ketchum had told danny but especially in warm weather i always smoke the bears first from the aroma in the air it was definitely a bear that was smoking danny thought he opened the driversside door cautiouslyon the lookout for hero assuming that the hound might see his designated role as that of guarding the smoking bear but no dog emerged from one of the outbuildings or from behind any of several sheltering piles of wreckage ketchum danny called who wants to know they heard ketchum shout before the door opened to the wanigan with the smoking stovepipe ketchum quickly put the rifle away well you arent as late as you thought you would be he hailed them in a friendly fashion its nice to see you again carmella he told her almost flirtatiously its nice to see you mr ketchum she said come on in and have some coffee ketchum told them bring cookies ashes with you dannyi want to see what youve got them in carmella was curious to see the container too they had to pass the strongsmelling bearskin on the clothesline before entering the wanigan and carmella looked away from the bears severed head it was still attached to the pelt but the head hung nosedown almost touching the ground and a bright globe of blood had bubbled and congealed where the blood had once dripped from the bears nostrils it now resembled a christmas ornament attached to the dead animals nose amos new york steak spice ketchum proudly read aloud holding the jar in one hand well thats a fine choice if you dont mind danny im going to put the ashes in a glass jaryoull see why when we get there no i dont mind danny said he was relieved in fact hed been thinking that he would like to keep the plastic steakspice container ketchum had made coffee the way oldtimers did in the wanigans hed put eggshells water and ground coffee in a roasting pan and had brought it to a boil on top of the woodstove supposedly the eggshells drew the coffee grounds to them you could pour the coffee from a corner of the pan and most of the grounds stayed in the pan with the eggshells the cook had debunked this method but ketchum still made his coffee this way it was strong and he served it with sugar whether you wanted sugar or notstrong and sweet and a little silty like turkish coffee carmella commented she was trying hard not to look around in the wanigan but the amazing though wellorganized clutter was too tempting danny ever the writer preferred to imagine where the fax machine was rather than actually see it yet he couldnt help but notice that the interior of the wanigan was basically a big kitchen in which there was a bed where ketchum presumably sleptsurrounded by guns bows and arrows and a slew of knives danny assumed that there must additionally be a cache of weapons he couldnt see at least a handgun or two for the wanigan had been outfitted as an arsenalas if ketchum lived in expectation that he would one day be attacked almost lost among the rifles and the shotguns where the walker bluetick bear hound must have felt most at home was a canvas dog bed stuffed with cedar chips carmella gasped when she saw hero lying on the dog bed though the bear hounds wounds were more striking than severe his mottled white and bluishgray flank had been raked by the bears claws the bleeding had stopped and the cuts on heros hip were scabbed over but the dog had bled in his bed overnight he looked stiff with pain i didnt realize that hero had lost half an ear ketchum told them there was so much blood yesterday i thought the whole ear was still there it was only when the ear stopped bleeding a bit that i could see it was half gone my goodness carmella started to say shouldnt you take him to a vet danny asked hero isnt friendly to the vet ketchum said well take hero to sixpack on our way to the river pams got some gunk that works good for claw wounds and ive got an antibiotic for the earwhile whats left of it is healing doesnt it serve you right hero ketchum asked the dog i told youyou were too far ahead of me the fool dog got to the bear while i was out of range ketchum explained to carmella the poor creature was all she could say oh hell be fineill just feed him some of the bear meat ketchum told her lets get going he said to danny taking the remington springfield down from two pegs on the wall he lowered the carbine across one forearm and headed for the wanigans door come on hero he called to the hound who rose stiffly from the dog bed and limped after him whats the gun for it looks like you got your bear danny said youll see ketchum told him youre not going to shoot anything are you mr ketchum carmella asked him only if theres a critter in need of shooting ketchum answered her then as if to change the subject ketchum said to danny i dont imagine youve seen a skinned bear without its head in that condition a bear resembles a man not something for you to see i think the logger added quickly to carmella stay ketchum said suddenly to hero and the dog froze alongside carmella who had stopped in her tracks too in the smokehouse the skinned bear was suspended above the smoldering fire pit like a giant bat without a head the bear indeed resembled a hulking mannot that the writer had ever seen a skinned man before kind of takes your breath away doesnt it ketchum said to danny who was speechless they went out of the smokehouse and saw carmella and the bear hound standing transfixed exactly where theyd left themas if only a violent change in the weather would have persuaded the woman and the dog to rethink their positions come on hero ketchum said and carmella dutifully followed the hound to the truckas if the old river driver had also spoken to her ketchum lifted hero putting the injured dog in the back of the pickup youll have to indulge sixpack danny ketchum was saying as they got into the cab of his truckcarmella taking up more than her share of room in the middle pam has something she wants to say to you both ketchum told them sixpacks not a bad person and i suspect she just wants to say shes sorry it was my fault that i couldnt read remember i never blamed pam for telling carl what really happened to injun jane it was the only thing sixpack had over the cowboy and he must have made her use it i never blamed sixpack either danny told him he tried to read carmellas expression which seemed slightly offended but she didnt say anything there was a bad smell in the cab maybe the smell had offended carmella it wont take too long anywaysixpack will have hero to attend to ketchum said to them hero barely tolerates pams dogs when hes not all clawed up this morning could be interesting they drove out the road advertising small engine repairs though danny somehow doubted that this was ketchums sign or that ketchum had ever been in the business of repairing other peoples small engines maybe the logger just fixed his own but danny didnt ask the smell was overpowering it had to be the bear but why had the bear been in the cab we met a guy who knows youa salesman at l l cote danny told ketchum is that so the riverman said was he a nice fella or do i take it that you met the one asshole who works there i believe thats the one we met mr ketchum carmella said the horrible smell traveled with them definitely the bear had been in the cab fat fella always wears camouflagethat asshole ketchum asked thats the one danny said the bear smell almost made him gag he seems to think youre halfindian well i dont know what i amor what the missing half of me is anyway ketchum thundered its fine with me if im halfinjunor threequartersinjun for that matter injuns are all a lost nation which suits me fine too that fella seemed to think your road was no longer called lost nation road danny told the old woodsman i ought to skin that fella and smoke him with my bear ketchum shouted but you know what he asked carmella more flirtatiously what mr ketchum she asked him fearfully that fella wouldnt taste as good as bear ketchum hollered laughing they swerved onto akers pond road and headed to the highway danny held the new glass jar with his dads ashes tightly in his lap the old container now empty was pinched between his feet on the floor of the cab the glass jar was bigger the cooks ashes together with the herbs and spices filled it only twothirds full it was once an applejuice jar danny saw by the label ketchum drove to that wellkept trailer park on route just outside errolthe saw dust alley campground where sixpack pam had a trailer sixpacks home which was no longer mobileit was set on cinder blocks and half surrounded by a vegetable gardenwas actually two trailers that had been joined together a kennel kept the dogs out of the garden and a large hinged door of the kind cats usually use allowed pams dogs free access between the kennel and the trailers ive tried to tell sixpack that a fullgrown fella could come through that fucking dog door though i suspect theres no fella around here who would dare to ketchum said hero had a hostile look about him as ketchum lifted the dog from the back of the pickup dont get your balls crossed ketchum told the hound danny and carmella had not seen sixpack who was kneeling in her garden on her knees she was almost as tall as carmella was standing pam got to her feetunsteadily and with the help of a rake danny only then remembered how big she wasnot fat but bigboned and nearly as tall as ketchum hows your hip ketchum asked her getting up off your knees isnt the best thing for it i suppose my hip is better than your poor dog sixpack told him come here hero she said to the hound who went over to her did you kill the bear all by yourself or did this asshole hunter finally get around to shootin it this asshole bear hound got too far ahead of me when hero got to the bear i wasnt in range ketchum complained again old ketchum aint as fast as he used to be is he hero sixpack said to the dog i shot the damn bear ketchum told her peevishly no shitof course you did pam said if you hadnt shot the damn bear your poor dog would be dead im giving hero an antibiotic for that ear the logger said to sixpack i thought you might put some of that gunk youve got on his claw wounds it aint gunkits sulfa sixpack told him the dogs in the kennel were an overeagerlooking lotmongrels for the most part though there was one that appeared to be close to a purebred german shepherd hero had his eye on that one even with a fence between them im sorry for your business here danny sixpack pam said im sorry for my part in it however long ago it was she added this time looking directly at carmella when she spoke its okay danny said to sixpack there was no preventing it i guess everyone loses people carmella told her i kinda fancied cookie once sixpack said now looking at danny but he wouldnt have nothin to do with me i suppose that was part of what provoked me you had the hots for cookie ketchum asked her high time i heard of it i guess i aint tellin youim tellin him sixpack said pointing at danny i aint sayin im sorry to you either pam told ketchum ketchum kicked the ground with his boot well shit well be back for the dog later this morningor maybe not till this afternoon he said to sixpack it dont matter when you come back pam told him hero will be fine with mei aint plannin on huntin any bears with him ill have some bear meat for you shortly ketchum said sullenly if you dont like it you can always feed those mutts with it ketchum made a sudden gesture to the kennel when he uttered the mutts word and sixpacks dogs commenced barking at him aint it just like you ketchum to get me in trouble with my neighbors pam turned to carmella and danny when she said would you believe hes the only asshole who can be counted upon to drive my dogs crazy i can believe it danny said smiling shut up all of you sixpack yelled at her dogs they stopped barking and slunk away from the fence all but the german shepherd who kept his muzzle pressed against the fence and continued to stare at hero who stared back id keep those two fellas separated if i were you ketchum said to pam pointing to his bear hound and the shepherd like i need you to tell me that sixpack said shit the logger said to her ill be in the truck ketchum told danny stay he said to hero without looking in the hounds direction thus again ketchum managed to make carmella turn to stone old age hadnt been gentle to sixpack who was ketchums age though she was still a scarylooking bleached blonde there was a scar on her upper lipone danny didnt remember in all likelihood the new scar was one the cowboy had given her the writer thought what was wrong with her hip might have been something the deputy had done to her too when the woodsman had shut himself in the cab of his truck and turned the radio on sixpack said to danny and carmella i still love ketchum you know though he dont forgive me muchand he can be an awful asshole when hes judgin you for your faults or for what you cant help about yourself danny could only nod and carmella had been turned to stone there was a momentary silence before pam continued talk to him danny tell him not to do somethin stupid to himselfto his left hand for starters what about ketchums left hand danny asked her ask ketchum about it sixpack said it aint my favorite subject that left hand aint the one he ever touched me with she suddenly cried the old logger rolled down the window on the drivers side of his truck just shut up sixpack and let them leave for christs sake he shouted pams dogs started barking again you already got to say you were sorry didnt you ketchum called to her come on hero sixpack said to the bear hound pam turned and went into the trailer with hero limping stiffly after her it was still only a little after seven in the morning and once danny and carmella had joined ketchum in the truck sixpacks dogs stopped barking there was half a cord of firewood in the bed of the pickup the wood was covered by a durablelooking tarpaulin and ketchum had put his rifle under the tarp anyone following behind the pickup truck wouldnt have seen the old boltaction remington which was hidden in the woodpile there was no hiding the bear smell in the cab however a kris kristofferson song from the seventies was playing on the radio danny had always liked the song and the singersongwriter but not even kris kristofferson on a beautiful morning could distract the writer from the powerful stench in ketchums truck this could be our last good night together we may never pass this way again when ketchum steered the truck south on route with the androscoggin now running parallel to them on the drivers side of the vehicle danny reached across carmellas lap and turned off the radio whats this i hear about your left hand the writer asked the old logger youre not still thinking about cutting it off are you shit danny ketchum said theres not a day that goes by when i dont think about it my goodness mr ketchum carmella started to say but danny wouldnt let her go on why the left hand ketchum danny asked the woodsman youre righthanded arent you shit dannyi promised your dad i would never tell you ketchum said even though i suspect cookie probably forgot all about it danny held the cooks ashes in both hands and shook them what do you say pop danny asked the silent ashes im not hearing dad raise an objection ketchum danny told the logger shiti promised your mom too ketchum shouted danny remembered what injun jane had told him on the night his mother disappeared under the ice ketchum got hold of a cleaver in the cookhouse hed just stood in the kitchen with his left hand on a cutting board holding the cleaver in his right hand dont jane had told the river driver but ketchum kept staring at his left hand on the cutting boardimagining it gone maybe jane had left ketchum there shed needed to take care of danny and his dad later when jane came back to the kitchen ketchum was gone jane had looked everywhere for the loggers left hand shed been sure she was going to find it somewhere i didnt want you or your father finding it shed told young dan sometimes especially when ketchum was drunk danny had seen the way the logger looked at his left hand it was the way the riverman had stared at the cast on his right wrist after angel went under the logs now they drove alongside the androscoggin in silence before danny finally said i dont care what you promised my dad or my mom ketchum what im wondering is if you hated yourselfif you were really taking yourself to task or holding yourself accountablewouldnt you want to cut off your good hand my left hand is my good hand ketchum cried carmella cleared her throat it might have been the awful bear smell without turning her head to look at either of them but speaking instead to the dashboard of the truckor perhaps to the silent radiocarmella said please tell us the story mr ketchum chapter moose dancing it was no surprise to danny that the story of ketchums left hand was not immediately forthcoming by the time the truck passed the pontook reservoirand danny noted the familiar drain age into the fields as they drove down dummer pond roadit was obvious that ketchum had his own agenda the story revealing whatever curious logic had persuaded the old logger to consider his left hand his good one would have to wait danny also noticed that ketchum drove past the former haul road to twisted river are we going to paris for some reason the writer asked west dummer ketchum corrected him or whats left of it does anyone call it west dummer anymore danny asked i do ketchum answered crossing the new bridge over phillips brook they went the way young dan had gone to school when injun jane was driving him long ago it had seemed a neverending trip from twisted river to paris now the time and the road flew by but not the bear smell dont get your balls crossed about it danny but the paris manufacturing company school the actual schoolhouseis still standing ketchum warned him where the young writertobe spent a few of his formative yearsgetting the shit beat out of him for the most part the woodsman explained to carmella who seemed to be struggling with the concept of crossed balls its probable that carmella was simply fighting nausea the combination of the rough surface of the dirt road with the rank smell in the trucks cab must have made her feel sick danny who was definitely nauseated tried to ignore the bear hair drifting at their feet blown about by the air from the open driversside window of the lurching truck even with a stick shift ketchum managed to drive righthanded he stuck his left elbow out the driversside window with the fingers of his left hand making only coincidental contact with the steering wheel ketchum clenched the wheel tightly in his right hand when he needed to shift gears his right hand sought the navelhigh knob on the long bent stick shiftin the area of carmellas knees ketchums left hand tentatively took hold of the steering wheel but for no longer than the second or two that his right was on the gearshift ketchums driving was a fairly fluid process as seemingly natural and unplanned as the way his beard blew in the wind from the open driversside window had the window not been open danny was thinking he and carmella almost certainly would have thrown up why didnt you put the bear in the back of the pickup danny asked ketchum the writer wondered if some essential hunting ritual were the reason for the slain bear riding in the cab of the truck i was in maine remember ketchum said i shot the bear in new hampshire but i had to drive in and out of maine i have new hampshire plates on my truck if the bear had been in the back of my pickup some game warden or a maine state trooper would have stopped me i have a new hampshire hunting license ketchum explained where was hero danny asked hero was in the back of the pickuphe was bleeding all over ketchum said live critters bleed more than dead ones because their hearts are still pumping the old logger told carmella who appeared to be suppressing a gag reflex i just buckled the bear in your seat belt danny and pulled a hat over his ears the beasts head looked like it was stuffed between his shouldersbears dont have much in the way of necksbut i suppose we looked like two bearded fellas out driving around ketchum would have sat up taller in the cab than the dead bear danny realized from a distance the woodsmans beard and long hair were as black as a black bears you had to look closely at ketchum to see the gray through the windshield of ketchums approaching truck especially if youd been passing with any speed probably ketchum and the bear had looked like two young men with heavy beardsyounger than ketchum really was anyway hell i wiped the bear blood off the seat the river driver was saying as the truck pulled into paris i do wonder though how long the critters reek will last bears do smell something awful dont they ketchum dropped the truck down to first gear his rough right hand briefly brushing one of carmellas knees im not trying to feel you up carmella the logger said to her i didnt plan on my stick shift ending up between your legs well put danny in the middle next time danny was looking all around for the steampowered sawmill but he couldnt see it hardwood sawlogs had once been driven down phillips brook to paris the paris manufacturing company of paris maine had made toboggans the writer remembered but where was the old sawmill what had happened to the horse hovel and the tool shops thered been a mess hall and a hostelrya seventyfiveman bunkhouse as danny recalledand what had appeared to be at the time a rather fancylooking house for the mill manager now as ketchum stopped the truck danny saw that only the schoolhouse remained the logging camp was gone what happened to paris danny asked getting out of the truck he could hear phillips brook it sounded just the same west dummer ketchum barked he was striding toward the knoll where the mess hall had been why they waited till ninetysix to take it down i couldnt tell youand they did a pisspoor job of it when they finally got around to the bulldozing the logger yelled he bent down and picked up a rusted pot and pan clanging them together danny followed him leaving carmella behind they bulldozed it the writer asked he could now see sharp shards of metal from the sawmill poking out of the ground like severed bones the horse hovel had collapsed and was left in a pile the seventyfiveman bunkhouse or hostelry had been churned halfunderground with the childlike remains of bunk beds scattered in the lowlying juniper an old washstand stood like a scoopedout skeleton there was an empty circular hole where the washbasin had been there was even the rusted hulk of a steamengine lombard log haulerrolled on its side with its boiler dented by the destructive but ineffectual force of the bulldozer the lombard rose out of a patch of raspberry bushes it resembled the violated carcass of a dinosaur or some other extinct species you want to get rid of a place you should burn it ketchum railed carmella traipsed far behind them pausing to pluck the burrs and the milkweed off her city slacks i wanted you to see this asswipe place first dannyits a fucking disgrace that they couldnt even dispose of it properly they were always dumber than dog shit in west dummer the old logger hollered why is the schoolhouse still standing danny asked given how those west dummer kids had abused him danny would have liked to burn the paris manufacturing company school to the ground i dont know ketchum told him that schoolhouse has some frigging recreational use i suppose i see crosscountry skiers here now and againand snowmobilers all the time of course i hear from those energy assholes that theyre going to put these fucking windmills on the high ridges all around threehundredandfiftyfoothigh turbinesthey have onehundredandfiftyfoot blades theyll build and service them with a thirtytwofootwide gravelsurfaced access roadwhich as any fool knows means theyll have to clear about a seventyfivefootwide path just to build the road these towers will make a whorehouse of noise and throw a shitload of ice theyll have to shut them down when theres too much snow or sleet or freezing fog and after the pisspoor weather has passed and they start the stupid windmills up again the ice that has frozen on the blades will get thrown eight hundred fucking feet the ice comes off in sheets several feet long but less than an inch thick those sheets could slice right through a fella or a whole moose and of course theres the flashing red lights to warn the airplanes away its wicked ironic that these energy assholes are the same sorry bunch of fuckheaded environmentalists who said that river driving wrecked the rivers and the forests or theyre the environmentalists asshole children ketchum suddenly stopped shouting because he could see that carmella was crying she had not progressed very far from the truck either the raspberry bushes had blocked her way or the debris from the bulldozed logging camp had impeded her with the uproar ketchum had been making carmella couldnt have heard phillips brooknor could she see the water the toppled lombard log hauler which was an utter unknown and as such forbiddingly foreign to her appeared to have frightened her please mr ketchum carmella said could we see where my angelù lost his life sure we can carmellai was just showing danny a part of his history the old river driver said gruffly writers have to know their history dont they danny with a sudden wave of his hand the woodsman exploded again the mess hall the mill managers houseall bulldozed and there was a small graveyard around here somewhere they even bulldozed the graveyard i see they left the apple orchard danny said pointing to the scraggly treesuntended for years now for no good reason ketchum said not even looking at the orchard only the deer eat those apples ive killed my fair share of deer here doubtless even the deer were dumber than dog shit in west dummer danny was thinking probably the dumb deer just stood around eating apples waiting to be shot they got back in the truck which ketchum turned around this time danny took the middle seat in the cab straddling the gearshift carmella rolled down the passengerside window gulping the incoming air the truck had sat in the sun unmoving and the morning was warming up the stench from the dead bear was as oppressive as a heavy rank blanket danny held his dads ashes in his lap the writer would have liked to smell his fathers ashes knowing that they smelled like steak spicea possible antidote to the bearbut danny restrained himself on the road between paris and twisted riverat the height of land where phillips brook ran southwest to the ammonoosuc and into the connecticut and where twisted river ran southeast to the pontook and into the androscogginketchum stopped his foulsmelling truck again the woodsman pointed out the window far off to what looked like a long level field perhaps it was a swamp in the spring of the year but it was dry land in septemberwith tall grasses and a few scrub pine and young maple suckers taking root in the flat ground when they used to dam up phillips brook the river driver began this was a pond but they havent dammed up the brook in years there hasnt been a pondnot for a long timethough its still called moosewatch pond when there was a pond the moose would gather here the woodsmen came to watch them now the moose come out at night and they dance where the pond was and those of us who are still alivethere arent manywe come to watch the moose dance they dance danny said they do its some kind of dance ive seen them the old logger said and these moosethe ones who are dancingtheyre too young to remember when there was a pond they just know it somehow the moose look like theyre trying to make the pond come back ketchum told them i come out here some nightsjust to watch them dance sometimes i can talk sixpack into coming with me there were no moose nownot on a bright and sunny september morningbut there was no reason not to believe ketchum danny was thinking your mom was a good dancer dannyas i know you know i suppose the injun told you ketchum added when the old logger drove on all carmella said was my goodnessmoose dancing if i had seen nothing else in my whole lifeonly the moose dancingi would have been happier ketchum told them danny looked at him the loggers tears were soon lost in his beard but danny had seen them here comes the lefthand story the writer predicted the mere mention of dannys mother or her dancing had triggered something in ketchum up close the old rivermans beard was more grizzled than it appeared from farther away danny couldnt take his eyes off him hed thought that ketchum was reaching for the gearshift when the loggers strong right hand grabbed dannys left knee and squeezed it painfully what are you looking at ketchum asked him sharply i wouldnt break a promise i made to your mom or your dad but for the fucking fact that some promises you make in your miserable life contradict some otherslike i also promised rosie that i would love you forever and look after you if there came a day when your dad couldnt like that one ketchum cried his reluctant left hand gripped the steering wheel both harder and for longer than he allowed his left hand to hold the wheel when he was merely shifting gears finally the big right hand released dannys kneeketchum was once more driving righthanded the loggers left elbow pointed out the driversside window as if it were permanently affixed to the trucks cab the nowrelaxed fingers of ketchums left hand only indifferently grazed the steering wheel as he turned onto the old haul road to twisted river immediately the road surface worsened there was little traffic to a ghost town and twisted river wasnt on the way to anywhere else the haul road hadnt been maintained the first pothole the truck hit caused the glovecompartment door to spring open the soothing smell of gun oil washed over them momentarily relieving them from the unrelenting reek of the bear when danny reached to close the door of the glove compartment he saw the contents a big bottle of aspirin and a small handgun in a shoulder holster painkillers both of them ketchum remarked casually as danny closed the glove compartment i wouldnt be caught dead without aspirin and some kind of weapon in the pickups bed nestled together on the woodpile under the tarpalong with the remington springfield danny knew there was also a chainsaw and an ax in a sheath above the sun visor of the truck on the drivers side was a footlong browning knife why are you always armed mr ketchum carmella asked the river driver maybe it was the armed word that caught ketchum offguard because he hadnt been armed that longago night when the logger and the cook and the cooks cousin rosie had started out on the icedosidoing their way on the frozen river right therein the bearstinking truck in the woodsmans wild eyesa vision of rosie must have appeared to ketchum danny noticed that ketchums fierce beard was once more wet with tears i have made mistakes the riverman began his voice sounded choked half strangled not only errors of judgment or simply saying something i couldnt live up to but actual lapses you dont have to tell the story ketchum danny told him but there was no stopping the logger now a loving couple will say things to each otheryou know dannyjust to make each other feel good about a situation even if the situation isnt good or if they shouldnt feel good about it ketchum said a loving couple will make up their own rules as if these madeup rules were as reliable or counted for as much as the rules everyone else tried to live byif you know what i mean not really danny answered the writer saw that the haul road to what had been the town of twisted river was washed outflooded years pastand now the rocky road was overgrown with lichen and swamp moss only the fork in the roada left turn to the cookhousehad endured and ketchum took it my left hand was the one i touched your mom with danny i wouldnt touch her with my right handthe one i had touched and would touch other women with ketchum said stop carmella cried at least she hadnt said my goodness danny thought he knew ketchum wouldnt stop now that he had started that was our first rulei was her lefthanded lover the logger explained in both our minds my left hand was hersit was rosies hand hence my most important hand my good hand it was my more gentle handthe hand least like myself ketchum said it was the hand that had struck fewer blows danny was thinking and ketchums left index finger had never squeezed a trigger i see danny told him please stop carmella begged was she gagging or crying the writer wondered it hadnt occurred to danny that it wasnt the story carmella wanted to stop it was the truck you said there was a lapse so what was the mistake danny asked the old woodsman but they were cresting the hill where the cookhouse had been just thenin the bouncing vomitous truckthere hove into view the deceptively calm river basin and below the basin was the bend in the river where both rosie and angel had been swept away carmella gasped to see the water for danny the shock was to see nothing therenot a board of the cookhouse remainedand as for the view of the town from where the cookhouse had been there was no town the mistake ketchum shouted ill say there was a lapse we were all drunk and hollering when we went out on the ice dannyyou know that much dont you yesjane told me danny said and i said or i thought i said to rosie give me your hand i swear thats what i said to her ketchum declared butbeing drunk and being righthandedi instinctively reached for her with my right hand i had been carrying your father but he wanted to slide around on the ice tooso i put him down ketchum finally stopped the truck carmella opened the passengerside door and vomited in the grass the poor woman kept retching while danny surveyed the crumbled chimney of the cookhouse nothing taller than two or three feet of the bricks was left standing where once the cooks pizza oven had been but your mother knew our rules ketchum continued rosie said not that handthats the wrong hand and she danced away from meshe wouldnt take my hand then your father slipped and fell down and i was pushing him across the iceas if he were a human sledbut i couldnt close the distance between your mom and me i didnt have hold of her hand danny because id reached for her with my right onethe bad one do you see i see danny said but it seems like such a small thing yet the writer could see it vividlyhow the distance between his mom and ketchum had been insurmountable especially when the logs tore downstream from the dummer ponds and onto the ice in the river basin where they quickly picked up speed carmella on her knees appeared to be praying her view of where her beloved angelù had been lost was truly the best in twisted river which was why the cook had wanted the cookhouse erected there dont cut off your left hand ketchum danny told him please dont mr ketchum carmella begged the old woodsman well see was all ketchum would tell them well see in the late fall of the same year hed set fire to twisted river ketchum came back to the site of the cookhouse with a hoe and some grass seed he didnt bother to sow any of it in what had been the town of twisted river but in the area of the cookhouseand everywhere on the hillside above the river basin where the ashes from the fire had settled into the groundketchum hoed the ashes and the earth together and he scattered the grass seed hed picked a day when he knew it was going to rain by the next morning the rain had turned to sleet and all winter long the grass seed lay under the snow there was grass the next spring and now there was a meadow where the cookhouse had been no one had ever mowed the grass which was tall and wavy ketchum took carmella by the arm and they walked down the hill through the tall grass to where the town had been danny followed them carrying his dads ashes andat ketchums insistencethe remington carbine there was nothing left standing in the town of twisted river save the onetime lone sentinel that had stood watch in the muddy lane alongside what had been the dance hallnamely the old steamengine lombard log hauler the fire must have burned so hot that the lombard was permanently blackenedimpervious to rust but not to bird shit yet otherwise perfectly black the strong sled runners were intact but the bulldozertype tracks were gonetaken as a souvenir maybe if not consumed in the fire where the helmsman had satat the front of the lombard perched over the sled runnersthe longuntouched steering wheel looked ready to use had there been a helmsman still alive who knew how to steer it as the cook once predicted the ancient log hauler had outlasted the town ketchum guided carmella closer to the riverbank but even on a dry and sunny september morning they couldnt get within six feet of the waters edge the riverbank was treacherously slippery the ground spongy underfoot they didnt dam up the dummer ponds anymore but the water upstream of the river basin nonetheless ran fasteven in the falland twisted river often overflowed its banks closer to the river danny felt the wind in his face it came off the water in the basin as if blown downstream from the dummer ponds as i suspected ketchum said if we try to scatter cookies ashes in the river we cant get close enough to the water the wind will blow the ashes back in our faces hence the rifle danny asked the woodsman nodded hence the glass jar too ketchum said he took carmellas hand and pointed her index finger for her not quite halfway to the far shore but almost in the middle of the basinthats where i saw your boy slip under the logs the riverman told her i swear to you danny it wasnt more than an arms length from where your mom went through the ice the three of them looked out across the water on the far shore of twisted river they could see a coyote watching them give me the carbine danny ketchum said the coyote took a long delirious drink from the river the animal still watched them but not furtively something was the matter with it please dont shoot it mr ketchum carmella said it must be sick if its out in the daytime and not running away from us the woodsman told her danny handed him the remington springfield the coyote sat on the opposite riverbank watching them with increasing indifference it was almost as if the animal were talking to itself lets not kill anything today mr ketchum carmella said lowering the gun ketchum picked up a rock and threw it into the river in the coyotes direction but the animal didnt flinch it seemed dazed that critter is definitely sick ketchum said the coyote took another long drink from the river now it didnt even watch them look how thirsty it isits dying of something ketchum told them is it the season for shooting coyotes danny asked the old logger its always open season for coyotes ketchum said theyre worse than woodchuckstheyre varmints theyre not good for anything at all theres no bag limit on coyotes you can even hunt them at night from the first of january till the end of march thats how much the state wants to get rid of the critters but carmella wasnt persuaded i dont want to see anything die today she said to ketchum he saw she was blowing kisses across the water either to bless the spot where her angelù had perished or to bestow long life on the coyote make your peace with those ashes danny the woodsman said you know where to throw that jar in the river dont you ive made my peace the writer said he kissed the cooks ashes and the applejuice jar goodbye ready danny asked the shooter just throw it ketchum told him carmella covered her ears with her hands and danny threw the jarto almost midstream in the river basin ketchum leveled the carbine and waited for the jar to bob back to the surface of the water one shot from the remington shattered the applejuice jar effectively scattering dominic baciagalupos ashes in twisted river on the far shore at the sound of the shot the coyote crouched lower to the riverbank but insanely held its ground you miserable fucker ketchum said to the animal if you dont know enough to run youre definitely dying sorry the old logger saidthis was spoken as an aside to carmella it was a smoothworking rifleketchums oldreliable boltaction sucker the woodsman shot the coyote on top of its skull just as the sick animal was bending down to drink again thats what i should have done to carl ketchum told them not looking at carmella i could have done it anytime i should have shot the cowboy down like any varmint im sorry i didnt do it danny its okay ketchum danny said i always understood why you couldnt just kill him but i should have the logger shouted furiously there was nothing but bullshit morality preventing me morality isnt bullshit mr ketchum carmella began to lecture him but when she looked at the dead coyote she stopped whatever else she was going to say the coyote lay still on the riverbank with the tip of its nose touching the running water goodbye pop danny said to the flowing river he turned away from the water and looked up at the grassy hill where the cookhouse had beenwhere hed disastrously mistaken injun jane for a bear when all along shed been his fathers lover goodbye cookie ketchum called out over the water dormi pur carmella sang crossing herself then she abruptly turned her back on the river where angel had gone under the logs i need a head start on you two she told danny and ketchum and she started slowly up the hill through the tall grassnot once looking back what was she singing the woodsman asked the writer it was from an old caruso recording danny remembered quartetto notturno it was calleda lullaby from an opera danny couldnt remember the opera but the lullaby must have been what carmella sang to her angelù when hed been a little boy and she was putting him to bed dormi pur danny repeated for ketchum sleep clean clean ketchum asked meaning sleep tight i guess danny told him shit was all ketchum said kicking the ground shit the logger said again the two men watched carmellas arduous ascent of the hill the tall waving grass was waisthigh to her truncated bearlike body and the wind was behind her off the river the wind blew her hair to both sides of her lowered head when carmella reached the crown of the hill where the cookhouse had been she bowed her head and rested her hands on her knees for just a second or twofor no longer than it took carmella to catch her breathdanny saw in her broad bentover body a ghostly likeness to injun jane it was as if jane had returned to the scene of her death to say goodbye to the cooks ashes ketchum had lifted his face to the sun hed closed his eyes but was moving his feetjust the smallest steps in no apparent direction as if he were walking on floating logs say it again danny the old riverman said sleep tight danny said no noin italian ketchum commanded him the river drivers eyes were still closed and he kept moving his feet danny knew that the veteran logger was just trying to stay afloat dormi pur danny said shit angel ketchum cried i said move your feet angel you have to keep moving your feet oh shit it had been a bitterly confusing morning for sixpack pam who liked to work in her garden earlyeven earlier than she fed the dogs or made coffee for herself and while her hip lasted first ketchum had come and disrupted everything in his inimitable fashion and shed put the sulfa powder on heros woundsall this before she fed her own dear dogs and made the coffee it was because of ketchums willful disruption of her day and treating the wretched dog whod been mauled by a bear that sixpack had turned her television on a little later than usual but she still turned the tv on soon enough pam was thinking that it was partly her own fault after all shed asked to see danny and that italian woman whod been the cooks loverthe injun jane replacement as sixpack thought of carmella pam had wanted to make her peace with them but now she felt conflicted the shock of danny being almost thirty years older than his father had beenthat is when sixpack had last seen the little cookwas upsetting and having made her apologies to danny and carmella pam was only now realizing that it was ketchums forgiveness she wanted that was confusing too moreover treating heros wounds had made her cry as if they were ketchums wounds she was impossibly trying to heal it was exactly at this bewildering momentat the height of her most bitter disappointment or so sixpack imaginedwhen she turned on the tv the world was about to overwhelm her too but sixpack didnt know that when she saw the wreckage caused by the first of the hijacked passenger jets american airlines flight flying out of boston had crashed into the north tower of the world trade center where the plane tore a gaping hole in the building and set it on fire it must have been a small plane someone on television said but sixpack pam didnt think so does that look like a hole a small plane would leave hero sixpack asked the wounded walker bluetick the dog had his eye on sixpacks male german shepherd both dogs were under the kitchen table the stoic bear hound didnt respond to pams question living with ketchum had made hero overfamiliar with being spoken to with ketchum the dog knew that no response was expected pam just kept watching the news about the plane crash on the tv it looked like a bright sunny day in new york city toonot the kind of day a pilot has a visibility problem sixpack was thinking sixpack was regretting that shed ever said she once kinda fancied cookiehadnt that been how shed put it pam could have kicked herself for saying that within ketchums diminished hearing every time she thought their relationship was improving if not exactly back on track it seemed to sixpack that she said the deadwrong thingor that ketchum did shed left a lot of men and had been left by them but busting up with ketchum had hit her the hardesteven when sixpack considered that leaving carl had caused the cowboy to very nearly kill her the deputy sheriff had raped her on a dock at nightat the success pond boat launch afterward a couple who had witnessed it had taken pam to the androscoggin valley hospital in berlin where shed spent a few days recuperating this had led to sixpack getting a job in the hospital which she liked she had a cleaning job most nights while her dogs were sleeping talking to some of the patients made pam feel less sorry for herself printed in small neat letters on her hospital uniform was the word sanitization sixpack doubted that many of the patients ever mistook her for a nurse or a nurses aide but she believed she was nevertheless a comfort to some of themas they were to her sixpack pam knew she would have to have her hip replaced and every time the hip hurt her she thought about the cowboy banging her on the dockhow hed pushed her face against a boat cleat which was what had given her the scar on her upper lipbut the worst of it was shed told ketchum that the woodsman really should kill carl this was the worst because sixpack hadnt known how strongly ketchum believed that he should have killed the cowboy years ago and when the deputy sheriff shot cookie ketchums selfrecriminations never ceased pam was sorry too that shed ever told ketchum what carl had done following that fatal collision on route this was out on the berlingroveton road where the highway ran alongside dead river two teenagers who werent wearing their seat belts had slammed headon into a turkey truck the turkeys were already dead theyd been processed as they say in the turkeyfarming business the truck driver survived but hed suffered a neck injury and had briefly lost consciousness when he came to the driver was facing the two dead teenagers the boy whod been driving was run through by his steering column and the girl who was pinned in the passenger seat had been decapitated carl was the first one from law enforcement on the scene andaccording to the turkeytruck driverthe cowboy had fondled the dead decapitated girl carl claimed that the truck driver was out of his head after all hed snapped his neck and had blacked out and when he came to he was evidently hallucinating but the cowboy had told pam the truth what did it matter that hed played with the headless girls titsshe was dead wasnt she to which ketchum had saidnot for the first or the last timei should just kill that cowboy sixpack now said to hero and her german shepherd you two should stop eyeballin each other that way it was a little after nine in the morningexactly eighteen minutes after the first passenger jet had hit the north towerwhen the second hijacked airliner united airlines flight also flying out of boston crashed into the south tower of the world trade center and exploded both buildings were burning when sixpack said to the assembled dogs tell me that was another small plane and ill ask you what youve been drinkin with your dog food hero tentatively licked some of the sulfa powder on his claw wounds but the taste of it stopped the dog from licking further dont that taste special pam asked the bear hound you lick that off hero ive got more in what appeared to be a calculated non sequitur hero lunged at the german shepherd both dogs were going at it under the kitchen table before sixpack was able to separate them with the water pistol she kept it loaded with dishwasher detergent and lemon juice and she squirted both dogs in their eyesthey hated it but it had hurt pams hip to drop down on all fours and crawl under the kitchen table with the fighting dogs and she was in no mood to listen to president bush who came on television at speaking from sarasota florida sixpack didnt despise george w bush to the degree that ketchum did but she thought the president was a smirking twerp and a dumbeddown daddys boy and she agreed with ketchums assessment that bush would be as worthless as wet crap in even the smallest crisis if a fight broke out between two small dogs for example ketchum claimed that bush would call the fire department and ask them to bring a hose then the president would position himself at a safe distance from the dogfight and wait for the firemen to show up the part pam liked best about this assessment was that ketchum said the president would instantly look selfimportant and would appear to be actively involvedthat is once the firefighters and their hose arrived and provided there was anything remaining of the mess the two dogs might have made of each other in the interim true to this portrait president bush said on tv that the country had suffered an apparent terrorist attack ya think sixpack asked the president on television characteristic of people who lived alone discounting her dogs pam talked back to the people on tvas if like the dogs the people on television could actually hear her by now the federal aviation administration had shut down the new york airports and the port authority of new york and new jersey had ordered all the bridges and tunnels in the new york area closed what are the dumb fuckers waitin for sixpack asked the dogs they should close down all the airports ten minutes later the faa halted all flight operations at us airports it was the first time in the history of the united states that air traffic had been halted nationwide ya see sixpack asked the dogs someone must be listenin to me if not ketchum and definitely not the dogs sixpack had soaked a clean sponge in cold water and was rinsing the dishwasher detergent and lemon juice out of the german shepherds eyes youre next hero pam told the bear hound who watched her and the shepherd impassively three minutes later american airlines flight crashed into the pentagon sending up a towering plume of smoke two minutes after that they evacuated the white house holy shit sixpack said to the dogs its lookin more and more like an apparent terrorist attack dontcha think she was holding heros head in her lap rinsing the dishwasher detergent and lemon juice from the wounded bear hounds eyes when at the south tower of the world trade center collapsed after the tower plummeted into the streets a billowing cloud of dust and debris drifted away from the building people were running through the waves of dust five minutes later a portion of the pentagon collapsedat the same time that united airlines flight which had also been hijacked crashed to the ground in somerset county pennsylvania southeast of pittsburgh i wonder where that one was headed hero sixpack said to the dog the german shepherd had circled around behind pam and hero was anxious that he couldnt see the shepherd the bear hounds nervousness alerted sixpack to her devious shepherds presence she reached quickly behind her and grabbed a handful of fur and skin squeezing as hard as she could until she heard the shepherd yelp and felt the dog twist free of her grip dont you try sneakin up on me sixpack said as the german shepherd slunk out the dog door into the outdoor kennel it was next announced on television that theyd evacuated the united nations buildingand the state and justice departments along with the world bank i see all the important fellas are runnin for cover sixpack said to hero the dog eyed her warily as if he were considering her contradictory behavior in the following manner first she puts the badtasting yellow gunk on my cuts then she squirts me in my eyes with the stingingandburning stuff and lastly she tries to make me feel better not to mention where is that sneakattack fuck of a german shepherd dont get your balls crossed heroi aint goin to hurt you pam told the bear hound but hero regarded her mistrustfully the dog might have preferred his chances with a bear at the faa reported that all inbound transatlantic aircraft entering the united states had been diverted to canada oh thats brilliant sixpack said to the tv i might have begun with that idea a few fuckin months ago like i suppose ya thought that the fellas flyin those first two planes were from boston but the television ignored her four minutes later the north tower of the world trade center collapsed someone said that the tower appeared to peel apart from the top down as if a hand had taken a knife to a tall vegetable if this aint the end of the world its surely the start of somethin close to it sixpack said to the dogs hero was still looking all around for that fuckheaded german shepherd at israel evacuated all its diplomatic missions sixpack thought she should be writing this down ketchum always said that the israelis were the only ones who knew what was what that the israelis were closing down their diplomatic missions meant that the muslim extremists those militant islamists who were determined to wipe out the jews were beginning their religious war by wiping out the united statesbecause without the united states israel would long ago have ceased to exist nobody else in the craven socalled democratic world had the balls to stick up for the israelisor so ketchum also said and sixpack pretty much took what amounted to her politics from the old libertarian logger ketchum admired the israelis and almost nobody else sixpack had often wondered if ketchum was halfinjun and halfjewish because the riverman periodically threatened to move to israel pam had more than once heard ketchum say i might make more beneficial use of myself killing those assholes from hamas and hezbollah instead of picking on the poor deer and bear shortly after eleven that morning the new york city mayor rudolph giuliani urged new yorkers to stay at home the mayor also ordered an evacuation of the area of the city south of canal street by now pam was vexed at ketchum and the two others for spending close to the whole morning scattering the little cooks ashes but knowing ketchum sixpack considered that the logger would have insisted on showing danny what the woodsman called the vandalism that had been done to parisor west dummer as ketchum obdurately called itand either en route to paris or on the way back sixpack knew that ketchum would have paused to deliver a fucking eulogy to the confused heartbreaking moose who danced their scrawny asses off in moosewatch pond pam felt a pang that she had not often accepted ketchums periodic invitations to join him in a middleofthenight visit to see the moose dancing sixpack believed that the moose were just aimlessly millin around it was also with a pang that sixpack regretted that she had not accompanied ketchum on many of his proposed overnight campin trips as she called them to that grassy hill where the cookhouse had been she knew this was hallowed ground to ketchum and that he liked nothing better than to spend the night there ketchum just pitched a tent and slept in a sleeping bag but his snoring kept her awake half the night and pams hip hurt her on the hard ground furthermore ketchum best liked camping at the cookhouse site when the weather had turned colderespecially once there was snow the cold weather made sixpacks hip throb youre the one who keeps putting off the hipreplacement surgery ketchum routinely told her sixpack regretted putting off the surgery too and how could she expect the old river driver to resume their longago relationship if she wouldnt go camping with him when he asked her when shed suggested going to see a movie in berlin instead ketchum had rolled his eyes at her sixpack knew ketchums opinion of movies and berlin he liked to say i would rather stay home and watch hero fart she wanted ketchum to marry her sixpack suddenly realized but how just after noon with ketchum and the other two having been gone the entire morningand pam feeling extremely pissedoff at them and at the rest of the worldthe immigration and naturalization service said that the us borders with canada and mexico were on the highest state of alert but that no decision had been made concerning closing the borders the fanatics arent canadians sixpack shouted meaninglessly at the dogs the terrorists arent mexicans she wailed shed held herself together all morning but sixpack was losing it now hero went out the dog door into the outdoor kennel no doubt thinking his odds were better with the german shepherd than with pam it was no wonder that when ketchum finally arrived with danny and carmella the logger saw his longsuffering hero that fine animal together with pams dogs in the outdoor kennelsixpacks untrustworthy german shepherd among themand took this to mean that sixpack had been neglecting his wounded bear hound pam must be farting away her time watching whatever abomination there is on daytime television was how the evercritical woodsman expressed himself to danny and carmella uhoh danny said to carmella you should be nice to sixpack ketchum danny told the old logger in fact i think you should marry heror try living with her again anyway constipated christ ketchum shouted slamming the door to his truck pams dogs immediately commenced barking but not the stoic hero sixpack came out the trailer door from her kitchen the country is under attack pam screamed bush is flyin around in air force onethe coward must be hidin the israelis have all gone home to defend themselves its the beginnin of the end of the world sixpack shouted at ketchum and all you can do you crotchety asshole is rile up my dogs marry her ketchum said to danny why would i want to live with her can you imagine coming home every day to a deteriorated state of mind like that its all true sixpack wailed come see for yourself ketchumits on television on television ketchum repeated winking at carmellawhich doubtless drove sixpack around the bend naturally if its on tv it must be truer than most things but neither sixpack nor ketchum had thought very much about where they werein an orderly fastidiously neat trailer park in the saw dust alley campground where there were many stayathome women with young children and some retired or unemployed older people both men and women and a few unattended teenagers who were skipping school while their working parents didnt have a clue it was ketchum who clearly didnt have a clue about how many people had overheard him and pam and both ketchum and sixpack were unprepared for the diversity of opinion among the trailerpark residents who had been glued to their television sets all morning given that the walls of their trailers were paperthin and that many of them had been talking with one another in the course of the days unfolding events theyd expressed quite a variety of viewsin regard to what some of them saw as the first installment of the armageddon they were witnessingand now this notoriously belligerent intruder had come into their small community bellowing and the famously loudmouthed ketchum for the former river driver was indeed famous in errol seemed to be unaware of the developing news aint you heard ketchum an old man asked he was stooped almost bent overwearing redandblack wool hunting pants on this warm september daywith his suspenders loosely cupping his bony shoulders and his bare scrawny arms dangling from a white sleeveless undershirt is that you henry the logger asked the old man ketchum had not seen the sawyer since theyd shut down the sawmill in paris years before they had bulldozed it halfunderground henry held up his left hand with the missing thumb and index finger sure its me ketchum the sawyer said its the war in the middle east the war between the muslims and the jewsits started here ketchum henry said it started long ago ketchum told the sawyer whats going on the logger asked sixpack ive been tryin to tell ya sixpack screamed there was a young woman with an infant in her arms its a terrorist attackno airport is safe theyve closed them all down she said to ketchum two teenage boys brothers whod skipped school were barefoot they wore jeans and were shirtless in the midday sun hundreds of people are deadmaybe thousands one said they were jumpin from skyscrapers the other boy said the president is missing a woman with two small children said well thats good news ketchum declared bush aint missinhes just flyin around stayin safe i told ya sixpack said to the logger maybe the jews did itto make us think it was the arabs a young man on crutches said if its your brain thats addled you dont need crutches the old woodsman told him constipated christlet me have a look at the tv ketchum said to sixpack the former river driver now a reader was possibly the only resident of errol who didnt own a television they traipsed into pams kitchennot just ketchum with danny holding carmellas arm but also henry the old sawyer with the stumps instead of a thumb and an index finger and two of the women with young children the young man on crutches had hobbled away outside the teenage boys could be heard by the kennel after exchanging pleasantries with the dogs one of the teenagers said look at the tough bastard with one earhes been in a fight some fight the second boy said it musta been with a cat some cat the first boy said appreciatively on pams kitchen tv the media kept replaying that moment when flight crashed into the south tower of the world trade centerand of course those moments when first the south tower and then the north tower came down how many people were in those towershow many cops and how many firemen were under those buildings when they fell ketchum asked but no one answered him it was too early for those statistics at pm speaking from barksdale air force base in louisiana president bush said that all the appropriate security measures were being takenincluding putting the us military on high alert worldwide well that sure as shit makes us all feel safer ketchum said make no mistake bush said on the tv the united states will hunt down and punish those responsible for these cowardly acts oh boy ketchum said it sounds to me like thats what we should be afraid of next but they attacked us the young woman holding the infant said dont we have to attack them back theyre suicide bombers ketchum said how do you attack them back at president bush left barksdale aboard air force one and flew to another base in nebraska more flyin around sixpack commented how many wars will that shitforbrains start do you imagine ketchum asked them come on ketchumhes the president the sawyer said ketchum reached out and took the old sawyers handthe one with the missing thumb and index finger did you ever make a mistake henry the veteran river driver asked a couple henry answered everyone could see the two stumps well you just wait and see henry ketchum said this asswipe in the white house is the wrong man for the jobyou just wait and see how many mistakes this penisbreath is going to make on this mouse turds watch theres going to be a fucking myriad of mistakes a fuckin what sixpack said she sounded frightened a myriad ketchum shouted an indefinitely large numbercountless danny explained to sixpack sixpack looked sick as if the confidence had been kicked out of her maybe youd like to watch the moose dancin tonight she said to ketchum maybe you and meand danny and carmella toocould go campin its gonna be a pretty night up by the cookhouse and between you and me ketchum we could come up with some extra sleepin bags couldnt we shit ketchum said theres an undeclared war going on and you want to watch the moose dancing not tonight sixpack ketchum told her besides danny and i have some serious issues to discuss i suppose they have a bar and a tv at the balsams out in dixville notch dont they the logger asked danny i want to go home carmella said i want to go back to boston not tonight ketchum said again the terrorists arent going to bomb boston carmella two of the planes flew out of boston if they were going to attack boston they would have done it ill drive you back to boston tomorrow danny told carmella he couldnt look at sixpack who seemed to be in despair leave me the doglet me look after hero pam said to ketchum they dont take dogs at the balsamsand you should stay the night there ketchum cause youll be drinkin just so youre paying ketchum said to danny of course im paying danny said all the dogs had come in the dog door and were huddled in the kitchen thered been no more holleringnot since ketchum had shouted a myriadand the dogs were anxious about so many humans standing around in sixpacks small kitchen without any yelling dont get your balls crossed heroill be back tomorrow ketchum told the bear hound you dont have to work at the hospital tonight the former river driver asked sixpack i can get out of it she told him disinterestedly they like me at the hospital well shiti like you too ketchum told her awkwardly but sixpack didnt say anything shed seen her opportunity pass all pam could do was position her aching body between the two children belonging to one of the young women and that unreliable german shepherd the dog was just plain bonkers sixpack knew that her odds of preventing the shepherd from biting the kids were far better than the possibility that she could ever persuade ketchum to live with her again hed even offered to pay for her hip replacementat that fancy fucking hospital near dartmouthbut pam speculated that ketchums generosity toward her damaged hip had more to do with the loggers infinite regret that hed not killed the cowboy than it served as a testimony to ketchums enduring affection for her everybody out i want my kitchen backeverybody out now sixpack suddenly said she didnt want to break down in front of a bunch of strangers all but one of pams mutts as ketchum called them sidled out the dog door before sixpack could say to them not you but the dogs were used to the everybodyout command and they moved more quickly than the two women with young children or old henry the former sawyer and doubledigit amputee paying no heed to pams command the lunatic german shepherd and hero stood their ground the dogs were engaged in a macho standoff in opposite corners of the kitchen no more trouble from you two pam said to them or ill beat the livin shit out of you but shed already started to cry and her voice lacked its customary firepower the two dogs werent afraid of sixpack anymore the dogs could sense when a fellow creature was defeated the three of them were riding in the bearfouled truck againdanny once more in the middle and carmella as close to the open passengerside window as she could getwhen ketchum turned on the radio in the stinking cab it wasnt yet three oclock in the afternoon but mayor giuliani was having a press conference someone asked the mayor about the number of people killed and giuliani answered i dont think we want to speculate about thatmore than any of us can bear that sounds like a good guess danny said and youre thinking about moving back hereisnt that right ketchum asked danny suddenly didnt i hear you say that there was no real reason for you to stay in canada not anymoreand that you were inclined to come back to your own country werent you recently complaining to me that you didnt really feel like a canadianand after all you were born here you really are an american arent you i suppose so danny answered the writer knew enough to be careful with ketchums line of questioning i was born herei am an american becoming a canadian citizen didnt make me a canadian danny said more assertively well that shows you how stupid i amim just one of those slow fellas who believes what he reads the old riverman said slyly you know danny i may have been a long time learning to read but i read pretty welland quite a lotnowadays what are you driving at ketchum danny asked him i thought you were a writer ketchum told him i read somewhere that you thought nationalism was limiting i believe you said something about all writers being outsiders and that you saw yourself as someone standing on the outside looking in i did say that danny admitted of course it was an interviewthere was a context fuck the context ketchum shouted who cares if you dont feel like a canadian who cares if youre an american if youre a writer you should be an outsideryou should stay on the outside looking in an exile you mean danny said your country is going to the dogsit has been for some time ketchum told him you can see it better and write about it better if you stay in canada i know you can we were attacked mr ketchum carmella said weakly her heart wasnt in the argument are we going to the dogs because we were attacked its what we make out of the attack that counts ketchum told her hows bush going to respond isnt that what matters the old logger asked danny but the writer was no match for ketchums pessimism danny had always underestimated the former river drivers capacity for following things through to their worstpossible conclusion stay in canada ketchum told him if youre living in a foreign country youll see whats true and what isnt true back in the old usa i mean more clearly i know thats what you think danny said the poor people in those towers carmella started to say but she stopped carmella was no match for ketchums pessimism either the three of them were in the bar at the balsams watching the tv at pm when someone on cnn said there were good indications that the saudi militant osama bin laden who was suspected of coordinating the bombings of two us embassies in was involved in the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagonthis was based on new and specific information meaning since the attacks an hour and a half later after ketchum had consumed four beers and three shots of bourbon and when danny was still drinking his third beer cnn reported that us officials said the plane that crashed in pennsylvania could have been headed for one of three possible targets camp david the white house or the us capitol building carmella who was sipping only her second glass of red wine said ill bet on the white house do you really think i should marry sixpack ketchum asked danny just try living with her danny suggested well i did thatonce the old riverman reminded him i cant believe sixpack wanted to fuck cookie ketchum cried then out of consideration for carmella he added sorry the three of them went into the dining room and ate an enormous meal danny kept drinking beer to ketchums disgust but ketchum and carmella went through two bottles of red wine and carmella retired early its been a difficult day for me she told them but i want to thank you mr ketchum for showing me the riverand for everything else carmella was assuming that she wouldnt see ketchum in the morning and she wouldnt even when hed been drinking ketchum was an earlier and earlier riser both gentlemen offered to walk carmella to her hotel room but she wouldnt hear of it she left them in the dining room where ketchum immediately ordered another bottle of red wine im not going to help you drink it danny told him i dont need your help danny ketchum said for a small person which danny was the problem with drinking only beer was that he began to feel full before he felt drunk but danny was determined not to let ketchum tempt him with the red wine danny still imagined that the red wine had played some role in the cowboys murder of his father on the very day the cooks ashes were scattered in twisted river danny didnt want to belittle the memory of that terrible night when carl killed dannys dad and danny gave all three rounds of the gauge to the cowboy youve got to let yourself go danny ketchum was saying be more daring im a beer drinker ketchumno red wine for me danny told him for christs sakei mean as a writer ketchum said as a writer danny asked you keep skirting the darker subjects ketchum told him you have a way of writing around the periphery of things i do danny asked him you do you seem to be dodging the squeamish stuff ketchum told him youve got to stick your nose in the worst of it and imagine everything danny at the time this struck danny as less in the spirit of literary criticism than it appeared to be a direct invitation to spend the night in the cab of ketchums truckor in the smokehouse with the skinned smoking bear what about the bear danny suddenly asked the woodsman wont the fire in the smokehouse go out oh the bear will have smoked enough for nowi can start the fire up again tomorrow ketchum told him impatiently theres one more thingwell okay two things first of all you dont seem to be a city personnot to me i think the country is the place for youi mean as a writer ketchum said more softly secondlythough i would suggest this is more importantyou have no need for the fucking nom de plume anymore as im aware that the very idea of a pen name once affected you adversely i think its time for you to take your own name back daniel always was your dads name for you and ive heard you say danny that daniel baciagalupo is a fine name for a writer youll still be danny to me of course butonce again as a writeryou should be daniel baciagalupo i can guess what my publishers will say to that idea danny said to the logger theyll remind me that danny angel is a famous bestselling author theyre going to tell me ketchum that an unknown writer named daniel baciagalupo wont sell as many books im just telling you whats good for youas a writer ketchum told him almost offhandedly let me see if i understand you correctly the writer said a little peevishly i should rename myself daniel baciagalupo i should live in the country in canada i should let myself gothat is be more daring as a writer danny dutifully recited i think youre catching on the logger told him is there anything else you would recommend danny asked him weve been an empire in decline since i can remember ketchum said bluntly he wasnt kidding we are a lost nation danny stop farting around the two men stared at each other poised over what they were drinkingdanny forcing himself both to keep drinking and to continue looking at ketchum danny loved the old logger so much but ketchum had hurt him ketchum was good at it well i look forward to seeing you for christmas danny said it wont be that long now maybe not this year ketchum told him the writer knew he was risking a blow from ketchums powerful right hand but danny reached for the loggers left hand and held it against the table dontjust dont danny said to him but ketchum easily pulled his hand away just do your job danny the old river driver told him you do your job and ill do mine vi pointe au baril station ontario chapter lost nation for three winters now the writer daniel baciagalupowhod reclaimed the name that the cook and cousin rosie had given himspent the months of january and february and the first two weeks of march on turner island in georgian bay the island still belonged to charlotte the onetime love of dannys life but charlotte and her family had no desire to set foot on the frozen lake or those frigid snowcovered rocks in the heart of the winter when they lived happily in los angeles danny had actually improved the placenot only according to ketchums standards andy grant had taped heated electrical cables to the waste lines that were used during the winter these same pipes were also wrapped with a foil insulation and covered with an iceandwater membrane danny could have had running hot water by applying similar heatline and insulation methods to the water pipe running to the bay but andy would have had to do a lot more worknot to mention move the hotwater heater inside the main cabin to ensure that those pipes wouldnt freeze it was simpler for danny to chop a hole in the ice on the lake and carry the water from the bay in a bucket this amounted to a lot of chopping and carrying butas ketchum would have saidso what there wasnt just the icechopping there was a lot of wood to cut ketchums chainsaw was a big help in the ten weeks danny was there he cut all the wood he would need the following winterwith enough left over for charlotte and her family to use on those summer nights when it was cool enough to have a fire in addition to the woodstove in the main cabin there was a propane fireplace in the bedroom and an electric heater in the bathroomand andy grant had put fiberglass insulation between the floor joists the main cabin was now sustainable for winter weather and there was a second woodstove in dannys writing shack though there was no insulation there the little building was small enough to not need it and danny banked the perimeter walls of the shack with snow which kept the wind from blowing under the building and cooling off the floor every night danny also banked the fire in the woodstove in the main cabin when the writer awoke in the morning it was only necessary for him to put more wood on the fire and fully open the flue then he tramped outside to his writing shack and started a fire in the woodstove there overnight the only concession he made to his ibm typewriter was that he covered it with an electric blanketotherwise the grease would freeze while the writing shack was warming up danny chopped a hole in the ice on the lake and brought a couple of buckets of water up to the main cabin one bucket of water was usually sufficient to flush the toilet for the day a second sufficed for what cooking danny did and for washing the dishes charlotte s oversize bathtub easily held four or five buckets which included the two that had to be heated near to boiling on the stove but danny didnt take a bath until the end of the day he went to work every morning in his writing shack inspired by the view of that windbent pinethe little tree that had once reminded both the writer and ketchum of the cook danny wrote every day until early afternoon he wanted to have a few remaining hours of daylight in which to do his chores there was always more wood to cut and almost every day danny went to town if there wasnt much garbage to haul off the island and he needed only a few groceries danny would make the trip on crosscountry skis he kept the skis and poles and a small haul sled in granddaddys cabin near the back dock that was the unheated possibly haunted cabin ketchum and hero had preferred during their days and nights on the islandthe cabin with the trapdoor in the floor where charlotte s grandfather the wily poacher had likely hidden his illegally slain deer it was a short ski from the back dock of the island across shawanaga bay and then danny took the south shore road into pointe au baril station he wore a harness around his chest there was a ring attached to the harness between dannys shoulder blades where a carabiner held a tow cord to the haul sled of course if there was a lot of garbage to take to town or if he needed to do more extensive shopping in pointe au baril danny would take the snowmobile or the polar airboat andy grant had warned the writer that he would need to have his own snowmobile as well as the airboat there werent many days in the winter months when boating conditions were unfavorable except when the temperature climbed above freezing then the snow sometimes stuck to the bottom of the hull making it difficult for the airboat to slide across the snowcovered ice that was when you had to have a snowmobile but in early january when danny arrived at charlottes island there was usually open water in the main channel out of pointe au baril stationand often floating slabs of ice in the choppy water in the brignall banks narrows early january was when the polar airboat was essentialand only occasionally in midmarch in some years albeit rarely the ice in the bay began to break up that early the airboat could cruise over ice and snow and open watereven over floating chunks of broken icewith ease it could go mph though danny never drove it that fast the airboat had an airplane engine and a single rearmounted propeller it had a heated cabin too and you wore guards to protect your ears from the sound the airboat had been the most expensive element of making turner island habitable for danny during those ten weeks in the coldest part of the winter but andy grant had shared the cost with the writer andy used it as a work boat not only in december when the ice began to form in the bay but from the middle of march till whenever the ice was entirely goneusually by the end of april danny liked to be gone from georgian bay before the start of mud season the ice breaking up in the bay held no attraction for him there wasnt much of a mud season in georgian bay it was all rocks there but for daniel baciagalupo mud season was as much a state of mind as it was a recognizable season in northern new eng land since charlotte s family used the bedroom in the main cabin only sparingly as a guest room danny kept some of his winter clothing in the closet yearroundjust his boots his warmest parka his snow pants and his ski hats naturally charlottes and her familys summer paraphernalia was everywherewith new photographs on the walls every winterbut charlotte had left dannys writing shack as it was shed found a couple of pictures of ketchum with the cook and two or three of joe which she had hung in the shackperhaps to make danny feel welcome there not that she hadnt already done enough to make him feel warmly invited to use the place charlotte s husband the frenchman was evidently the cook in their family because he left notes for danny in the kitchen about any new equipment that was there danny left notes for the frenchman too and they traded presents every yeargadgets for the kitchen and sundry cooking ware the more recently restored sleeping cabinswhere charlotte and her husband and their children slept every summerwere understood to be offlimits to danny in the winter the buildings remained locked the electricity and propane had been turned off and the plumbing drained but every winter danny would at least once peer in the windowsno curtains were necessary on a private family island in shawanaga bay the writer merely wanted to see the new photographs on the walls and to get a look at what new toys and books the kids might have this wasnt really an invasion of charlotte s privacy was it and if only from such a wintry and farremoved perspective charlotte s family looked like a happy one to daniel baciagalupo the notes back and forth with the frenchman had all but replaced charlotte s nowinfrequent phone calls from the west coast and danny still stayed out of toronto at that september time of the year when he knew charlotte and her director husband were in town for the film festival ketchum had advised the writer to live in the country to the veteran river driver danny hadnt seemed like a city person well that the writer spent a mere ten weeks on turner island in georgian bay didnt exactly constitute living in the country though he traveled a lot nowadays danny lived in toronto the rest of the year yetat least from early january till the middle of marchthat lonely island in shawanaga bay and the town of pointe au baril station were extremely isolated as ketchum used to say you notice the birch trees more when theres snow there were not more than two hundred people in pointe au baril in the winter kennedys which was good for groceries and home hardware stayed open most of the week in the winter months there was the haven restaurant out on route where they served alcohol and had a pool table the haven had a fondness for christmas wreaths and they displayed an abundance of santasincluding a bass with a santa claus hat while the most popular food with the snowmobilers were the chicken wings and the onion rings and the french fries danny stuck to the blts and the coleslawwhen he went there at all which was rarely larrys tavern was out on toodanny had stayed there with ketchum on their deerhunting trips in the bayfield and pointe au baril areathough there was already a rumor that larrys would be sold to make room for the new highway they were always widening but for now the shell station was still operating supposedly the shell station was the only place in pointe au baril where you could buy porn magazines not very good ones if you could trust ketchums evaluation it could be forlorn at that time of year and there wasnt a lot to talk about except for the repeated observation that the main channel didnt freeze over for all but a week or two and all winter long both the gossip and the local news provided various gruesome details of the accidents out on there were a lot of accidents on that highway this winter thered already been a fivevehicle pileup at the intersection with go home lake road or near little go home baydanny could never keep the two of them straight to those yearround residents who didnt know he was a famous author daniel baciagalupo was just another outofit american naturally the liquor storeout on across from the bait shopwas always busy as was the pointe au baril nursing station where an ambulance driver had recently stopped danny who was on his snowmobile and told him about the snowmobiler whod gone through the ice in shawanaga bay did he drown danny asked the driver havent found him yet the ambulance driver replied danny thought that maybe they wouldnt find the snowmobiler until the ice broke up sometime in midapril according to this same ambulance driver at the nursing station thered also been a doozy of a headon in honey harbour and an alleged firstrater of a rearend job in the vicinity of port severn rural life in the winter months was rugged snowblurred and alcoholfueled violent and fast those ten weeks that danny lived in the environs of pointe au baril station were a strong dose of rural life maybe it wasnt enough country living to have satisfied ketchum but it was enough for danny it counted as the writers requisite country livingwhether ketchum would have counted it or not in the afterhours restaurant the eighth and final novel by danny angel was published in seven years after baby in the road what danny had predicted to ketchum was largely truenamely his publishers complained that a book by an unknown writer named daniel baciagalupo couldnt possibly sell as many copies as a new novel by danny angel but danny made his publishers understand that in the afterhours restaurant was absolutely the last book he would publish under the angel name and in every interview he repeatedly referred to himself as daniel baciagalupo over and over again he told the story of the circumstances that had forced the nom de plume upon him when hed been a young and beginning writer it had never been a secret that danny angel was a pen name or that the writers real name was daniel baciagalupothe secret had been why the accidental death of the bestselling authors sonnot to mention the violent murder of the writers father and the subsequent shooting of the cooks killerhad been big news danny could have insisted that in the afterhours restaurant be the debut novel by daniel baciagalupo their complaining aside and however reluctantly dannys publishers would have agreed but danny was content to let his next novel it would be his ninth be daniel baciagalupos debut in the afterhours restaurant got a warm reception and mostly good reviewsthe author was often praised for a nowadaysatypical restraint maybe the oftrepeated restraint word was what bothered the writer though it was meant as praise danny would never know what ketchum thought of in the afterhours restaurant but restraint had never been a prominent part of the loggers vocabularynot in the category of admired qualities anyway would danny angels last novel have satisfied the former river drivers demand that danny let himself gothat is be more daring as a writer apparently danny didnt think so you keep skirting the darker subjects ketchum had told him in the case of in the afterhours restaurant would the nightly efforts of the gentle sous chef to teach himself his illustrious fathers trade constitute more of the same writing around the periphery of thingsas ketchum had unkindly put it danny must have thought so otherwise why wouldnt he have proudly put daniel baciagalupos name on the new novel his most subtle work one reviewer had written glowingly about in the afterhours restaurant in ketchums unsubtle vocabulary the subtle word had never been uttered in praise his most symbolic undertaking another critic had commented there was no telling what ketchum might have said about the symbolic word danny knew but the writer didnt doubt what the fearless riverman would have thought symbolism and subtlety and restraint added up to dodging the squeamish stuff which ketchum had already criticized danny for and would the old logger have liked how danny answered the repeated political questions he was asked during the promotional trips he took to publicize in the afterhours restaurant in the novelist was still answering political questionsand there were a few translation trips for in the afterhours restaurant yet to come yes its truei continue to live in canada and will continue to live here danny had said though the reason for my leaving the united states has been as an old friend of my family once put it removed it had been ketchum of course whod used the removed word in reference to the deceased cowboymore than once no its not true that i am politically opposed as you say to living in the us danny had said many times andjust because i live in canada and im a canadian citizeni do not intend to stop writing about americans or about behavior i associate with being an american it could even be argued that living in a foreign countryespecially in canada which is right across the borderenables me to see america more clearly or at least from a slightly less american perspective ketchum would certainly have recognized the writers sources for that answer though the combative woodsman wouldnt necessarily have appreciated how tactful danny usually was in answering those questions regarding the novelists political opposition to his country of birth its too soon to say the writer was always sayingin response to how the attacks of september and president bushs retaliation to those attacks had affected the united states in response to where the wars in afghanistan and iraq were headed in response to whether or not canada would be dragged into a recession or a depression because the us was fast approaching one or both wasnt it from the canadian journalists that was generally the implication it was going on four years since ketchum had called the united states an empire in decline what might the old logger have called the country now in canada the questions danny was asked were increasingly political most recently it had been someone at the toronto star whod asked danny a battery of familiar questions wasnt it true that the united states was hopelessly overextended militarily wasnt the federal government wallowing under massive debt and would the writer care to comment on america s belligerent warmongering nature wasnt the bestselling authors former country as the canadian journalist referred to the united states in decay for how much longer danny wondered would the answers to these and other insinuating questions fall into the toosoontosay category the writer knew that he couldnt get away with that answer forever i am a slow processori mean as a writer danny liked to preface his remarks and im a fiction writermeaning that i wont ever write about the september eleventh attacks though i may use those events when theyre not so current and then only in the context of a story of my own devising the combined evasiveness and vagueness of that cautious manifesto might have elicited from ketchum something along the lines of the embattled woodsmans mountainsofmooseshit expletive after all danny was on record for saying that the us electionthe one bush stole from gorewas indeed a theft how could the writer not comment on the version when bush had beaten john kerry with questionable tactics and for the worst of all reasons in dannys view john kerry had been a hero twicefirst in the war in vietnam later in his protests against it yet kerry was viewed with disfavor by america s bully patriots who were either stupid or stubborn enough to still be defending that misbegotten war what danny had said to the media was that his socalled former country occasionally made him remember and appreciate samuel johnsons oftquoted patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel regrettably that wasnt all danny said in some instances sounding like ketchum the writer had gone on to say that in the case of the us election the scoundrel was not only george w bush it was every dumberthandogshit american voter whod believed that john kerry wasnt patriotic enough to be the us president those remarks would be repeatedespecially that bit about the bully patriots not to mention singling out every dumberthandogshit american voter the novelist daniel baciagalupo had indeed written and published eight novels under the nom de plume of danny angel and danny and his father had fled the united states and come to canadaan act of emigration to evade a madman who wanted to kill them a crazy excop who eventually did kill dannys dadbut the way it appeared to most of the world was that daniel baciagalupo had chosen to stay in canada for political reasons as for danny he was getting tired of denying it also sounding like ketchum was easier danny pretending to be ketchum had commented on a recent poll twice as many americans had expressed more unrestrained loathing at the prospect of gay marriage than theyd registered even mild anxiety about the outcome of the war in iraq bushs regressive gaybashing is reprehensible the writer had said a comment like that further contributed to dannys political reputation sounding like ketchum was very quotable on the refrigerator in his toronto kitchen danny had compiled a list of questions for ketchum but they didnt look like a list they hadnt been assembled in an orderly way there were many small scraps of paper taped to the fridge because danny had dated each note the recorded information on the door of the refrigerator resembled a kind of calendar of how the war in iraq was proceeding soon the fridge would be covered even the most antiamerican of the writers canadian friends found his refrigerator politics a futile and juvenile exercise it was also a waste of scotch tape and the same year in the afterhours restaurant was published danny had gotten in the habit of listening on the radio to a patriotic countrymusic station in the states danny could find the channel only late at night he suspected that the signal was clearest when the wind was blowing north across lake ontario did danny do this to make himself angry at his former country no not at all it was ketchums response to the crappy country music danny wished he could hear the writer longed to hear the old logger say ill tell you whats wrong with dumbshit patriotismits delusional it signifies nothing but the american need to win might not ketchum have said something like that and now with the war in iraq almost two years old wouldnt ketchum also have railed that the majority of americans were so poorly informed that they failed to see that this war was a distraction from the socalled war against terrornot a furtherance of that avowed war danny had no quarrel with seeking out and destroying alqaedaseek out and destroy fucking hamas and hezbollah while youre at it ketchum had thunderedbut saddams iraq had been a secular tyranny did most americans understand the distinction until we went there thered been no alqaeda in iraq had there it didnt take much for danny to be over his head politically he wasnt as sure of himself as ketchum had been danny didnt read as much either what would the raging woodsman from coos county have said about the united states declaring an end to major combat operations in iraq in may less than two months after the war had begun it was tempting to wonder the questions for ketchum on dannys refrigerator may have been a reminder of the wars folly but the writer had to wonder why hed bothered to keep such an overobvious account it served danny no purpose other than to depress him to the separate but similarsounding denials by us secretary of state colin powell and british prime minister tony blairwho swore in may that intelligence about iraq s weapons of mass destruction was neither distorted nor exaggerated in order to justify the attack on iraq danny could imagine ketchum saying show me the weapons fellas at times danny recited the questions for ketchum to the dog even the dog ketchum might have quipped is smart enough to know where this war is headed daniel baciagalupo would be sixtythree this coming mud season he was a man whod lost his only child and his father and he lived alonenot to mention that he was a writer naturally danny would talk and read aloud to the dog as for hero he seemed unsurprised by dannys somewhat eccentric behavior the former bear hound was used to being spoken to it usually beat getting mauled by a bear the dog was of indeterminate age ketchum had been vague about how old this particular hero wasmeaning how many generations were descended from that first fine animal which the current hero represented there were more gray hairs on heros muzzle than danny remembered but the walker blueticks mottledwhite and bluishgray coat made the gray hairs of age harder to distinguish and that hero was lame was not only an indication that the dog was advanced in years the claw wounds from the bearmauling had healed long ago though the scars were very visible and that hip where the bear had clawed hero suffered from some joint damage the mangled mostly missing ear had also healed but the scar tissue was black and furless most disconcerting to anyone encountering hero for the first time was that the veteran bear hound was missing an eyelidon the opposite side of the dogs fierce face from his mangled ear the eyelid was lost in heros last confrontation with sixpacks german shepherd thoughaccording to pamhero had gained the upper hand in the dogs final kennelclearing fight sixpack was forced to put the shepherd down shed never held it against hero however by pams own account the two dogs had always and sincerely hated each other to the writer the battlescarred bear hound was a living replica of coos county where lethal hatreds were generally permitted to run their course as elsewhere danny consideredwhenever he happened to glance at the questions for ketchum on his refrigerator door in january the number of us soldiers killed in iraq since the start of the war had climbed to five hundred hell five hundred is nothingits just getting started danny could imagine the old logger saying well be up to five thousand in just a few more years and some asshole will be telling us that peace and stability are right around the corner what do you think about that hero danny had asked the dog whod pricked up his one ear at the question wouldnt our mutual friend have been entertaining on the subject of this war danny could tell when the dog was really listening or when hero was actually asleep the eye without the eyelid followed you when hero was only pretending to sleep but when the dog was truly dead to the world the pupil and the iris of the constantly open eye traveled somewhere unseen the cloudywhite orb stared blankly the onetime bear hound slept on a zippered dog bed stuffed with cedar chips in the toronto kitchen contrary to dannys earlier opinion ketchums stories of heros farting hadnt been exaggerated on the dog bed heros preferred chew toy was the old sheath for ketchums biggest browning knifethe onefooter that the riverman used to stash over the sun visor on the drivers side of his truck the sheath which had absorbed the sharpening oil from ketchums oilstone knife sharpener was possibly still redolent of the slain bear that had once ridden in the cab of the truck from the way hero seemed neurotically attached to the lightly gnawed sheath danny understandably believed so the footlong browning knife itself proved to be less useful danny had taken the knife to a kitchensupply store where theyd tried unsuccessfully to resharpen it dannys repeated efforts to rid the knife of any residue of ketchums sharpening oil by putting the knife in the dishwasher had dulled the blade now the knife was dull and oily and danny had hung it in a most visible but unreachable part of his toronto kitchen where it resembled a ceremonial sword ketchums guns were another matter danny hadnt wanted themnot in toronto hed given them to andy grant with whom danny went deer hunting every november killing carl had made it easier for danny to shoot deer though hed refused to fire a shotgun never again hed said to andy danny used ketchums remington springfield instead in a wooded area even at reasonably close range it was harder to hit a deer with that prized collectible but the kick of the carbineor the resonance of the shortbarreled rifles discharge in his earwas different from what danny remembered of the gauge andy grant knew the bayfield area like the back of his hand hed hunted there as a boy but for the most part andy took danny deer hunting on what was more familiar terrain for dannythat area west of lost tower lake between paynes road and shawanaga bay in the vicinity of the winter snowmobile portage and sometimes within sight of the back dock on charlotte s island was a natural runwaya virtual game path for deer that way every november danny could look across the gray water at his winter destination there were places on the mainland overlooking shawanaga bay where you could see the back dock on turner islandeven the roof of granddaddys cabin where ketchum had once thrown the skin from that rattlesnake hed shot for those november hunting trips danny always stayed at larrys tavern in the bar was where hed heard the rumor that larrys would one day be sold whenever the new highway advanced that far north who was danny to say as the oldtimers in the bar often did that larrys should be spared neither the tavern nor the motel seemed worth saving to the writer but he couldnt deny that both parts of the roadside establishment had long served a local albeit largely selfdestructive purpose and every winter when danny arrived on charlotte s island andy grant loaned him ketchums remington in case of critters ketchum would have said andy also left a couple of extra loaded cartridge clips with the writer hero invariably recognized the carbine it was one of the few times the bear hound wagged his tail for that boltaction remington springfield had been ketchums gun of choice for bear and doubtless hero was reminded of the thrill of the chaseor of his former master it had taken two years for danny to teach the dog to bark the growling and farting and the snoring in his sleep came naturally to herothat is if the bear hound hadnt learned these indelicate arts from ketchumbut hero had never barked before in his earliest efforts to encourage hero to bark danny would occasionally wonder if the old logger had disapproved of barking there was a little park and playground probably as big as a football field near dannys rosedale residence and adjacent to those two new condominiums on scrivener square whichas luck would have itdid not block the writers view of the clock tower on the summerhill liquor store danny walked hero in the park three or four times a daymore often than not on a leash lest there might happen to be a german shepherd present in the park or some other male dog who could have reminded hero of sixpacks late shepherd in the park danny barked for hero the writer made every effort to bark authentically but hero was unimpressed after a year of this danny wondered if hero somehow didnt think that barking was a weakness in dogs other dogwalkers in the little park were disconcerted by heros leanandmean appearance and by the bear hounds preternatural aloofness from other dogs there were also the scars the stiffhipped limpnot to mention the wonkyeyed baleful stare its only because hero lost an eyelidhes not really giving your dog the evil eye or anything danny would try to reassure the anxious dog owners what happened to that ear a young woman with a brainless breed of spaniel asked the writer oh that was a bear danny admitted a bear and the poor things hipthose terrible scars a nervouslooking man with a schnauzer had asked the same bear danny said it was their second winter on charlotte s island when the barking began danny had parked the polar airboat on the ice off the front dock he was unloading groceries from the boat while hero waited for him on the dock danny tried once more to bark at the dogthe writer had almost given up to both danny and the dogs surprise dannys bark was repeated there was an echo of the bark from the direction of barclay island when hero heard the echo he barked of course there was an echo attending heros bark too the bear hound heard a dog uncannily like himself bark back it had gone on for over an hourhero barking at himself on the dock if ketchum had been there danny thought the former river driver would probably have shot the bear hound what have i created the writer wondered but after a while hero had stopped after that the dog barked normally he barked at snowmobiles and at the onceinawhile airplanelike sound of a distant airboat out in the main channel he barked at the train whistles which the dog could hear from the mainlandand less frequently at the whine of the tires on those big longhaul trucks out on as for intruderswell in those winter weeks there were nonethere was only a nowandagain visit from andy grant hero barked at andy too one could never say that ketchums bear hound was normalor even almost normalbut the barking did much to alleviate the sheer creepiness of heros oneeared gapingeyed face certainly dannys fellow dogwalkers in that little park near scrivener square were less visibly anxious about the bear houndand now that the dog barked he growled less it was a pity that there was nothing danny could do about heros silent farting or his colossal snoring what the writer was realizing was that he hadnt known what owning a dog was like the more danny talked to hero the less the writer was inclined to think about what ketchum would have said about iraq did having a dog make you less political not that danny had ever been truly political hed never been like katie or like ketchum danny did take sides politically he had political opinions but danny wasnt an antiamericanthe writer didnt even feel like an expatriate the world that was captured in the barest outline form on his toronto refrigerator began to seem less and less important to the author that world was increasingly not what daniel baciagalupo wanted to think aboutespecially not as ketchum would have said as a writer thered been an accident on near horseshoe lake road a dipshit driving a hummer had rearended a cattletransport trailer killing himself and a bunch of beef cattle this happened the first winter danny stayed on charlotte s island and hed heard about the accident from his cleaning woman she was a first nation persona young woman with black hair and eyes a pretty face and thick stronglooking hands once a week danny drove the airboat to the shawanaga landing indian reserve that was where he picked her up and where he returned her at the end of the day but she almost certainly didnt live there shawanaga landing was mostly used in the summer months both as a campsite and as a gateway to the bay the residents of the reserve lived in the village of shawanaga though there were a few first nation people who lived yearround in skerryvoreor so andy grant had told danny both areas could be reached by road in the winter months at least on snowmobiles the young cleaning woman seemed to like riding in the polar airboat danny always brought a second pair of ear guards for her and after shed met hero she asked why the bear hound couldnt come along for the ride the airboat is too loud for a dogs earswell for his one ear anyway danny told her i dont know how well hero can hear out of the mangled ear but the cleaning woman had a way with dogs she told danny to put her ear guards on hero when he drove to shawanaga landing to pick her up and when he drove back to turner island without her surprisingly the dog didnt object to wearing them and when the cleaning woman rode in the airboat with hero she held the bear hound in her lap and covered his earseven the mostly missing onewith her big strong hands danny had never seen hero sit in anyones lap before the walker bluetick weighed sixty or seventy pounds the dog devotedly followed the young woman throughout her cleaning chores the same way hero attached himself to danny everywhere on the island when danny was otherwise alone there when danny was using the chainsaw the bear hound maintained a safe distance between them the writer was sure that hero had learned this from ketchum there was an ongoing misunderstanding in regard to where the young first nation person liveddanny never saw anyone waiting for her at shawanaga landing or any kind of vehicle she might have used to get herself to and from the boat landing danny had asked her only once but the young cleaning womans answer struck him as dreamy or facetiousor bothand hed not asked her for clarification ojibway territory shed said danny couldnt tell what the first nation woman had meantmaybe nothing he could have asked andy grant where she was actually fromandy had put him in touch with her in the first placebut danny had let it go ojibway territory was a good enough answer for him and the writer had instantly forgotten the young womans name if hed ever really heard it once early in the first winter she worked for him hed said to her admiringly you are tireless this was in reference to all the icechopping she didand how many full buckets of water she hauled up from the lake and left for him in the main cabin the girl had smiled shed liked the tireless word you may call me thatplease call me that shed told him tireless thats my name the first nation woman had told him thats who i am all right again danny could have asked andy grant for her real name but the woman liked to be called tireless and that was good enough for danny too sometimes from his writing shack he saw tireless paying obeisance to the inuksuk she didnt formally bow to the stone cairn but she respectfully brushed the snow off itand in her submissiveness she demonstrated a kind of deference or homage even hero who stood eerily apart from tireless on these solemn occasions seemed to acknowledge the sacredness of the moment danny worked as well in his writing shack on the one day a week when tireless came to clean as he did when he was alone with hero there the cleaning woman didnt distract him when she was done with her work in the main cabinit didnt matter that on other days danny was used to hero sleeping and farting and snoring in the writing shack while he workedthe writer would look up from his writing and suddenly see tireless standing by that windbent little pine she never touched the crippled tree she just stood beside it like a sentinel with hero standing beside her neither the first nation cleaning woman nor the bear hound ever stared at danny through the window of his writing shack whenever the writer happened to look up and see them next to the weatherbeaten pine both the dog and the young woman had their backs to him they appeared to be scouting the frozen bay then danny would tap the window and both tireless and hero would come inside the writing shack danny would leave the shack and his writing while tireless cleaned up in there which never took her longusually less than the time it took danny to make himself a cup of tea in the main cabin except for andy grantand those repeat oldtimers danny occasionally encountered in the bar at larrys tavern or at the haven restaurant and in the grocery storethe first nation cleaning woman was the only human being danny had any social intercourse with in his winters on the island in georgian bay and danny and hero saw tireless just once a week for the ten weeks that the writer was there one time when danny was in town and he ran into andy grant the writer had told andy how well the young first nation woman was working out hero and i just love her hed said shes awfully easy and pleasant to have around sounds like youre getting ready to marry her andy told the writer andy was kidding of course but dannyif only for a minute or twofound himself seriously considering the idea later back in the airboatbut before he started the engine or put the ear guards on the bear hounddanny asked the dog do i look lonely to you hero i must be a little lonely huh in the kitchen of dannys house on cluny drive particularly as the year advancedthe politics on the writers refrigerator had grown tedious conceivably politics had always been boring and the writer only now had noticed at least the questions for ketchum seemed trivial and childish in comparison to the more personal and detailed story danny was developing in his ninth novel as always he began at the end of the story hed not only written what he believed was the last sentence but danny had a fairly evolved idea of the trajectory of the new novelhis first as daniel baciagalupo danny was slowly but gradually making his way backward through the narrative to where he thought the book should begin that was just the way hed always worked he plotted a story from back to front hence he conceived of the first chapter last by the time danny got to the first sentencemeaning to that actual moment when he wrote the first sentence downoften a couple of years or more had passed but by then he knew the whole story from that first sentence the book flowed forwardor in dannys case back to where hed begun as always too the more deeply danny immersed himself in a novel the more what passed for his politics fell away while the writers political opinions were genuine danny would have been the first to admit that he was mistrustful of all politics wasnt he a novelist in part because he saw the world in a most subjective way and not only was writing fiction the best of what daniel baciagalupo could manage to do writing a novel was truly all he did he was a craftsman not a theorist he was a storyteller not an intellectual yet danny was unavoidably remembering those last two us helicopters that left saigon those poor people clinging to the helicopters skids and the hundreds of desperate south vietnamese who were left behind in the courtyard of the us embassy the writer had no doubt that we would see that or something like that in iraq shades of vietnam danny was thinkingtypical of his age because iraq wasnt exactly another vietnam daniel baciagalupo was such a sixties fella as ketchum had called him there would be no reforming him it was with little conviction that danny spoke to the yawning otherwise unresponsive dog ill bet you a box of dog biscuits heroeverything is going to get a lot worse before anything gets a little better the bear hound didnt even react to the dog biscuits part hero found all politics every bit as boring as danny did it was just the world as usual wasnt it who among them would ever change anything about the way the world worked not a writer certainly hero had as good a chance of changing the world as danny did fortunately danny didnt say this to heronot wanting to offend the noble dog it was a december morning in after the final already forgotten question for ketchum had been taped to the door of dannys refrigerator when lupitathat most loyal and longsuffering mexican cleaning womanfound the writer in his kitchen where danny was actually writing this disturbed lupita whoin her necessary departmentalizing of the householdtook a totalitarian approach to what the various rooms in a working writers house were for lupita was used to if disapproving of the clipboards and the loose ream of typing paper in the gym where there was no typewriter the plethora of postit notes which were everywhere in the house was a further irritation to her but one she had suppressed as for the political questions for mr ketchum stuck to the fridge door lupita read these with everdecreasing interestif at all the tapedup trivia chiefly bothered lupita because it prevented her from wiping down the refrigerator door as she would have liked to do caring as she did for dannys house on cluny drive had been nothing short of a series of heartbreaks for lupita that mr ketchum didnt come to toronto for christmas anymore could make the mexican cleaning woman cry especially in that latedecember time of yearnot to mention that the effort shed had to expend in restoring the late cooks bedroom following that double shooting had come close to killing her naturally the bloodsoaked bed had been taken away and the wallpaper was replaced but lupita had individually wiped clean every bloodspattered snapshot on dominics bulletin boards and shed scrubbed the floor until she thought her knees and the heels of her hands were going to bleed shed persuaded danny to replace the curtains too otherwise the smell of gunpowder would have remained in the murderous bedroom it is worth noting that in this period of dannys life the two women he maintained the most constant contact with were both cleaning women though certainly lupita exerted more influence on the writer than tireless did it was because of lupitas prodding that danny had gotten rid of the couch in his thirdfloor writing room and this was entirely the result of lupita claiming that the imprint of the loathsome deputy sheriffs body was visible to her on that couch i can still see him lying there waiting for you and your dad to fall asleep lupita had said to danny naturally danny disposed of the couchnot that the imprint of the cowboys fat body had ever been visible to daniel baciagalupo but once the mexican cleaning woman claimed to have sighted an imprint of carl on that couch the writer soon found himself imagining it lupita hadnt stopped there it was soon after hero had come to live with him danny was remembering when lupita proposed a more monumental change those bulletin boards with their collected family historythe hundreds of overlapping snapshots the cook had saved and there were hundreds more in dominics desk drawerswell you can imagine what the mexican cleaning woman thought it made no sense lupita had said for those special photos to be on display in a room where they were now unseen they should be in your bedroom mr writer lupita had told danny shed spontaneously taken to calling him that or señor writer danny couldnt recall exactly when this had started and it followed of course that those photographs of charlotte would have to be moved its no longer appropriate lupita had told danny she meant that he shouldnt be sleeping with those nostalgic pictures of charlotte turner who was a married woman with a family of her own without a word of resistance from mr writer lupita had simply taken charge now it made sense the late cooks bedroom served as a second guest room it was rarely used but it was particularly useful if a couple with a child or children were visiting the writer dominics double bed had been replaced with two twins the homage to charlotte in this farremoved guest roomat the opposite end of the hall from dannys bedroomseemed more suitable to what dannys relationship with charlotte had become it made more sense too that danny now slept with those photographs of the cooks immediate and extended familiesincluding some snapshots of the writers dead son joe danny had lupita to thank for this even being possible and lupita was the one who maintained the bulletin boards she chose the new and recycled photographs that she wanted danny to sleep with once or twice a week danny looked closely at the pictures on those bulletin boards just to see what lupita had rearranged occasionally there were small glimpses of charlotte in the snapshotsfor the most part these pictures were of charlotte with joe they had somehow passed lupitas unfathomable radar of approval and there were pictures of ketchum galore of courseeven a few new ones of the woodsman and of dannys young mother with his even younger dad these longsaved shots of cousin rosie had come into dannys possession together with hero and ketchums gunsnot to mention the chainsaw the old photos had been spared any exposure to sunlight pressed flat in the pages of rosies beloved books which had also come into dannys possessionnow that the old logger could no longer read them what a lot of books ketchum had hoarded how many more might he have read that december morning in when lupita caught danny writing in the kitchen he was closing in on a couple of scenes he imagined might be near the beginning of his noveleven actual sentences in some cases he was definitely getting close to the start of the first chapter but exactly where to beginthe very first sentence for examplestill eluded him he was writing in a simple spiral notebook on white lined paper lupita knew that the writer had a stack of such notebooks in his thirdfloor writing room where she felt strongly he should have been writing youre writing in the kitchen the cleaning woman said it was a straightforward declarative sentence but danny detected an edge to it from the critical tone of lupitas remark it was as if shed said youre fornicating in the driveway in broad daylight danny was somewhat taken aback by the mexican cleaning womans meaning im not exactly writing lupita he said defensively im making a few notes to myself about what im going to write whatever youre doing youre doing it in the kitchen lupita insisted yes danny answered her cautiously i suppose i could start upstairslike on the third floor in your writing room where youre not writing the cleaning woman said that would be fine danny told her lupita sighed as if the world were an endless source of pain for herit had been danny knew he tolerated how difficult she could be and for the most part danny accepted lupitas presumed authority the writer knew that one had to be more accepting of the authority of someone whod lost a child as the cleaning woman had and more tolerant of her too but before lupita could leave the kitchento attend to what she clearly considered her outoforder if not altogether wrong first task of the daydanny said to her would you please clean the fridge today lupita just throw everything away the mexican was not easily surprised but lupita stood as if she were in shock recovering herself she opened the door to the fridge which she had cleaned just the other day there was practically nothing in it except when danny was having a dinner party there almost never was no i mean the door danny told her please clean it off entirely throw all those notes away at this point lupitas disapproval turned to worry enfermo she suddenly asked danny her plump brown hand felt the writers forehead to her practiced touch danny didnt feel as if he had a fever no i am not sick lupita danny told the cleaning woman i am merely sick of how ive been distracting myself it was a tough time of year for the writer who was no spring chicken lupita knew christmas was the hardest time for people whod lost family of this the cleaning woman had little doubt she immediately did what danny had asked her to do she actually welcomed the opportunity to interrupt his writing since he was doing it in the wrong place lupita gladly ripped the little scraps of paper off the fridge door the damn scotch tape would take longer she knew digging at the remaining strips with her fingernails she would also scour the door with an antibacterial fluid but she could do that later its not likely that it ever occurred to the cleaning woman that she was throwing away what amounted to dannys obsession with what ketchum would have made of bushs blundering in iraq but she was maybe in dannys mindway in the back somewherethe writer was aware that he was at that moment letting go of at least a little of the anger he felt at his former country ketchum had called america a lost nation but danny didnt know if this was fair to sayor if the accusation was true yet all that mattered to daniel baciagalupo as a writer was that his former country was a lost nation to him since bushs reelection danny had accepted that america was lost to him and that he wasfrom this minute forwardan outsider living in canada till the end of his days while lupita made a fuss over the refrigerator door danny went into the gym and called kiss of the wolf he left a fairly detailed message on the answering machine he said he wanted to make a reservation at the restaurant for every remaining night that kiss of the wolf was openthat is until patrice and silvestro closed for the christmas holiday lupita had been right christmas was always hard for danny first hed lost joe and those christmases in colorado then dannys dad had been blown away and every christmas since that alsomemorable christmas of the writer was reminded of how hed heard about ketchum who was lost to him too danny was not ketchum the writer was not even like ketchum though thered been times when danny had tried to be like the old logger oh how hed tried but that wasnt dannys jobto use the job word as ketchum had meant it dannys job was to be a writer and ketchum had understood that long before danny did youve got to stick your nose in the worst of it and imagine everything danny the veteran river driver had told him daniel baciagalupo was trying if the writer couldnt be ketchum he could at least heroize the logger really how hard was it the writer was thinking to make ketchum a hero well writers should know its sometimes hard work to die danny ketchum had told him when it had taken danny three shots to drop his first deer shit i should have known then what ketchum meant the writer was thinking on that day when lupita was madly cleaning all around him yes he should have chapter ketchum excepted danny did have some glimmer of understanding in regard to what ketchum was up tothis had happened around the time of american thanksgiving in november the writer was having dinner one eveningnaturally at kiss of the wolfand dannys dinner date was his own doctor their relationship wasnt sexual but they had a serious friendship shed been dannys medicalexpert reader for a number of his novels shed once written him a fan letter and theyd begun a correspondencelong before he came to canada now they were close friends the doctors name was erin reilly she was almost dannys agewith two grown children who had children of their ownand not long ago her husband had left her for her receptionist i should have seen it coming erin had told danny philosophically they both kept asking me repeatedlyi mean about a hundred times a dayif i was all right erin had become the friend in his toronto life that armando desimone had been to danny in vermont danny still corresponded with armando but armando and mary didnt come to toronto anymore the drive from vermont was too long and airplane travel had become too inconvenient for people their age and of their disposition the airportsecurity goons have taken every swiss army knife i ever owned armando had complained to danny erin reilly was a real reader and when danny asked her a medical questionwhether this was a concern he had for himself or when he was doing research for a character in a noveldanny appreciated that the doctor gave long detailed answers erin liked to read long detailed novels too that night in kiss of the wolf danny had said to his doctor i have a friend who has a recurrent desire to cut off his left hand his left hand failed him somehow will he bleed to death if he actually does it erin was a gangling heronlike woman with closely cut gray hair and steely hazel eyes she was intensely absorbed in her work and in whatever novel or novels she was readingto a flaw danny knew and maybe the flaw was why he loved her she could be blind to the world around her to an alarming degreethe way with the passage of time the cook had managed to convince himself that the cowboy wasnt really coming after him erin could joke that she should have seen it comingmeaning her husbands involvement with her receptionistbut the fact that theyd both kept asking erin if she was all right was not in dannys opinion what his dear friend erin should have noticed erin had written her husbands viagra prescriptions she had to have known how much of that stuff he was taking but danny loved this about erinher acute innocence which reminded him of everything his father had been blind to which danny had also loved this friend who has a recurrent desire to cut off his left hand dr reilly slowly said is it you danny or is this a character youre writing about neither its an old friend danny told her i would tell you the story erin but its too long even for you danny remembered what he and erin had to eat that night theyd ordered the prawns with coconut milk and green curry broth theyd both had the malpeque oysters with silvestros champagneshallot mignonette to start tell me everything erin hed told her spare me no detail the writer was always saying this to her erin smiled and took a tiny sip of her wine she was in the habit of ordering an expensive bottle of white wine she never drank more than a glass or two donating the remainder of the bottle to patrice who then sold it by the glass for his part patrice every so often paid for erins wine patrice arnaud was dr reillys patient too well danny here goes erin had begun that night in november your friend probably would not bleed to deathnot if he cut his hand off at the wrist with a clean swipe and a sharp blade danny didnt doubt that whatever instrument ketchum might use would be sharpbe it the browning knife an ax or even the old loggers chainsaw but your friend would bleed a lota real spurting mess out of the radial and ulnar arteries which are the two main vessels he would have severed yet this unfortunate friend of yours would have a few problemsthat is if he wanted to die here erin paused at first danny didnt know why does your friend want to die or does he just want to be rid of the hand the doctor asked him i dont know danny answered her i always thought it was just about the hand well then he may get what he wants erin said you see the arteries are very elastic after they were cut they would retract back into the arm where the surrounding tissues would compress them at least to a degree the muscles in the arterial walls would immediately contract narrowing the diameter of the arteries and slowing the blood loss our bodies are resourceful at trying to stay alive your friend would have many mechanisms coming into play all making an effort to save him from bleeding to death here erin paused again whats wrong she asked danny daniel baciagalupo was still thinking about whether or not ketchum wanted to kill himself over all those years with the incessant talk about the left hand it hadnt occurred to the writer that ketchum might have been harboring more serious intentions are you feeling sick or something dr reilly asked danny no its not that danny said so he wouldnt bleed to deaththats what youre saying the platelets would save him erin answered platelets are tiny blood particles which arent even large enough to be real cells theyre actually flakes that fall off a cell and then circulate in the bloodstream under normal circumstances platelets are tiny smoothwalled nonadherent flecks but when your friend cuts off his hand he exposes the endothelium or inner arterial wall which would cause a spill of a protein called collagenthe same stuff plastic surgeons use when the platelets encounter the exposed collagen they undergo a drastic transformationa metamorphosis the platelets become sticky spiculated particles they aggregate and adhere to one anotherthey form a plug like a clot danny asked his voice sounded funny he couldnt eat because he couldnt swallow he was somehow certain that ketchum intended to kill himself cutting off his left hand was just the loggers way of doing it and of course ketchum held his left hand responsible for letting rosie slip away but rosie had been gone for years danny realized that ketchum must have been holding himself accountable for not killing carl for his friend dominics death ketchum faulted himselfmeaning all of himself ketchums left hand couldnt be blamed for the cowboy killing the cook too much detail while youre eating erin asked ill stop the clotting comes a little later there are a couple of other proteins involved suffice it to say there is an arteryplugging clot this would stem the tide of your friends bleeding and save his life cutting off your hand wont kill you but danny felt that he was drowning he was sinking fast well writers should know its sometimes hard work to die danny the old logger had told him okay erin danny said but his voice wasnt his own neither he nor erin recognized it lets say that my friend wanted to die lets assume that he wants to cut off his left hand in the process but what he really wants is to die what then the doctor was eating ravenously she had to chew and swallow for a few seconds while danny waited easy erin said after another small sip of wine does your friend know what aspirin is he just takes some aspirin aspirin danny repeated numbly he could see the contents of the glove compartment in ketchums truck as if the door were still open and danny had never reached out and closed itthe small handgun and the big bottle of aspirin painkillers both of them ketchum had called them casually i wouldnt be caught dead without aspirin and some kind of weapon hed said aspirin blocks certain parts of the process that activates the platelets dr reilly was saying if you wanted to get technical you could say that aspirin prevents blood from clottingonly two aspirin tablets in your friends system and very possibly the clotting wouldnt kick in quickly enough to save him and if he really wanted to die he could wash the aspirin down with some booze through a completely different mechanism alcohol also prevents platelet activation and aggregation there would be a real synergy between the alcohol and the aspirin rendering the platelets impotentthey wouldnt stick to one another no clot in other words your handdeprived friend would die erin finally stopped talking when she saw that danny was staring at his food not eating its also worth noting that daniel baciaglupo had hardly touched his beer danny his doctor said i didnt know he was a real friend i thought that he was probably a character in a novel and you were using the friend word loosely im sorry danny had run home from kiss of the wolf that november night hed wanted to call ketchum right away but privately it was a cold night in toronto that late in the fall it would have already snowed a bunch of times in coos county new hampshire ketchum didnt fax much anymore he didnt call danny very frequently eithernot nearly as often as danny called him that night the phone had rung and rung thered been no answer danny would have called sixpack but he didnt have her phone number and hed never known her last nameno more than he knew ketchums first name if the old logger had ever had one he decided to fax ketchum some evidently transparent bullshitto the effect that danny thought he should have sixpacks phone number in case there was ever an emergency and danny couldnt reach ketchum i dont need anybody checking up on me ketchum had faxed back before danny was awake and downstairs in the morning but after a few more faxes and an awkward phone conversation ketchum provided danny with pams number it was december of that same year before danny got up the nerve to call sixpack and she wasnt much of a communicator on the phone yes she and ketchum had gone a couple of times that fall to moosewatch pond and seen the moose dancingor millin around as sixpack said yes shed gone campin with ketchum toobut only once in a snowstorm and if her hip hadnt kept her awake the whole night ketchums snoring would have nor did danny have any luck in persuading ketchum to come to toronto for christmas that year i may show up i more likely wont was how ketchum had left itas independent as ever all too soon it was that time of year daniel baciagalupo had learned to dreadjust a few days before christmas coming up on what would be the first anniversary of his dads murderand the writer was eating dinner alone at kiss of the wolf his thoughts were unfocused wandering when patricethat eversuave and graceful presenceapproached dannys table someone has come to see you daniel patrice said with unusual solemnity but strangely at the kitchen door to see me in the kitchen danny asked a tall stronglooking person patrice intoned with an air of foreboding doesnt look like a big readermight not be what you call a fan but why the kitchen door danny asked she said she didnt think she was wellenough dressed to come in the front door patrice told the writer she danny said how he hoped it was lady sky i had to look twice to be sure patrice said with a shrug but shes definitely a she in that crowns lane alleyway behind the restaurant oneeyed pedro had spotted the tall woman hed graciously shown her to the service entrance to the kitchen the former ramsay farnham had said to sixpack pam even if its not on the menu they often have cassoulet at this time of yeari recommend it i aint lookin for a handout sixpack told him im lookin for a fella name of dannya famous writer danny doesnt work in the kitchenhis dad did oneeyed pedro told her i know thatim just a backdoor kinda person pam said its a fuckin fancylookin place the former ramsay farnham appeared momentarily disdainful he must have suffered a flashback to his previous life its not that fancy he said in addition to whatever snobbishness was in his genes ramsay still resented his favorite restaurants change of name though no one had ever seen it kiss of the wolf would always be a porn film to oneeyed pedro there were other homeless people in the alleyway sixpack could see them but they kept their distance from her it was perhaps fair to say that oneeyed pedro was only a halfhomeless person the others in the alley were wary of pam sixpacks rough northwoods attire notwithstanding she didnt look like a homeless person even oneeyed pedro could see the difference he knocked at the service entrance to kiss of the wolf and joyceone of the female sous chefsopened the door before joyce could greet him pedro pushed sixpack ahead of him into the kitchen shes looking for danny oneeyed pedro said dont worryshes not one of us i know danny and he knows me sixpack quickly said to joyce i aint some kinda groupie or anythin like that at the time pam was eightyfour its not likely that joyce mistook her for a groupienot even a writers groupie kristine ran to get patrice while joyce and silvestro welcomed sixpack inside by the time patrice brought danny back to the kitchen silvestro had already persuaded pam to try the duo of foie gras and duck confit with a glass of champagne when danny saw sixpack his heart sank sixpack pam was no lady sky and danny guessed that something had to be wrong is ketchum with you the writer asked her but danny already knew that ketchum would have come in the front doorno matter how the old woodsman was dressed dont get me started dannynot here and not till ive had somethin to eat and drink sixpack said shit i was drivin all day with that fartin dogwe only stopped to pee and gas up the truck ketchum said i should have the lamb chops thats what sixpack had they ate together at dannys usual table by the window pam ate the lamb chops holding them in her fingers with her napkin tucked into the open neck of one of ketchums flannel shirts when she was done eating she wiped her hands on her jeans sixpack drank a couple of steam whistles on tap and a bottle of red wine she ordered the cheese plate in lieu of dessert ketchum had given her very detailed directions to dannys house warning her that if she arrived near dinnertime she would probably find danny at kiss of the wolf the logger had also provided sixpack with directions to the restaurant but when she looked inside kiss of the wolfsixpack was tall enough to peer over the frostedglass part of the large window facing yonge streetsome of those overdressed types among the restaurants rosedale clientele must have discouraged her from just walking in shed gone searching for a rear entrance instead that rosedale crowd can be snootylooking i put heros dog bed in the kitchenhes used to sleepin in kitchens pam said ketchum told me to let myself in cause you never lock the place nice house i put my stuff in the bedroom farthest away from yoursthe one with all them pictures of that pretty lady that way if i have one of my nightmares i might not wake you up heros here danny asked her ketchum said you should have a dog but i aint givin you one of mine sixpack said hero aint the friendliest critter to other dogsmy dogs sure as shit wont miss him you drove all this way to bring me hero danny asked of course the writer understood that there was probably more purpose to sixpacks visit than bringing him the bear hound ketchum said i was to see you in person no phone call not a letter or a faxnone of that chickenshit stuff sixpack told him ketchum musta meant it seriously cause he put everythin in writin besides theres other crap he wanted you to haveit was all in his truck you brought ketchums truck danny asked her the truck aint for youim drivin it back pam said you wouldnt want it for city drivin dannyyou wouldnt want it anyway cause it still smells like a bear took a shit in it wheres ketchum what happened the writer asked her we should go walk the dog or somethin sixpack suggested someplace more private you mean danny asked christ danny theres people here with their noses born outta joint sixpack said kiss of the wolf was crowded that night since the name change and patrices backtobistro renovation the restaurant was packed most nights some nights danny thought the tables were too close together as the writer and sixpack pam were leaving pam appeared to be favoring her bad hip but danny soon realized that shed meant to lean on the adjacent table where a couple had been staring at them throughout their dinner because he was famous danny was used toalmost oblivious topeople staring at him but pam apparently hadnt taken kindly to it she upset the wineglasses and water on the couples table suddenly seeming to catch her balance sixpack struck the seated gentleman in his face with her forearm to the surprised woman at the wrecked table sixpack said thats cause he was gawkin at meas if my tits were showin or somethin both a waiter and a busboy rushed to the ruined table to make amends while patrice smoothly glided up to danny embracing the writer at the door another memorable eveningmost memorable daniel patrice whispered in dannys ear im just a backdoor kinda person sixpack said humbly to kiss of the wolfs owner and maître d once they were out on yonge street and while they were waiting for the crossing light to change danny said to sixpack just tell me for christs sake tell me everything spare me no detail lets see how heros doin danny sixpack said im still rehearsin what i gotta say as you might imagine ketchum left me with a shitload of instructions as it had turned out ketchum put several pages of instructions in an envelope in the glove compartment of his truck the door to the glove compartment had been left open purposely so that pam couldnt miss seeing the envelope which was pinned under ketchums handgun a better paperweight bein unavailable at that time as sixpack said now danny saw that ketchums truck was parked in the driveway of the cluny drive house as if the former riverman had changed his mind about coming for christmas appearing to guard his dog bed hero growled at thema surly greeting pam had already put the sheath for ketchums footlong browning knife in the bear hounds bed maybe it served as a pacifier the writer considered hed spotted the long browning knife on the kitchen countertop and had quickly looked away from the big blade the dogs farting had filled the kitchenpossibly the entire downstairs of the house god whats wrong with heros eye danny asked pam no eyelid ill tell ya later just try not to make him feel selfconscious about it sixpack said danny saw that shed put ketchums favorite chainsaw in the gym what am i going to do with a chainsaw the writer asked her ketchum said you should have it sixpack told him perhaps to change the subject she said if i had to guess hero has to take a crap they walked hero in the park christmas lights twinkled in the neighborhood surrounding them they brought the dog back to the kitchen where danny and sixpack sat at the kitchen table the bear hound sat at what seemed a purposeful distance just watching them pam had poured herself some whiskey in a shot glass i know you know what im gonna tell ya dannyyou just dont know the how of it she began i see the story startin with your motherall because ketchum was fuckin your mom instead of learnin ta read aint that right sixpack said so anywayheres the endin later when they unloaded the truck together danny was grateful that sixpack had postponed telling him the story shed given him time to prepare himself for it and while hed been waiting to hear what had happened to ketchum danny had already imagined a few of the detailsthe way writers do danny knew that ketchum would have wanted to see the moose dancing one last time and that this time the old woodsman wouldnt have invited sixpack to come with him as it had snowed that day and the snow had stoppedquite a cold night well below freezing was expectedketchum had said to sixpack that he knew her hip wasnt up to camping out at the cookhouse site but that maybe she would like to join him there for an outdoor breakfast the next morning kind of a cold spot for breakfast aint it shed asked him after all it was past middecembercoming up on the longest night of the year twisted river rarely froze over until january but what was ketchum thinking yet as pam explained to danny theyd had breakfast together at the cookhouse site before ketchum always enjoyed making a fire he would set some coals aside and brew the coffee the way he liked itin the roasting pan with the coffee grounds and eggshells in the snow he melted for the water he would grill a couple of venison steaks and poach three or four eggs on the fire sixpack had agreed to meet him there for breakfast but the plan didnt add up and pam knew it sixpack had taken a look in ketchums pickup there was no tent and no sleeping bag if the veteran river driver was camping out he must have been planning on freezing to deathor else he was intending to sleep in the cab of his truck with the motor running furthermore ketchum had left hero with pam i think the cold kind of gets to heros hip too hed told her first i heard of it as sixpack said to danny and when shed shown up at the cookhouse site the next morning sixpack knew right away that there was no outdoor breakfast in ketchums plan the coffee wasnt brewing nothing was cooking there was no fire she spotted ketchum sitting with his back against the remains of the crumbled brick chimney as if the logger might have imagined that the cookhouse was still standingthe burnedtotheground building somehow warm and cozy all around him hero had run to his master but the dog stopped short of where ketchum sat on the snowcovered ground pam saw that the bear hounds hackles were up and the dog suddenly walked stifflegged circling the old logger ketchum sixpack had called but thered been no response from the woodsman only hero had turned his head to look at her i couldnt walk over to himnot for the longest time sixpack told danny i could tell he was a fuckin goner because it had snowed the previous day and the snow had stopped before nightfall it was easy for pam to see how hed done it there was a trail of blood in the fresh snow sixpack followed the blood down the hill to the riverbank there were some big stumps above the bank and she saw where ketchum had wiped the snow off one of them the warm blood had seeped into the stump and ketchums ax was stuck so firmly in the stump that pam couldnt pull it out there was no left hand to be found obviously ketchum had thrown it in the river having seen the spot in the river basin where ketchum shot the applejuice jar containing the cooks ashes danny had no trouble imagining exactly where ketchum had thrown his left hand but it must have been hard work for the old woodsman to walk back up the hill to the site of the cookhouse from all the blood pam saw in the snow she knew ketchum must have been bleeding profusely once when they was still drivin hardwoods on phillips brook sixpack told danny i seen ketchum stealin some firewood for himself you know he was just pickin some pulpwood outta the pilethem fourfoot smalldiameter logs didnt amount to much but i seen ketchum turn half a cord of pulpwood into kindlin in less than half an hour that way no one would recognize the stuffif they spotted the wood in his truck sometime later ketchum just choked up on the handle of his axhe held it in one hand you know like a hatchetand he split them logs lengthwise and then split em again till they was skinny enough so he could chop them fourfoot logs inta twofoot sticks of fuckin kindlin i never seen him swing that ax he was so strong danny and so accuratehe just wielded that ax with one hand like it was a fuckin hammer those paris manufacturin company clowns never knew why their pulpwood was disappearin ketchum said the assholes were too busy makin toboggans in mainethats where they were truckin most of their hardwoods them paris peckerheads never noticed where their pulpwood was goin yes ketchum could split a fourfoot hardwood log onehanded danny had seen how the woodsman could wield an ax both as an ax and as a hatchet and after ketchum had cut off his hand the old river driver was still strong enough to walk up the hill where hed sat down to rest his back against all that was left of the cookhouse chimney thered been a bottle of whiskey beside him sixpack said she told danny that ketchum had managed to drink most of it anything else danny asked sixpack i meanon the ground beside him yeaha big bottle of aspirin pam told the writer there were still plenty of aspirin left in the bottle sixpack said ketchum wasnt much of a painkiller person but i suppose he took some aspirin for the painhe musta just washed em down with the whiskey as danny knew the aspirin hadnt been for the pain knowing ketchum danny believed that the old riverman had probably relished the pain the whiskey wasnt for the pain either both the aspirin and the whiskey the writer knew were strictly to keep ketchum bleeding the logger had little forgiveness for anyone who had a job to do and did a pisspoor job of it only ketchum could kill ketchum right ketchum couldnt forgive himself for failin to keep cookie alive sixpack told the writer and before thatafter your boy died dannyketchum felt he was powerless to protect you all he could do was obsess about your writin me too the writer said to sixpack me too sixpack didnt stay for christmas after theyd carried ketchums guns up to dannys bedroom on the second floorpam insisted that all the guns be stowed under dannys bed because this was what ketchum had wantedand once theyd lugged the boxes of rosies books up to dannys thirdfloor writing room sixpack warned the writer that she was an early riser how early he asked her ketchums truck and sixpack pam were gone when danny woke up in the morning shed made coffee for him and had left him a letter which shed written by hand on several pages of the typing paper he kept in the gym sixpacks handwriting was very familiar to danny from those years when shed written ketchums letters for the thenilliterate logger but danny had forgotten how well pam wrotefar better than she spoke even her spelling was correct the writer wondered if this was the result of all the readingaloud shed once done to ketchum naturally sixpacks letter included instructions for taking care of hero but most of her letter was more personal than danny had expected she was having the hipreplacement surgery at dartmouthhitchcock hospital as ketchum had recommended shed made a few new friends at the saw dust alley campground that nicelooking trailer park on route the attacks of september had served to introduce her to many of her neighbors henry the old west dummer sawyer with the missing thumb and index finger would look after pams dogs while she was having the surgery henry had volunteered to look after the dogs while sixpack was driving ketchums truck to toronto and back too sixpack had also made some longstanding friendships at the androscoggin valley hospital in berlin where she still worked nights as a cleaning person shed called her friends at the hospital when she found ketchums body at the cookhouse site sixpack wanted danny to know that shed sat with ketchum for the better part of that morning just holding his one remaining hand the right onethe only one he ever touched me with as sixpack put it in her letter pam told danny he would find some photographs pressed flat in the books that had once belonged to dannys mother it had been hard for sixpack not to burn the pictures of rosie though pam did more than put her jealousy aside sixpack admitted that she now believed ketchum had loved the cook even more than the logger had once loved rosie sixpack could live with thatthe lefthand business notwithstanding besides sixpack said ketchum had wanted danny to have those photos of the writers mother i know its none of my business pam also wrote to danny but if i were you i would write and sleep in that thirdfloor room it is peaceful up there in my opinionand its the best room in the house butdont get your balls crossed about this dannyi suspect you are well acquainted with more than your fair share of ghosts i suppose its one thing to work in a room with a ghost but quite another matter to sleep in the same room with one i wouldnt knowi never had children on purpose my philosophy was always to do without those things i didnt dare to loseketchum excepted danny wrote the ketchum excepted words on a scrap of typing paper and taped it to one of his outdated typewritersanother ibm selectric ii the one he was currently using in that thirdfloor room he shared with joes ghost the writer liked the phrase ketchum excepted maybe he could use it all that had happened three years ago and counting the only reason danny hadnt thrown out his relic of a fax machine which was still in the kitchen of that house on cluny drive was that sixpack occasionally faxed him and he faxed her pam must have been eightyeight or eightyninethe same age ketchum would have been if the old logger were still aliveand her messages via the fax machine had lost what literary pizazz shed once demonstrated as a letter writer sixpack had grown more terse in her old age when there was something shed read or had seen in the news on tvand provided the item was in the dumberthandogshit category of human stupiditiessixpack would fax danny pam unflinchingly stated what ketchum would have said about this or that and danny never hesitated to fax her back with the writers version of the river drivers vernacular it was not necessarily what ketchum might have said about the war in iraq or the neverending mess in the middle east that particularly interested danny or sixpack it was what ketchum would have said about anything it was the old loggers voice that danny and sixpack wanted to hear thus we try to keep our heroes alive hence we remember them the midfebruary storm had blown across lake huron from western canada but when the wind and snow hit the georgian bay islands the wind shifted and the snow just kept falling the wind now blew from a southerly direction from parry sound to shawanaga bay from his writing shack danny could no longer see where the bay ended and the mainland began because of the whiteout from the storm the fir trees on what danny knew was the mainland appeared as a mirage of a floating forestor the trees seemed to be growing out of the frozen bay the wind whipped little spirals of snow skyward these twisters looked like small tornadoes of snow sometimes when the wind blew northward along the length of shawanaga bay there were actual tornadoesnot unlike the kind you see in the american midwest or on the canadian prairies danny knew andy grant had warned the writer to watch out for them tireless had called danny on his cell phone she didnt want to be an island cleaning woman today it wasnt a good idea to be out in the polar airboat not when the visibility was this bad in a similar storm only a few years ago tireless told danny some buttbrained oaf from ohio had run his airboat aground on the oconnor rocksjust a little northwest of moonlight bay danny had to come that way in order to pick tireless up at the shawanaga landing indian reserve what happened to himthe buttbrained oaf from ohio danny asked her they found the poor fool frozenstiff as a stick tireless told him ill come get you tomorrow or the next daywhenever the storms over danny said ill call you or you call me kiss hero for me she said i dont kiss hero a lot danny told tireless at least im not inclined to well you should kiss him more the first nation woman said i think hero would be nicer to you if you kissed him a lot all morning in the writing shack hero had been farting up a stormthe near equal of the snowstorm danny was watching out his window it was a morning when the writer wasnt tempted to make his relationship with the bear hound a closer one jesus hero danny had exclaimed several times in the course of the foulsmelling morning but it was unfit weather for the walker bluetick to be put outside and despite the dogs unrelenting flatulence the writing had been going well danny was definitely getting closer to the start of his first chapter certain sentences now came to him whole intact even the punctuation seemed permanent when two such sentences were born consecutively one emerging immediately after the other the writer felt especially riveted to his task hed written the first twosome of the morning on a piece of typing paper and had thumbtacked the page to the rough pineboard wall of his writing shack danny kept looking at the sentences rereading them as for the river it just kept moving as rivers doas rivers do under the logs the body of the young canadian moved with the river which jostled him to and froto and fro danny liked the repetition he knew this was firstchapter material but the passage belonged at the end of the chapterit definitely didnt sound like a beginning danny had circled the under the logs phrase which the writer thought wouldnt be a bad chapter title yet much of the focus of the first chapter seemed to be on the cook the focus really wasnt on the boy whod slipped under the logs you could not say the past or the future in the cooks presence without making him frown daniel baciagalupo wrote there were other isolated sentences about this young cook they were like landmarks or signposts for danny helping to orient the writer as he plotted his first chapter another sentence was in the cooks opinion there were not enough bends in twisted river to account for the rivers name there would be much more about the cook of course it kept coming the cook could see that the river driver with the broken wrist had come ashore carrying his pike pole in his good hand danny wrote the cook would be a major pointofview character in the first chapter the writer imaginedas danny also imagined the cooks twelveyearold son would be the cook knew too well that indeed it was the young canadian who had fallen under the logs daniel baciagalupo wrote and there was one sentence about the cook that the writer left unfinishedat least for the moment the cook had an aura of controlled apprehension about him as if he routinely anticipated the most unforeseen disasterswell that was as far as danny wanted to go with that sentence which he knew he would have to complete another day for now it was enough to type all these thoughts about the cook on a single piece of paper and thumbtack the page to the wall of the writing shack in a town like twisted river only the weather wouldnt change danny had also written it could work as a first sentence to the chapter but the writer knew he could do better still the sentence about the weather was a keeper danny could use it somewhere now it was that mudseason swollenriver time of year again daniel baciagalupo wrotea better beginning sentence but it wasnt really what the writer was looking for everything about the ketchum character was more fragmentary nothing about the ketchum character came to danny in a complete sentencenot yet there was something to the effect that ketchum had done more damage to himself than breaking his wrist in a river drive danny liked that line but he couldnt see where the sentence was going there was another fragment about ketchum being no neophyte to the treachery of a log drive danny knew he could and would use that but he wasnt sure wheremaybe in proximity to an asyetuncertain sentence about ketchum lying on his back on the riverbank like a beached bear yet these fragments also found their way to the writingshack wall where they were thumbtacked alongside the first chapters other signposts or landmarks at this point the writer could see the angel character more clearly than he could see the ketchum characterthough it was obvious to daniel baciagalupo that the ketchum character was more major maybe most major danny was thinking just thenat what amounted to a wave of more noxious farting from the dogdannys cell phone rang again buenos días señor writer lupita said buenos días lupita danny said the mexican cleaning woman didnt call often in those ten weeks of the winter when danny lived on the island in georgian bay lupita looked after the house on cluny drive she opened and read the authors mail she replayed the messages on his answering machine she kept an eye on the fax machine too once a week lupita would compile a list of what she considered was important for danny to knowin essence what she believed couldnt wait until he returned to toronto she faxed the list of priority messages to andy grants office in pointe au baril station danny always left a couple of checkbooks of signed blank checks for lupita who paid his bills while he was gone most of all the mexican cleaning woman demonstrably enjoyed reading the writers mail and deciding what was importantand what wasnt this doubtless appealed to lupitas prideher sense of herself as having an immeasurable authority an almost managerial control over the bestselling authors domestic life danny knew that lupita would have seized any opportunity that presented itself for her to take charge of the writers wretched personal life too if shed had daughters she would have introduced them to danny lupita did have nieces she would shamelessly leave their photographs on the kitchen countertop calling danny after shed gone home to tell him that shed lost some photos that were dear to her perhaps hed seen the pictures lying around somewhere lupita the pictures are on my kitchen countertopwhere you evidently left them he would tell her the darkhaired beauty in the pink tank topthe one with the wonderful smile and the gorgeous skin my precious niece actually mr writer lupita she looks like a teenager danny would point out no shes oldera little lupita would tell him once lupita had told him just dont marry another writer all youll do is depress each other im not going to marry anybodynot ever he told her why dont you stab yourself in the heart instead she asked him soon youll be consorting with prostitutes i know you talk to the dogive heard you she told him if lupita was calling him in pointe au baril she was vexed about something danny knew whats up lupita he asked her on the cell phone is it snowing in toronto were having quite a snowstorm up herehero and i are stranded i dont know about that unfortunate dog but i think you like to be stranded mr writer lupita said clearly the weather wasnt on her mind that wasnt why shed called sometimes lupita became convinced that people were watching the house on cluny drive occasionally they were shy fans a few every yearmildly obsessed readers just hoping to get a look at the author or lowlifes from the media maybehoping to see what another double shooting perhaps some sleazy canadian magazine had published a map of where torontos celebrities lived dannys house on cluny drive had been included not often but once a month or so an autographseeker came to the door lupita shooed them away as if they were beggars he gets paid to write booksnot sign them the cleaning woman would say some halfwit in the media had actually written about lupita the reclusive writers livein girlfriend appears to be a stout hispaniclooking personan older woman with an extremely protective disposition lupita hadnt been amused both the stout and the older grievously troubled her as for lupitas disposition she was more protective than ever theres someone looking for you señor writer lupita now told him on his cell phone i wouldnt go so far as to call her a stalkernot yetbut she is determined to find you i can tell you that how determined danny asked i wouldnt let her in lupita exclaimed and i didnt tell her where you were of course of course danny repeated what did she want she wouldnt sayshes very haughty she looks right through youif looks could kill as they sayand she boldly hinted that she knew where you were she was fishing for more information i think but i wouldnt take the bait lupita said proudly boldly hinted how danny asked she was unnaturally informed lupita said she asked if you were up on that island youd once lived on with the screenwriter i said what island well you should have seen how she looked at me then as if she knew you were lying danny asked yes lupita cried maybe shes a witch but every danny angel fan knew that hed lived with charlotte turner and that theyd gone to georgian bay in the summer it had even been written somewhere that the allegedly reclusive writer was spending his winters on a remote island in lake huron well it was remote in the winter anyway for a danny angel reader this was basically an intelligent guess it hardly meant that the woman looking for the writer had witchlike powers what did this woman look like lupita danny asked he was tempted to ask the mexican cleaning woman if shed spotted a broom or if the unnaturally informed woman had been attended by the smell of smoke or the crackling sound of a fire she was really scarylooking lupita declared big shoulderslike a man she was hulking hulking danny repeated reminding himself of his dad he was the cooks son clearlyrepetition was in his genes she looked like she lived in a gym lupita explained you wouldnt want to mess with her believe me the word bodybuilder was on the writers lips but he didnt say it lupitas combined impressions suddenly caused danny to conjure the spirit of lady sky for hadnt amy looked like she lived in a gym hadnt lady sky been capable of looking right through you if looks could kill indeed and hadnt amy been a hulking presence somehow the haughty word didnt suit lady sky but the writer understood that this may have been lupitas misinterpretation did she have any tattoos danny asked mr writer its february lupita cried i made her stay outside in the cold she looked like an arctic explorer could you see what color her hair was danny asked amy had been a strawberry blonde he remembered hed never forgotten her she was wearing a parkawith a hood lupita declared i couldnt even see what color her eyebrows were but she was big danny insisted not just broadshouldered but tallright she would tower over you lupita exclaimed shes a giantess there was no point in asking if lupita had noticed a parachute somewhere danny was trying to think of what else he could ask lady sky had at first seemed older than the writer but later hed reconsidered maybe she was closer to his own age than hed thought how old a woman was she lupita danny asked would you guess that she was my ageor a little older maybe younger lupita answered with conviction not much younger but definitely younger than you are oh the writer said he knew that his disappointment was audible it made danny feel desperate to have imagined that amy might fall from the sky again miracles dont happen twice even lady sky had said that she was only an angel sometimes yet lupita had used the determined word to describe the mysterious visitor lady sky had certainly seemed determined and how little joe had loved her well whoever she is danny said to lupita on the phone she wont show up here todaynot in this storm shell show up there one day or shell be back herei just know it lupita warned him do you believe in witches mr writer do you believe in angels danny asked her this woman was too dangerouslooking to be an angel lupita told him ill keep an eye out for her danny said ill tell hero shes a bear you would be safer meeting a bear señor writer lupita told him as soon as their phone conversation ended danny found himself thinking thatfond of her as he waslupita was a superstitious old mexican did catholics believe in witches the writer was wondering danny didnt know what catholics believednot to mention what lupita in particular believed he was exasperated to have been interrupted from his writing furthermore lupita had neglected to say when shed confronted the giantess in toronto this morning maybeor was it last week moments ago hed been on track plotting the course of his first chapter a pointless phone call had completely derailed him now even the weather was a distraction the inuksuk was buried under the snow never a good sign the writer could imagine tireless saying and danny couldnt bear to look at that windbent little pine the crippled tree was too much his fathers likeness today the pine appeared near to perishingcringing snowladen in the storm if danny looked southeastin the direction of pentecost island at the mouth of the shawanaga riverthere was a white void there was absolutely nothing to see there was no demarcation to indicate where the swirling white sky ended and the snowcovered bay began there was no horizon when he looked southwest burnt island was invisiblegone lost in the storm due east danny could make out only the tops of the tallest trees on the mainland but not the mainland itself like the lost horizon there was no trace of land in sight in the narrowest part of the bay was an ice fishermans shack perhaps the snowstorm had swept the shack away or the ice fishermans shack had simply vanished from view like everything else danny thought that hed better haul some extra pails of water to the main cabin from the lake while he could still see the lake the new snow would have hidden the last hole hed chopped in the ice danny and hero would have to be careful not to fall through the thin ice covering that hole there was no point in risking a trip to town todaydanny could thaw something from the freezer he would take the day off from cutting wood too outside the windborne snow stung heros wideopen lidless eye the dog kept pawing at his face just four buckets heroonly two trips to the bay and back danny said to the bear hound we wont be outside for long but the wind suddenly and totally dropped just as danny was hauling the second two buckets from the bay now the snow fell straight down in larger softer flakes the visibility was no better but it was more comfortable to be out in the storm no wind no pain herohow about that danny asked the walker bluetick the dogs spirits had notably improved danny watched hero run after a red squirrel and the writer hauled two more a total of six pails of water from the bay now he had more than enough water in the main cabin to ride out the stormno matter how heavily the snow kept falling and what did it matter how long the storm lasted there were no roads to plow there was a lot of venison in the freezer two steaks looked like too much food but maybe one wasnt quite enoughdanny decided to thaw two he had plenty of peppers and onions and some mushrooms he could stirfry them together and make a small green salad he made a marinade for the venisonyogurt and freshsqueezed lemon juice with cumin turmeric and chili this was a marinade he remembered from maos danny built up the fire in the woodstove in the main cabin if he put the marinated venison near the woodstove the steaks would thaw by dinnertime it was only noon danny gave hero some fresh water and fixed himself a little lunch the snowstorm had freed him from his usual afternoon chores with any luck danny might get back to work in the writing shack he felt that his first chapter was waiting for him there would only be the bear hounds farting to distract him under the logs the writer said aloud to hero testing the phrase as a chapter title it was a good title for an opening chapter danny thought come on hero he said to the dog but theyd not left the main cabin when dannys cell phone rang againthe third call of the day most days in the writers winter life on charlottes island the phone didnt ring once its the bear hero danny said to the dog what do you bet that the big shebear is coming but the phone call was from andy grant i thought i better check up on you the builder said how are you and hero surviving the storm hero and i are surviving just finein fact were very cozy danny told him im thawing some of the deer you and i shot not planning on going shopping are you andy asked him im not planning on going anywhere danny answered thats good andy said youve got whiteout conditions at your place have you total whiteout danny told him i cant see burnt islandi cant even see the mainland not even from the back dock andy asked him i wouldnt know danny answered hero and i are having a pretty lazy day we havent ventured as far as the back dock there was a long pauselong enough to make danny look at his cellphone screen to be sure they were still connected you and hero might want to go see what you can see off the back dock danny andy grant told the writer if i were you i would wait about ten or fifteen minutesthen go take a look what am i looking for andy the writer asked a visitor the builder told him theres someone looking for you danny and she seems real determined to find you real determined danny repeated shed shown up at the nursing station in pointe au baril asking for directions to turner island the nurse had sent her to andy everyone in town knew that andy grant was protective of the famous novelists privacy the big stronglooking woman didnt have her own airboat she didnt have a snowmobile either she didnt even come with skisjust ski poles her backpack was huge and strapped to it was a pair of snowshoes if shed had a car it must have been a rental and shed already gotten rid of it maybe shed spent the night at larrys tavern or in some motel near parry sound there was no way she could have driven the entire distance from toronto to pointe au baril stationnot that morning not in that snowstorm the snow had blanketed georgian bay from manitoulin island to honey harbour andaccording to andyit was supposed to snow all that night too she said she knows you andy told the writer but if it turns out that shes just a crazy fan or some psycho autographseeker theres enough room in that backpack for all eight of your booksboth the hardcover and the paperback editions then again that backpacks big enough to hold a shotgun she knows me howshe knew me when and where danny asked all she said was we go back a ways youre not expecting a visit from an angry exgirlfriendare you danny im not expecting anybody andy the writer said shes one powerfullooking lady danny the builder said how big is she daniel baciagalupo asked were talking giantess category andy told him hands like pawsboots bigger than mine you and i together could fit in her parka there would probably be room for hero too i suppose she looks like an arctic explorer the writer guessed shes sure got the right clothes for this weather andy said the snowpants the snowmobilers glovesand her parka has a big old hood i dont suppose you saw the color of her hair the writer said nopenot under that hood i couldnt even be sure of the color of her eyes andy said and what would you guess her age was danny asked about my age maybeor a little older nope the builder said again shes way younger than you are danny at least what i could see of her shes really fitlooking with all the clothes she had on how could you tell she was fit the writer asked she came into my officejust to look at my map of the bay the builder told danny while she was locating turner island on the map i lifted her backpacki just picked it up off the floor and set it down again its about a seventypound pack danny that pack weighs as much as hero and she left here carrying it like a pillow she sounds like someone i met once danny said but her age is wrong if she were the woman im thinking of she couldnt be way younger than i amas you say i could be wrong about that andy told him people age differently danny some folks seem to stay the same others if its been a while you wouldnt recognize them oh its been a whileif shes the one im thinking of danny said its been almost forty years it cant be her the writer said he sounded impatient with himself danny didnt dare to hope that it was lady sky he realized that it had also been a while since hed hoped for anything he had once hoped that nothing terrible would ever happen to his beloved joe hed also hoped that his dad would long outlive the cowboy and that ketchum would die peacefullyin his sleep with both his hands intact daniel baciagalupo didnt have a good record with hope danny its dumb to think you can even guess what someones going to look like after forty years andy said some people change more than othersthats all im saying look the builder said why dont i come out there i could probably catch up to her on my snowmobile i could bring her the rest of the way and if you dont like heror shes not the person youre thinking ofi could bring her back to pointe au baril no hero and i will be all right danny said i can always call you if i need help getting her to leave or something you and hero better be on your way to the back dock andy told him she left here a while ago and shes got a real long stride okay well get going thanks andy danny told him you sure i cant come out there or do anything for you the builder asked ive been looking for a first sentence to my first chapter the writer answered you wouldnt have a first sentence for me would you i cant help you with that andy grant said just call me if you have any trouble with that woman there wont be any trouble danny told him danny take that old remington with you when you go to the back dock its just a good idea to have the gun with youand make sure she sees it okay okay the writer answered hero was excited as always to take a walk with ketchums springfield carbine dont get your hopes up hero danny told the dog the odds are shes not a bear the snow was kneedeep on the wideopen path to the writing shack and not quite as deep on the narrow path through the woods from dannys workplace to the back dock when he passed his writing shack the writer said aloud ill be back first chapter ill see you soon first sentence hero had run ahead there was a grove of cedars out of the wind where a small herd of deer had bedded down for the night either hero had spooked them or the deer had moved on when the wind dropped hero was sniffing all around there were probably deer turds under the snow the snow in the cedar grove was flattened down where the deer had huddled together theyre gone heroyou missed them danny told the bear hound those deer are on barclay island by now or theyre on the mainland the dog was rolling in the snow where the herd had bedded down if you roll in any deer turds hero ill give you a bathwith shampoo and everything hero hated baths danny didnt much like washing the uncooperative dog either in the cluny drive house in toronto lupita was the one who washed the dog she seemed to enjoy scolding hero while she did it so señor machohow do you like having only one eyelid but thats what you get for fighting mr machoisnt it there must have been three feet of snow on the roof of granddaddys cabin to which neither the writer nor the dog gave more than a passing glance if that cabin had been haunted before it was more haunted now neither danny nor hero would have welcomed an encounter with ketchums ghost if the old logger were a ghost danny knew that the poachers cabin was just the spot for him the snow had drifted thighhigh onto the back dock across the frozen bay parts of the mainland were visible in the whiteout but the far shore didnt emerge distinctly the mainland was blurred the clarity of the shoreline was fleeting in the distance fragments of the landscape momentarily appeared only to disappear the next instant there were no identifying landmarks that allowed danny to see exactly where the snowmobile portage from paynes road came into contact with the bay but from the vantage of the dock the writer could make out the shape of the ice fishermans shack it had not been blown away by the storm yet the shack was so indistinct in the steadily falling snow that danny knew the snowshoer would be halfway across the reach of the bay before he could see her what had little joe said that day at the pig roast plane not a bird and then because danny had been watching katie instead of the small airplane hed heard joe say not flying falling only then did danny see her the skydiver was freefalling hurtling through the sky when the writer had first spotted her only seconds before her parachute opened and amy herself had come consecutively more and more into view first it became clear she was a woman skydiver then all at once she was naked only when danny was beside her in the pigpenin all the mud and pig shitdid he realize how big amy was shed been so solid now the writer squinted across the bay into the falling snow as if he were waiting for another little airplane to appear on the vanished horizonor for another redwhiteandblue parachute to pop open whoever she was she wouldnt be naked this time the writer knew yet he also knew that like the skydiver she would suddenly just be therethe way an angel drops down to earth from the heavens he was looking and looking for her but danny understood that in the whiteout of the snowstorm the woman would just plain appear as if by magic one second nothing would be there the next second she would be halfway across the bay and coming closerone long stride after another what the writer had overlooked was the fact that hero was a hunter the bear hound had one good ear and a very good nose the growl began in the dogs chest and heros first bark was muffledhalf swallowed in his throat there was no one out there on the frozen bay but the bear hound knew she was coming the dogs barking began in earnest only seconds before danny saw her shut up herodont scare her away danny said of course the writer understood that if she was lady sky nothing could scare her the snowshoer was in full stride practically running when danny saw her at such a pace and carrying a backpack that heavy shed worked up quite a sweat she had unzipped the parka to cool herself off the hood which shed pushed off her head lay on the back of her broad shoulders danny could see her strawberryblond hair it was a little longer than she used to cut it when shed been a skydiver the writer could understand why both lupita and andy grant thought she was younger than danny amy looked younger than the writer if not way younger when she reached the dock hero finally stopped barking youre not going to shoot meare you danny amy asked him but the writer whod not had much luck with hope couldnt answer her danny couldnt speak and he couldnt stop staring at her because it was snowing the tears on dannys face were mingled with the snow he probably didnt know he was crying but amy saw his eyes oh hold onjust hang onim coming she said i got here as fast as i could you know she threw the backpack up on the dock together with her ski poles and she climbed over the rocks taking her snowshoes off when she gained her footing on the dock lady sky danny said it was all he could say he felt himself dissolving yeah its me she said hugging him she pulled his face to her chest he just shook against her boy youre even more of a mess than i thought you would be amy told him but im here now and ive got youyoure going to be okay where have you been he managed to ask her i had another projecttwo actually she told him they turned out to be a waste of my time but ive been thinking about youfor years danny didnt mind if he was lady skys project now he imagined that shed had her share of projects more than two so what the writer thought he would soon be sixtythree danny knew he was no prize i might have come sooner you bastard if youd answered my letter amy said to him i never saw your letter my dad read it and threw it away he thought you were a stripper danny told her that was a long time agobefore the skydiving amy said was your dad ever in chicago i havent done any stripping since chicago danny thought this was very funny but before he could clear up the misunderstanding lady sky took a closer look at hero the bear hound had been sniffing amys discarded snowshoes suspiciouslyas if he were readying himself to piss on them hey you amy said to the dog you lift your leg on my snowshoes you might just lose your other earor your pecker hero knew when he was being spoken to he gave amy an evil crazed look with his lidless eye but the dog backed away from the snowshoes something in amys tone must have reminded the bear hound of sixpack pam in fact at that moment lady sky had reminded danny of sixpacka young sixpack a sixpack from those longago days when shed lived with ketchum jeez youre shaking so muchthat gun might go off amy told the writer ive been waiting for you danny told her ive been hoping she kissed him there was some mintflavored gum in her mouth but he didnt mind she was warm and still sweating but not out of breathnot even from the snowshoeing can we go indoors somewhere amy asked him at a glance anyone could see that granddaddys cabin was uninhabitableunless you were ketchum or a ghost from the back dock of the island it was impossible to see the other buildingseven when there wasnt a snowstorm danny picked up her snowshoes and the ski poles being careful to keep the carbine pointed at the dock and amy shouldered the big backpack hero ran ahead as before they stopped at the writing shack so that danny could show her where he worked the little room still smelled of the dogs lamentable farting but the fire in the woodstove hadnt died outit was like a sauna in that shack amy took off her parka and a couple of layers of clothes that she wore under the parkauntil she was wearing just her snowpants and a tshirt danny told her that hed once believed she was older than he wasor they were the same age maybebut how was it possible that she seemed younger now danny didnt mean younger than she was that day on the pig farm in iowa he meant that shed not aged as much as he hadand why was that did she think amy told him that shed lost her little boy when she was much younger shed already lost him when danny met her as a skydiver amys only child had died when he was twolittle joes age at the pig roast that death had aged amy when it happened and for a number of years immediately following her boys death it wasnt that amy was over her sons deathone never got over a loss like that as she knew danny would know it was only that the loss didnt show as much when so many years had passed maybe your childs death ceased being as visible to other people after a really long time joe had died more recently to anyone who knew danny the writer had noticeably aged because of it were the same age more or less amy told the writer ive been sixty for the last couple of years i thinkat least thats what i tell the guys who ask you look fifty danny told her are you trying to get in my pants or something amy asked him she read those sentences and the fragments of sentences from the first chapterthe lines hed thumbtacked to the pineboard wall of the writing shack what are these she asked theyre sentences or parts of sentences ahead of myself theyre waiting for me to catch up to them he told her theyre all lines from my first chapteri just havent found the first sentence yet maybe ill help you find it amy said im not going anywhere for a while i dont have any other projects danny could have cried again but just then his cell phone rangfor the fourth fucking time that day it was andy grant of course checking up on him she there yet andy asked who is she shes the one ive been waiting for danny told him shes an angel sometimes lady sky reminded him when he hung up this time anyway what might the cook have said to his son if hed had time to utter some proper last words before the cowboy shot him in the heart at best dominic might have expressed the hope that his lonely son find someoneonly that well danny had found her actually shed found him given charlotte and now given amyat least in that aspect of his lifethe writer knew hed been lucky some people dont ever find one person daniel baciagalupo had found two shed been living in minnesota for the last few years amy said if you think torontos cold try minneapolis shed told him amy had done a little grappling in a wrestling club called minnesota storm shed hung out with a bunch of exgopher wrestlers she saida concept that danny found difficult to grasp amy martinmartin had been her maiden name and shed taken it back years agowas a canadian shed lived a long time in the united states and had become an american citizen but she was at heart a canadian amy said and shed always wanted to come back to canada why had she gone to the states in the first place danny asked her because of a guy i met amy told him shrugging then my kid was born there so i felt i should stay she described her politics as largely indifferent now she was sick of how little americans knew about the rest of the worldor how little they cared to know after two terms the failed policies of the bush presidency would probably leave the country and the rest of the world in a terrible mess what amy martin meant by this was that it would then be high time for some hero on a horse to ride in but what could one hero on one horse do not much would change lady sky said she had fallen to earth in a country that didnt believe in angels yet the biblehuggers had hijacked one of the two major political parties there with the biblehuggers not much would ever change moreover there was what amy called the cocksuckers contingent of the countrywhat danny knew as the dumberthandogshit element those bully patriotsand they were too set in their ways or too poorly educated or both to see beyond the ceaseless flagwaving and nationalistic bluster conservatives are an extinct species lady sky said but they dont know it yet by the time danny had shown amy the main cabinthe big bathtub the bedroom and the venison steaks he was marinating for dinnertheyd established that they were bedfellows at least politically while amy knew more about danny than he knew about her this was only because shed read every word hed written shed read almost all the shit that had been written about him too the shit word was what they both instinctively used for the media so that on the subject of the media they discovered they were bedfellows too most of all amy knew when and how hed lost his little joeand when his dad had died and the how of that too he had to tell her about ketchum whom she knew nothing about and while this was hardexcept with sixpack danny didnt talk about ketchumthe writer discovered in the process of describing ketchum that the old logger was alive in the novel danny was dreaming and so danny talked and talked about that novel and his elusive first chapter too they heated the pasta pots of lake water to a near boil on the gas stove and with their two bodies in that big bathtub the tub was full to the brim danny had not imagined it was possible to fill that giant bathtub but not even the novelist had ever imagined that tub with a giantess in it amy talked him through the history of her myriad tattoos the when and the where and the why of the tattoos held dannys attention for the better part of an hour or moreboth in the warm bathtub and in the bed in that bedroom with the propane fireplace hed not taken a close look at amys tattoos beforenot when she was spattered with mud and pig shit and not afterward when she was wearing just a towel danny felt it would have been improper and unwelcome to have stared at her then he stared at her now he took all of her in many of amys tattoos had a martialarts theme shed tried kickboxing in bangkok for a couple of years she had lived in rio de janeiro where shed competed in an unsuccessful startup tour of ultimate fighting for women some of those brazilian broads were tougher than the thai kickboxers lady sky said tattoos have their own stories and danny heard them all but the one that mattered most to amy was the name bradley that had been her sons name and her fathers shed called the boy both brad and bradley and after he died shed had the twoyearolds given name tattooed on her right hip where it jutted outprecisely where amy had once carried her child when he was a toddler in explaining how how shed borne the weight of her little boys death amy pointed out to danny that her hips were the strongest part of her strong body danny didnt doubt it amy was happy to discover that danny could cook because she couldnt the venison was good though there wasnt quite enough of it danny had sliced some potatoes very thinly and stirfried them with the onions peppers and mushrooms so they didnt go hungry danny served a green salad after the meal because the cook had taught him that this was the civilized way to serve a saladthough it was almost never served this way in a restaurant it pleased the writer no end that lady sky was a beer drinker i found out long ago she told him that i drink everything alcoholic as fast as i drink a beerso i better stick with beer if i dont want to kill myself im pretty much over wanting to kill myself amy added he was pretty much over that part too danny told her he had learned to like heros company the farting notwithstanding and the writer had two cleaning ladies looking after him they would all be disappointed in him if he killed himself amy had met one of the cleaning ladies of course andweather permittinglady sky would probably meet tireless tomorrow or the next day as for lupita amy called the mexican cleaning woman a better guard dog than hero lady sky was sure that she and lupita would become great friends i have no right to be happy danny told his angel when they were falling asleep in each others arms that first night everyone has a right to be a little happy asshole amy told him ketchum would have liked how lady sky used the asshole word the writer was thinking it was a word choice after the old loggers heart danny knew whichin his sleepled him back to the novel he was dreaming amy martin and daniel baciagalupo had a month to spend on charlotte turners island in georgian bay it was their wilderness way of getting to know each other before their life together in toronto began we dont always have a choice how we get to know one another sometimes people fall into our lives cleanlyas if out of the sky or as if there were a direct flight from heaven to earththe same sudden way we lose people who once seemed they would always be part of our lives little joe was gone but not a day passed in daniel baciagalupos life when joe wasnt loved or remembered the cook had been murdered in his bed but dominic baciagalupo had had the last laugh on the cowboy ketchums left hand would live forever in twisted river and sixpack had known what to do with the rest of her old friend one midfebruary day a snowstorm blew across lake huron from western canada all of georgian bay was blanketed by it when the writer and lady sky woke up the storm was gone it was a dazzling morning danny let the dog out and made the coffee when the writer brought some coffee to amy in the bedroom he saw that shed fallen back to sleep lady sky had been traveling a long way and the life shed led would have tired anyone out danny let her sleep he fed the dog and wrote amy a note not telling her he was falling in love with her he simply told her that she knew where to find himin his writing shack danny thought that he would have breakfast later whenever lady sky woke up again he would take some coffee with him to the writing shack and start a fire in the woodstove there hed already built up the fire in the woodstove in the main cabin come on hero the writer said and together they went out in the fresh snow danny was relieved to see that his fathers likeness that windbent little pine had survived the storm it wasnt the ketchum character who should begin the first chapter daniel baciagalupo believed it was better to keep the ketchum character hidden for a whileto make the reader wait to meet him sometimes those most important characters need a little concealment it would be better danny thought if the first chapterand the novelbegan with the lost boy the angel character who was not who he seemed was a good decoy in storytelling terms angel was a hook the young canadian who was not a canadian was where the writer should start it wont take long now daniel baciagalupo believed and whenever he found that first sentence there would be someone in his life the writer dearly desired to read it to legally or not and with or without proper papers danny wrote angel pope had made his way across the canadian border to new hampshire its okay the writer thought but its not the beginningthe mistaken idea that angel had crossed the border comes later in berlin the androscoggin dropped two hundred feet in three miles two paper mills appeared to divide the river at the sorting gaps in berlin danny wrote it was not inconceivable to imagine that young angel pope from toronto was on his way there yes yesthe writer thought more impatiently now but these last two sentences were too technical for a beginning he thumbtacked these sentences to the wall alongside the other lines and then added this sentence to the mix the carpet of moving logs had completely closed over the young canadian who never surfaced not even a hand or one of his boots broke out of the brown water almost daniel baciagalupo thought immediately another sentence emergedas if twisted river itself were allowing these sentences to bob to the surface the repeated thunkthunk of the pike poles poking the logs was briefly interrupted by the shouts of the rivermen who had spotted angels pike polemore than fifty yards from where the boy had vanished fine fine danny thought but it was too busy for a beginning sentence there were too many distractions in that sentence maybe the very idea of distractions distracted him the writers thoughts leapt aheadtoo far aheadto ketchum there was something decidedly parenthetical about the new sentence only ketchum can kill ketchum definitely a keeper danny thought but most definitely not firstchapter material danny was shivering in his writing shack the fire in the woodstove was taking its time to heat the little room normally danny was chopping a hole in the ice and hauling a couple of buckets of water out of the bay while the writing shack was warming up this morning hed skipped the chopping and the hauling later in this glorious day he would have lady sky to help him with the chores just then without even trying to think of itin fact at that moment daniel baciagalupo had reached out to rub hero behind the dogs good earthe first sentence came to him the writer felt it rising into view as if from underwater the sentence came into sight the way that applejuice jar with his dads ashes had bobbed to the surface just before ketchum shot it the young canadian who could not have been more than fifteen had hesitated too long oh godhere i go againim starting the writer thought hed lost so much that was dear to him but danny knew how stories were marvelshow they simply couldnt be stopped he felt that the great adventure of his life was just beginningas his father must have felt in the throes and dire
