jilly cooper appassionata to the royal scottish national orchestra because they make great music and i love them all acknowledgements i felt desolate when i finished appassionata because id grown so fond of everyone whod helped me i was constantly touched and amazed that musicians who work such punishing hours often for totally inadequate reward should not only be the merriest and the funniest people in the world but also the most generous with their time i must therefore start with a huge thank you to my guardian angels benign bassoonist chris gale his wife jacoba ace cook and viola player and another viola player ian pillow who writes classic fm magazines wonderfully funny column pillow talk all of whom are from the bournemouth symphony orchestra fair annie tennant education officer of the city of birmingham symphony orchestra jack rothstein super violinist soloist leader and conductor his wife linn hendry another ace cook and a pianist who specializes in violin repertoire and finally brilliant violinist marat bisengaliev and his wife steena sublime first flute at the english northern philharmonia these eight muses gave me inspiration encouragement endless introductions and marvellous hospitality they never minded being bombarded with silly questions could you bonk a small woman on a glockenspiel would tearstains devalue a strad in the middle of the night and if they didnt know the answer they always knew someone who did i cannot thank them enough i would also like to thank two great orchestras the bournemouth symphony orchestra whose managing director anthony woodcock very kindly allowed me to spend a fantastic week in poole talking to both musicians and management sitting in on rehearsals touring the south of england listening to marvellous concerts everyone helped me but i would like to say a special thank you to marion aston kevin banks andy barclay nigel beale philip borgwheeler andrew burn johnathan carney john charles stuart collins david gill stuart green christopher guy helen harris anna hawkins karen jones edward kay jayne litton janet male peter rendle nick simmonds verity smith louise wright and peter witham the red lions share of my gratitude however must go to the royal scottish national orchestra in i wistfully asked my friend ian maclay who now runs the bbc concert orchestra if he knew a band brave enough to take me on tour abroad within twentyfour hours he had elicited an invitation to tour spain from paul hughes who must be the nicest man in classical music and who had just taken over the rsno as managing director thus followed one of the best weeks of my life as the orchestra roared through five cities bringing the very formal spanish audiences yelling in delight to their feet walter weller darkly urbane and charismatic was the conductor john lill adored by musicians and public alike was the soloist reducing us to tears of joy by his piano playing and tears of laughter with his outrageous jokes at the parties afterwards jacqueline noltingk ensured everything ran miraculously smoothly in may i joined the rsno for a second tour this time of switzerland once again they played gloriously to packed houses and their music in my heart i bore long after it was heard no more again everyone was sweet to me but the following were of particular value to my story kenneth blackwood helen brew valerie carlaw william chandler john clark john cushing pamella dow morrison and sally dunbar claire dunn jeremy fletcher charles floyd brian forshaw martin gibson john gracie john grant david hair john harrington philip hore duncan johnstone fiona mcpherson evgeny minkov angela moore jacqueline noltingk joseph pacewicz edwin paling miranda phythianadams kevin price stephane rancourt michael rigg alistair sinclair ian smith justine watts stephen west one of my heroes in appassionata is a young pianist so i am deeply indebted for their advice to great soloists philip fowke janina fialkowska alan kogosowsky i am also grateful to philip mackenzie conductor and moving force behind the west country amadeus chorus and orchestra and his bassoonist wife charlotte who suggested i play the narrator in peter and the wolf at the colston hall in so i could experience the utter terror of performing as a soloist with an orchestra my other more gilded hero is a brass player here again marvellous anecdotes and many ideas came from david mcclenaghan and john logan first and third horn of the rsno martin hobbs second horn of the bso lance green first trombone rsno danny longstaff second trombone of the cbso and above all the legendary tony turnstall former principal horn of the royal opera house orchestra covent garden my main heroine becomes a conductor so i was immensely grateful for help from sir simon rattle andrew litton jean paul casadesus stephen barlow ross pople denys darlow michael burbidge olivier dohnányi and above all andré previn andré that most droll and beguiling of raconteurs and companions allowed me to sit in on rehearsals and recording sessions with the mighty london symphony orchestra and talked to me for many hours about both conducting and playing the piano i must especially thank dear bill holland and harriet capaldi of warner classics for producing the most beautiful cd titled appassionata from a selection of the music featured in the book on the recording side i must also thank erik smith steve long and mike hatch for patiently answering my questions as did distinguished composers orlando gough and geoffrey burgon my neighbour in gloucestershire on the musical administration side id like to thank philippa sherwood and andrew jowett of symphony hall birmingham and christopher bishop late of the rsno and the philharmonia for all their help and wonderful hospitality ian killik of the english northern philharmonia lynn calvin of the musicians union libby macnamara of the association of british orchestras charles beare world expert on string instruments sonia copeland chris steward alison taylor ellyn kusman rosamund leitch of the wagner society diggory seacome timpanist supremo and mover and shaker of the cotswold symphony orchestra all the artists agents in appassionata are perfectly horrid and bear absolutely no resemblance to darling sir ian hunter chairman of harold holt or trudy wright of harrison parrott both of whom advised and royally entertained me during my research i spent a lovely morning at the english national ballet where amanda gilliland and jane haworth were as beautiful as they were informative i also spent fascinating days at the royal academy of music and the royal college of music watching professor colin metters and the venerable george hurst assessing student conductors practising their skills on respective college orchestras one of the pieces was bartóks violin concerto which mia biakella the soloist played quite beautifully i am also grateful to huw humphreys a young conductor who after his début at the holywell music rooms in oxford in gave me invaluable insight into preconcert nerves and the problems of galvanizing musicians on a plane to lapland in i sat next to a delightful bassoon teacher who told me piano competitions were frightfully bent with large lady judges often receiving grand pianos as bribes after that i naturally included a piano competition in the book i then spent a splendidly inspiring week at the leeds piano competition where i saw no sign of pianos changing hands and must thank the competitions founder fanny waterman and mary bailey from the sponsors harveys of bristol organizer liz arnold romilly meagen of the bbc and roisin grimley from ireland it was also a great thrill to spend time with the brilliant young british contestant leon macaulay who immediately after the result touchingly apologized for only coming second it would have been so much better for your book if i had won i also made friends with mark anderson the handsome american contestant who came third and he and his wife beautiful pianist tamriko siprashvili delighted us with piano duets when they came to stay in gloucestershire in august i spent exciting days at the international world power competition sulamita aronovsky was the indefatigable organizer and i must thank ann fuller samantha day irish judge john oconor and american judge herbert stessin for their marvellous observations joe lewis looked after me backstage another brilliant british contestant paul lewis came second and again spent many hours talking to me i must also thank leonard pearcey and ruth cubbin for twice inviting me to radio s excellent young musician of the year award many musicians helped me with the background material and stories for the book they include robin brightman of the lso richard hewitt of the nep john hill erich gruenberg alberto portugheis elizabeth drew stuart elsmore alistair beattie alexa butterworth mats lidstrom angela moore rodney friend former leader of the lso norman jones former principal cellist to the philharmonia raymond cohen former leader of the royal philharmonic and hannah roberts the music press were also fantastic malcolm hayes of the daily telegraph and mike tumelty of the glasgow herald held my hand on the tour of spain david fingleton looked after me at the leeds and took me to endless lovely concerts as did dear lesley garner super columnist and mel cooper of classic fm who opened his great generous heart and his address book to me on endless occasions john julius norwich invited me to a gorgeous lunch in the country norman lebrecht of the daily telegraph author of the maestro myth nobly tracked down the legend of the chandelier in buenos aires opera house keith clarke editor of classical music magazine and doughty fighter of musicians causes nicholas kenyon controller of radio professor george pratt peter barker and ron hall all gave me wonderful support my old friend and sunday times colleague peter watson wrote a terrific biography of nureyev which was a constant inspiration when i was inventing my explosive dancer alexei nemerovsky all my friends in fact entered into the spirit of the book alan titchmarsh thought up the title appassionata my piano tuner marcus constance dreamt up a devilish plot for sabotaging a grand piano in the middle of a competition lord marchwood took me up in an air balloon over france with general sir peter de la billière musicians have many ailments joanne murphy advised me on physiotherapy dr joe cobbe dr graham hall and staff nurse sue workman on asthma john hunt introduced me to anthony norcliffe who knew all about mending brass players teeth on the nonmusical front patrick despard of arcona was fiendishly imaginative about the splendours and skulduggeries of property developing toby trustrameve was brilliant on computers as were andrew parkerbowles on racing peter clarkson and jean alice cook on nuns names and practices susie layton on decor sue jacobs of leicestershire social services and deborah fowler in her book a guide to adoption on adoption other friends who came up with ideas include susannah and bill franklyn anthony rubinstein george and dang humphreys john woods roger and rowena and harry luard francis willey mary and anthony abrahams graham hamilton michael leworthy and john conway of the archduke wine bar id like to thank jack and patricia godsell for their beautiful toadsmoor lake which was a magical source of inspiration and dr ueli habegger who finally located the island on lake lucerne where the ghost horn player can sometimes be heard at dusk as well as spain and switzerland my research took me in to prague and on to pardubice where british jockey owner and trainer charlie mann exceeded all expectation by coming second in the czech grand national on its a snip and later in came first i must particularly thank lord patrick beresford and baroness dory friesen for masterminding this brilliant trip for abercrombie and kent and thank sir derek hodgson queeks carletonpaget and liza butler for being such beguiling travelling companions many people wrote offering advice and anecdotes many numbers went down in my telephone book sadly i never followed them up as in the end i had to get down and write the book if researching appassionata was a joy writing it was an absolute nightmare because an orchestra consists of so many characters and mine were continually getting out of control particularly in their behaviour in fact paul hughes ian pillow and linn rothstein who most heroically read through the manuscript for mistakes said they had never come across an orchestra who behaved quite so badly as my rutminster symphony orchestra nor in fact had i the high jinks and bad behaviour in the book are totally invented and i would stress that appassionata is a work of fiction any resemblance to any living person or organization is wholly unintentional and purely coincidental i never got to bogotá where the first chapters are set but annie senior and peter gibbskennet gave me graphic descriptions and i was much indebted to both the lonely planet guide to colombia and the fruit palace a stunning travel book by charles nicholl nor would the book have probably been completed if sharon young of british airways hadnt tracked down a folder of early notes id left at glasgow airport i am truly sorry if ive left people out but if id listed everyone whod helped me these acknowledgements would be longer than the book while writing appassionata i was gently followed to prague and switzerland and all over england by a bbc crew from bookmark headed by basil comely occasionally i found it difficult to get to grips with brass players love lives or seduction techniques in conductors dressingrooms with a bbc crew breathing down my neck but otherwise they couldnt have been more tactful kind and fun to work with my publishers paul scherer mark bartyking patrick jansonsmith of transworld as usual have been impeccable constantly encouraging and reassuringly rock solid at a time of book trade turbulence i have also had wonderful editorial help from the glorious diane pearson and from broo doherty who grew crosseyed as she ploughed through pages of manuscript crammed with musical references she was however so charming and so enthusiastic about the book that i accepted nearly all the changes she suggested i am also eternally lucky in having the best most delightfully insouciant agent in london desmond elliott and his assistant nathan mayatt who spent so much time photostatting and despatching for the first time the huge manuscript was typed on computers the real heroines of appassionata are therefore my friends annette xuerebbrennan anna gibbskennet and pippa moores who completed the job on new machines in an amazing five weeks they worked long into the night deciphering my deplorable handwriting punctuating correcting spelling and pointing out howlers i cannot express sufficient gratitude to them nor to ann mills my equally heroic cleaner who somehow cleared up the mess while picking her way delicately through rising tower blocks of manuscript until the house looked rather like hong kong sadly my dear friend and pa jane watts who supervised so much of the photostatting and collation of the book and who had given me so much love and support over the past six years left in november with huge luck her place was soon taken by pippa moores who arrived to oversee the move into computers and stayed to become my new assistant my family comme toujours were staunchness personified leo felix and emily hardly saw me for eighteen months but gave endless cheer and comfort so did my dogs barbara and hero and four cats agnes sewage rattle and tilsonthomas who provided sweet silent companionship and protection in the gazebo even at the dead of night dear gallant barbara gertrude the mongrel in my last four books seemed determined to cling on to life if only to see me safely into port she died a few days after i finished writing leaving the world unbearably the poorer finally i would like to thank musicians everywhere for the joy they bring and to beg the public the government and the local authorities to give them the support and funding they so desperately need because a twentyfirst century without

love for the second time in her life the flight to bogotá delayed by engine trouble at caracas took fifteen hours taggie whod hardly eaten or slept since rupert broke the news of their journey could only manage half a glass of champagne nor being very dyslexic was she able to lose herself in danielle steel or catherine cookson nor even concentrate on robbie coltrane camping it up as a nun on the inflight movie she could only clutch ruperts hand praying over and over again please god let it happen by contrast rupert concealing equal nerves behind his habitual deadpan langour had drunk far too much as he sat thumbing through a glossary at the back of a bogotá guide book i now know the colombian for stupid bugger prick jerk double bed airconditioning rum and cocaine so we should be ok at el dorado airport the policemen fingered their guns seeing an affluentlooking gringo the taxidriver turned off his meter as they drove past interminable whorehouses and dives blaring forth music past skyscrapers next to crumbling shacks ruperts hangover was assaulted as much by the shroud of black diesel fumes that blanketed the city as by the furiously honking almost static rushhour traffic there was rubbish everywhere on every pavement pimps with dead eyes drug pushers carrying suitcases bulging with notes tarts in tight dresses pushed aside beggars on crutches and stepped over grubby sloeeyed children playing in the gutter how could anything good come out of such a hellhole as taggie couldnt bear to wait a second longer they drove straight to the convent now quivering like a dog in a thunderstorm she was panicking about her clothes dyou think i should have stopped off at the hotel and changed into something more motherly rupert glanced sideways noone filled a body stocking like taggie or had better longer legs for a miniskirt you look like a plainclothes angel my skirt isnt too short never never rupert put a hand on her thigh by the time they reached the convent a sanctuary amid the squalor appalling poverty and brutal crime of the slums the fare cost almost more than the flight the angelus was ringing in the little belltower the setting sun finding a gap in the dark lowering mountains of the andes had turned the square white walls a flaming orange a battered virgin mary looked down from a niche as rupert knocked on the blistered bottlegreen front door but noone answered we should have rung first to check they were in said taggie who despite the stifling heat of the evening was trembling even more uncontrollably she looked about to faint i cant imagine theyre out at some raveup gently rupert smoothed the black circles beneath her terrified eyes itll be ok sweetheart he clouted the door again now that he was in cocaine city rupert had never more longed for a line to put him in carnival mood to carry him through the interview ahead his longing increased a moment later when the door was unlocked and creaked open a few inches and he had a sudden vision that robbie coltrane had got in on the act again a massive nun like a superannuated orangutan with tiny suspicious eyes disappearing in fat a beard and hairy warts bristling disapproval demanded what they wanted she then insisted on seeing their passports and looked as though she would infinitely rather have frisked taggie than rupert before grudgingly allowing them in by contrast the mother superior maria immaculata was femininity and charm itself she had a round almost childish face like a threequarters moon smiling slanting brown eyes and a cherished olive complexion set off by a very white linen wimple as she moved forward with a rustle of black silk the pale hand she held out to rupert and taggie was soft and slightly greasy from a recent application of hand cream mother maria immaculata believed you brought more comfort to the poor and suffering if you looked attractive it was the same in her office crimson bougainvillaea rioted round the windows outside frescoes and wood carvings decorated the white walls of her office on her shiny dark desk which seemed to breathe beeswax beside a silver vase of blue hibiscus flowers lay the report of ruperts and taggies marriage drawn up by english social workers but maria immaculata did not set much store by gringo gobbledygook more importantly rupert and taggie had come with an excellent recommendation from the cardinal who was a friend of declan ohara ruperts partner whose television interviews were transmitted worldwide even the pope who was evidently writing a book and might want to promote it on declans programme one day had put in a good word anyway maria immaculata preferred to make up her own mind and then sister mercedes who acted as the convent rottweiler had helped matters greatly by bringing in this beautiful couple the man as blond tall handsome and proud as el dorado himself and his wife as deathly pale slender and quivering as a eucalyptus tree in an earthquake and whose eyes were as silvergrey as the eucalyptus leaves themselves taggie was clutching a litre of dutyfree brandy a vast bottle of joy a british airways teddy bear wearing goggles and a flying jacket and a white silk tasselled shawl decorated with brilliantly coloured birds of paradise for you she stammered dropping them on mother immaculatas desk and nearly knocking over the vase of hibiscus if rupert with his lightning reflexes hadnt whisked it to the safety of a side table i hhhope you dont mmmind us barging in straight from the airport but we were so longing taggies voice faltered timeo danaeos thought sister mercedes grimly she spent her life pouring cold water on the romantic enthusiams of maria immaculata who was now lovingly fingering the white shawl dear child you shouldnt have spoiled us they will do for a raffle said sister mercedes firmly maria immaculata sighed perhaps you could arrange some tea sister mercedes sit down she smiled at rupert and taggie and pointed at two very hard straightbacked wooden chairs you must be tired after such a journey not when youve been travelling as long as we have said rupert thinking of the wretched years of miscarriages and painful tests and operations the trailing from one specialist to another not to mention the humiliation of the endless kgbstyle interrogations by social workers are you capable of satisfying your young wife mr campbellblack or would you be prepared to take on an older child one perhaps that was coloured abused or mentally and physically handicapped to which rupert had snapped back no taggies got enough problem children with me youre too old at fortyfour mr campbellblack by the time he or she is a teenager youll be nearly sixty im afraid if you want a baby you and mrs campbellblack will have to go abroad rupert gritted his teeth at the memory looking at the two of them maria immaculata felt that beneath his cool rupert was the far more apprehensive probably because his background which involved a disastrous first marriage a string of affaires one illegitimate daughter the english social workers had hinted there might be others was much more likely to scupper the adoption he had however been an excellent father to his two teenage children and appeared to have a very happy marriage to this beautiful wife and who would not thought maria immaculata admiring taggies sweet face now that the sun curiously peering through the bougainvillaea had added a glow to her blanched cheeks the hand not clutching ruperts was now rammed between her slender thighs to stop them shaking it was also noticeable how she winced every time the crying of a baby in the orphanage could be heard over the wistful chant of womens voices coming from the chapel over herbal tea so disgusting rupert suspected it had been made from sister mercedes beard shavings it was agreed taggie should spend the next three weeks helping in the orphanage to indicate her suitability as a mother rupert would drop her off and collect her in the evenings there was no way sister mercedes was going to let him loose among her novices as a rule couples were never shown their prospective baby at a first interview but maria immaculata was so charmed by taggie trying so heroically to hide her longing that she reached for the telephone and gabbled a few sentences sister mercedes pursed her thick lips it was all going too fast rupert whod picked up some spanish on the international showjumping circuit went very still what if they produced a hideous baby taggie had such high expectations you may find you cannot love the baby we have chosen for you said maria immaculata as though reading his thoughts but our babies are like gold to us and we in turn may decide you are not the right parents to have one but we thought there was a knock on the door and a beautiful young nun in a snowwhite habit whose dark eyes widened in wonder as she saw rupert came in bearing a tiny bundle hidden in a lace shawl this is sister angelica who runs the nursery said maria immaculata i wouldnt mind taking that home thought rupert irrationally we thought mr and mrs campbellblack might like a glimpse of baby bianca went on maria immaculata this time the hibiscus really did go flying as taggie leapt up and stumbled forward drawing back the shawl and gazing down in wonder at the little crumpled face oh look she whispered oh may i hold her oh rupert oh look she gasped taking the fragile body in her arms as if it were the christchild itself thought sister angelica taggie gazed and gazed look at her tiny nose and her perfect ears and her long fingers and shes got little fingernails already and eyelashes and her skins like ivory oh rupert was anything ever so adorable taggies gruff voice broke and her tears splashed down onto biancas face waking her so the baby blinked and opened big shiny black eyes oh thank you shes so beautiful sobbed taggie it was as instinctive as one of his brood mares nuzzling and suckling a newborn foal suddenly rupert didnt need that cocaine hit after all seeing the look of pride and triumph on his face maria immaculata mopped her eyes sister angelica was openly crying as she dabbed joy behind her ears only sister mercedes looked as though her big end had gone there i mustnt monopolize her you must hold her taggie turned to rupert but rupert was only happy because taggie was overjoyed to him bianca was just a blob in fact the only baby hed ever liked had been his daughter tabitha perhaps bianca sensed this because when she was handed over to him she went absolutely rigid screamed and even regurgitated milk over his blazer until sister angelica laughing removed her meanwhile a dazed taggie was hugging maria immaculata i know its only the beginning and shes not remotely ours yet but thank you she mumbled then turning to a still stony faced sister mercedes she settled just for clasping her hand youve all been so kind oh may i hold her again would you like to give bianca her bottle asked maria immaculata then ignoring sister mercedes to hell with the raffle added i think this calls for a glass of brandy all round i do hope youll be comfortable in the hotel sister mercedes has chosen for you it is very convenient only three kilometres from the convent to rupert the red parrot was sister mercedes revenge a twostorey cockroachridden version of the hair shirt having acceded to ruperts demands for double beds and airconditioning over the telephone the landlord alberto whose tight greasestained grey vest displayed tufts of stinking black armpit hair showed them into a room where the double bed wouldnt have accommodated two anorexic midgets the airconditioning consisted of wire netting over the window an electric fan which distributed the dust and the swarms of insects and a gap along the top of the walls to let in the blare of the television sets in neighbouring rooms outside the rickety balcony was about to collapse beneath the weight of two parched lemon trees in terracotta tubs and traffic roared both ways up and down what had been described as a quiet oneway street it was only when taggie looked round for water to relieve the parched lemon trees that they realized the nearest bathroom was twenty yards down the corridor seeing that rupert was about to blow his top taggie said soothingly that alberto couldnt be that bad did you see those sweet little hamsters running round his office rupert hadnt got the heart to tell her they were on tonights menu along with another colombian delicacy giant fried ants the only consolation he said crushing a second cockroach underfoot is that the press will never dream of looking for us here tomorrow well move somewhere else i dont think we can alberto just told me hes sister mercedes brother but they were so tired and relieved they fell asleep wrapped in each others arms in one tiny bed the next morning taggie shrugging off any jet lag was back at the convent blissfully happy to be looking after bianca and helping sister angelica with the other orphans having dropped her off rupert returned to the red parrot and spent half the morning on the telephone checking up on all his horses including his best one penscombe pride who had happily recovered from a nasty fall in the rutminster gold cup rupert also tried to cheer up his favourite jockey lysander hawkley who was suicidal because his old horse arthur had collapsed and died within a whisker of winning the gold cup and because the girl he loved kitty rannaldini was showing no signs of leaving her fiendish husband no arthur and no kitty rupert i dont think i can stand it afterwards rupert visited the ministry of foreign affairs in bogotá as a former government minister he wanted to see how many strings he could pull and how much red tape he would have to cut through to enable them to take bianca back to england he lunched with a polo friend a sleek charming playboy called salvador molinari who offered him a cocaine deal you know so many reech people rupert the deal would have sorted out all ruperts problems at lloyds regretfully he refused ive got to behave myself sal until weve got bianca safely home later in the avenida jiminex rupert bought some cheap emeralds from a dealer for taggie his daughters perdita and tabitha and dizzy his head groom in bogotá beside the darkhaired darkeyed colombians rupert was as flashily conspicuous as a kingfisher leaving the dealers he was stopped by a policeman pretending to be doing an official search who then tried to make off with ruperts rolex and his wallet being still high from a cocaine hit at the dealers rupert knocked the policeman across the street leaving him minus two front teeth and went off and bought a gun and a money belt on the way to pick up taggie the taxi broke down having asked rupert to give him a push the driver proceeded to drive off with ruperts briefcase containing the emeralds and all the adoption papers and medical reports stamped both in petty france and by the ministry in bogotá as rupert proceeded to shoot the taxis tyres out with his new gun two more policemen smoking joints on the pavement totally ignored the incident retrieving his briefcase finding excellent use for all the colombian swear words hed learnt on the flight over rupert went off and hired a bulletproof mercedes which made him half an hour late picking up taggie which in turn resulted in a sharp dressingdown from sister mercedes taggie she said had been worried and rupert had missed a chance to bath and feed bianca rupert tried not to look relieved as the old monster waddled off to fetch taggie he reflected that in a battle with his bulletproof mercedes sister mercedes would win hands down taggie reeled out in manic mood oh rupert shes so sweet shes wearing one of the dresses we brought and she drank all her bottles and sister angelica said she cried much less today and im sure she smiled at me although it was probably wind and sister mercedes was really friendly and sat next to me at lunch mercedes bent said rupert after a surprisingly good dinner at the red parrot of shellfish stew and mangoandguava ice cream enhanced by a bottle of chilean riesling they were just drinking to little bianca when taggie turned green and lurched upstairs glued to the only lavatory on the landing niagara at both ends she threw up and up and up into a bucket until she was only producing yellow froth and specks of blood a local doctor summoned by a demented rupert said it was only altitude sickness and prescribed rest in the morning when mother immaculata popped in with a bunch of roses from the convent garden and a bottle of water flavoured with lemonjuice and sugar she was happy to report back to the nuns that never had she seen a husband more devoted or worried than rupert by the evening taggie was delirious raging with fever too ill to be moved as various doctors supplied by salvador trooped in and out trusting none of them rupert was onto james benson his doctor in gloucestershire i dont give a fuck if its three oclock in the morning i want you out here give it another twentyfour hours altitude sickness often takes this form youve given her the wrong jabs you overpaid clown upstairs he could hear taggie screaming ill ring back redhot pokers were gouging out taggies brain she was being bombed by massive cockroaches the blades of the electric fan crept nearer and nearer like the pit and the pendulum it was getting hotter by the minute not a breath of wind moved the gum trees outside the rains were expected any day in her more lucid moments taggie screamed for bianca dont take her away i hate you i hate you she was pummelling at ruperts chest then at three in the morning colombian time as he was changing her soaking nightgown he thought he was hallucinating too and that taggie had turned into his first wife helen whose slender body had been covered with freckles then he realized it was a rash and was on to the hospital in a flash yelling at them twenty minutes later an old man arrived yawning with his suit over his pyjamas just shut up and leave me alone with your wife he was out in five minutes he had given taggie ajab to sedate her and curb the itching when the blisters developed she would need calamine and you got me out of bed for this he glared at rupert what is it for christs sake virulitis a little spanish is a dangerous thing rupert went ashen smallpox he whispered oh god dont let her die chicken pox grunted the doctor are you sure quite pretty uncomfortable in older patients now keep her quiet and stop her scratching pity to spoil such a lovely face dizzy with relief rupert belted back to the bedroom only to find taggie sobbing her heart out angel youre going to be ok rupert took her burning body in his arms but you mustnt scratch the doctor says i cccant see bianca for a fortnight or go near the convent in case i give the babies chicken pox theyll think im not healthy enough to be a mother theyll give her to someone else oh rupert i cant bear it ill sit with her ill go every day i promise despite sister mercedes furious chuntering maria immaculata was most understanding of course rupert could take taggies place his was the side of the marriage of which she was unsure it would be good to study him at close range two as sister mercedes grimly predicted rupert caused havoc among the nuns anyone would have thought a highranking archangel if not the messiah had rolled up as they made endless excuses to pop into the orphanage to gaze in wonder at this edgy sunlit stranger whose cold eyes were bluer than marys robes and whose hair brighter gold than any medieval fresco he also appeared to be poring over endless medieval scrolls soon pale lips were being reddened by geranium petals habits bleached to new whiteness eyelashes darkened by olive oil from the kitchen and beards and moustaches disappearing for the first time in years even maria immaculata discreetly wafting joy insisted on giving rupert religious instruction while the parish priest who was as gay as a meadow brown after summer rain bicycled over to preach a fierce sermon on the vanity of vanities the medieval scrolls were in fact reports on ruperts racehorses his television company and his various enterprises faxed out to the red parrot from england other faxes read more like an illiterate serial in a womans magazine as lysander ruperts jockey who was even more dyslexic than taggie joyfully chronicled the escape of his great love kitty rannaldini from her fiendish husbands clutches kitty had evidently made her getaway on the prince of darkness rannaldinis most valuable and vicious racehorse and managed to stay on his back until she reached lysanders cottage the horse had carried on into the village and trampled all over the vicars crown imperials rannaldini even more incensed than the vicar had retreated to new york to take over the new world symphony orchestra vowing vengeance and the besst news wrote lysander is that kittys having my baby in the ortum so biacna will hav sum ass to kik sorry yoov got to babysitt at least yoo can od on snow or dope botaga is sposed to hav the best grarse in the werld aware of sister mercedes massive disapproving shadow blocking out his light rupert hastily scrumpled up the fax despite being the object of every other nuns adulation rupert often wondered how he endured those long days at the convent there were only sister angelica and two novices to look after twenty babies in the orphanage which was part of the old chapel and had high windows out of which you couldnt see the din was fearful and when the rains came to the incessant crying of babies was added a machinegun rattle on the corrugated roof rupert was also exhausted having come to the end of a punishing racing season masterminded the entire trip to bogotá and worried himself into a frazzle over taggies illness he was woken all through the night by calls from tokyo kentucky and the middle east like bogotá the bloodstock market never slept but although rupert ran one of the most successful national hunt yards in the country he was coming to the depressing conclusion that if he were going to beat lloyds and the recession keep the estate going and support all his children including bianca he would have to switch to the flat full time rupert had always been a handson boss but as he gazed at the sleeping baby he thought how nice it would have been if he could have started handing over the running of the estate to his son marcus but marcus was a wimp only interested in playing the piano bianca was very sweet rupert decided and far prettier than the other babies but she slept most of the day and rupert had finished his faxes by ten oclock with plenty of time on his hands he soon noticed a nearby cot where an older child with a terrible squint and a dark magenta birthmark down the side of his brown face sat slumped gazing at the whitewashed wall the picture of desolation but when rupert stretched out a hand to smooth back the childs hopelessly matted hair he cringed away in terror whimpering like a kicked puppy poor little sod what happened to him beaten up and left for dead by his indian parents said sister angelica angrily they regard birthmark as sign of devil we call him xavier she went on but its him who needs saving he show no desire to walk or talk the doctor think hes seriously backwards when xavier was two next month he was destined for the state orphanage which meant hed almost certainly never be adopted even then hell be lucky sister angelica added bitterly all over bogotá you must have seen the posters advertising funerals always the government have purges in chile unwanted children are left to die in concrete bunker here they shoot any kid hanging round street because it make the place untidy outside the convent knee deep in mud a little graveyard lurked like a crocodile rupert shivered and noticing sister angelica had tears in her eyes put an arm round her shoulder sister angelica whod been plunging rose thorns into her flesh at night to curb her immoral thoughts about rupert jumped away but not before a glowering sister mercedes appeared in the doorway youre wanted in the kitchen sister rupert was so bored he started playing with xavier bringing him toys and sweets at first xavier shrank from him but gradually interest sparked in the boys hopelessly crossed eyes the next thing was to improve xavs appearance he shouldnt be wearing girls clothes rupert returned next day with a blue checked shirt and blue jeans to replace the flowing white nightgown it was then he realized how pitifully thin xav was the trousers which had to be rolled up at the ankle were meant for a one year old it took two hours four tantrums and two bars of chocolate to untangle and wash his hair the screams were so terrible that rupert had to remove him from the dormitory the novices were in raptures over xavs lustrous black curls sister mercedes looked thunderous she had spent her life in the prison of being ugly what right had rupert to raise xaviers hopes of escape the days slid by the rains continued theyd have to build an ark soon taggie made heroic efforts not to scratch her spots which were crusting over and beginning to drop off every night she bombarded rupert with questions about bianca poring over the polaroids he brought her but beyond telling her bianca had drunk all her bottles put on a couple of ounces cooed and slept there was little of interest to report instead he found himself talking about xav who was still shoving him away one moment clinging and tearful the next i took him a teddy bear this morning he totally ignored me and it all day he still hasnt forgiven me for untangling his hair but when i went he yelled his head off this had upset rupert more than he cared to admit but the next morning when he arrived at the convent xav babbled with incomprehensible joy frantically waving his little hands trying to express himself hes happy smiled sister angelica he refused to be parted from the bear even in the bath as bianca was asleep rupert gathered up a purring xavier and carried him across to the delapidated convent school where sister angelica to the counterpoint of rain dripping into several buckets was telling the children the legend of el dorado the indian ruler who had coated himself in gold dust before bathing in homage his subjects had tossed gold and precious stones mostly emeralds into the lake after him later the name el dorado was given to an equally legendary region of fabulous riches many of the spanish conquistadores explained sister angelica men who looked like senor campbellblack blushing slightly she pointed at rupert had died from shipwreck and starvation when they sailed across the oceans in search of the riches of the lake many more colombian indians she pointed to xav had been butchered in the process the pursuit of gold she added gravely as she shut the book will never bring happiness the only el dorado is found in your hearts rupert whod always pursued gold relentlessly and who had been wondering what sister angelicas legs were like beneath her white robes raised a sceptical eyebrow wandering out of the classroom he passed a pile of wooden madonnas roughly carved in the convent workshop waiting to be sold in the market examining one he was startled to find it opening to reveal a hollowed inside jesus what a country even the nuns were smuggling coke as noone was looking he slid the madonna into his inside pocket having lunched yet again on rice and herbal tea any minute hed turn into a bouquet garni rupert realized it had stopped raining salvador had invited him out to his house in the country to try out a couple of horses suddenly desire to escape from bogotá poverty and squalor became too much for him as sister mercedes was out no doubt terrorizing the poor rupert persuaded sister angelica to let him take xavier along too strapping him into the child seat in the back of the mercedes after the rain every blade of grass and leaf of jungle tree glittered in the sunlight like distilled emeralds xav gazed in wonder at towering dark grey mountains brimming rivers rainbows arched like limbodancing josephs he was even more excited by the fat piebald cows and the sleek horses knee deep in the lush rolling savannah round salvadors beautiful white colonial house salvador who was sleeker than a brylcreemed otter was seriously rich a monet a picasso and a modigliani hung on the drawingroom walls suntanned girls in bikinis decorated the swimmingpool sweeps of orchids grew everywhere like bluebells you like he asked rupert proudly of course its beautiful you should come in on that cocaine deal i have to keep my nose clean rather than running said rupert unhitching xav from the child seat ive got a lot of dependants anyway i cant cope with this country everythings crooked the police the government the customs men even the nuns how dyou live with it salvador shrugged we have a popular song in colombia if you dance with the devil you must know the right steps he was appalled by xav you said you were adopting lovely little girl we are just brought xav along for the ride salvador lifted xavs chin looking in distaste at the crossed eyes and the purple birthmark lit up by the sun and shook his head how old is he nearly two better buy him a pair of crutches for his second birthday then he can beg in the street he hasnt a chance once the nuns kick him out pity someone didnt give him a karate chop at birth after that rupert decided not to buy any of salvadors horses but if he hadnt resolved to switch to the flat he would have been sorely tempted by a dark chestnut mare leaving a trail of silver spray he let her have her head across the drenched green savannah forgetting everything in the dull thud of hooves and the feel of a fit beautiful horse beneath him he was away for so long xav had worked himself into a frenzy little runt seems quite attached to you said salvador in surprise probably the only good thing thatll ever happen to him come on then leaning down rupert lifted xav up in front of him and set off again he expected terror as he broke into a canter and then a gallop but was amazed to hear screams of delighted crowing laughter and the faster he went the more xav laughed redindian blood coming out thought rupert reflecting bitterly and briefly once again on his son marcus who was terrrified of everything particularly horses as they returned to the house for tea and rum punches three borzois swarmed out to meet them rupert missed his dogs terribly he had been very upset to find a drowned puppy in the gutter outside the hotel that morning hed probably grown so attached to xav he told himself firmly because he regarded him as a surrogate dog and he was a brave little boy when one of the girls in bikinis took him for a swim in the pool after an initial look of panic in ruperts direction he screamed with delight again hes a sweet kid admitted salvador as xavier tucked into one of colombias more disgusting delicacies cheese dipped in hot chocolate but hes still too bloody ugly on the way home rupert was held up by horrific traffic jams a solid blockade of lorries belching out fumes a bus had overturned tipping glass over the road and a van was being checked by the police xav however slept through the whole thing with a pang rupert noticed the beauty of his left profile now his black combed curls fell over his forehead and his birthmark was hidden as rupert walked into the convent he was confronted by a jibbering sister mercedes who snatched xav away like a female gorilla scooping up her baby how dare rupert kidnap one of the children he had seriously jeopardized his chances of adopting bianca how dare he raise expectations she shouted as a terrified xav screamed and sobbed as he was dragged away rupert flipped all thought of behaving well for biancas sake forgotten sister mercedes squawks in fact were purely academic there was no real likelihood of rupert and taggie being turned down all the official documents were now stamped and in private chats with maria immaculata rupert had agreed to donate a large sum to repair the school he had also had enough of sister mercedes if you dont shut your trap you disgusting old monster he yelled producing the hollowedout madonna from his inside pocket ill tell the cardinal exactly what youve been up to although hes probably in it as well and he stalked out dislodging most of the flaking green paint from the front door as he slammed it behind him back at the red parrot surrounded by polaroids of bianca taggie had not realized how late rupert was she had been wrestling with a letter to her stepson marcus wishing him good luck in a recital how on earth did one spell that he was giving at college next week she also begged him to come down to penscombe soon to hopfully meat yor nu sisster taggies desire to bear ruperts child had been intensified because she knew how much he wanted a son to run the estate this in turn would have taken the pressure off marcus saying rupert got on brilliantly with marcus had been the only time in fact she had lied to the social workers she was equally ashamed that the moment rupert walked in she shoved her letter under a cushion and launched into a flood of chat to distract him dr mendoza says im not infectious any more taggie was about to suggest they popped back to the convent for half an hour when she noticed the bleak expression on ruperts face and stammered that she couldnt wait to see bianca tomorrow morning fortunately rupert was distracted by the telephone it was declan ohara taggies father and ruperts partner at venturer television ringing from gloucestershire with his usual courtesy declan asked after bianca taggies chicken pox and then the hotel even fleas boycott this place snapped rupert get on with it declan what dyou really want as youre in bogotá could you nip over to buenos aires tomorrow its about two thousand miles some nip protested rupert taking a large glass of whisky from taggie didnt they teach you any geography at school i want you to go and see abigail rosen whos she about the greatest fiddler in the world and the hottest property in classical music said declan reverently they call her lappassionata i want to do a twohour special on her but her agents shepherd denston who are even greater fiddlers than she is wont answer my telephone calls youre so gifted at doing deals blarney wouldnt get you anywhere if i wasnt desperate to get out of this cesspit and i dont know anything about music bullshit your way through ill fax out abby rosens cv therell be tickets for you and taggie at the boxoffice rupert promptly rang and squared the trip with mother maria who delighted that someone had taken on sister mercedes was more than accommodating it will do you good to have a break enjoy yourselves i would give the world to hear lappassionata at least we can get out of this dump for twentyfour hours said rupert jubilantly your father wants us to chat up some female nigel kennedy youll love ba taggie was so desperate to catch another glimpse of bianca rupert agreed they could pop in to the convent on the way to the airport stopping off at a toyshop waiting for taggie rupert glanced at a cutting which lysander had just faxed out from the scorpion this claimed that rupert was giving sanctuary to lysander and kitty rannaldini now that shed left her husband and weaved in an old quote from rupert that kitty was well shot of an arriviste wop like rannaldini political correctness was never ruperts forte taggie by now had settled for a pink fluffy rabbit and a musical box we better move it said rupert adding a red racing car for xavier to the pile but one look at bianca was too much for taggie oh rupert dyou mind terribly if i dont come to ba rupert did mind terribly particularly when he thought of his battles with bureaucracy and his heroic devotion to duty while she had chicken pox the offwhite suit he was wearing was the only thing in his wardrobe that didnt reek of sick it was also the first time in seven years of marriage that taggie had admitted that she wanted to be with anyone else more than him but he was not going to show it why should i mind he said icily bestlooking women in the world live in ba thanks for the pink ticket not even caring that sister angelica was witnessing such a scene not bothering to kiss a horrified mouthing taggie ignoring the anguished bellows of xavier rupert stalked out of the convent nearly dislodging the battered virgin from her niche as he banged the door three ruperts mood didnt lighten until he reached buenos aires a city where he had often played polo and which he had always loved as he joined the crazy traffic hurtling along the wide streets elegant regal houses gazed down unperturbed over the halfmoon spectacles of their balconies even with a chill in the air and the trees in the lush parks already turning the merry inhabitants appeared to be holding drinks parties on the pavement outside every café after bogotá it felt blissfully safe for the first time in weeks rupert left off his money belt lappassionata posters were everywhere showing off abigail rosens rippling dark curls and hypnotic eyes like the leader of some dodgy religious sect as her latest cd of paganinis caprices had just topped the classical charts her face also dominated the window of every record shop and she certainly caused mayhem round the opera house huge crowds frantic for returns rioted and smashed windows motorists driven frantic by traffic jams anticipated the concert with a fortissimo tantivy on their horns rupert was delighted to flog taggies ticket for nearly a grand but was completely thrown on entering the opera house to see rannaldinis pale sinister face glaring down from posters in the foyer declan had foxily omitted to tell rupert that the new world symphony orchestra was touring south america and rannaldini as their very new musical director had flown down to ba to conduct them and abigail rosen in the brahms concerto rupert felt a rare wave of shame he and rannaldini had last met at the rutminster cup when all their horses had fallen and rupert had been venting hysterical rage on lysander in front of the entire jockeys changingroom for throwing the race rage which had turned out to be totally misplaced as a post mortem had revealed lysanders old horse had in fact died of a massive heart attack as kitty rannaldini and lysander were now happily shacked up in one of ruperts cottages the arriviste wop who regarded lysander as a complete dolt would no doubt suspect rupert of masterminding the entire coup rupert could have done without complications like this if he were going to sign up abigail rosen she was probably under rannaldinis forked thumb by now the fiveminute bell put an end to his brooding he had never seen a hall so packed people were tumbling out of boxes sitting in the aisles and on the edge of the stage standing four deep along the back and virtually swinging from the chandelier which hovered overhead like some vast lurex air balloon the orchestra were already on stage tuning up the only man in the place blonder than rupert was the leader of the orchestra julian pellafacini an albino with a deathly pale skin almost white hair curling over his collar and bloodshot eyes hidden behind tinted spectacles julian was such a brilliant musician sat so straight in his chair at the front of the first violins and had such a sweet noble expression on his thin bony face as he smiled reassuringly round at the other musicians that their only desire was to play their hearts out for him but beneath his air of calm as he chatted idly to the coleader beside him julian was deeply apprehensive that rannaldini would destroy his beloved orchestra now for example he was making them even more nervous by deliberately keeping them waiting the merry chatter in the audience grew louder as the glamorous bejewelled women tried to identify rupert rupert however was scowling at a tall selfimportant man with a leonine head and a glossy dark beard emphasizing firm red lips who was thanking the row in front in a loud booming voice for letting him in rupert loathed beards and he thought the man looked like one of those ghastly mormon fathers photographed in colour magazines surrounded by hoards of adoring wives and children and probably fiddling with the lot of them he was affectedly dressed in a frockcoat with a scarf at the neck secured with a big pearl tiepin rupert shuddered by strange coincidence the man was now smugly and noisily informing the admiring redhead on his right that he was christopher shepherd abigail rosens agent and showing her a haughty headtossing picture of his artist on the front of time magazine halting in midshudder rupert was about to tap christopher shepherd on the shoulder and make his number when the orchestra rose to their feet and in swept rannaldini to demented applause for a second he glared round at his new orchestra and raised his baton then the downbeat dropped like a hawk introducing the first doomladen octaves of the overture to verdis the force of destiny rupert was tonedeaf and bored to tears by music but hed had plenty of practice in being bored and deafened in the last fortnight and he had to admire the way rannaldini drew his orchestra together he might be small but he controlled every note every nuance every silence there were also some ravishingly pretty girls in the orchestra their split black skirts showing a lot of leg their eyes going down to their music then up to rannaldini as they bowed and blew with all their might rannaldini despite his icy exterior was in a blazing temper he had not only been vilely humiliated by kitty leaving him he had also been vastly inconvenienced in one swoop he had lost his whipping boy and his skivvy who had tolerated his endless exwives children and mistresses run his four houses and masterminded his multifaceted career with incredible efficiency since kitty had walked or rather galloped the prince of darkness out of his life rannaldini had gone through three pas in new york the fourth on the verge of a nervous breakdown had booked him into the ba hilton where his mâitresse en titre the great diva hermione harefield from whom he was trying to distance himself was staying instead of the plaza in the suite next to abigail rosen even worse the new pa had failed to order a white gardenia for his buttonhole and worst of all she had forgotten to pack his tailcoat rannaldini had been reduced to pinching one off the hiltons very reluctant head waiter which was far too big and every time he raised his arm he got a whiff of minestrone rapturous applause greeted the end of the overture but it was nothing to the uproar of stamping cheering and wolfwhistles that detonated the hall when abigail rosen erupted onto the platform rannaldini gave her several lengths start and speedily jumped onto his rostrum to disguise the fact that she topped him by at least three inches he then waited impatiently baton tapping as she shook hands with the albino leader then bowed and smiled at the orchestra before bowing and smiling at the audience her straight thick black brows above the tigerish yellow eyes her hooked nose huge drooping red mouth wide jaw thick dark curly hair only just restrained by a black velvet bow and marvellous sinewy body made her look almost masculine but rupert had never seen such a sexy girl her wonderful long legs were shown off by the briefest blackvelvet shorts while a fuschiared sleeveless body stocking emphasized strong white arms a broad rib cage and high full breasts totally over the top yet flaunting the fact that shed earned them were the huge diamonds that flashed on the bracelet on her left ankle as though ice flakes had drifted down from the great chandelier overhead and she certainly detonated her fiddle the brahms concerto is so difficult it was originally described as having been written against the violin after a very emotional beginning with a heaving ocean of sound the orchestra plays on for three minutes before the soloist comes in during this agonizing wait abigail seemed to quiver like a mustang trapped in the starting gates and when she picked up her bow even rupert had never heard anyone play with such raw passion and vitality her fingers flickering like flames her bow gouging out sound like a trowel digging for treasure she played with total concentration and a wild threatening energy and gave wonderful flourishes of the bow at the end of every important phrase as she prowled around the stage scent wafting from her hot body there was also something infinitely touching when she wasnt playing in the way she rested her head like a weary child on her twomilliondollar stradavarius and so spontaneous when she swung round and grinned at the first oboe whod gone quite puce in the face playing the ravishing opening to the slow movement several times however she turned to scowl at rannaldini his stillness a total contrast to her incessant movement with his sinister pallor midnightblack eyes and cloaklike tailcoat he was a dead ringer for dracula rupert was glad abigail kept making a cross of bow and fiddle to ward off the bastards unrelenting evil she had now taken up the first oboes luminous hauntingly beautiful tune glancing sideways rupert saw that tears were trickling down the wrinkles of the old woman beside him mon dieu oh mon dieu as rupert passed her his handkerchief his thoughts wandered to xavier poor little sod what chance did he have rupert had read that lasers could cure a squint and work wonders with birthmarks but he mustnt think like that taggie couldnt cope with two children particularly one so retarded he couldnt even walk the orchestra were into the last movement now a manic joyous gypsy dance with terrifying crossrhythms rupert could see the white glisten of abigails armpits the dark tendrils glued to her damp forehead god she was glorious there couldnt be a man in the audience who didnt want to screw the ass off her she was plainly into some horse race with rannaldini faster and faster neither willing to give in both her bow and his baton a blur the faster they went the more the great chandelier trembled and shot out glittering rainbows of light and at the end when the bellows of applause and the storm of bravoes nearly took off both roof and chandelier rupert noticed that although abigail collapsed into the arms of the albino leader and reached out to shake hands with the principals of the various sections of the orchestra she snatched her fingers away when rannaldini tried to kiss them this was followed by an insult more pointed when a pretty little girl in a pinkstriped party dress presented her with a bunch of red roses and she promptly handed one to the first oboe who had played so exquisitely viva lappassionata roared the audience until she came back and played a paganini caprice as an encore the orchestra who could temporarily forgive a hard time in rehearsal if the concert was a success were looking happier and in homage to abby the string players rattled their bows on the backs of the chairs in front until julian led them off for the interval the only person surprisingly who seemed put out was christopher shepherd whod been making furious notes on the back of his programme and who promptly disappeared backstage to see his illustrious client deciding also to give mahlers fourth in the second half a miss rupert followed him defusing the heavy security on the stage door with a good wad of the dollars hed been paid for taggies ticket hearing rannaldinis screams and seeing smoke coming out of the conductors room rupert nipped behind a double bass case and nearly bumped into rannaldinis mistress hermione harefield who was waiting to sing the soprano solo in the mahler she was wearing a white dress which looked as though a swan had forgotten to blow dry its feathers and was making it impossible for a makeup girl to touch up her lipstick as she screeched abigail rosen and i had a noencore agreement shut up you stupeed beetch snarled rannaldini we havent got all night and off they went hermione got her revenge by making the slowest entrance in musical history trapping rannaldini like a car behind a hay wain on a narrow road the crowd who had turned up backstage to congratulate abigail and get their programmes signed were disappointed when christopher shepherd went grimly into her dressingroom and locked the door the manager of the opera house was almost in tears over the vast fees he was having to fork out for abby rannaldini and hermione they cost more than the boxoffice receipts for the whole evening he moaned and he hadnt paid the orchestra yet nor the marketing people rannaldini ees impossible he told rupert bitterly he finded out how much lappassionata get and refuse to come out of his room until he get more he complain about her having too much publicity then when i arrange press conference he storm out because someone ask heem if his wife is coming back wise lady to stay away hermione is just as orrible the manager went on she see proof of programme and posters then wait until they are printed to complain they are not ok the poor man was only too happy to accept a further wad of green backs in return for secreting rupert in the dressingroom next to abigails on the adjoining balcony rupert could hear everything that was going on between her and christopher shepherd howard denston and christopher shepherd were the most successful agents in new york power brokers they moved conductors soloists and even entire orchestras around the world like chess pieces known as pimp and circumspect they complemented each other perfectly howard denston also known as shepherds crook was a beguiling wide boy from the bronx who pulled off the shadier deals and lent on unwilling debtors totally amoral he was only turned on by the big deal christopher shepherd radiating integrity and old testament authority provided the agencys respectable front christopher had orchestrated abbys career from the start settling fees monitoring her promotion providing encouragement and advice abby tended to play what he told her to because unlike most agents he was musical playing the piano and possessing a fine tenor voice having starred in many amateur productions he saw himself very much as rodolfo in la bohème hence the frockcoat and the pearl tiepin christopher had a parental attitude to his artists he was aware of the insularity of soloists the insecurity of conductors he knew that this resulted in huge egos that needed the public far more than the public needed them and that they responded as much to bullying as encouragement the instant he locked the door of abbys dressingroom she lived up to her lappassionata nickname dropping the red roses she was putting in the basin she bounded forward flinging her arms round his neck writhing against him covering his face that wasnt obscured by dark brown beard with kisses was i ok was i really ok omigod ive missed you how long can you stay on in the uk did you like the encore i need you oh christo i want you so bad she started to fumble with the pearl pin then changed her mind no lets go back to the plaza i cant be bothered to change abby had a clear carrying voice which had shed most of its bronx accent and which squeaked endearingly when she got excited christopher however was in no mood to be charmed dont be ridiculous repelled by her trembling burning sweatdrenched body which had once excited him so unbearably he prised off her hands and shoved her away how in hell can you expect to be taken seriously right when you come onto the platform dressed as a hooker those hot pants are so tacky pulling up a chair and like rodolfo sitting on it back to front as if to protect himself from further sexual assault he asked where are those gowns beth bought for you theyre too hot abby would have added too middleaged and too frumpy but she didnt want to insult christophers wife and why in hell are you wearing that even tackier diamond bangle round your ankle we all know youre coining it dressed like that youre an insult to brahms and a brilliant conductor abby was already prowling round the little room but at the reference to rannaldini her contrition evaporated hes a monster she howled he screwed me on every tempo dragging or pushing me on i nearly unravelled in the last movement has it entered your thick head that he might be right he only happens to be the greatest interpreter in the world only because he makes the most bucks thats all you care about hes an asshole dont be obnoxious exploded christopher why must you always telegraph the fact you come from the gutter and how dare you snatch your hand away when he was gracious enough to kiss it bloody judas kiss right the orchestra detest him and hes only been with them a few days they were really complimentary she added wistfully julian pellaficini said i reminded him of david oistrakh and hes played the concerto loads of times himself christopher looked at her pityingly dont kid yourself your exquisite sound had anything to do with the ecstatic smiles on the musicians faces they only rattled their bows so joyfully because your ostentatious and unauthorized little encore pushed them into overtime and all that posturing and writhing is so unnecessary give the audience an orgasm if you must but please dont have one yourself thats because youre not giving them to me any more said abby sulkily like a neglected wife finding comfort in a child she picked up her strad and dusted it down before putting it lovingly in its case and tucking it up in a periwinkleblue silk scarf thank you little fiddle she dropped a kiss on its curved scroll then turned defiantly towards christopher im not playing for that sonofabitch again sure you are christopher opened the fridge youre gonna record all the mozart concertos with him and the new world symphony orchestra for starters like hell i am fix me a vodka youre staying sober christopher poured her a glass of perrier cmon you dont want to catch cold get showered and changed and at dinner you will turn on what little charm you have thank you for making music with me maestro i was only acting up because youre so awesome maestro im sorry i broke the noencore agreement miss harefield you cannot afford to make enemies because you want to sign them both up hissed abby all right im sorry she was near to tears now i just want us to be alone but as she peeled off her fuchsiared body stocking christopher reached for her dressinggown the size of her breasts no longer turned him on only her enormous royalties please kiss me begged abby perlease we havent got time he was now flipping through her goodluck cards to see if they were from anyone important ive got a feeling beth suspects us he added on her way to the shower abby halted in horror oh no shes been like a mom to me well you havent behaved like a daughter to beth said christopher brutally how did she find out oh my god this is awful people are talking the corniest way of dumping a woman in the world thought rupert scornfully christopher was even more of a tosser than he looked rupert needed a large drink and he had heard enough emerging from the artists bar ten minutes later he found hermione coming off the platform still screeching not only had abby got higher billing but her applause had lasted four times as long seeing rupert however hermione halted in midscreech like a child spying a tube of smarties rupert campbellblack youve come all the way from penscombe to hear me sing i have too lied rupert you were sensational then you must join us for dinner just rannaldini me and christopher shepherd hes charming and abigail rosen shes a spoilt brat but we dont have to bother with her theres an official reception first at the british embassy i must look in because theyd be so disappointed she added as they were both nearly sent flying by musicians already changed charging out to find the nearest bar but you can come too she shouted over the stampede then were going on to dinner at wellingtons the official reception like all the diplomatic parties rupert had ever been to was held in a large highceilinged room with sculptured yellow flower arrangements on shiny leggy furniture and frightful oils of elder statesmen on eaudenil walls as april signalled the start of the argentine autumn the central heating was on at full blast having spent many years on the showjumping circuit and as a tory minister rupert discovered he knew plenty of people most of the guests however knew noone so they gravitated to the evenings two celebrities hermione who was now wearing a wonderbra and a purple chanel suit was livid that the crowd round abby was so much larger abby had changed into a very short halternecked dress in oystercoloured silk which clung lasciviously to her marvellous body her hair freed from its black velvet ribbon rippled in preraphaelite abundance over her shoulders she was still clutching her dark red roses whose long stems dripped onto her skirt moulding it between her thighs she was also wearing high heels which enabled her to see over the crowd to where christopher was having a competition with hermione to see who could crinkle their eyes at one another the more engagingly rupert halflistening to the ancient italian ambassador who like all ambassadors seemed to have once had an affaire with his mother was tall enough to watch abby over the crowd she looked wild vulnerable and on the brink of tears as she made heroic attempts to scintillate on the perrier christopher had forced on her politely signing programmes and answering silly questions about how she got such a lovely shine on her fiddle when the fifteenth person asked how she managed to memorize so many notes she finally flipped and snapped back by learning them as christopher was still arched over hermione about to free fall down her cleavage abby slid out of the group of admirers across the room and onto the balcony where julian pellafacini had commandeered a bottle of beaujolais and was quietly getting drunk easily the most diplomatic person in the room who had spent his entire career keeping the peace between troublesome conductors and temperamental players julian had suffered this afternoon the almost unique humiliation of being bawled out three times by rannaldini in front of the orchestra emptying abbys perrier over the balcony he filled up her glass with red wine after the stifling room it was blissfully cool abby breathed in a smell of damp earth moulding leaves and the distant reek of bonfires the full moon was untangling itself from the trees a round gold ball for orions dogs to play with wheres rannaldini she asked taking a conference call from japan or so he says with his blond hair even whiter in the moonlight and his long pale kindly face julian looked like the ghost of abraham lincoln whod had a premonition he was about to be assassinated rannaldini was so goddamned charming when he was guesting he said bitterly that the orchestra particularly the young players were knocked out when he got the job now theyre shellshocked like a bride waking up on the first morning of her honeymoon to find her handsome young grooms turned into a werewolf rannaldini met the second flute outside the elevator this evening alio leetle girl he purred i avent made you cry yet ave i julian shuddered and filled up his glass hes a lousy conductor said abby scornfully he only gets edgeofseat performances because noone knows what hes going to do next if you hadnt held the first violins back in the last movement id have come off the rails when she told julian about the proposed record deal with rannaldini and the new world he was delighted the orchestra would love it they thought you were terrific christopher didnt sighed abby then you need a new agent said julian angrily christopher once tried to get me on his books id probably be as famous as zukerman or perlman but i found him he chose his words carefully out of kindness too er forceful ive grown accustomed to his force sighed abby she jumped as the french windows opened but it was only a waitress after abbys autograph well trade it for another bottle of red wine julian emptied the remains into abbys glass where are you going next england said abby unenthusiastically christ id love to work there if i were single id take the next plane but the workloads insane you have to work twice as hard for half the money id never see luisa and the kids but my dream is to end up in the cotswolds leading some west country orchestra ill join you are you coming to dinner julian shook his head ive got to rally the troops stop them topping themselves or getting so drunk they dont make the plane tomorrow the orchestra was off to rio in the morning but lets keep in touch i dont want christopher to stamp out that individuality looking up at the sky abby noticed a drifting fleece of white cloud had put a great ring of motherofpearl edged with rust around the moon that moons got exactly the same roundeyed roundfaced pseudoinnocence as hermione said abby putting julians card in her bag god shes hell hell agreed julian the number of times ive seen her jab another soloist in the foot with her high heel to steal a bow through the french windows abby could see her agent putting his empty glass of perrier on a tray and picking up a full one hell dump me for hermione just as effortlessly thought abby in panic hermione who talked too much to drink a lot was merely bending over the silver tray to check her reflection placido is one of the only topflight singers like me she was telling christopher who doesnt have an agent but his wife is very supportive if my partner bobby wasnt so busy running the london met despite having christophers full attention she was miffed that at the other end of the room rupert was being happily propositioned by the ravishing wife of the chilean ambassador and that julian pellafacini who should also have been paying court was out on the balcony with that sluttish abby despite the tropical heating hermione gave a theatrical shiver could you possibly close those windows christopher i darent catch cold as placidos always saying ones voice is a gift from god one has a responsibility but christopher had already crossed the room come inside at once he ordered abby furiously youre supposed to be working and youre putting hermione in an awful draught how can you be so selfish i figured you were keeping her warm with all that hot air replied abby julian laughed christopher glared at him the moment hed signed up rannaldini hed make sure julian got the boot particularly as now he was wearing one of abbys red roses in his buttonhole grabbing abbys arm christopher frogmarched her across the room the french ambassadors wife wants a word about a charity gala i dont want to talk to her right you ought to do more for charity i do a great deal too much for help the agent christopher turned purple what has got into you you youve been so mean youve got to learn to take criticism hissed christopher aaah madame ambassador seeing christopher belting back to hermione a second later rupert decided to take the bullshitter by the horns trapping christopher against a large yucca plant he introduced himself as the chairman of venturer television why wont you answer declans calls no point said christopher dismissively abigails diary hasnt got a window in the next three years she talked to time declans the best interviewer in the world only take a day declan could come to you wed be talking six figures said christopher grandly then at ruperts look of disbelief added every thirty seconds someone buys one of abbys records ok we can get those kind of bucks anywhere and per cent of any overseas sales declan sells worldwide so does abigail she was in new mexico yesterday shes off to the uk tomorrow then paris berlin prague budapest moscow tokyo then back for a charity gala in new york declan could meet her in any of those hermione my dear your drink needs freshening and christopher was gone leaving an enraged rupert in midsentence christopher controlled abbys media appearances he knew there must always be something exciting on the horizon to tempt the record stores but he had no intention of letting declan loose on her the publicity would have been sensational but abby was much too impulsive and unguarded particularly after a few drinks with a grand inquisitor like declan she could easily break down and dump about her long affaire with christopher and her guilt about beth four outside a taxi was waiting to take them to wellingtons having installed himself in the front and abby and hermione quivering with animosity in the back christopher was enraged when rupert sauntered down the embassy steps and jumped in beside abby hi he kissed her cheek my names rupert campbellblack hermione invited me along rupert comes from my neck of the woods said hermione reverently christopher knew exactly whose neck he wanted to wring in the dim light abby was instantly aware of a flawlessly carved profile only softened by a beautiful curling mouth and an ironhard thigh rammed against hers because hermiones bottom had taken up so much of the back seat and you deserved every one of those red roses darling murmured rupert making a vsign at christophers rigidly disapproving back wheres signor ravioli hermione laughed heartily you mustnt tease him rupert hes taking a conference call from tokyo and meeting us at wellingtons rannaldini in fact was not ringing japan but pleasuring the second flute in the conductors room and then dispatching her to do his packing at the hilton he looked as smooth as hell when he arrived at the restaurant having changed into an ivory silk shirt and a black blazer with a huge wolf coat slung around his shoulders but the smug postcoital smile was promptly wiped off his face when he saw rupert and there was a dangerous moment beneath a large portrait of the duke of wellington wearing too much lipstick when they met face to bluespotted tie because rupert was so much the taller you know rupert dont you rannaldini gushed hermione no but we have my trainer jake lovell in common said rannaldini silkily who is about to oust rupert as leading trainer and who was a very great friend of ruperts exwife not a flicker in ruperts face betrayed how much he wanted to hit rannaldini across the room and we also have lysander hawkley in common he drawled whos an even closer friend of your present wife rannaldini i gather shes taken up raceriding and was last seen hurtling across country on the prince of darkness perhaps jake lovell could give her a job although i hear shes expecting lysanders baby seeing the murder in rannaldinis deadlynightshadeblack eyes christopher said hastily shall we go straight in dinner as a result was incredibly acrimonious scenes from the battle of waterloo depicted on the diningroom walls were nothing to the barrage of sotto voce bitchery flashing between rupert and rannaldini christopher placed himself between hermione and abby but just as he was ushering rannaldini bossily to abbys other side rupert nipped in and pinched the seat not having eaten all day he was more than a little drunk he was fed up with christopher for snubbing him and leaving him to pay for the taxi so decided to irritate both him and rannaldini by flirting with abby stung by christophers earlier rejection but believing she had a night ahead and a week in the uk with him abby had taken one incredulous look at rupert who was even more beautiful in the relentless overhead light and was only too happy to flirt back great entrance this evening rupert told her softly you and rannaldini looked like snow white and the single dwarf abby laughed he is single if his wifes just left him couldnt happen to a nastier man rupert unfolded her union jack napkin casually caressing her thighs as he laid it across them why does rannaldini detest you so much asked abby ive just heard him telling christopher you were the beegest sheet unhung i didnt know one hung sheets any more rupert smiled blandly at abby mrs bodkin our ancient housekeeper likes to hang them out in the wind but i thought you americans used massive tumble dryers abby burst out laughing you still havent explained why he hates you his wife whom he bullied and cuckolded shamelessly has just run off with one of my jockeys he thinks i orchestrated it did you rupert shook his head you should see my jockey hes so pretty everyone wants to ride him why dyou hate rannaldini he cant stop flaunting the fact that his trainer is the little sheet who ran off with my first wife did she marry him no someone else how very complicated said abby losing interest she was quite short sitting down noticed rupert her great height was all in her legs her pale face was shiny with sweat black circles hammocked the bags under the tigerish eyes beneath her chin and on her collar bone her strad had left red marks as though dracula had been having a good gnaw nanny would have recommended a good dose reflected rupert she was far coarser than taggie but still hellishly sexy the waiters were plonking down carafes of wine obscuring christophers view with a large vase of red dahlias rupert filled up abbys glass i know you probably hate to talk about work he went on having listened carefully to two australian pouffs in ecstasies in the gents at the opera house but ive never heard the brahms so lyrically played i wept in the slow movement the last movement really captured the hungarian idiom and in the first movement i never believed passages in tenths could be so clearly executed but with such a beautiful sound you must have a very big stretch he picked up abbys rather large stubby fingers for someone with such a little hand abby blushed with pleasure shed written this guy off as dropdead handsome beefcake and he really knew about music flustered she snatched her hand away and grabbed a piece of bread no bread abigail boomed christopher glaring through the red dahlias like moses on the wrong side of the burning bush he knew how soloists could blow up eating to stave off loneliness in hotel bedrooms biting her huge red cushiony lower lip instead abby studied the menu ill have spaghetti carbonara she told the waiter defiantly you will not snapped christopher ordering dover sole and radicchio salad for both of them and no sauce tartare he added bossily odd denial from such a tartar said rupert thickly buttering a large piece of white bread sprinkling salt on it in the argentine fashion and handing it to abby rannaldini was going so bloody fast i nearly had a bet on the last movement how much would he earn a night for conducting about one hundred and fifty thousand bucks rupert was appalled thats more than my best stallion gets for covering a mare con is the operative word remembering abbys cv rupert gazed into her eyes they were the same pale yellow as the winter jasmine growing round the drawingroom window at penscombe but the irises were ringed with black and the brilliant whites lined with the thickest dark lashes rannaldini had compelling hypnotic eyes too perhaps it was essential for a maestro i hear you want to conduct so i dont have to put up with schmucks like tonight isnt it enough being a genius at the violin genius is never enough said abby haughtily i want power nice scent rupert buried his nose in her wrist whats it called raw ambition your poxy agent doesnt want you to come on declans programme youd enjoy it declans a lovely man and edith spinks on our board shes a lovely man too spink squeaked abby in excitement i just adore her warrior woman suite a genuine talent spink even if slender id hardly call edith slender she weighed in at sixteen stone all of it muscle at our last board meeting when she came to my stagparty she drank everyone else under the table youre the dopiest guy again abby burst out laughing leaning back as the waiter laid a fish knife and fork on either side of her union jack table mat dont you have any control over your life taunted rupert abby shrugged and drained her glass i live on a treadmill hotel bedroom airport concert hall airport hotel recording studio recital back to the airport i know the flight schedules better than the brahms tonight ive slept in the most beautiful suites in the world but had noone to share them with lay down your brahms and surrender to mine said rupert lightly then he looked deep into her eyes holding them letting his own narrow slightly corny old tricks he hadnt played for years that is a terrible terrible waste how did you meet your gaoler my dad died early he didnt make any dough he never verbalized his feelings but he cried when he listened to beethoven and i loved him mom isnt jewish right but she became more of a jewish momma after she married dad she was the one who pushed me she still calls after every concert trying to control my life christopher heard me playing and signed me up when i was twelve he took me out of school in the states found me a good teacher for a year then packed me off to the conservatoires in paris and russia rupert let her run on it was quite interesting and he liked looking at her face which had great strength and at her breasts rising out of the halter neck i never had the life of a normal child she added finally music was the only thing that mattered and christopher rupert plunged his knife into his steak releasing the blood how long have you been sleeping with him abby looked up in terror eyes staring totally thrown howd you know please dont say anything christophers phobic about scandal his wifes been so darling to me mind you shes a yachneh then at ruperts raised eyebrows added dismissively a housewife with large boobs ive got one of those said rupert approvingly jolly nice too but abby was too distraught to laugh leaving threequarters of her sole uneaten ignoring christophers and hermiones looks of disapproval she lit a cigarette christopher never sleeps with her she whispered defiantly a husband said rupert idly is a man who tells his wife he never sleeps with his mistress and his mistress he never sleeps with his wife i used to be like that ive got a past longer than the bible what happened the burning glow of abbys cigarette was jumping round like a firefly in her shaking hand i married an angel said rupert abbys pallor was lardlike now beads of sweat kept breaking out on her upper lip and her forehead why isnt she with you she said sullenly shes in bogotá were adopting a baby how very caring of you hermione could no longer bear to be excluded from ruperts conversation to take on a disadvantaged youngster she added warmly if i wasnt concertizing all year bobby my partner and i have often thought of adopting a little sibling for cosmo cosmod probably eat it muttered rupert hermiones son created more havoc than most earthquakes of course cosmo is supergifted sighed hermione he could inhibit a less bright child hes such a plucky little horseman too rupert i thought you might give him some riding lessons rupert laughed at a scowling rannaldini lysanderd better do that hes the brilliant rider passersby kept peering in from the street outside then leaping up and down in ecstasy and pointing as they recognized abby in the restaurant diners kept coming over seeking her autograph and then noticing hermione and rannaldini wanted theirs as well hermione kept singing the same doomladen bars from the force of destiny rannaldini sipped white wine very slowly and stared covertly at rupert ironically until rupert had got involved with lysander rannaldini had always longed to be friends with him aware how much they had in common both men were extremely successful intensely competitive insanely jealous spoilt and ultimately insecure both had had mothers who hadnt loved them and had taken it out on women ever since except that rupert had got lucky with taggie deep down rannaldini was bitterly ashamed of being unable to sustain a relationship now he couldnt take his eyes off rupert searching for grey hairs red veins spare tyres some sign that the peacock feathers were beginning to moult maddeningly there was none he was dying to have a go at rupert but didnt want to betray his longing or the white heat of his animosity in front of christopher christopher was hopping mad everything had gone wrong he loathed not being in control hed wanted abby to be admiring and respectful to rannaldini so he could do a number on hermione but all either woman could do was to drool over that arrogant mischiefmaking brit who was now giving abby his card and writing the fax number of his hotel in bogotá on the back i hear youve got benny basanovich on your books rannaldini interrupted his thoughts but christopher didnt want to talk about benny there were many instrumentalists and singers on shepherd denstons books who would profit from an introduction to rannaldini that was another reason for signing up the great maestro but that could come later tonight all he wanted to talk about was rannaldini as hermione had gone off to the ladies in a huff because more people were asking for abbys autograph christopher said softly to rannaldini i want to put the two most explosive talents in the world together rannaldini glanced at abby she was a spoilt brat and not his type but hed always been turned on by indifference hed enjoy taming her making her jump reducing her to crawling submission he also wanted that mozart cd deal because he suspected the new world orchestra were not going to be the pushover hed expected the board had refused him the total hiring and firing rights hed had with his last orchestra it would be good to have a megarecord contract to bargain with he wanted the deal but not christopher as an agent christopher he decided was an avaricious thug ill have a dessert if you will christopher hermione had returned from the ladies face repainted reeking of arpège full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on desserts quipped christopher gallantly then whispered i want to set you free from rannaldini i want harefield to be an even greater name than callas hermione bridled my voice is considered far more lovely than marias i said a greater name hermione im not interested in money lied hermione my only desire is to bring music to the masses that was a good sign christopher thought shed just put her hand on his crotch but he removed it gently with a little squeeze and a tickle of the palm in case it met abbys hand coming the other way i get as much of a charge if solti says youre wonderful hermione as to hear builders on scaffolding shouting allo ermione loved your last halbum bort it for the cover but i loiked the contents hermiones cockney accent was quite frightful its the little things that matter like the ambassador this evening saying youre even lovelier in the flesh i hear that so often i dont know why abby caught ruperts eyes and giggled then picked up christophers hand examining the fingernails until christopher snatched it away asking sharply what she was doing look for pastry crumbs youve got fingers in so many pies shepherds pie rupert refilled her glass then dropping his voice whispered christopher wouldnt do business with me hes so grand he only talks to god and rannaldini answers i suppose abby nodded christopher wants me to record all the mozart concertos with rannaldini i wouldnt a beautiful pianist who was recording beethoven with him topped herself two weeks ago what was her name rachel grant ive heard her play she was a wonderful musician and rannaldini was terrible to his wife kitty for a second rupert shed his flip manner dont mess with him sweetheart hes evil hell break you hermione in between mouthfuls of chocolate mousse was humming the force of destiny again i had fifteen curtain calls when i sang leonora at la scala dyou remember rannaldini we could have a ball if you did declan murmured rupert hed had far too much to drink his message was quite unequivocal gazing into his beautiful predatory unsmiling face which for a second seemed unnervingly like rannaldinis abby thought how impossible it would be to resist him if he really put on the pressure and how gorgeous it would be just to take off with him into the pampas rupert heard himself saying god id love to sleep with you i dont sleep abby tossed back her black hair well have insomnia with me then they both jumped as rannaldinis mobile rang si si check eet again by that time i weel be weeth you switching it off rannaldini smiled round the table my leer ees grounded so i charter mexican jet one cannot be too careful i am so relieved we all escape calamity what dyou mean snapped rupert there is legend said rannaldini silkily that once the great chandelier fall when they perform the force of destiny keeling many many people i cant remember who was playing alvaro interrupted hermione but they say the leonora wasnt nearly as good as me always eet breeng terrible luck continued rannaldini tonight chandelier stay put but who knows where the ill luck will fall my orchestra were terrified he nodded coldly at abby as if to dismiss any complaints of julians that why they look shellshocked and thees is why i ave jet checked three times just een case rupert felt icicles dripping down his spine how could he have left darling taggie by herself in bogotá a handful of nuns was no defence she might be kidnapped mugged or raped by some junkie he should have put her in the hotel safe with the adoption papers your car is waiting maestro it was the head waiter are you coming rannaldini turned to christopher then added to abby with a sadistic smirk christopher hitch a lift weeth me back to new york i dont understand stammered abby christopher got to his feet ive got a helluva lot on in new york and meetings first thing he said placatingly ill get over to the uk later in the week red eye flight shepherds delight said abby meditatively then she went beserk you son of a bitch she screamed you never intended to stop over here or come with me to england and she hurled her glass of red wine at him so it trickled like blood down his white shirt hermione was suddenly looking very excited shall we have a quiet drink in my room she said turning to rupert but rupert had gone cursing himself for not stopping to recharge his mobile rupert raced for the telephone he was unable to get a squawk out of the red parrot terrified some ghastly fate had befallen taggie he urged his taxidriver who drove like the great ayrton senna anyway to go even faster overtaking rannaldini deep in conversation with that smug bastard christopher on the way once at the airport rupert managed to commandeer rannaldinis plane which was revving up on the runway rannaldini had been so gratuitously offensive to the mexican crew and insulted their honour by insisting on a third securitycheck that their swarthy piratical captain was only too happy to accept yet another bribe ill be so broke soon thought rupert ruefully ill have to take up conducting turning round the mexican captain alerted flight control and flew off to bogotá seeing rannaldini and christopher foaming on the runway rupert flicked them another vsign declan could do his own negotiating in future having fretted himself into a frazzle rupert reached the red parrot as dawn was breaking despairingly over the poverty of the city as alberto yawning and still wearing his grey greasy vest unlocked the door rupert grabbed him by the shoulders is my wife ok si si relief fuelled ruperts rage why the fuck doesnt your telephone work i suppose you havent paid the bill you idle sod alberto shrugged possibly small earthquake earthquake ruperts fingers bit into albertos plump shoulders until he winced only small one meesis campbellblack want to be near bianca so she sleep at convent rupert was so thankful he gave the rest of his cash to the beggars already out on the streets he found taggie still in yesterdays jeans and an old black poloneck she had spent the night in a chair with xavier still clutching his teddy bear and his racing car in her arms yesterday taggie had had a wigging from maria immaculata i have seen many couple here seeking babies and you have very good marriage your husband love you but dont abuse his generousness and take in every limping duck he may be jealous of bianca try to put him if not first at least equal taggie was utterly mortified and as desperate to see rupert as he to see her laying xavier down in the armchair she fell into his arms ive been so worried i love you i missed you so so much they cried in unison how could he have propositioned abby thought rupert in horror when all that was true good and beautiful in the world was in his arms he was murmuring endearments and was about to kiss her when xav woke and started to cry he missed you as much as i did said taggie in a choked voice he cried himself to sleep she stepped back quickly to stop the child falling off the chair but suddenly incredulous delight sparked in xaviers little face jibbering with joy he slid to the floor swayed on his feet then like a man in space took the first wobbling steps of his life towards rupert who leapt forward to catch him just before he fell appearing in the doorway a drowsy sister angelica crossed herself this is a miracle taggie burst into tears she knew she shouldnt push limping ducks on rupert but seeing him dropping the proudest kiss in the world on xavs black curls and rubbing his face against xavs cheek as he normally only did with puppies she couldnt stop herself i know its awful after you lost all that money at lloyds she sobbed and spent fortunes coming out here and we couldnt afford for him to go to harrow but couldnt we possibly take xav home as well she stroked xavs little hand now barnacled to ruperts lapel i cant bear to leave him are you sure you can cope with two babies muttered rupert when he could trust himself to speak at last theyll be a hell of a lot of work and a hell of a lot more red tape sister angelica was tearfully crossing herself over another miracle dyou think maria immaculata will throw xav in as a joblot if i restore the chapel as well asked rupert darling giggled taggie reprovingly but rupert had turned back to xavier tossing him screaming with delight in the air fasten your seatbelt xavier campbellblack youre coming to england ruperts euphoria was complete later in the day when he found a fax at the red parrot from abby saying shed like to do the interview with declan shed be back from her tour in three weeks could he write to her at her new york apartment and not say anything to christopher i hope you get your baby she had added at the end and he or she makes you and your angelic wife really happy he and she thought rupert jubilantly and two fingers to the force of destiny five abby whose tantrums subsided as quickly as they flared up was woken at midday by an enraged christopher who after interminable delays had finally arrived in new york and who immediately chewed her out for last nights scene he had dismissed it to rannaldini as some schoolgirl crush but he didnt trust rannaldini and even less rupert not to blab about it all over new york weve got to cool it for beths sake but i need you pleaded abby who was still groggy from sleepingpills at least answer my letters theyve got to stop too said christopher hastily he couldnt man his personal fax at all times and five letters a week reeking of amarige abbys sweet musky very distinctive scent and marked personal were not easily explained away sandras beginning to get suspicious sandra was christophers secretary a plump knowing blonde at whom abby had shouted too often when she was desperate to get through to christopher why doesnt she send on my fan mail and my clippings i need some feedback because its all answered in the office sandras perfected your signature so she can even acknowledge favourable reviews shell be forging my cheques soon christopher lost his temper i cannot understand your attitude a complete powerhouse at shepherd denston is devoted to keeping your particular show on the road so you can concentrate on music which was what you said you always wanted and all you do is winge howie howard denstons son who ran the london office christopher continued would meet her at heathrow and drive her up to birmingham where she was playing the brahms again with the city of birmingham symphony orchestra and for gods sake think of the agencys reputation and wear something long and decorous the symphony hall are generously allowing you to sign cds in the interval and remember only sign your name ok all those personal inscriptions and love from abigails just hold up the queue you want to excise love from my life you could fly out to tokyo oh hell she screamed theres someone at the door dont hang up please dont hang up outside were four smiling waiters all avid to have a look at abby as they wheeled in a massive breakfast for two champagne grapefruit topped with strawberries silver domes over sausages bacon and eggs a tbone for christopher croissants and blackcherry jam which abby had ordered yesterday anticipating she and christopher would be ravenous after a long night of love im sorry sobbed abby youll have to take it away rootling around in her bag she gave them two hundred dollars but when she picked up the telephone again christopher had gone nor did her spirits rise when she found buenos aires airport so upended by rannaldinis fury and his attempts to charter a new aeroplane that her own flight to heathrow had been grounded by a temporary strike abby who was wearing jeans and a purple tshirt had scraped her hair back and hidden her reddened eyes behind huge dark glasses but she never managed to remain anonymous a ripple of excitement went round the airport as the tannoy started belting out her latest hit next minute crowds were mobbing her yelling lappassionata lappassionata and nearly starting a riot abby then ended up on the same flight as hermione who despite her big black hat and her white chanel suit was deeply miffed not to be mobbed as well looking disapprovingly at abbys ripped shirt and wild hair from which the purple ribbon had been torn hermione said as they climbed the steps to the plane you come from a different generation of course abigail who are more concerned with lights and glitter and showbiz i couldnt bring myself to pose nearly naked on a record sleeve our generation were only interested in the music abby was about to snap back that nothing mattered more than the music when she gave a gasp of joy one of the inside firstclass seats in the lefthand row had been packed with hundreds and hundreds of scented yellow roses christopher hadnt forgotten he had done this in the early days of their affaire when he occasionally had been unable to travel with her then the furies moved in as hermione too gave a gasp of joy who put those lovely rosebuds beside my seat theyre for me mais non an air france steward shimmied up elles sont pour madame harefield an ecstatic hermione then asked the steward jeanclaude what a macho name to put the roses in water so abby could have the seat next to her she then proceeded to read out the accompanying card from christopher in which he said he was so jealous of anyone sitting beside hermione that he felt compelled to fill the seat with flowers i know hed have made an exception if hed known you were going to be on this plane abigail hermione went on graciously then he says lets see oh yes meeting you dame hermione actually im not a dame yet was like a dream come true i cant wait for our next encounter a ruse is a ruse is a ruse thought abby bleakly hermione must pay excess baggage on her hand luggage she reflected a second later as every steward was summoned to stow away squashy fur coats makeup bags endless dutyfree gifts for my partner bobby and our son cosmo i never come home emptyhanded into every available crevice and i expect a nice glass of bubbly and some caviar jeanclaude the moment we take off abby cuddled her strad case it was like travelling with a renoir she even took it into the john on flights those are exactly the words he once wrote to me she thought numbly as hermione lovingly replaced christophers note in its little envelope by the way ive got a present for you abigail perhaps ive misjudged her thought abby until hermione handed over a large signed photograph of herself and a tape of her singing strausss last four songs i was so touched went on hermione smugly that rupert campbellblack flew all the way from bogotá to hear me in the mahler he came to sign me up protested abby oh what was the use i must say for an older guy hes dropdead gorgeous did you notice his beautiful hands said hermione as though it was the discovery of the century oh get real muttered abby hes beautiful all over he has the most beautiful hands thank god the plane was taxiing along the runway whats his wife like asked abby not a woman of substance said hermione firmly thats why hes drawn to well more sophisticated and mature women like yourself said abby looking round for her sickbag indeed hermione bowed her head oh splendid here comes jeanclaude with the bubbly just managing not to throttle her particularly when she continued to sing the force of destiny abby pretended to sleep brooding on the tyranny of her life bound like ixion on the wheel of fortunemaking she had been excruciatingly homesick when shed been sent away to paris and russia she had never had time for real friendships with other girls or going out dancing or on dates dickering over lipsticks cooking disgusting dinners to impress boyfriends the grind of touring had just been bearable when christopher had been with her now she only had endless hours in bridal suites to contemplate her isolation the final straw when they finally reached heathrow was that howie wasnt there to meet her rosalie brandon his deputy was full of apologies benny basanovich the agencys star pianist had thumped a conductor in frankfurt and howie had had to fly off and sort it out he sent you his best abby theres a car waiting to take you up to birmingham i promised howie rosalie looked faintly embarrassed id escort mrs harefield home to rutminster were all frightfully excited about the possibility of having her as a new client she whispered ill catch up with you tomorrow youll love the cbso abby slumped in the front seat of the limousine cruising at ninety up the ml outside the spring barley shivered like animal fur cow parsley tossed on the verges the white spikes of blossom on the hawthorn hedges rose and fell like benny basanovichs fingers lambs slept beside their mothers cattle grazed towards the setting sun occasionally an adorable little village or a huge house at the end of a long treelined avenue flashed by all life going on without me thought abby despairingly inside the car was as coolly airconditioned as the bottom of the sea birmingham temporarily cheered abby up she was deeply impressed by the orchestra and the awesome acoustics of symphony hall her hero simon rattle however was in vienna and the guest conductor was a charming wily old fox called sir rodney macintosh short balding very rotund with twinkling pale blue bloodshot eyes and a pink beaming face above a neat white beard he wore a black smock purple tracksuit bottoms and gymshoes with holes cut out for his corns normally musical director of the rutminster symphony orchestra sir rodney was drawing to the end of a long distinguished career and knew everyone in the music world how did you get on with madame harefield was his first question as he gave abby tickling kisses on both cheeks i thought she was a cow rodney looked shocked thats very unkind oh god ive goofed thought abby very unkind to cows said rodney theyre such innocent sweetnatured animals and he roared with such infectious laughter that abby joined in leading her to her dressingroom he waddled ahead chattering all the time hermione didnt go to a very good charmschool did she darling if you want a laugh see her sing leonore in plumcoloured breeches got a bum on her bigger than oliver hardy i hear rannaldini was conducting in ba he went on defininitely top of the hitler parade darling a cold sensualist driven by lust that never touches the heart heres your dressingroom next to mine which is frightfully posh and normally belongs to simon rattle like a peep oh yes please said abby admiring the grand piano draped in tapestries the sofas the scores the big bowl of fruit on a marble table and the photographs of beautiful children in silver frames she would have a room just like that when she became a conductor her own dressingroom was full of flowers christopher she thought with a bound of hope but they were only orange lilies from howie sorry babe catch up with you later red roses and good luck from rupert bluebells and freesias from declan ohara when shall we two meet and finally great branches of white lilac pouring forth sweet heady scent in trembling anticipation from rodney abby hugged him if only she had a grandfather like him ill pick you up in twenty minutes darling abby was very nervous shed been up since six practising in her hotel bedroom between them rannaldini and christopher had destroyed her confidence but rodney was such a tonic although he had been known to crunch glacier mints filched from the leader during the cadenzas of soloists he disliked he couldnt have been sweeter to abby you are an artist dear child play at whatever tempo you feel correct and we will accompany you isnt it splendid he added as he led her into the vast soaring hall pity about the cherryred chairs ghastly colour but fortunately here theyre always covered in bums unlike rannaldini rodney was also adored by the musicians having kissed the leader on both cheeks he clambered laboriously onto the rostrum collapsed onto a chair mopped his brow on a lemonscented bluespotted handkerchief and beamed round at everybody thats the hard part over so lovely to be back with my favourite orchestra you all look so divine and play so wonderfully it doesnt matter a scrap i cant remember any of your names the orchestra giggled now i dont need to introduce this ravishing child shes had a frightful time in ba with rannaldini so youve got to be particularly nice to her the orchestra gave abby a friendly round of applause artists in their own right they were not overawed by soloists rodney opened the score and raised his stick now please play together boys and girls or i wont know where to put my beat abbys knees would hardly hold her up in the long wait before she came in but from her first note magazines and books were put down crosswords abandoned tax returns set aside and the musicians looked at each other in awe as the raw sad sweetness pierced the tidal waves of orchestral sound ravishing my dear rodney called a halt halfway through the first movement brass dearies itd be nice if the diminuendo could be slightly more pronounced ie shut up a bit then when a vital bassoon entry was missed agonizing over ten across dear boy its laocoon i always have trouble spelling it now you can concentrate on brahms much of the rehearsal was spent telling them about princess diana whom hed sat next to last night such a charmer and nodding off on the rostrum while abby and the orchestra played on regardless which orchestra am i playing with he asked being woken by a particularly noisy tutti the cbso maestro said the leader grinning ah yes now boys and girls why are we so happy because uncle rodneys in charge tiddle urn tiddle urn pom pom it was together when i sang it rodney lifted his stick again he had the weirdest beat very high and wavery like a slow drunken flash of lightning the best maestros like rannaldini had a distinct click at the bottom of the down beat so the orchestra knew exactly when to come in but when rodney was on the rostrum the leader gave a nod to start everyone off but it was very discreet because the orchestra had such respect for him i may go to sleep in the cadenza he warned abby when shall we wake you up sir rodney asked the leader when you hear me snore the orchestra were in stitches but despite such jokes and the legendary blaséness of musicians they all stood up and cheered abby at the end and they were joined by people whod crept into the seats all over the auditorium abby burst into tears and fled to her dressingroom rannaldini should be shot said the leader furiously rodney mopped abby up over a cup of earl grey tea insisting she have one of the sticky cream cakes hed bought in white cardboard boxes for the entire orchestra dont worry about this evening we will get ecstatic reviews because you are breathtakingly beautiful and because i am old and have a beard what an easy way to eminence to grow a beard if youre free we might have a little supper after the concert wont you be exhausted abby bit into a huge eclair certainly not ill have a good sleep during the maxwell davies which comes after the interval im off home to lucerne in the morning abby returned to the hyatt hotel and followed her usual routine eating a small bowl of pasta for lunch which gave her time if necessary to throw it up before the concert a precaution shed taken since bad fish had sabotaged her in tel aviv she then lay down but didnt sleep because she kept praying christopher might call an hour before she had to leave for the concert she washed her hair then warmed up for twenty minutes in her dressingroom changing and making up during the overture which gave her as little time as possible to be nervous in defiance of christopher she put on a very short sleeveless dress covered in midnightblue sequins which glittered with every movement and wore her hair loose but pulled off her face with a crimson bow she also ringed her eyes with black eyeliner but left off her mascara in case the brahms made her cry again rodney had the entire orchestra and the audience in fits of laughter when he waddled on to conduct the overture from il seraglio and sent one of the cymbals flying with his big belly his jaw dropped ten minutes later when he popped in to collect abby dear god child what a smasher you are i ought to wave a sword rather than a baton to drive them off and you look great too sighed abby i love that blackandsilver cummerbund madame harefield said rodney acidly couldnt think where id found one big enough if that woman were bowling for england wed have no difficulty retaining the ashes tiddle om pom pom dont be nervous birminghams in for a treat although rodney dozed off twice in the first movement he managed to wake up and bring the orchestra in after the cadenza the audience sat spellbound by the beauty of abbys sound and the sadness on her face abby always felt the last moments of the concerto were the saddest as the hungarian gypsy seemed to romp down the hill her feet coloured skirts earrings and dark curls flying then suddenly to break down like a mechanical toy and as the whole orchestra went quiet limp stumbling through the last two bars before the three final thunderous chords invariably when abby played there was a long stunned silence at the end as though it were intrusive to interrupt such sorrow and depth of emotion then the audience went wild breaking into deafening rioting applause rodney turned his plump hands apart his head on one side what can i say before enfolding her in a warm scented bearhug the audience crazy for an encore would have gone on clapping for ages abby longed to oblige them then to unwind slowly savouring her triumph but rosalie brandon having spent twentyfour hours humouring hermione was back in martinet form waiting in abbys dressingroom you havent time for an encore youve got to sign cds in the foyer and then ive arranged for an interview with the guardian and then were having supper with the independent abby loathed rosalie being present at interviews it had been the same when she was a kid and her mother had insisted on staying in the room when the doctor examined her im having supper with sir rodney she said firmly christopher never stops chewing me out for not brownnosing conductors christophers right thought rosalie beadily abby was definitely getting above herself rodney steaming like a pink pig in the conductors room as he changed into a clean shirt for the second half gave abby a jaunty wave as she passed by on her way to the foyer see you later abbygator six abby regarded rodney as far too old and gay to try anything so she was relieved when he suggested supper in the apartment in which the orchestra put up visiting conductors youve been stared at quite enough he announced as he emerged from the conductors room wearing a big black cloak and a beatle cap tipped rakishly over one eye he was clutching a clanking carrier bag just a few little extras from tescos and singing a snatch from la bohème come along musetta devourer of all hearts as they toddled across the square arm in arm passing cafés boutiques pigeons huddling in the eaves and a glittering canal the moon slimmer than two days ago but still sporting a rust halo was sailing through silvery wisps of cloud ring round the moon means trouble sighed rodney i do hope i dont get a tax bill in the morning the apartment was blissfully warm with a gas logfire which rodney immediately turned on looking down from the mossgreen walls were portraits of musics giants alfred brendel andré previn rannaldini giulini jessye norman simon rattle youll be up there soon said rodney pouring her a large glass of dom perignon then sitting down at the big grand piano whats your favourite tune abbys mind went blank rodney strummed a few chords and began to sing i love abby in the springtime i love abby in the fall i love abby in the summer when it sizzles then changing key and putting on a french accent thank eavens for abigail for abigail get beeger every day thank heavens for abigail shes grown up in the most exciting way he looked so sweet and naughty abby kissed him on the top of his shiny bald head having installed her on a dark gold damask sofa with the latest copy of classical music which had her picture on the front he toddled off to rustle her up some scrambled eggs abby felt herself unwinding for the first time in weeks oh why were all the sweetest guys gay when rodney returned five minutes later however he was brandishing the nearly empty bottle reeking of english fern and wearing nothing but a blueandwhite striped butchers apron rodneys down beat may have been wavery but nothing could have been more emphatic than his upbeat which was relentlessly lifting the striped apron like a shop blind my lovely child putting the bottle on the mantelpiece rodney advanced briskly omigod screamed abby flight to both doors was cut off so she took the only possible way out and went off into peals of laughter after a second rodney joined in and they collapsed on the sofa until the tears were running down their cheeks i thought you were gay because you kissed the leader and you were so sympatico said abby wiping her eyes oh my dear four wives to vouch to the contrary oh well it was worth a try you shouldnt be so beautiful and so tall those stunning breasts at eyelevel are beyond all temptation what happened to your last wife she died three years ago bless her wonderful old girl used to play concertos in her nightie so she could go straight to bed afterwards you must be so lonely not terribly darling ones always had a few little friends well put on a bathrobe and ill make the scrambled eggs after that they had a riotous evening with rodney regaling her with stories of the great henry wood gave me my first concert after i came out of the navy and my first cigar he was a charmer you should do a prom darling youd love it they asked me said abby wistfully christopher wanted too much money rodney frowned and topped up his glass of brandy ive heard that concerto so often but tonight you made me listen to it completely afresh i felt that strange excitement we all long for like the first time i saw david gower pick up a bat or the first time i heard jacqueline du pré pick up a bow you have two matchless qualities the ability to hold an audience captive and a unique sound that can never be mistaken for anyone elses but youre dreadfully unhappy arent you darling gently he massaged her aching neck so abby told him about christopher we call him christoofar over here observed rodney hes avaricious always pushes his artists too hard gets as much money out of them as quickly as possible before they burn out you ought to have been allowed to unwind after that exquisite concerto or at least have tomorrow off so you can have some fun and do other things i want to have a go at conducting dont know how ready the world is for women conductors mused rodney women in power are often unnecessarily brutal to their subordinates thatcher crushing her cabinet who reacted with appalling spite musically youre quite good enough darling youve got the authority too but concert tickets tend to be bought by women and queers he gave abby a foxy nudge in the ribs and they prefer a glamorous bloke at the helm and orchestras are very tricky youd only get by if they loved you what about edith spink protested abby ediths a chap and shes got her composing although her last symphony sounded as though a lot of drunken bears were having a saucepan fight i must go abby leapt to her feet as she suddenly noticed how old and tired he looked as he led her to the door he begged her to come and stay in his house in lucerne its on the lake and quite ravishing therell be no passes scouts honour and youre going to come and play for my orchestra in rutminster ravishing country there too and my boys and girls would love you shall i pack for you asked abby rodney shook his head the sight of you bending over my suitcase gently he patted her bottom would be too much for me goodnight my new little friend he stood on tiptoe to kiss her cheek youd have enjoyed it you know theres many a good tune played on an old fiddle and im a spring chicken compared to your stradivarius returning still laughing to the hyatt hotel and reality abby found an express parcel from christopher frantic with excitement hoping for a gold bracelet or even a diamond pin as an act of atonement abby ripped it open and found six copies of the cd contract for the mozart concertos it was covered in primroseyellow stickers telling her where to sign also enclosed was a brusque note from christopher ordering her to return the contracts at once a car would be waiting at heathrow tomorrow to take her on to a rehearsal and recital at the wigmore hall the next day she would start recording the bartók concerto with the lso if declan ohara or rupert campbellblack try to contact you i cannot urge you too strongly to resist them ended christopher thats the one thing that could screw up the rannaldini deal i better call rupert at once thought abby five mozart concertos music she loved spoilt for ever by bullying and screaming matches her shoulders her arms her back and her neck still ached in the old days christopher had cured her rubbing in tiger balm a mixture of herbs and menthol and sooner or later his fingers had crept downwards in pursuit of pleasure abby groaned at the memory taking her violin from its case she cleaned its strings with eaudecologne then dusted its smooth flanks and delicate neck curving over into the seahorse head its you and me against the world little fiddle she said sadly if i dont play you well enough the bank will take you back again you must have witnessed so much misery in two hundred and eighty years but have you ever been played by anyone as lonely and unwanted as me but that wasnt true rupert had wanted her and mens hands had trembled when theyd asked her to sign their records this evening even rodneys jovial elephantine pass had made her aware she was desirable she was only so isolated because christopher when he had wanted her had not wanted witnesses and had driven away all her friends and even her noisy fat mother pacing her room all night she watched the sky lighten and the city emerge far below she could now see a row of pretty pastel houses the kind she would have loved to have settled down in lining the bottlegreen oily waters of the canal on which floated brightly coloured barges attached at the centre like the petals of a flower all round was debris where bulldozers and cranes were in the process of flattening beautiful old russet buildings churches meeting houses and a factory with tall pipes ill be bashed down before i have any chance to enjoy life thought abby her eyes following the path of the canal which flowed under roads and bridges past a man throwing sticks for his shaggy white dog along a row of dark cypresses into the mist keeping its head down amid the hubbub of the city the hands of the little red clocktower merged into one at sixthirty abby flipped she was enmeshed like laocoon she had to break free first she chucked rannaldinis contracts out of the window blue birds of unhappiness they wheeled downwards then she took the earliest shuttle to heathrow and booked herself onto concorde buoyed up by an excess of champagne she wept over a piece in the independent about rachel grant the beautiful pianist whod been recording the beethoven concertos with rannaldini she had evidently driven over a cliff because shed seen a picture in the scorpion of her husband sneaking out of the apartment of a former mistress what a tragic loss to music wrote the reporter abby got stuck back into the champagne im immortal she thought drunkenly as they approached new york i could fly this aeroplane if they asked me and i can fly straight back into christophers heart still feeling immortal she called christopher on landing but was utterly deflated to be told he was out sandra his manipulative blonde secretary had gone to the dentist christophers mobile had also been switched off he was probably at a recording session where they were not popular in despair plunging down from the champagne abby took a taxi to her riverside apartment geography was taking over this was new york every brick and street number reminded her of once being happy with christopher the river looked grey seallike and unfriendly boats were chugging sluggishly upstream like commuters someone had left the elevator door open so she had to hump her bags up five floors letting herself in abby gave a sigh of pleasure to see the pale peach walls the dark peach carpet going into the livingroom she was startled to find an empty bottle of champagne two glasses and a bunch of pale yellow roses roughly rammed into a vase abbys first terrified thought was burglars her eyes raced round the walls and furniture checking pictures ornaments and silver but everything seemed in place then as painful as stubbing ones toe on a dog bowl in the dark she noticed the grey pinstripe jacket hanging on a chair what too was the crocodile wallet shed given christopher doing on the glass table beside the keys shed lovingly had cut so he could let himself into the apartment a letter from rupert had already been opened somehow abbys buckling legs carried her next door she had always wanted a beautiful bedroom other stars celebrate overnight fame with ferraris yachts or picassos or a central park penthouse but abby as she practised nine hours a day and faced tiny indifferent audiences in draughty halls had only dreamt of a bower of bliss in the centre of the room was a vast fourposter richly swagged with crimson velvet handprinted with vast blushpink peonies half a dozen white lace pillows reared up like the himalayas against the wroughtiron bedhead which had been intricately woven into a pattern of treble and bass clefs perfect to cling onto when she writhed like an electric eel above and below christopher she had called in a lighting specialist to cast a flattering rosy glow so that christopher unlike tithonus would never grow old on the walls was more crimson velvet on the polished floor rosepatterned rugs and on the scarlet lacquer bedside tables where shed left them ten days ago were two huge vases of lilies whose petals were beginning to droop and wrinkle like old limp hands the only blot on her bed of crimson joy was christopher filling his secretary sandra in very nondental fashion the horrified silence was broken by abby thats why you kept on at me to buy a new york apartment so you could send me off on tour and hump this fat tramp in comfort she yelled why didnt you use the office carpet or the back seat of the volvo like we used to does beth know about sandra i figured it was key not to upset beth looking round she noticed the closet doors were open sandra had obviously been trying on her clothes a peacockblue party dress lay inside out on the floor a bottle of lemonandrosemary oil stood unstoppered by the bed im surprised you bother with that stuff sandra abby addressed sandra almost chattily the only thing christopher enjoys having massaged is his ego for a frozen moment christopher panicked then he wriggled out from underneath sandra and wrapping a red towel round his loins advanced on abby what the hell are you doing here he thundered how dare you let the wigmore hall down i hope you werent photographed coming off the aeroplane or theyll figure youve accepted another booking shepherd denston are backing that concert we stand to lose a lot of money he glanced at his watch on the bedside table unless you get back on that aeroplane at once abby looked at him in bewilderment i cannot believe what im hearing holding her hands over her ears she stumbled out to the kitchen christopher followed her determined to bluff it out how dare she treat with rupert behind his back how dare she leave rosalie in the lurch and swan off with that old reprobate rodney macintosh abbys eyes were rolling she was as grey with shock as the river outside christopher could smell the champagne sour on her breath he was just reaching the fortissimo climax of his fury when abby told him she had chucked rannaldinis contract out of the window its now being dumped on by birmingham pigeons which is what it deserves you dont give a fuck about me im just the eternal jackpot on the fruit machine how many millions of notes have i played to buy this apartment and youve just desecrated it well youve blown it this time seizing the carving knife which sandra had used to level the bottom of the rose stems abby bent back her other hand almost abstractedly examining the veins faint as biro marks on the inside wrist then raising the knife she made a deep cut half an inch above her watchstrap seeing her hand hanging like a snowdrop spurting blood and the agencys livelihood gushing away christopher leapt forward to stop her slashing her right one not your bowing hand for christs sake seven abby was raced to hospital micro neuro and plastic surgeons jetted in from all over the world to save her career after a sevenhour operation including a massive blood transfusion they managed to repair both the tendons and the arteries and suture the nerve sheaths as the nerves had been severed she was spared a lot of pain when she came round that would come later as the nerves grew back pitifully slowly at a millimetre a day she was kept heavily sedated with tranquillizers antibiotics and painkillers pouring in through the drip counsellors poured in too and physiotherapists to waggle gently the lifeless fingers abby had no movement left she couldnt cup her hand move her thumb across to her little finger or open and shut or splay her fingers at all she would have to wear a splint for months to stop her hand contracting like a vultures claw which meant all the muscles would waste abby asked only one question would she ever play the violin again in time said the chief consultant if you persevere with the physio the nerves will take at least a year to regenerate then well be able to tell more whether youll ever play to concert standard is doubtful theres too much pressure put on young soloists today abby was devastated there were fears for her sanity as she sobbed uncontrollably for hours on end or gazed blankly into space how could she have deliberately destroyed her godgiven talent just to break out of christophers boaconstrictor stranglehold to spite him because he no longer loved her christopher had tried to hush up the story arrogantly ordering abby to say nothing as he passed himself off as the lone boyscout hero whose tourniquet had saved abbys life unfortunately the porter in abbys block had noticed sandra going in and out who could forget those knockers in a hurry christopher had also patronized and ridden roughshod over too many people and wriggled out of paying for too many lunches to have many friends in the press the result was a monumental scandal particularly at such a tragic loss of a unique talent tigress and cheater shouted the headlines over huge pictures of a smouldering abby and a sanctimonius christopher christopher had also lied about the fact that beth had found out she had had no idea and was wiped out by such betrayal which made abby feel infinitely worse nor were matters helped by hermione who was at first irked by the massive coverage then when it showed no signs of abating decided to cash in and fly to new york caring hermione in mercy dash announced the scorpion with a picture of the great diva on the hospital steps clutching a bunch of already drooping roses and her latest cd label out as presents for abby ignoring the fact that after thirty seconds abby had rung down in hysterics to have her chucked out hermione afterwards told the army of reporters that she had advised abigail to involve herself in charity work think of the poor people of rwanda i urged her at least you are being looked after by wonderfully caring hospital staff i hope the sacred message of my latest cd heavenly hermione will bring her spiritual refreshment abby whod had to be given a massive shot of valium wasnt remotely cheered up five minutes later when rupert sauntered in he was in new york to check out laser surgery for xavs birthmark and arrived with a carrier bag over his head what in hell are you doing snarled abby hiding from hermione shes only interested in your beautiful hands and theyre still on show actually shes far too busy fighting for access to the makeup department with all those consultants who are becoming television stars providing bulletins on your progress he removed the carrier bag and smoothed his hair he was wearing a loveinthemist blue shirt which matched his long blue eyes which in turn matched the patch of blue sky which was all abby could see through her window part of a sunny outside world which seemed lost for ever poor old duck said rupert remembering the bleak horror of taggies miscarriages it must be like losing a baby far far worse abby snapped like losing a thousand babies every time i played a concert i gave birth rupert was appalled by her appearance a forelock of dark hair fell damp and flat to her eyebrows her fleshless face was dominated more than ever by the haunted heavily shadowed yellow eyes the only plumpness left was in the curve of her lower lip she had lost twenty pounds seeing her huddled wideshouldered longlegged body rupert was reminded of some shellshocked youth fatally wounded in the trenches getting out his fountainpen he drew a blue cross on the inside of her right wrist just where it joined her hand this is the place if you want to top yourself properly you did it too far up the arm just means the nerves take longer to grow back will they course they will i had no feeling for six months after i trapped a nerve at the la olympics ricky francelynchs arm took nearly three years my soninlaw lukes hand was pulverized by a polo ball we all got better he had brought her a bunch of lilies of the valley and a little silver replica of a head of garlic thats to ward off evil youre to keep it beside you all the time taggies also made you a tin of fudge she sent love and said she was dreadfully sorry thanks said abby listlessly did you get your baby we got two xavier and bianca flew them home last week the grooms had hung a welcome home banner across the gate and balloons all up the drive edith spink brought the cotchester chamber orchestra over in a bus to play congratulations all the dogs had bows it was great xavier couldnt believe his eyes hes walking all over the place now and his first word was daddy so hes obviously going to be a diplomat rupert gave a big yawn sorry were not getting much sleep at the moment biancas routines all out of sync his tearing spirits made abby feel even more dreadful particularly as they kept being interrupted by nurses popping in to check abbys fingers for gangrene and gaze at rupert they never allow me a second to brood groaned abby and oh god the counsellors due at three oclock dont believe in that crap said rupert only person who can sort you out is yourself counsellors are flooding into penscombe at the moment theres a ghastly beard with an adams apple whos got a crush on taggie and keeps forecasting disaster because weve adopted a black child he asked me yesterday whether i was going to teach xav the customs of his country did he want me to give xav a line of coke for breakfast i said but abby wasnt listening being too wrapped up in her own tragedy i cant do declans programme now she said sulkily if thats what youve come for ruperts face softened i came to see you because i was dead worried and because i like you a lot classical music bores the tits off me reminds me of my first wife but you made it as exciting rupert cast round as a good gold cup abby started to cry rupert took her in his arms for a second abby clung to him enjoying the muscular warmth then as the counsellor came in she screamed with rage is there no peace except beyond the grave dont talk like that chided the counsellor shes doing great she added to rupert i must go rupert got to his feet the only answer he ruffled abbys hair is to become a conductor that shit rannaldini needs some competition shepherd denston who were in turmoil were fast coming to the same conclusion if only abbyd done the job properly grumbled howard on a conference call to christopher and young howie in london she could have become a cult figure like james dean or marilyn monroe not enough mileage said young howie shes better alive we gotta find something for her to do shepherd denston needed the money it was not just the houses on long island and the old masters and young mistresses acquired on the expectation of abbys massive income the agency had also extended themselves dangerously backing concerts throughout eastern europe only to find the newly free populations were hungrier for new cars than culture what a pity that contract with rannaldini never got signed said howard we better get her strad back said christopher briskly cant let it lie idle maria needs a decent instrument maria kusak was abbys bitterest rival one of the agencys rising stars fact that abbys pulled through suicide like coming off drugs or cracking anorexia is gonna evoke public sympathy said howie then groaned as his secretary handed him a fax saying that benny basanovich had been so drunk in munich hed skipped pages of prokofievs third concerto before falling off the pianostool the only answer said howard is for her to learn to conduct while we see if her hands gonna recover for now though abby must leave the limelight until the scandal had died down sir rodney macintosh whod said some uncomfortingly sharp things to christopher after the accident gallantly came to the rescue and offered abby the use of his house on lake lucerne the wild flowers are out of this world darling and the mountain air is purer arid more exhilarating than krug rodneys ancient housekeeper gisela who was used to temperamental artists would build up abbys strength there was every score in the world to work on she could have a resident physio and a succession of student conductors to teach her the rudiments christopher everyone decided must bow out of abbys life another reason why lucerne was a good idea her career in future would be handled by the london office and when he wasnt racing all over europe to sort out the chaos caused by benny basanovich by howie denston eight clutching her silver clove of garlic abby arrived in lucerne rodney met her and with a series of loud bangs singing all boys are cheap today cheaper than yesterday to the tune of la donna e mobile drove her out to his house along the lake known as flashers folly it stood on the town side of a wooded peninsula which seemed to crawl into the lake like a huge furry caterpillar the house itself was square black gabled with a mossy red roof and warm yellow walls smothered in white wisteria the oak front door was thirty yards from the waters edge behind the house was a lawn flanked by honeysuckle rose colonnades and a water garden fed by two springs separating the garden from the mountains was an orchard and a copse of linden trees rodneys fourth wife the one whod played concertos in her nightie had plainly been a wonderful gardener weve had some great parties over the years rodney squeezed abbys shoulder in heatwaves we often bathed starkers in the lake at midnight the entire attic was set aside for rodneys train sets he could run ten trains simultaneously along the tracks without any crashes the secret of conducting is to be able to do ten things at once abbys big bedroom took up most of the second floor and had windows front and back as well as a fourposter with sprigged whiteandyellow muslin curtains it contained a piano a record player bookshelves packed with every score from purcell to gorecki a stuffed bear wearing a victorian bishops mitre and among other pictures on the pale parmaviolet walls a portrait of rodneys second cousin myrtle whod become a missionary apart from gisela the household included rodneys cat shostakovich a huge indolent charmer with long grey hair and big orange eyes who usually lay around in pools of sunlight but who was currently weaving round abbys legs being driven crazy by a heady smell of coq au vin from the kitchen oh wow how lovely to have a cat ecstatically abby bent to stroke shosty as he was known but as she gathered him up her left hand couldnt support him and he crashed to the floor flouncing off on fluffy grey plusfours lands on his feet like his master said rodney reassuringly like rupert he was horrified by abbys appearance so tall thin and pale a tree stricken by lightning she touched her left hand constantly desperate for the return of any feeling to distract her he led her to the front window outside the shimmering pale blue lake seemed to merge into the powderblue mist and the greyblue sky without any horizon but gradually snowy white peaks began to appear look darling theyre all coming out to welcome you those are the riga mountains and that big crooked peak is mount pilatus named after pontius pilate legend has it that after he sentenced christ to death he came here to suffer for his sins pilate and me thought abby bleakly i can think of worse places its better than croydon said rodney woods were now emerging on the opposite shore now you can see tribschen he went on pointing to the prettiest white dolls house on a high grassy mound where cosima lived with wagner and before he became a conductor hans richter worked there as wagners secretary richter for a second abby was roused out of her apathy my hero he was such a brilliant musician orchestras just adored him she didnt add that with his beard mane of hair broad shoulders and air of authority richter had looked rather like christopher richter however had been a devoted husband a christopher with honour but she must forget christopher hopelessly she clutched her silver garlic aware of her misery rodney pointed to an island of trees rising out of the water about fifty yards from the shore after a long day of copying out the mastersingers richter a very strong man used to row across the lake from tribschen at dusk embark on that island and practise the french horn thus starting another legend of a mysterious ghost horn player leaning out of the window on those early summer evenings waiting for the stars to come out abby often imagined she could hear the first sweet notes of a horn but they were only owls hooting and the cries of the water birds looking back on her first few months in lucerne abby was appalled that she behaved quite so horribly generous passionate demanding workaholic her last twelve years had been dominated by christopher and more recently by her strad which had now gone back to the bank abby missed the strad even more than christopher her relationship with the violin had been so close so joyous so tactile so successful it had been like taking a beloved dog back to a rescue kennel and the heartbreaking beauty of her surroundings only made her loss worse the doctors were pleased with her by october the severed muscles had knit so she now had some movement in her fingers but she still had no grip and no feeling in her palms or her fingertips her worst problem however was her inability to relax raging at the slowness of her physical recovery she plunged into conducting standing in front of the long gold mirror in her room endlessly waving a baton to records trying to anticipate the entrances of the various instruments or giving herself blinding headaches poring over scores long into the night her main difficulty was having to conduct in a vacuum if only she could have returned from lucerne with a case of different musicians set them up like chess pieces breathed life into them and rehearsed and rehearsed them until she dropped how can i practise without an orchestra she raged at rodney its like learning to be a good lay from reading sex books i could certainly help you with the latter said rodney it isnt a joke so rodney in his sweetness for her twentysixth birthday on october rounded up all his musician pals in lucerne and geneva the twentystrong local choir and four soloists and arranged for them to spend the weekend at flashers folly the plan was for abby to rehearse the messiah with them on saturday and sunday and then give a performance in front of an invited audience on sunday night abby was so excited and terrified she became utterly impossible desperate for evidence that her hand was better she was also constantly and recklessly testing it rodney only spent about a third of the year in lucerne and gisela liked everything to be perfect on the friday morning before the concert gold leaves were tumbling into the lake but it was so warm she had laid breakfast outside café au lait bacon and mushrooms picked at dawn from the orchard homemade croissants and apricot jam were all served on and in rosepatterned goldleaf plates cups and saucers part of a priceless set of twelve rodney who was whipping through the times crossword which was faxed out to him from rutminster every morning always had his orange juice out of a heavy glass tumbler of which he was inordinately proud engraved with his name and a picture of a puffing train it had been presented to him by his orchestra on his seventyfifth birthday last year gisela despite being old and rheumaticky hated to be helped but abby was desperate to prove her grip was getting stronger so the moment breakfast was over she stacked everything including rodneys tumbler onto the tray ill carry it in alarm rodney put down the times im ok the next moment abbys hand had slipped and everything had smashed into a hundred pieces on the flagstones why the hell dont you leave things alone shouted rodney too horrified to apologize abby stormed upstairs leaving the mess within seconds the hallelujah chorus was blaring out of her bedroom and when rodney stumped angrily upstairs to play with his trains abby had ostentatiously banged her windows shut to blot out the sound of shouting whistling and hooting even when shostakovich appeared mewing at the window abby screamed at him to go away he had a maddening habit of sitting on scores or leaping onto her shoulders like a witchs cat when she was giving her all to some elaborate aria at one oclock she was playing worthy is the lamb so loudly that she didnt hear giselas tentative knock so gisela let herself in always trying to tempt abby to eat more she had made her a pale pink smoked salmon soufflé wild strawberry icecream and had squeezed her a glass of her favourite pinkgrapefruit juice also on the tray which she placed on the table by the window was a bowl of vitamins and a posy of mauve autumn crocuses abby went beserk for chrissake how many times do i have to tell you ill come down when i want to eat giselas kind rosy face crumpled in dismay upstairs the from zurich ran into the from geneva with a crash as rodney toddled downstairs his stationmasters cap askew over his eye did nothing to diminish the roaring rage on his face how dare you shout at gisela like that you spoilt brat everyone is falling over themselves to be nice to you gisela and i are going into lucerne this afternoon and if youre not in a better mood when we get home you can pack your bags and get out again abby was too distraught to apologize but after they had gone she sobbed her hopelessly muddled heart out how could she have been so ungrateful god would punish her by never allowing her to play the violin again oh please what gets into me wearily she picked up her stick and the battered yellow score of the messiah it was cheating to conduct to a record and made her lazy and slow to adjust rodneys musicians if he hadnt already told them not to turn up for such an ungrateful cow would probably play it in a completely different way shed have to sing and imagine it in her head handels original version of the messiah was scored for a very small orchestra and abby had arranged her room so each instrument was represented by a different object the bookshelf on her left was the first violins the chest of drawers next door the second violins the faded crimson armchair the first oboe the trouser press the second oboe the stuffed bear in the mitre seemed appropriately august to play both bassoons rodneys beady cousin myrtle gazing down between the windows which looked on to the back garden represented the violas and abbys whiteandyellow fourposter against the righthand wall which she hadnt made yet had to act as the harpsichord the messiah begins with the entire orchestra playing together loudly and gravely for twentyfour bars abby glared round the room to see that everyone was paying attention paused and raised her baton rannaldini was said to have a down beat that could halve butter straight from the freezer abby was determined to be as incisive one her stick whistled downwards two to the left three to the right and four in a sweeping quartercircle back to one at bar twentyfive after a diminuendo the tempo changed and she had to cue in the crimson armchair and the chest of drawers after the first beat of the bar and then bring in the bookshelf and the trouser press followed four bars later by the stuffed bear the fourposter and rodneys cousin myrtle and all the time she had to sing the tune in a breathless soprano playing away for all their worth the whole room reached bar ninetyseven and the first recitative comfort ye beating eight quavers to the bar with her right hand abby exhorted the bookshelf cousin myrtle the chest of drawers and the fourposter to play slowly and quietly by shaking her left hand still as rigid as a dutch dolls downwards as though she were drying her nails glancing round she nodded to her dark green bathrobe hanging on the door who was standing in as the tenor comfort ye comfoort yeee my peeeeple sang abby quelling cousin myrtle with a deathray glance for coming in too early as she speeded up the tempo to walking pace for every valley she must remember the bassoons who dodged about all over the place throughout the aria nor did she think the stuffed bear was capable of counting thirtyone bars between twiddles should she forget to cue him in but somehow they circumnavigated every rough place and crooked straight to end with a splendid run of trills from the crimson armchair well done everyone called abby try and be even more together only the stuffed bear and cousin myrtle were looking at her but in her experience most musicians didnt bother to look much at conductors and now for the first chorus with a tenbar allegro tutti before she stretched out both hands to the gold trees in the orchard outside who were playing the part of the chorus and the glory the glory of the lord sang the alto apple trees terrific wonderful abby urged them on oh wow she added as she cued in the plums the pears and an ancient quince tree to bring in the basses sopranos and tenors it seemed right that such a pretty delicate tree as the pear should sing soprano oh thank god it was all coming good and all flesh shall see it together encouraged the apple trees abby worked on frenziedly until the light started fading she was just about to embark on a trumpet shall sound which required a solo trumpet when she noticed a candidate had rolled up in the form of shosty who was back mewing piteously rubbing his fur against the window pane shed been so foul to him earlier putting down her baton abby opened the window leaping onto her shoulder shosty smelt of thyme and marjoram he must have been hunting at the bottom of the mountain for a second he purred round her neck a grey muffler louder than any percussion player then jumped onto the table to lick up the butter that had escaped from the smoked salmon soufflé although her wrist ached dreadfully a great peace swept over abby shed had such a good afternoons work how could she have been so foul to gisela and rodney it was she who needed her rough places planed with the most vicious sandpaper shed go into lucerne tomorrow and buy gisela that new winter coat shed been talking about abby wandered over to the front window the sun had set leaving the lake a drained vermilion the snowy mountains opposite had turned dark pink like summer or rather autumn puddings as they rose out of their gold ruff of woods to the left she could see the island where hans richter had practised his french horn there were no horns in the messiah if only some wonderful musician could row over from the island to woo her she was almost resigned to the loss of christopher she no longer jumped with hope each time the telephone rang or the post arrived but she felt overwhelmed with sadness like the marschallin in der rosencavalier that something she had so cherished had gone for ever she jumped as shosty bored by salmon flavoured butter joined her on the windowledge weaving against her putting out an idle hand to stroke him abby froze whipping back her hand as though she had had some fearful electric shock then she put it back held it there and began to tremble violently there was no doubt she could feel the faint tickling of his fur against her palm pressing down gently she could feel the hardness of his backbone and running her hand to the left encountered the ramrod straightness of his tail then she rubbed the hopelessly wasted ball of her thumb against him no feeling there yet nor in her fingertips still shaking she put her palm down again she could definitely feel his fur moving the next moment the front door banged gathering up shosty she raced downstairs screaming with excitement rodney was standing in the doorway still in his stationmasters cap smiling guiltily hed spent far too much money on among other things a new train set gisela as though catching the last rays of the sun was proudly wearing a new red overcoat oh rodney oh gisela screamed abby darling you look happier said rodney who never harboured grudges on the way down the last flight abby lost shosty who indignant at being carted in such a noisy and unseemly fashion wriggled out of her arms and flounced off to the kitchen i can feel i can feel i can feel shostys fur on my hand whooped abby going straight into giselas arms im sorry ive been such a bitch i was so scared gisela could feel abbys face soaked with tears and her desperate thinness her ribs were protruding like an oldfashioned radiator there there she stroked abbys heaving shoulder you will get best now putting down his parcels rodney took abbys hand and kissed the palm can you feel that i can feel your beard tickling more than shostys fur abby was between tears and laughter im gonna play the violin again richter and wagner shared half a bottle of champagne when wagner wrote the last bar of the mastersingers said rodney happily we all deserve a nice bottle of krug appassionata first movement nine abby worked for nearly two more years in lucerne before moving to london to take a conducting course at the royal academy of music a solid roanandwhite edwardian building the academy stands in the marylebone road flanked by plane trees the autumn term had already begun but london was enjoying a very hot indian summer few members of the academys orchestra redfaced from lugging heavy instruments noticed the viva lappassionata poster hanging from the flagpole as they scuttled in through the glass front door inside anticipation had reached fever pitch since her attempted suicide abby had achieved cult status among students who collected her old records and pinned up her posters portraying her in her tempestuous gypsy beauty in a materialistic world she had sacrificed all for love in the foyer therefore an unusual number of students who should have been at their various classes pretended to read notices about scholarships and forthcoming concerts such was the excitement that one half expected the antique fiddles to break out of their glass case and offer abby their services or sir henry wood in his red robes to shout bravo from his portrait in an anteroom as the clock edged towards a quarter past ten and there was no sign of her the students reluctantly dispersed except for a tall boy wearing a navyblue baseball cap to dry his hair flat and a girl with a dark red bob who was scornfully reading a letter which had been pinned to the noticeboard dear musicians thank you for making music with me so delightfully i must congratulate the academy on a super orchestra with great pleasure hermione harefield stupid cowpat muttered the girl and getting out a biro she wrote ps if david the hunky first trombone wants to pop in to the old mill paradise hell be most welcome to a bed for the afternoon florah stop it chided the boy youre going to be seriously late oh all right grabbing her viola case flora hopscotched across the blackandwhite checked floor slap into her teacher why the hell arent you warming up he said furiously i put my head on the block putting you forward for this dont you dare let me down yes mr french sorry mr french promise to do my best mr french flora scampered off into the dukes hall where goldframed portraits of illustrious former students looked down from paprikared walls on to a packed audience of students parents teachers and talent scouts two friends had kept a seat in the back row for the boy in the baseball cap flora sauntered up onto the stage where the academy orchestra grumbling about the cold after the sunshine outside were tuning up practising difficult solos and runs in different directions like skaters both sexes were huddled in sweaters and trousers wore clumpy shoes or trainers and no makeup the only way you could distinguish the girls was by their long flowing undyed hair which was mostly drawn back from high clear foreheads although a few in abbys honour had turned up with wild appassionata gypsy curls the object today was for this years student conductors who sat in a nervous nailbiting row behind the horns to try out their skills on the academy orchestra in the first movement of bartóks viola concerto flora was playing the solo and she and the musicians had endlessly to repeat the same bits as one conductor after another fumblingly attempted to control the orchestra and were repeatedly taken apart by a genial but highly critical professor who sat in the second desk of the second violins with a score making notes the bartók concerto is extremely difficult and with all the stopping and starting the timpanist the percussion and the brass including hermiones hunky trombone player had very little to do except count bars between the occasional flurry of notes which they often missed because the conductors forgot to bring them in youre not keeping the orchestra down enough shouted the professor to a sweating swede who was flapping on the rostrum as though he were about to fly through the vaulted roof we cant hear flora just as well flora grinned at the japanese leader who had a lean beautiful body and a face like a red indian its the cadenza next ill need scaffolding and oxygen to reach that top a what the hells happened to lappassionata to fox any press who had in fact been humiliatingly nonexistent abby had been smuggled in by a back door shivering behind dark glasses dying of nerves she was dickering whether to rush out and be sick again how could she do justice to such a beautiful piece particularly when the orchestra were only playing it for the first time the soloist abby decided was extremely good she needed to work on her technique she ground to a halt twice in the cadenza and burst out laughing when during a really sad bit shed caught a friends eye in the audience but generally she executed the high notes effortlessly and joyfully and in the lower register the sound was mellow dark and mysterious she was also extremely attractive her figure was hidden by baggy black trousers and a thick black cardigan but she had a clear pale gold skin merry green eyes a plump face ending in a pointed chin and her shining bob was the same warm burntsienna as her viola above all she played with total insouciance keeping up a stream of badinage with the orchestra chewing gum and reading her tattered poetry book every time there was a pause now she was sitting on the lean thigh of the japanese leader awaiting the next victim a plump greek called adonis who had soft white hands and gold teeth to match his gold corduroy shirt all his friends trooped round behind the brass section to video him conducting like photographing the captain of the titanic murmured flora getting to her feet sweat was glistening on her upper lip a russet lock had fallen away from the tortoiseshell slide there was a chorus of wolfwhistles as she took off her black cardigan to reveal a dark green tshirt embroidered with yellow daisies and tucked into a wide leather belt vy dyou have to distract me viz striptease grumbled adonis now dont vorry i vill follow you i dont vant you following me i want you with me said flora raising her viola adonis tried very hard but the orchestra were all over the place the genial professor sighed he was going to have his work cut out with this lot that soloist is smart thought abby wistfully adonis was now going much too fast but she always caught up glancing sideways she noticed the boy with the baseball cap totally still really listening he followed every note flora played what a beauty thought abby hes the one who ought to be called adonis a punchup was narrowly avoided because adonis skipped another page and missed out the hunky trombonists last entry yet again abby whod been studying the concerto for the last fortnight couldnt bear to hear it so butchered but would she do any better the notes of the score swum meaninglessly before her eyes oh god she hoped she wasnt going to be sick again adonis was followed by lorenzo a handsome italian who made beautiful gestures but who seemed more interested in ogling flora and the video cameras this ones got two left hands murmured the professor as lorenzo kept smoothing his hair with his right hand youve occasionally got to beat in time lorenzo he called out no matter how emotional you feel youve got to first and foremost be a traffic policeman so the orchestra can follow and know where they are particularly in a piece with so many changes of tempo i try again this time extravagant waving and fists clenched to heaven were followed by four bars of total silence where am i lorenzo smote his noble brow in the dukes hall giggled flora youre lost said the professor but not forgotten parking her chewinggum on the side of the rostrum flora gave lorenzo a kiss that is a disgusting habit flora reproved the professor i dont know what score you studied lorenzo but i dont think it was bartóks viola concerto the orchestra grinned lorenzo turned scarlet and started to argue discuss it with me later said the professor firmly weve got time for one more before lunch the rest of the conductors waiting behind the horns leapt to their feet like mps frantic to speak but the professor had nodded to the back of the hall here comes abby said flora sliding off the leaders knee the japanese boy looked round that is not her bet you a tenner i dont have your kind of money few of the audience or musicians recognized abby she was so thin and wore black jeans a blackwatch tartan shirt dark glasses and no makeup her hair was short and curly like the young paganini the scarlet pouting lips the clinging minis the wild gypsy voluptuousness had all gone carworker rather than carmen murmured flora abby gave nobody any time to give her a cheer she carried no score only a baton as she loped up the hall and jumped up onto the rostrum as she whipped off her glasses the orchestra could see the imperiousness in those strange unblinking yellow eyes which was belied by the white knuckles and the frantically knocking knees for a second she was grabbed by utter panic her mind a snowstorm how could she have been so stupid as to conduct without a score then she said quietly this is a beautiful piece lets give it some shape and feeling she suggested some small alterations to the strings and woodwind then turned to the brass and the percussion im afraid you guys dont have much to do which makes it easier to goof off ill try and make things as clear as possible for you good luck her hand as she raised it was shaking so crazily even bartók couldnt have captured the crossrhythms but once she brought it down the entire hall realized who she was because she was in a class of her own the beat of her right hand was knifeedge clear and although her left hand was a little stiff she still couldnt splay her fingers or cup her hand she managed to show the orchestra exactly what she wanted and in addition convey the emotional intensity she needed the one vestige of the old abby was the way she swayed to the music like a dancer but she had only to glare at the brass to shut them up and she completely enslaved the trombones by bringing them in exactly right and giving them a radiant smile of approval afterwards flora found it nerveracking having the worlds greatest violinist beside her but she loved the way abby glanced round to synchronize orchestra and soloist and swept aside the orchestral sound so flora could always be heard are these the same musicians is this the same piece thought the professor in rapture letting abby run through the entire movement without stopping and then leading a whooping cheering stamping round of applause you have all the marks of a great conductor he told abby you have nerve but not nerves it will be a joy to teach you everyone was longing to congratulate her but they were too shy and so was she so they all left her and scampered off to lunch abby was just pulling out her music case from underneath her chair to put away her stick when she heard a voice say excuse me swinging round abby found the soloist and the boy who had been sitting at the end of her row standing up he was at least two inches taller than abby and when he whipped off his baseball cap he revealed a beautifully shaped freckled forehead and hair an even darker red than the girls abby wondered if they were brother and sister the girl did the talking i know it sounds corny but weve got every one of your records that was a fantastic performance we wondered if we could buy you lunch just to celebrate abby longed to accept but she was so near the edge that she snapped back im far too busy to waste time eating and then stalked out five minutes later flora tracked her down in a distant practice room trying not to be overheard by the pianist bashing out liszts dante sonata next door abby was huddled against the blue velvet curtains her shoulders shaking flora had long been haunted by a description of a vivisection clinic where the animals had their vocal chords cut on admission so however bad the pain became all you could hear was desperate rasping this was the sound abby was making now you were seriously good stammered flora in fact the only thing to cry about is how awful we were mind you you were lucky to find somewhere to cry practice rooms are harder to get here than tickets for your old concerts looking up abby saw the kindness in the girls eyes belying her flip manner im sorry she croaked the last time i was on a platform i was playing the brahms concerto with the cbso i know said flora everyone knows everything about you although what a brilliant conductor youd turned into was certainly hidden in the mists of lake lucerne it was your solo gulped abby fishing for another tissue i can quite understand that no you play real good youve got a fantastically natural sound i guess you reminded me of myself i should do admitted flora having based my style entirely on yours all our generation has music schools are churning out more little abbies than an ecclesiastical property developer abbys lips twitched at least come and have a drink outside in the sunshine the boy was leaning against the railings his nose in the selected piano works of chopin making notes with a pencil my names flora seymour by the way announced the girl and this is marcus campbellblack abby perked up you must be ruperts son marcus waited never knowing if the next bit was going to hurt or not goodness youre like him abby admired the long dark curling eyelashes and the exquisite bone structure its just like looking at a fabric sample in a different colour except abby couldnt ever imagine rupert blushing or being lost for words rupert came to see me in the hospital and gave me this delving in her jeans pocket abby produced the silver clove of garlic to ward off evil do tell him i take it everywhere and give him my best he said hed met you said marcus guardedly round the corner he opened the door of his aston martin for her you go in the back said flora then youll have room for your legs georgie maguire new man abby picked up a tape on the back seat in excitement this must be her latest oh wow christopher my ex and i rock star was our sort of big tune i know its terrible shmaltz and i shouldnt say so but i just adore georgies music you should said marcus starting up the car and ignoring floras kick on the ankle georgies floras mother omigod ill tell her youre a fan said flora shell be really pleased shes a terrific fan of yours abby looked at flora with new respect gee im sorry i was rude earlier flora shrugged mums the same she cant bear strangers muscling in particularly when shes coming down after a concert and she goes ballistic if people drop in at home abby noticed marcus wheezing as he drove petrol fumes were floating on the hot air and the walk to the car had made him breathless reaching into the pocket of his shirt he got out his inhaler and squirted a couple of jets into the back of his throat marcus is asthmatic explained flora thank god we can forget about that for a bit pulling the bartók concerto out of the stereo she threw it in the glove compartment put it back in its case grumbled marcus and if you must smoke dont use the floor as an asthtray flora grinned dont be a fusspot then turning round to abby continued i cant get over how different you look i cut my hair and my losses which did you think was the worst of those conductors adonis by a very swollen head announced flora i cant think how you followed him said marcus if you learn to follow any idiot you get more dates later flora added scornfully conductors are so thick they carry a white stick to tell everyone theyre deaf marcus has been wonderful she added to abby hes been playing the piano version for me all week leaning across him she chucked some more chewinggum out of the window which landed on the shiny dark green flanks of the bentley drawing up beside them jesus when will you learn to behave marcus accelerated away from the bentleys fistshaking chauffeur i thought lorenzo was even more of a talentfree zone than adonis hes got no sense of rhythm he has in bed said flora look at that sweet jack russell i wish i could have a dog in london when did you go to bed with lorenzo asked marcus in surprise oh last week some time he keeps wanting repeats i quite fancy toniko ive never had a jap where did you two meet asked abby wondering what on earth the relationship was between them we were at school together said flora marcus and flora were the star pupils at the academy marcus was a great beauty he had inherited ruperts greek profile so vital in a pianist and his elegant longlegged broadshouldered body but he also had his mothers glossy dark red hair freckles and huge startled eyes which were the same soft acid green as spring moss desperately shy he was however unaware of his miraculous looks and like a fawn or faun seemed likely to bolt into mythical woods at any moment in his third year at the academy he was destined for a brilliant career as a pianist if he could conquer his asthma and his nerves flora who was only in her second year and who was as sexy and selfconfident as marcus was shy and retiring had a voice even more beautiful than her mother georgie she was still taking singing lessons but despite pressure from her teachers who liked to feature illustrious expupils in the prospectus she showed no interest in taking up singing as a career instead she was concentrating on the viola her official excuse was that she didnt want to be tagged as georgie maguires daughter i dont have mums charisma nor her ability to project in reality she had been totally wiped out by an affaire with rannaldini when she was sixteen and had decided singing was too isolated a career she had deliberately chosen the viola that lovely but unobtrusive cinderella of the instruments because it blended into the orchestral sound like cornflour was seldom heard on its own and was the butt of endless jokes in doing this flora felt she was putting on a mental hair shirt submerging her flamboyant personality in the hope that god would forgive her the affaire with rannaldini and somehow alleviate her suffering with their famous parents and their hefty private incomes marcus and flora in the current economic climate of vanishing grants could have been the victims of a lot of envy and flak at college as they were both exceptionally talented utterly without side and it was soon realized that marcuss apparent aloofness was only shyness any prejudice had swiftly evaporated ten the quick drink turned into a threehour session all the tables outside marcuss and floras favourite italian restaurant were taken so they lunched inside demanding a large carafe of red wine prestissimo and larding the rest of their order for canelloni and ratatouille with musical terminology which involved a lot of backchat and giggling with the waiters despite their age differences abby was nearly twentyeight flora nineteen marcus twenty they found they had a huge amount in common as children of the famous marcus and flora understood the pressures and the sacrifices one is never centre stage sighed flora like abby both rupert and georgie had toured extensively and marcus told abby how wretched rupert had been after he gave up show jumping a lot of lunch was spent telling abby how brilliantly she had conducted always boastful when she was unsure of new people with her tongue loosened by unaccustomed drinking on a very empty stomach she went into an orgy of namedropping about the famous musicians who had it seemed either tried to screw her or screw up her career inevitably she eventually launched into a tirade against rannaldini flora let her run and although she had downed most of a carafe of red by the time abby had finished no flush had invaded her pale cheeks did you sleep with rannaldini she asked idly certainly not said abby pompously he came between me and my art flora kneaded her bread into a pellet and lobbed it at the restaurant cat when i knew him he came between my legs whoops sorry then at abbys look of incredulity continued i had an affaire with him when i was still at school you gotta be joking what happened he dumped me left me behind like an indifferent paperback in the folds of a hotel bed flora waved to the waiter to bring another carafe how long did it last its a long long time from may to september sighed flora rannaldinis so promiscuous that being hopelessly hopelessly hooked on him has all the exclusivity of a widow in the first world war but it doesnt seem to hurt any less no safety in numbers her voice was getting faster and faster its like being alive in your coffin but noone hears you scrabbling to get out i know hes a shit but not an hour passes when i dont want him she dropped her head like a broken daffodil then the next moment had stubbed out her cigarette on marcuss untouched ratatouille oh christ markie im sorry her head fell sideways onto his shoulder as he put up a freckled right hand to stroke her cheek she clutched it heard the latest viola joke said marcus to cheer her up what what dyou do with a dead viola player what move him up a desk floras mouth lifted slightly marcus had eaten drunk and talked much less than the others occasionally his eyes met abbys and a shy helpless smile drifted across his face he was beautifully dressed in chinos a dark brown cashmere sweater and a prussianblue shirt which went perfectly with his dark red hair when he removed his sweater abby noticed he had a pianists physique breadth of shoulder arms grooved with muscle and big hands that could stretch a tenth with ease a gold signet ring bearing the campbellblack crest flashed on his left hand as he practised on the table snatches of chopins grande polonaise which he had to play in a college recital next week hes very appealing thought abby through a haze of wine perhaps i need a toyboy particularly one who could simplify difficult repertoire by transcribing it for the piano he also picked up the check ill pay you next week its the end of the month flora called out as marcus went over to the till i think i bought the whole of jigsaw and hmv yesterday morning leave it she said as abby got out her purse marcus gets a massive allowance from rupert how did you two meet as i said we were at school together id been drinking at lunchtime comme toujours i felt sick during a concert and threw up into marcuss trumpet i think that was the moment rannaldini fell albeit temporarily in love with me out of the window a horsechestnut tree tawny against the palest blue sky reminded flora of the same great belllike trees in rannaldinis park how was he really she asked as she emptied marcuss untouched second glass of wine into her own being upstaged by marcuss father rupert had flown out to sign me up for declan oharas programme again abby couldnt resist boasting rupert came on really strong if i hadnt been crazy about christopher wed certainly have ended up in bed i wouldnt tell marcus that interrupted flora sharply hes bats about his stepmother abby jumped slightly as marcus chucked three gold pound coins onto the redandwhite checked tablecloth as he put a fiver alongside the pile of notes in his wallet abby saw a photograph of a very beautiful redhead is that your partner she asked archly dyou go for redheads no its my mother said marcus as it was four oclock there was no point in going back to the academy so after flora had rushed back to fetch her viola which shed left under the table they tottered down the road to madame tussauds because abby had never seen her own waxwork i went to see it as a pilgrimage my first day at college confided flora on the top floor they discovered ruperts waxwork in red coat breeches and brown topped boots gazing moodily into space among the great sporting heroes hi dad said marcus ironically rupert was next to jake lovell who was looking equally unfriendly isnt that the guy asked abby perplexed who ran off with marcuss mother said flora who we dont talk about in ruperts presence im amazed they dont come alive at night and throttle each other hi mum there was georgie maguire with her long russet hair and sensual smiling face clutching a microphone among the pop stars drifting into classical music they ran slap into hermione mouth wide open in song queen of the nightmare stormed flora ought to be in the chamberpot of horrors abby liked flora more and more particularly when she removed her chewinggum and stuck it on hermiones nose and topped her dark curls with marcuss baseball cap florah hissed marcus retrieving his baseball cap and looking nervously at an ancient dozing assistant hope to god she doesnt come to life like hermiones statue in the winters tale getting out a pentel flora drew a big black moustache on hermiones upper lip abby was clutching her sides and flora was lighting an illicit cigarette then the temperature plummeted as though they had just stepped out of a plane in the arctic circle and they found themselves confronting a fearsome lifelike rannaldini brandishing his baton like a dirk everything was in place the gardenia the trained grey hair the three inches of dazzling white cuff waving his wand like the wicked fairy said flora stonily good afternoon maestro drawing heavily on her cigarette she shoved it between rannaldinis fingers if i was wearing a pin we could stick it into him said abby by now their giggling had roused the attendant marcus hastily distracted him by asking where they could find abigail rosens waxwork hes got a beautiful voice thought abby a bit like prince charless but with a slight break in it the attendant hadnt recognized abby and after much headscratching and consulting of lists announced that her waxwork had been melted down because she wasnt considered famous enough any more i flew too near the sun said abby tonelessly once they got outside she crumpled against marcus i guess im an applausejunkie worse than hermione she sobbed into his shoulder i grumbled about the pressures at the time ok i complained endlessly about media intrusion but i just cant get used to not being famous any more no fan mail never being in the paper not even the classical music press and now this the rushhour traffic crawling towards the westway where a huge setting sun blazed like a stop sign looked on fascinated a trio of workmen crammed into the front of a blue van seeing abby so tall slim and wideshouldered in marcuss arms lent out and shouted fucking poofters fucking homophobes shouted back flora making a vsign its only because your agents have deliberately kept you out of the public eye she comforted abby look how deliriously excited everyone was today once the press twig youre the new karajan theyll never leave you alone and thats as bad a nightmare wailed abby and i miss my strad its now being played by a bitch called maria kusak i know she wont look after it i expect shell leave it in restaurants like i do said flora as they rustled through plane leaves unhinged by the days great heat now we could go to the planetarium which would put everything in perspective and make us realize how infinitely trivial our lives are but unfortunately its just shut so were going to take you to meet a very glamorous russian conductor all russian conductors are drunk and incompetent said abby ungratefully boris is often very drunk but hes a good conductor said marcus and a lot of people unaccountably think hes a terrific composer added flora reflecting that it couldnt have been good for abbys ego that all the people pouring out of offices stared at marcus rather than at her but abby had stopped in her tracks are you talking about boris levitsky who married rachel grant flora nodded thats weird abby was really agitated i read a piece about rachels suicide it really influenced me right that she could drive off a cliff because shed caught boris cheating on her after i cut my wrist abbys voice broke i wanted to write to boris and tell him i was sure rachel didnt mean to kill herself it was just a crazy gesture to wipe out the hurt with an even greater hurt anything to make the pain go away tell boris that im sure it would comfort him said marcus boris was very well known in russia when i was at the moscow conservatoire sniffed abby later as marcus edged the aston martin through the traffic we all went to his concerts it was a great scandal when he fell in love with rachel and defected to the west she was a marvellous player i wasnt a fan of hers said flora with rare coldness she was an awful bitch you couldnt blame boris for straying he used to be one of rannaldinis assistant conductors and rachel so detested the influence rannaldini had on him that she had an affaire with rannaldini out of spite took him off me to be exact thats probably why i hate her but i thought boris and rachel were reconciled protested abby they were said flora but rannaldini and boris were after the same job running the new world symphony orchestra in new york boris looked as though he was going to get it he was young brilliant and back with rachel the scorpion caught him coming out of chloes his exmistresss flat im sure rannaldini tipped them off typical shitty thing he would do rachel saw the photograph in the scorpion and drove off the road hey presto rannaldini crying crocodile tears over the death of the finest pianist of her generation lands the new york job can we get some drink from that offlicence marcus we cant stop here well have to stop somewhere borisll have drunk any drink hes got boris was shattered by rachels death flora turned back to abby particularly because she left him two young children to bring up not a great aid to composition despite such setbacks boris has had loads of women since rachel died men get over these things much more quickly than women because theyre in a buyers market but he still misses rachel and feels dreadfully guilty about her people are always giving him money to write things then he doesnt deliver the rutminster symphony orchestra commissioned a requiem to rachel more than two years ago an old duck called sir rodney mackintosh im his protégée said abby sniffily ive only been stopping at his house for the past two and a half years i cant be expected to know her entire cv thought flora irritated rodneys so darling added abby possessively darling agreed flora so you probably know rodney felt sorry for boris but again boris has failed to deliver every time he picks up his chewed pencil he thinks about rachel starts crying and has to have another huge glass of red wine and the rso have to keep rescheduling boris was a great conductor mused abby but not especially focused hes going out with some big boobed bratislavian bassoonist tonight so marcus and i said wed babysit eleven dont mention rannaldini muttered flora as clinking bottles in time to the clanking of the ancient lift they slowly climbed to the sixth floor or boris will foam at the mouth boris was already foaming at the mouth hardly concealing his manhood with a ninja turtle face towel he was waving a toothbrush instead of a baton having opened the front door he dived into a nearby bathroom to spit out the toothpaste he had just had a bath and was trying to dry a pair of boxer shorts with a hairdryer despite a sallow skin deepset eyes almost entirely concealed by puffiness dark hair like an unclipped poodle and a chunky rugger players body there was an undeniable byronic smoulder about boris abby took one look at him realized she was half an inch taller kicked off her shoes and bolted to the to repair her smudged eyeliner and even put on some lipgloss boris took one look at abby and decided to give the bratislavian bassoonist a miss he and abby were soon gabbling in russian about their moscow days what have you got for us to drink asked flora i cannot drink i am on vagon then boris saw the bottles flora was taking out of an oddbins carrier bag oh vell perhaps i am not abby was even unfazed by the messiest livingroom ever it was very russian with crimson and scarlet furniture and gold icons on the midnightblue walls but every chair was piled high with clothes the grand piano buckled under scores covered in drink rings and upended silver photograph frames the dark red velvet cloth on the big table could hardly be seen for hamburger boxes and bottles wafting stale remnants of drink on the bookshelves were halfeaten apples overflowing ashtrays tapes and cds out of their cases while the entire family obviously chucked their shoes and boots in one corner the rest of the floor was littered with orange peel pencil sharpenings tissues and crumpledup pieces of manuscript paper oh boris you are a slut sighed flora where are the children hidden under the rubble i forget to tell the kids they stay with friends good thing theyll get bubonic plague if they stay here flora removed a curling ham sandwich from the mantelpiece when did you last eat i verk since midnight last night said boris proudly nearly twenty hours while flora chided marcus who was more practical had found a black dustbin bag in the kitchen and now settled down to clear up the mess wheres the stuff youve just written i put it in the samovar for safety said boris is it numbered asked marcus retrieving it not that it matters flora who was opening bottles murmured to abby play it back to front upsidedown it wouldnt make any difference she blew a kiss at boris let me see said abby reverently marcus held out a manuscript page covered in a mass of black corrections looks as though a lot of centipedes have been doing the highland fling after a mud bath said flora why cant you use a rubber instead of crossing out because eef my first thought was best eef i rub it out it is gone how can anyone copy that grumbled flora i can said marcus removing the pages to the safety of his music case vot does eet sound like ill try and play it later when ive tidied up this dump what a wonderful wife youll make someone flora lobbed some orange peel at marcuss black bag and missed if you want to make yourself useful she said to abby go and wash up four glasses abby had a dazzling début as a conductor she was telling boris as abby returned with an assortment of mugs cups and even a small vase ear is the only theeng that matter said boris filling them all up to the top ear and rhythm telling the orchestra how and ven to play a conductor must learn what is possible to ask then ask the orchestra ten times more he must also come into a room at any time and command attention you have that in your countenance which i would fain call master or rather maestro quoted flora settling down to sort out the mountain of newspapers thrown down by the fireplace what piece did you do asked boris bartóks viola concerto ah boris gave a theatrical sigh and drained his glass bartók is like me his last christmas he could never leave hees flat because he was so ashamed he had no money to tip lift man bartók had security till he was eight then his father died like mine did said abby taking a huge gulp of red wine he was aries like me said flora like mine his genius was never recognized boris was near to tears he die in poorness like i shall if you gave up drink and worked a bit harder youd be very rich said flora tipping a pile of guardians into marcuss dustbin bag oh look heres your hairbrush that must have been missing for months removing it from the pile flora sat down on the arm of boriss chair and started to brush his wild curls my music reflects the chaos of our times i dont know why you dont save time and programme this flat instead ignoring her boris topped up abbys glass i am sorry about your wrist i have all your records vil you play again my physio thinks so but i still cant grip the neck of a violin and my fingers cant get around the strings eet is same i ave music bursting to get out of my head but i cannot write its not the same at all reproved flora you can still move a pencil dont be a drama queen ouch said boris as she tugged at a tangle at the back whats got into you i am sick of an old passion christ youve got chewinggum here i wanted to tell you boris lowering her voice abby broke into russian again obviously talking about rachel because soon they were both crying and wiping each others eyes and pouring out more glasses of red summit meeting between the super powers said flora drily as marcus returned with a second dustbin bag beautiful redandblue patterned rugs were beginning to emerge on the floor and a goldandblue embroidered shawl on the piano where marcus was righting the silverframed photographs of the old days in moscow children on toboggans grannies with sweptup hair the young boris with prokofiev and shostakovich that vas my rachel boris pointed to a photograph of a beautiful but disapprovinglooking woman she vas a saint she was a crosspatch said flora getting a black velvet toggle out of her trouser pocket to tie back boriss curls finally she brushed his wild eyebrows there mel gibson she kissed the tip of his nose how many voices are you scoring the requiem for asked abby none said boris flatly the instruments play the voices the rso chorus is full of squawking amateurs and hermione harefield wanted to sing soprano part so i stop them all i ate singers returning to the pile through which she was making slow progress because she kept stopping to read things flora was now brandishing an unstamped postcard with a charging bison on the back why are you writing to edith spink she send tape of concert of my berlin vall symphony she did in vest country it sound so orrible i write telling her never to play my vork again i vondered vot happen to that postcard geeve it to me dont be silly flora tore up the postcard and chucked it into marcuss black bag ediths a good egg when rannaldini blocked my scholarship to the academy she put in a good word youre stupid to upset her boris shes on your side not ven she play my music like that i shall have to go back to teaching you cant you hated teaching said flora sensibly all those staff meetings about handles on lavatory doors all the fuss when you wanted time off to go to performances let alone rehearsals and you cant compose if you have to write lectures youve got to finish rachels requiem i never meet a deadline or an honest woman said boris sulkily thats bloody rude when ive given you the benefit of my advice christ flora pulled out a sheaf of brown envelopes dont you ever pay bills not if i cant pay them i cannot buy my kids clothing i cannot redecorate my flat look at the damp boris pointed to a dark stain above the window youll be able to paper it with brown envelopes said flora heres one from the danish national ballet surely you dont owe them any money opening the envelope flora triumphantly shook out a cheque for thirty thousand kroners which boris held up to the light in ecstasy its for ballet they want me to write about little mermaid thats terrific said abby excitedly youll get repeats every time anyone wants to do it and they can sell videos and tapes in the foyer boris whose melancholy alternated with raging high spirits became quite expansive at the prospect of relative riches normally he flora and marcus would have played chamber music into the small hours but desisted in deference to abby what are your plans he asked her take the course at the academy ive familiarized myself with loads of scores in lucerne now i need practise ill take any gig offered having tidied up as much of the sittingroom as possible marcus was wheezing so badly from the dust that he had to retreat to the kitchen resort to a couple of puffs from his inhaler and sit down for ten minutes hunched over the kitchen table to recover his breath then he started on supper there was only a certain amount of his day that he could cope with other people he needed to be alone now to think about next weeks concert finding a lot of eggs of dubious antiquity some rockhard gruyère and some big tomatoes he decided to make cheese omelettes and tomato salad there was no vinegar so he used the juice of a wrinkled lime and brought a loaf out of retirement by turning it into garlic bread rubbing the gruyère up and down the grater until the curls of cheese had overflowed the bowl he studied the chopin humming and making notes need a topup it was abby with a bottle marcus shook his head she looked much better than she had earlier there was a sparkle in her eyes and colour in her cheeks my thats good abby pinched a bit of tomato out of the salad bowl who taught you to cook my stepmother the divine taggie teased abby hermione harefield said she wasnt a woman of substance shes the most ssubstantial person i know stammered marcus furiously shes bbeautiful and kkind and shes the only woman whos ever made my father happy that bitch hermiones just jealous i told you to keep your trap shut abby said flora appearing in the doorway after supper leaving the others to drink and gossip marcus settled down to play the piano boriss flat was on the second floor of a foursided block which looked out on to a square of garden dominated by a huge golden catalpa it was so mild that people in the surrounding flats opened their windows wrapping their children in duvets so they could all listen to marcus until the stars came out clapping and cheering whenever he stopped and shouting for him to go on audience dont do zat for me grumbled boris but he is good boy he confided to abby i teach him piano at school ven rachel die he turn up at the house asking what he could do looking after kids helping me sort things out he is gentle but he is not at all vimp and he play like dream abby a bit drunk now was equally enchanted but also tearful she must not neglect her physio having dispatched the grande polonnaise with a great flourish marcus got out more music and launched into a modern piece explosions of crashing notes interspersed with a sad haunting tune thats beautiful called out abby what is it ees familiar boris looked perplexed bloody well should be said marcus its part of the dies irae from rachels requiem i finished transcribing it last night i wrote that boris leapt to his feet play it again wheres my violin under the sofa said flora impatiently boris tuned up and began to play the main tune with marcus accompanying marcuss copying was dark and clear which made it very easy to read having jewish blood like abby boris tended to soup up the melody playing very emotionally with great rhetorical gestures this is very grateful piece he told abby and flora in delight you mean rewarding corrected flora yes its breathtaking like bartók full of hitherto undreamed of possibilities occasionally stopping to change a note totally absorbed they played on marcus is seriously good abby told flora nothing can stop him making it lets make some coffee flora led abby into the kitchen marcus is happy and relaxed at the moment she went on because hes among friends and hes had the odd drink but hes crippled by nerves throwing up for hours before concerts and hes already had to cancel two recitals because of asthma attacks which doesnt help in the music world which hates unreliability shall we wash up flora looked unenthusiastically at the supper plates but as the dishwasher was still working overtime gurgling away cleaning all the silver and china theyd unearthed from the sittingroom she decided to leave it nothing ever gets clean that i wash by hand after some rootling around she found a tin of gold blend in the breadbin and unable to find a spoon shook some coffee into four cups also she added switching on the kettle marcus has a terrible hangup about rupert who doesnt see the point of him at all but rupert seemed so caring in ba said abby perplexed and when he visited me in the hospital ruperts dazzling agreed flora but the brighter the moon the darker the shadow it casts and its no fun being son of superstud ruperts always preferred tabitha marcuss younger sister and he passionately disapproves of his son and heir taking up anything as drippy as the piano when he should be at home learning how to run the estate how did it turn out with those kids rupert adopted thats the worst part sighed flora im afraid theres no milk ruperts totally besotted with the boy xavier cured his squint and nearly his birthmark got him racing round on lysanders old shetland pony ruperts got the tearaway hes always wanted flora lowered her voice its crucified marcus returning to the livingroom abby heard a voluptuous explosion of notes and gave a cry of joy marcus was playing beethovens appassionata sonata its so darling to play that well sort of in my honour she went over to the piano sort of marcus blushed being a truthful boy next week im also playing it in a recital at college ill come along said abby in excitement making marcus blush even more darkly did you know that to understand the appassionata beethoven said you have to read the tempest this music crept by me upon the waters allaying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air marcus nodded my stepfather told me and quoted the same lines sorry as a flurry of wrong notes resulted im no good at talking and playing abby retreated to the sofa god my back aches said flora who was plaiting boriss hair three hours of bartók takes it out of you ive got some ibuleve in the bathroom said boris a smell of bonfires was still drifting in through the open window glancing at his watch marcus saw it was nearly eleven oclock they were still clamouring for more in the flats outside hed better stop soon or the kids would never get to bed he launched into roger quilters childrens overture there was a lady loved a swine sang flora as she returned with the ibuleve thats a stunning voice too thought abby in envy goodness they were a talented trio flora slumped between boriss knees calmly pulling off her daisyembroidered tshirt and using it to cover high pointed breasts as boris began to rub the gel into her shoulders and i wonder what their relationship is thought abby glancing across the room as he launched into baa baa black sheep marcus met abbys eyes saw the admiration in them and thought how lovely she looked her strong proud face softened by the lamplight she was much more boyish than hed expected sitting on the sofa her long legs tucked underneath her she looked like a model for gentlemans quarterly marcuss timidity with women had been exacerbated two years ago at the stagparty of basil baddington one of his fathers wilder cronies rupert irked by marcuss apparent lack of interest in girls after all he was supposed to produce an heir one day had organized a hooker marcus had been quite unable to get it up and had been violently sick terror which makes people take deeper breaths triggered off a violent asthma attack which could have been fatal the whole thing was hushed up by ruperts gp the admirably unflappable james benson who got marcus onto a nebulizer at the local hospital just in time before hed lost consciousness miserably aware of regurgitated wine all down his dressshirt marcus had heard james benson reproving his father you must be more careful with him rupert you know hes never been strong by mutual agreement neither taggie nor marcuss mother had been told of this disaster but marcuss relationship with rupert always shaky had inevitably deteriorated reluctant to witness the love he had always craved so unstintingly lavished on little xavier marcus had avoided pensombe and concentrated on his career girls except flora who was more of a pal were avoided even though they chased him like mad not least because of his fathers bank balance last night after copying out boriss score until long after midnight marcus had collapsed into bed only to be jolted by a terrifyingly erotic dream about boris and woken sobbing his heart out because it could never be possible having dreaded confronting boris today he was ecstatic to find himself suddenly so attracted to abby his blue shirt was still stiff from the salt of the tears shed shed outside madame tussauds all this added radiance to his playing who did marcuss mother marry asked abby thinking of the stepfather who had quoted the tempest malise gordon thirty years older replied flora writhing half in ecstasy half in pain under boriss fingers hes been a brilliant stepfather and really encouraged marcus but that doesnt make up for ones own father not giving a toss flora suddenly shivered they had been so wrapped up in talking they hadnt realized how cold it had become as she banged down the big sash window the telephone rang it was helen marcuss mother in hysterics it was a few moments before boris could get any sense out of her malise had had a massive stroke and been rushed to hospital marcus must go home at once twelve marcus drove straight home to warwickshire he was bitterly ashamed afterwards that his main emotion was despair that he would probably have to duck out of a recital yet again and disappointment that he would no longer be faced with the terrifying yet magical prospect of abby in the audience he wasnt even very worried about malise who never having let him down seemed unlikely to start now in fact malise never regained consciousness marcus was devastated he had loved his stepfather deeply kind formal old enough to be his grandfather malise had always encouraged him they had played endless duets together malise had explained harmony taken marcus to concerts and shared with him his s of myra hess and denis matthews and solomon he had also provided him with a role model of total integrity and honour but marcus had to surpress his anguish in order to comfort his mother who having been adored and wrapped in cotton wool by malise for sixteen years was quite incapable of coping with funerals let alone life on her own the press of course had a fieldday dredging up the old story of how malise as chef déquipe had held the british showjumping team together during their golden era and how during the la olympics when rupert campbellblacks great rival jake lovell had run off with ruperts wife helen the team had gone on with one man short to win the gold there was also a lot of guff about how malise had picked up the pieces marrying helen and restoring her selfconfidence which had been shattered by eight years of hell married to rupert and a disastrous few weeks with a miserably dispossessed jake who couldnt wait to belt back to his wife the funeral was rather like a rerun of madame tussauds with all the showjumping greats rolling up to pay their last respects and rupert and jake glaring into space as a further insult jake had brought along his son isaac a brilliant young jockey who had beaten one of ruperts horses earlier that week the only thing that could have redressed the balance for rupert would have been if marcus could have played malises favourite bach prelude quite beautifully on the steinway that helen had insisted on hiring for the service but marcuss asthma always grew worse under stress and in the panic of overseeing all the lastminute arrangements he forgot to bring his inhaler he just managed to help carry the coffin the three hundred yards across the village green to the church before collapsing fighting for breath beside his mother helen was still young enough at fortyfour to be described as absolutely stunning rather than having been absolutely stunning she was far too unnerved at seeing jake again after all those years and wondering guiltily if she were wearing too much blusher and eyeshadow on the grounds that malise would have wanted her to look beautiful to notice marcuss plight unfortunately a church filled with flowers and the fumes from the ancient pew which had recently been treated for woodworm made the band round marcuss chest even tighter ruperts best friend billy lloydfoxe had reduced everyone to tears including himself reading the dedication to the horse which always brought the house down at the end of the horse of the year show according to the service sheet marcus should have been next but white and sweating he could only clutch his chest and shake his head so after a long agonizingly embarrassed pause the parson who had been a family friend for years twigged what was up and carried on with the service marcus was only aware of the reproach in his mothers eyes i didnt break down i didnt fail malise she seemed to be saying and such a public failure would only confirm ruperts conviction that his son totally lacked bigmatch temperament marcus had also been incapable of carrying the coffin to the graveside staggering back to the beautiful queen anne rectory in which malise had lived all his life revived by several squirts from his inhaler he had been able to hand round drinks and sandwiches there had been a horrible fascination in being introduced by helen to jake lovell he was amazed his mother could have left his gilded glamorous father for anyone so small and insignificant and then rupert had walked into the room caught the three of them talking and stalked right out of the house dragging a protesting taggie and tabitha with him returning to the kitchen for more sandwiches marcus had found malises bigboned tactless daughter whod been brought up in the old rectory and whose eyes were now running over the furniture like beetles wondering what she could claw back the boys not going to be much support to helen she was saying to mrs edwards helens daily sickly looking fellow daddy did so much for him and marcus had wanted to shout i loved him too but the funeral was only the beginning of the nightmare malise had left his desk and everything else in order to quote his favourite writer montaigne he had been booted and spurred and ready to depart he had also hidden his worries from helen so well that shed had no idea how badly hed been hit by lloyds he had made the old rectory and its twenty acres over to helen but not lived the necessary seven years to avoid estate duties what little money was left would be eaten up paying the lloyds losses helen was so distraught marcus felt he had to give up his london digs and stay with her at least for the autumn term helen managed to justify this sacrifice as not being too great it would be so much better for marcuss asthma living in the country and commuting to london for his weekly lessons and at least it would get him away from that trampy flora helen was too selfcentred to realize how upset marcus was by malises death she had always lacked the gift of intimacy and been admired rather than liked now for the first time in her life she felt popular and absolutely amazed by everyones kindness the wonderful letters the solicitous telephone calls the invitations to stay the quiches and appleturnovers left in the porch dear helen you must eat but once this stream of sympathy dried up and she no longer had the funeral to plan helen sunk into apathy terrified of becoming addicted she refused to take tranquillizers or sleepingpills or even a stiff drink to get her through the increasingly dark winter evenings she had never got on with her daughter tabitha who was still at boardingschool who spent all her time at penscombe with rupert and taggie marcus and his career therefore became all she had to live for marcus felt the millstone of her dark cloying love weighing him down and once again was ashamed of longing so much for all the fun of his london life with flora boris and now abby the piano seemed to be his only refuge meanwhile over in new york rannaldini had not been enjoying the domination over the new world symphony orchestra he had hoped for possibly because his musicians were in revolt that he earned a hundred times more in a night than they did in a week he was still having gruelling battles with the unions and endless lawsuits had been brought by unfairly sacked musicians there was also the unread pile of unsolicited manuscripts and far too much contemporary music to programme and no boris to weed out and translate it for him any more two and a half years on rannaldini was also still brooding on how he could get his revenge on rupert for orchestrating the breakup of his marriage to kitty and hijacking his plane in ba the elm is a patient tree murmured rannaldini it hateth and waiteth a few days after malises death rannaldini was lunching on oysters and seafood salad in his penthouse flat which was papered with platinum discs and photographs of himself with the famous and which overlooked the tawny autumnal beauty of central park picking up the times which was flown out to him every day from london rannaldini observed that another wife was standing by her cabinet minister husband the photograph had been cropped at waist level but rannaldini felt sure the wife had a stiletto heel in her husbands gucci toecap and a knee in his groin despite the linked arms and the frenetically smiling faces kitty had not stood by him the bitch turning the pages easing a piece of squid out of his back teeth rannaldini discovered malises obituary a glow job describing his brilliant war his knowledge of paintings his work on the flute and his skill as a chef déquipe where he was the only person who could harness the genius of rupert campbellblack he is survived by a second wife and one daughter from his first marriage read rannaldini pouring himself another glass of pouillyfumé he could remember the exquisite helen at a school concert definitely one of ruperts finest thoroughbreds an earnest intellectual snob thirty years younger than her upright second husband and in need of a little excitement smiling rannaldini took out a piece of dovegrey writingpaper and picked up his jadegreen fountainpen he wrote in green ink my dear helen may i please forgive my presumption but going through some old newspapers which i hadnt had time to read i found the times obituary of your husband what an extraordinary finelooking multitalented man i had no idea that the m m gordon who wrote to my mind the definitive work on the flute was married to you i would so like to have met him you wont remember but we met briefly when your son accompanied my daughter natasha when she sang hark hark the lark at a bagley hall concert a few years ago he showed immense promise i hope he has taken up the piano as a career you must be utterly desolate but please comfort yourself as voltaire wrote rannaldini sighed with pleasure helen would love voltaire but he decided to translate the poem americans werent too hot on french there are two deaths and one is such that all men dread and all abhor the one is to be loved no more the others nothing much this is in no way to dismiss the depths of your suffering but at least you are safe in the knowledge you were never betrayed my young wife left me for a boy her own age two and a half years ago i cannot say i envy you but at least malises love for you and yours for him is intact and untarnished does malise have any unpublished work i would be so interested to read it and assist its publication perhaps when your heart is a little easier you would have lunch with me i have a jet or a helicopter that could collect you perhaps when i am next in london and we could share our sadness yours ever rannaldini hark hark the lark sang rannaldini as smirking he sealed the envelope and set the letter aside to be posted in a few weeks time when the trickle of consoling letters would have dried up and his would have far more impact helen was utterly charmed rannaldinis letter arrived at the beginning of november at the nadir of her despair it looked as though she was definitely going to have to sell the old rectory and malises daughter whom she had never liked although shed taken on malises two black labradors which helen had also never liked was contesting the will and had laid claim to malises prettier pieces because they were family heirlooms of course helen remembered rannaldini from the school concert arriving late and plonking himself next to hermione harefield so helen had been forced to move back a row and sit next to rupert who had behaved abominably as usual whispering to taggie and even nodding off and snoring in counterpoint to the mozart concerto marcus had been playing so beautifully helen was utterly heartbroken over malises death but rannaldinis letter comforted her she wrote back a charming note littered with quotations saying lunch would be delightful after all she told herself firmly rannaldini might well be able to give marcus a legup in his career marcus meanwhile with conspicuous gallantry had tackled his father about giving helen an allowance rupert had replied that hed think about it but had gazed out of the window at the reddygold leaves cascading down from his towering beeches as fast as his money seemed to be pouring into lloyds thank god he hadnt been too badly hit and had never risked the house or any of the land but he didnt see why the hell he should support helen it was sixteen years since shed buggered off and hed paid every penny to support marcus and tabitha and was still giving them both whacking great allowances when hed first met helen she had been working for a publisher and always pointing out his literary déficiences she could bloody well get a job now privately rupert was absolutely livid with helen for asking jake lovell back to the house after the funeral jake was doing too bloody well as a trainer and rupert was consumed by all the ancient jealousy that malise had loved jake more than him to top it taggie had enraged rupert by asking helen to stay for christmas claiming that she and marcus couldnt be all alone the first year after malises death i suppose youre going to serve lame duck at christmas dinner he said nastily and taggie remembering sister angelicas warning about too many limping ducks felt a cold chill thirteen rannaldini planned his first telephone call to catch helen at a particularily low ebb she had just returned from evensong at which malise should have been reading the lesson the church had always been full of admiring ladies on such occasions tonight they had turned up to see how his widow was coping not very well it seemed afterwards as helen emerged into the drizzle of a chill november evening feeling them all shying away she had scuttled off blackscarfed head bowed slipping on the yellow leaves concealing the slimy paving stones she was too distraught to pause and to speak a word of comfort to malise in his cold bed tomorrow she would bring him the pinched remnants of the rose garden as marcus had gone to hear murray perahia playing at the wigmore hall helen had a long night ahead terrified of sleeping alone since the black labradors had departed even more terrified of waking to the horrors of life without malise and a new one hundred thousand pound lloyds bill the telephone was ringing as she came through the door malise an instinctive desperate hope but it was only a friend whod been in church bossily summoning her to a dinner party only ten of us do you good to get out eight for eightthirty strictly caszh helen had never been casual in her life im not up to it annabel course you are ive asked meredith whalen for you such a duck and when one gets to our age im afraid one has to put up with gays why should some poor gay have to put up with me im sorry i cant helen banged down the receiver with such force the roses on the hall table scattered dark red petals all over the flagstones joining a shoal of leaves which the icy wind had swept in through the still open front door the drawingroom flowers were dropping she mustnt let standards slip the telephone rang again i truly cant annabel she shrieked hysterically signora gordon said a deep caressing velvety voice ow are you theese ees rannaldini ere he was so gently solicitous that helen found herself quite able to accept an invitation to lunch on wednesday when rannaldinis spies had made sure marcus would be safely at the academy helen had always prided herself on her homework but on this occasion she had no need to buy any of rannaldinis cds malise had collected most of them admiring their clarity colour and controlled passion helen also rewatched rannaldinis famous video of don giovanni and found it deeply disturbing as the cameras lingered on hermione harefields rosy romping nudity and even more so on the still cold face and beautifully moving hands of rannaldini himself she was horrified that with malise only two months dead she should be thrown into such a panic at the prospect of lunching with such a fatally glamorous man or how resentful she felt towards malise for leaving her too poor to buy a new dress she couldnt find her newish olivegreen cashmere anywhere wretched tabitha must have whipped it which meant she had to fall back on the saint laurent black suit shed worn to ruperts and taggies wedding at least its white puritan collar would hide the dandruff which had snowed down since malises death wednesday morning brought more devastating bills helen whod been up at first light spent the morning in tears tidying unnecessarily she had felt her daily womans chaperonage when rannaldini arrived was more important than the gossip mrs edwards would later impart round the village but as a final straw mrs edwards rolled up puffing with excited disapproval and brandishing a badtaste piece in the scorpion who would helen the most beautiful widow in england marry now suggestions included pierce brosnan boris levitsky richard ingrams edward heath julian clary lysanders father david hawkley a darkly handsome headmaster who was as the scorpion pointed out a dead ringer for malise and horror upon horror rannaldini photographed smouldering on the rostrum helen couldnt stop blushing as she told mrs edwards that by extraordinary coincidence signor rannaldini would be popping in that morning to look at the colonels unpublished work on the flute i must ffind a ffolder for it she stammered bolting upstairs and i should coco muttered mrs edwards taking a hefty slug of the colonels sloe gin before strategically positioning herself with the antiquax in the study off the hall not that there was much to polish the poor little soul couldnt stop cleaning since the colonel had passed away in front of her dressingtable helen prayed her blushes would not spread to horrible red blotches on her neck starting on her face she plucked a grey hair from her left eyebrow and five more from her temples combing lustreless tendrils over her hair line to hide more dandruff it would be drifting soon taking her handmirror to the window she gasped in horror with a compass despair and worry had scratched new lines round her pinched mouth and reddened eyes outside the garden looked horribly untidy half the trees stripped halfshowing rainblackened limbs at awkward dislocated angles as they struggled out of their redandyellow rags then before her eyes a gust of wind covered the lawn with leaves again malise had insisted on sweeping them up at once the leaves would break her in the end glancing in the mirror she saw that tears had left a blob of mascara on her cheekbone as she wiped it away the skin stayed pleated helen gave a groan she couldnt face rannaldini mrs edwards would have to say she was ill but bang on midday punctual for the first time in his life rannaldini landed his big black helicopter on the lawn sending all the leaves swirling upwards around him as he leapt out don giovanni returning from the eternal bonfire blimey said mrs edwards applying antiquax on top of antiquax for rannaldini was stained mahogany from ten days studying scores in the caribbean sun wading through the leaves like a surfer he handed helen a big bunch of tabascored freesias then he briefly put his arms round her so she could enjoy the muscular springiness of his body and its saunawarmth as though he had indeed emerged from hellfire i know exactly how tired and lonely and cold you feel all the time he murmured then stepping back and staring deep into her eyes but nothing dim you great beauty no wonder autumn ees in retreat when you upstage heem like this rannaldini had always been able to lay it on with a jcb blushing redder than the freesias helen invited him in while she put them in water better than a film star thought mrs edwards kicking the study door further open as she rubbed antiquax into the blue damask arm of a chair as helen belted off to find a vase and slap on another layer of clinique foundation rannaldini explored the charming drawingroom with its apricot walls faded grey silk curtains and glass cases containing helens porcelain collection one would have to break the glass to reach her as well reflected rannaldini he thought it a particularly beautiful room because of the preponderance of his records and because of a photograph of tabitha on the piano bareback astride an old grey pony her hair was in a blond plait and her eyes were as cool and disdainful as ruperts the elm is a patient tree it hateth and waiteth thought rannaldini lasciviously malise had had a good eye for paintings rannaldini admired a cotman and a little pisarro but what had possessed him to hang that frightful oil of poplars against a sunset with a cow which looked more like a warthog in the foreground then he read the rather obtrusive signature helen gordon on a side table was an open poetry book who would have thought my shriveld heart could have recovered greenness read rannaldini in the desk the green leather blotter wouldnt close round the sheaf of bills flipping through them rannaldini saw that helen really was in trouble the cotman and the pisarro would soon be off to sothebys hearing her footsteps as she returned with the freesias in a saxeblue jug he turned back to her painting this is excellent oh how darling of you malise liked it i didnt have much time but perhaps now helens voice trailed off then pulling herself together she picked up a file on a sidetable you said youd like to see malises unpublished work have you really got time it is huge honour i will make time lied rannaldini mrs edwards was polishing the hall table now to have a better look the colonel had been a real gentleman although rather frail towards the end but this fellow looked as though he had three or four more pints of blood pumping round his veins and that lovely boris chevalier accent you help malise asked rannaldini i made suggestions said helen eagerly how lucky to have someone to share ones life work rannaldinis deep sigh fluttered the pages as he returned them to the file its fascinating how the flute was given the cold shoulder by musicians in the nineteenth century began helen earnestly because it lacked sufficient expressive range may i to shut her up rannaldini took malises flute out of its case tuned for a second and started to play prokofiev malise played that helens eyes filled with tears i am sorry i will stop no no i never dreamt id hear it again so soon do you play other instruments piano oboe trumpet bassoon violin teemps goodness with so many accomplishments what made you become a conductor rannaldini laughed because at heart every man wants to be a fuhrer we must go to lunch i take you home then seeing the apprehension in helens eyes added dont worry my secretaries my gardener my ousekeeper and her usband my driver uncle tom cobbley and probably his grey mare will all chaperone you as the helicopter circled the old rectory before turning south helen could see mrs edwards belting down the drive twenty minutes early and gave a wail i forgot to put on the alarm im so scared of being burgled rannaldini smiled at her its already too late my darling orange leaves of beech saffron flames of larch still flickered in the umber woods as they flew over the little village of paradise up the river fleet to rannaldinis house valhalla lurking pigeongrey and wrapped in its conspirators cloak of trees helen had a heady glimpse of tenniscourts a swimmingpool the dark serpentine coils of a yewtree maze wonderful gardens horses out in their rugs in fields sloping down to the river and deep in the wood the watchtower where rannaldini worked and seduced valhalla itself narrowwindowed and brooding had been built before the reformation ive been reading a fascinating book on the dissolution of the monasteries began helen not wanting another lecture rannaldini whisked her down dark passages past suits of armour tattered banners and tapestries into a red drawingroom how pretty gasped helen meredith whalen decorate it and the kitchen when i was married to keety you ave such exquisite taste i pay you to theenk up new colour schemes oh i couldnt take your money my child purred rannaldini i know you need eet as i need your help to exorcize bad memory of my life with keety next week i go to prague for ten days by the time i return you must think up something wonderful but helen was crying again malise and i were going to prague on november for our anniversary malise tried to get tickets for a production of don giovanni at the stasis theatre mozart premièred it there in november you know and that was where they made amadeus but it was sold out because i am conducting smirked rannaldini of course how stupid of me said helen appalled since malise died i dont remember anything eet ees shock itll come back rannaldini poured her a glass of pouillyfumé you shall come to prague with me instead but i cant leave marcus and i cant afford it babbled helen you will be my guest i stay in flat i book you room in nice hotel i will send you plane ticket and ticket for don giovanni just for twentyfour hours you deserve a treat putting a warm hand on her neck as comforting as a wool scarf just dried on the radiator he led her down more passages to the big kitchen whose walls were covered in a glossy green paper populated by jungle animals and birds i certainly couldnt improve on this sighed helen i want eet changed said rannaldini chillingly keety loved the parrots and the hummingbirds i want eet out sit down i will make your lunch a bowl of soup will do stammered helen i cant eat at the moment then you will start from a nextdoor office despite faxes billowing out like smoke four telephones constantly ringing and the raindrop patter of expensive computors rannaldinis secretaries whod all read the scorpion kept finding excuses to pop in and gawp at helen princess margarets office had rung they said domingo wanted advice on an interpretation sir michael tippett wondered if rannaldini had had a moment to look at his latest opera hermione had rung four times rannaldini said he would call them all back later as he cooked checking rice throwing pink chunks of lobster into sizzling butter then laying them tenderly on a bed of shallots tarragon and tomatoes separating eggs boiling down fish stock helen talked her tongue loosened by a second glass of wine she told him about her money problems the big house she couldnt afford to keep up marcuss asthma and her worries about his friendship with flora she was delighted when rannaldini dismissed flora as an evil little tramp we will take marcus to the mountains he went on warmly then his voice thickened like the eggs in the double saucepan how about your daughter quite out of control helen didnt want to tell him how incensed she had been about the appropriation of the olivegreen cashmere so she added at halfterm tabitha borrowed my credit card saying she needed some school books then used it to buy a pair of jeans and spend the afternoon on a sunbed i cannot stand such vanity and such lies rannaldini who was no stranger to lies and would have been quite out of control on a sunbed with tabitha expressed his disapproval topping a cloud of white rice with butter and putting it in a slower part of the aga he gave the lobster sauce a stir and started chopping up chives for a salad of lettuce hearts how can you do so many things at once marvelled helen i am conductor helen wandered over to the screen which kitty over the years had lovingly covered with photographs of rannaldini and the famous everyones here she cried thinking what fascinating people she would meet if rannaldini became her er friend why dyou record in prague because its ten times cheaper than london or new york not speaking ill of your country helen but i am tired of new york last time i record a haydn symphony the shop steward sit watching second and go round four seconds to go eight bars from the end he leap on to the stage all right you guys its over i tried to keel him i had to be pulled off eet takes an act of congress and then of god to get rid of musicians over there i am almost broken man sighed rannaldini belying it by removing his suede jacket to show off his splendid physique but i must not talk any more i will burn your lunch putting a white mountain of rice on each emeraldgreen plate he spooned over the sizzling lobster mixture then poured on the buttery sauce topping it with a dash of cayenne voila this is too much protested helen you weel eat every bit even if i have to feed you rannaldini filled up her glass again how wonderfully easy to give dinner parties if one were living with rannaldini mused helen and think of the guest list her eyes strayed again to kittys screen it is quite quite delicious she said in awe as he told her his plans for the future rannaldinis warm eyes never left her face the leaves tumbling down remind me of new leaf i must turn over i am tired of jetting round world i must settle down in this lovely house write music and build up a great orchestra of wonderful musicians who would not be always chasing engagements and money like the london orchestras or threatening strike action like the guys in new york you could be another simon rattle said helen warmly rannaldini scowled the cbso is secondrate provincial orchestra he said haughtily you cant say that malise always felt fortunately rannaldinis third secretary popped her head round the door to say the princess of wales was on the line my dear rannaldini took the telphone may i ring you back in one hour hed be leaving for the albert hall to conduct turangalila around five oclock helen was so speechless with admiration that this great maestro should find time for her she forgot about simon rattle why dont you come with me this evening asked rannaldini playfully spooning the last of her lobster into her mouth i must get back for marcus eef only i had had a mother like you will hermione harefield be singing in prague asked helen this salad is so good no she sing in aida in rome and elephant run away with her nellie the elephant pack her trunk and run away with hermione sang rannaldini his face was expressionless but he gave helen a wicked sideglance and she burst out laughing poor hermione i have to confess helen went on i do have reservations about don giovanni as an opera the don reminds me so much of rupert she gave a shiver and the way he used to get his best friend billy lloydfoxe to cover for him like leporello i know rannaldini slid his hand over hers jake lovell talks of you often how terribly unhappy rupert made you how kind of jake said helen touched jake threw you lifebelt when you needed it said rannaldini but long term he would have bored you you are much too bright for him machiavellian rannaldini pressed every organ stop of helens vanity thats why he let you go he added knowing perfectly well that jake had dumped helen do you think hes happy with his wife jake dream of you often lied rannaldini selecting a ripe peach caressing its downy curves and who would not picking up a knife he laid bare the gold flesh helen found herself not only sharing the peach with him but after another glass agreeing to come to prague rannaldinis secretary then brought in a pile of fan mail have you sewn that button on my tailcoat he called after her shapely departing back people think being a conductor he continued as in dark green ink he scribbled his name on each letter is all helicopters jets and princesses but eet consist of worry where youll stop long enough to get your laundry done genius shouldnt have to worry about clean shirts and missing buttons said helen shocked rupert never bothered to answer fan mail she added that appal me rannaldini signed a couple of photographs eef by writing back to these young people i can lead them on to a lifetime of loving music it is small thing what a genuinely good man you are helen suppressed a belch how people have misjudged you come for a walk said rannaldini putting his huge wolf coat round her shoulders how it become you a leetle lamb in wolfs clothing as they walked up a path behind the house the low afternoon sun kept parting the clouds shining through yellowandorange leaves so they glowed like amber and topaz rannaldini picked up a red beech leaf and held it against a soft brown wand of ash leaves you must always wear brown with your red hair he told her black is too hard as they passed a monks graveyard helen noticed a little pink flower with bright crimson leaves growing out of the wall what a dear little plant it ees called herb robert all the year it flower the monks used the leaves to staunch flow of blood herb roberto teased helen as they stopped to lean on a mossy gate such a beautiful name why dont you use it my mother who reject me call me that roberto repeated helen softly coming from your lips it sound bettair not wanting to frighten her rannaldini decided against a kiss as they turned for home a biblical ray appeared through the clouds spotlighting valhalla and the saffron larches as though the place was on fire look helen it is omen my past go up in flames like götterdämmerung i bring you on this walk rannaldini took her hand because the trees at the top of the wood never turn because they only get sunshine in the evening oh helen let us have some sunshine in the evening of our lives helen squeezed his hand so moved that she couldnt speak before you come to prague said rannaldini i must send you my video of don giovanni helen who prided herself on telling the truth took a deep breath we have the video roberto but i must say neither malise nor i thought it was your best effort the music was delightful but all the sexual innuendo and the nudity seemed to trivialize the production go on said rannaldini icily and we both felt that the camera rested on your face too much although its fascinating watching a great conductor at work it rather distracts from the action my don giovanni achieve higher rating than eastenders it had popular appeal maybe roberto said helen earnestly but i think you are capable of greater things do you indeed rannaldini gazed fixedly ahead realizing she had goofed helen said hastily i guess its my fault as i said the don is so like rupert how is ruperts exquisite wife asked rannaldini silkily helens face tightened she was wildly jealous of taggie not only had she made rupert happy she was also adored by marcus and tabitha and when he was alive by malise thatll teach her to slag off my don giovanni thought rannaldini in amusement i expect shes busy chaining herself to some railing to stop lambs and calves being shipped alive to the continent said helen tartly the thought of taggie campbellblack being chained to anything excited rannaldini unbearably peter maxwell davies is on the telephone the second secretary greeted rannaldini and helen as they entered the house have you looked at his symphony yet put it in my briefcase i do it tonight rannaldini looked at his watch do you admire boris levitskys berlin wall symphony asked helen anxious to keep her end up malise and i were overwhelmed by it hopelessly derivative boris speak of being divinely inspired by the great composers sneeringly rannaldini pretended to pick up a telephone allo beethoven ow are you i am ready to receive message i take it down and out come chopsteeks thats unfair said helen reprovingly boris is very dear hes been so supportive since malise died he rings me three or four times a week i know marcus would love him as a stepfather she added defiantly and then felt absolutely miserable she is very insecure decided rannaldini malise had restored her confidence and hung a picturelight over her beauty now it had gone out changing tack he said gently many men would like to be marcuss stepfather eef you didnt like my don giovanni i must give you other records and eef you wont come to albert hall clive my chauffeur will drive you home later that evening marcus endured a halfhour moan about bills from a restless soberedup helen he then pointed to nielsens flute concerto and mahlers resurrection symphony lying on the piano if were that broke why are you buying that bastards records startled because marcus was normally so tolerant hoping mrs edwards wouldnt drop her in it helen tried a grey lie rannaldini wrote me a delightful letter admiring malises flute book and sent me the nielsen and the mahler because he thought i needed cheering up helen gave a deep sigh sure mum rannaldinis still a fiend he wiped out flora and he crucified poor kitty you ask lysander lysander stole rannaldinis wife said helen furiously because rannaldini was so unfaithful to her hes randier than dads jack russells then as helen winced added small man syndrome although for a small man he casts a long shadow and hes got a repulsive blackleatherclad henchman called clive who takes women off the bone for him helen shuddered why does he dislike boris so much i read it somewhere she added hastily boris is taller said marcus and a million times more talented rannaldini only admires musicians who are dead this article said he could be nice only because its such bliss when the electrodes stop fourteen helen was appalled the last thing she wanted was another promiscuous sadist when rannaldini called shed just refuse politely but rannaldini did not call expert at fostering addiction he knew exactly how to give a blue glimpse of paradise before slamming the skylight shut whizzing off abroad he left helen to stew for a fortnight until she was diving for the telephone snatching letters from the postman and scanning the pallid november skies praying one of the circling rooks would grow into a big black helicopter then on the morning of the opening night when she had abandoned all hope rannaldini rang blithely from prague i hope you are coming a messenger will drop tickets for plane and for don giovanni within the hour clive will meet you at prague i book you into charming discreet hotel lesplanade i didnt know i was expected helens voice scraped down a blackboard of indignation i cant make it at such short notice i didnt want to pressure you confessed rannaldini an i wasnt sure of production but eet come good then after a long pause he whispered i need you helen as helen arrived at heathrow a defiant red sun leaving the western sky aflame had just been sucked below the dark horizon like don giovanni never had helen been less prepared for a trip normally every local legend would have been memorized every fine church charted in anticipation of their own proposed trip malise had bought her a guide book to prague but she had been too superstitious to open it and once she was on the plane she couldnt take in a word she kept panicking about things including her wits she had left behind to avoid the bourbonbreathed attentions of a businessman with hairy nostrils in the next seat she accepted a copy of the times from the hostess only to find among the birthdays that international conductor rannaldini was fortyfour today on the cusp of scorpio and sagittarius those two most volatile and darkly virile signs rannaldini must want to share his birthday with her and she had brought no present except a first edition of malises book on the flute how awful although fog symbolizing her confusion delayed the plane by nearly two hours rannaldinis leporello the sinister clive his light eyes as unblinking and expressionless as a cobras was still waiting helen kept as far away from his lean leatherclad body as her seatbelt would allow she was so thin now there would be nothing for him to take off the bone she was far too uptight to be more than fleetingly aware of empty illlit restaurants floodlit fortresses and spires a gleaming river and overcrowded unkempt trees trying to escape over park railings as the czechs had only recently had mass access to cars the driving was hairraising clive swore under his breath as somehow avoiding headon collisions he hurtled rannaldinis black mercedes down the narrowest of streets rattling over the cobbles as if he would bang the heads of the tall lowering houses together the hotel as rannaldini predicted was charming with a crescent of smiling receptionists take your time weve missed the first act clive called after her as an ancient knowing porter drove the rickety tram of a lift up to the fifth floor seeing her pinched twitching reflection in the lift mirror helen was overwhelmed with longing for malise hed always thought she looked beautiful and would have known exactly how many kopeks to tip the porter the next moment she was gasping with joy for her entire room was filled with different coloured freesias embracing her in their sweet heady scent beside a blue glass bowl spilling over with persimmons peaches and passionfruit was a bottle of krug on ice and the bathroom was full of soap and bottles containing every permutation of balmains jolie madame how darling of rannaldini to have realized it was her favourite perfume more magical still on the drab beige bedspread lay a long crushed velvet dress in the same soft umber as the drenched ash wand he had picked up in the wood on the dressingtable was a red leather case from cartiers and a letter my darling the dress is to go with your beechleaf hair in box is small present to echo the stars i will put back in your eyes in hope rannaldini collapsing on the bed so hard it nearly broke her back helen opened the box inside glittered a diamond necklace the dress was wonderfully becoming the high neck and long sleeves concealed her jutting collar bones and refugee arms the ribbed clinging velvet made her look salukislender but what would happen when rannaldini undressed her and found the skeleton beneath the skin and how could she not sleep with him after accepting these gifts she wouldnt mind so much if her bottom hadnt dropped and if she didnt feel so leadenlimbed and out of practice what would happen if she froze inside as she had done so often with rupert the clasp of the diamonds nearly defeated her shaking hands she was going home the telephone rang oh why wasnt it malise whenever youre ready lisped clives voice as helen came out of the lift he was singing to himself wheres my master don giovanni making love to youth and beauty while i stay on sentry duty but there was no admiration in his face he preferred the more butch male singers from the chorus it had been the worst preopening week he could remember he told helen on the drive to the theatre rannaldinis clashes with singers and orchestra had been epic musicians here are used to working for the state and having the same job for life so it doesnt matter if they learn the parts or arrive on time theyre very bolshy all the singers were in tears at the dress rehearsal donna anna said firstnight nerves were a doddle compared with rannaldinis rages im the one with the first night nerves thought helen clive shouldnt discuss his boss like this its incredible to think she said reprovingly mozart himself conducting the première of don giovanni in this very theatre more than two hundred years ago and casanova was in the audience and wrote some of the libretto leered clive thinking rannaldini would have left both the don and casanova standing this week theres the theatre ahead romantically and softly lit by oldfashioned streetlamps and hung with windowboxes full of clashing redandmauve geraniums rose a square peppermintgreen building the foyer was flanked with hefty pillars that would have challenged even sampson how beautiful sighed helen if only we werent so late in mozarts day it was fashionable to be late and not stay the course said clive as he locked the car doors the kings and princes of prague used to make a quick exit from the royal box down those he pointed to an outside staircase so they could rush off to their fancy pieces helen looked bootfaced clive was far too familiar then they both jumped at a deafening machinegun rattle coming from the auditorium the traditional applause for the conductor at the beginning of the last act shit muttered clive only by brandishing his identity card as rannaldinis minion did he manage to smuggle helen past the doorman who had had death threats not to admit latecomers does signor rannaldini know ive arrived asked helen as they belted up the wide spiral staircase no lied clive once an opera starts rannaldini cannot be disturbed he hates to lose the mood he paces the conductors room like the prince of darkness sometimes in the interval he has a shower and changes his shirt in a trance not realizing it there are moments when art transcends everything panted helen but as clive smuggled her into a box overlooking the pit the door banged and in her nervousness helen dropped her bag with a clatter there was a horrified silence bows stopped moving wind and brass players stopped breathing rannaldini whipped round in a fury he was known to scream at latecomers or worse still hurl down his baton and storm out but as he caught sight of helen hugeeyed in the halflight diamonds glittering at her graceful neck like the pleiades he gave a wonderfully theatrical start and stopped conducting donna elvira languishing on her balcony don giovanni and leporello swapping clothes in the shadowy garden and all the musicians looked at him incredulously as though a metronome had broken down rannaldini gazed at helen then a smile of such rare sweetness and joy spread across his face that a ripple of laughter went through the orchestra and the nearby boxes and everyone was desperately craning round and leaping to their feet to see the beauty who had stopped the great maestro in his course hastily rannaldini pulled himself together i am sorry briefly he turned to the audience then back to the musicians and singers we begin the trio again taci injusti core the exquisite music started don giovanni resumed his amorous escapades helen was overwhelmed clearly even for rannaldini there were times when love was much more important than art clive was grinning broadly when during an exuberant tutti he slid back into the box bearing a bottle of champagne a glass and a plate of caviar with the maestros compliments he whispered he was worried this afternoon that you might not have had time to eat the toast was still warm like rannaldinis hands helen quivered with excitement marcus had so misjudged him she must eat a little but she mustnt crunch too loudly in the dim light she admired mozarts theatre gold tiers decorated with plump white cherubs rose up and up to a huge unlit chandelier oblong gilt mirrors on the inside of each slateblue velvet box huge gold tassels on the midnightblue curtains on either side of the stage the musicians instruments all added to the subdued glitter below her in a pit bigger than one of the czech grand nationals fearsome ditches the musicians played as if their lives depended on it it was also a mark of rannaldinis genius that after such an interruption he immediately got his glamorous cast of unknown singers back on course without any slackening of tension it was also obvious except to a dazzled helen that after her arrival both donna anna and donna elvira sang of the pangs of love with even more tearful conviction zerlina exuding snapping sloeeyed sexiness in a cherryred peasants dress on the other hand was glaring at rannaldini as she defiantly flashed soft white thighs and black stockings held up by one red and one purple garter at her stodgy lover masetto but helen had only eyes for rannaldini bewildered that such energy should come out of such stillness his hardly moving stick twitched like a cats tail his hair now ravenblack with sweat was the only evidence of expended energy they were into the moonlit graveyard now as giovanni vaulted over the wall to boast of more conquests to a terrified leporello helen thought once again with the anger of too much champagne how like rupert he was then she gasped in terror as the gaunt grey statue of the commendatore on his stone horse came to life and to the doomladen accompaniment of the trombones uttered the first dreadful greeting to the don your laughter will be silenced before morning who goes there undaunted by any ghost giovanni swung his machinegun round the tombstones as the sepulchral voice rang out again ordering him to leave the dead in peace helens blood ran even colder the statue looked so like malise on his deathbed malise had rescued her from rupert now he seemed to be warning her from the grave to stay away from rannaldini but helen was most unnerved by the lascivious halfsmile on rannaldinis face as the handsome young don still raging and unrepentant was finally sucked down into a quicksand of leaping flame aaah it was like watching a great aeroplane crash the prussianblue curtains closed like the gates of hell there was a stunned pause as the audience realized rannaldini had scrapped the last moralizing chorus then followed a deafening roar of applause as the lights went up and the vast chandelier glittered like a huge thistle overhead helen could see the full beauty of the theatre its soft blues and golds like a sunlit day at sea but loveliest to helen were the tier upon tier of ecstatically cheering people down below the musicians were shaking hands and hugging each other in delight as the cast trooped onto the stage elated but slightly bewildered at such an ovation how pretty the girls were strongfeatured redlipped lusty and displaying such full white breasts as they bent to gather up the carnations raining down rannaldini got the greatest cheer of all for a man whod been conducting for two hours forty minutes who was black under the eyes and whose suntan had faded he looked magnificent smaller than any of the men but dwarfing them with his personality donna elvira and donna anna on either side of him had kicked off their high heels and the audience cheered even louder as he kissed their hands and then reached out for the hand of zerlina who was sulking down the row then the chorus returned and everyone sang happy birthday in czech and donna elvira presented rannaldini with pink roses and a bust of mozart helen was in despair surrounded by such youth and vitality how could he bother with a scraggy wrinkly like herself grabbing her bag she frantically applied blusher then jumped as clive banged on the door time to congratulate the maestro as he led her down into the dingy catacombs behind the stage she was reminded of dantes inferno but was reassured by a glimpse of the commendatore having removed his grey makeup and his white wig to reveal a ruddy complexion and wavy yellow hair he was now putting on bicycle clips and eating a sausage sandwich the conductors room was pandemonium the screaming matches the fearful bullying had been forgotten in the euphoria of an historic performance cast and musicians alike were pouring in to thank rannaldini bringing him hastily written cards with their addresses on rannaldini because he could see helen working her way down the long queue and he wanted to create an impression of amiability bothered for once to shake hands with everyone and promised to return as soon as possible still in his tails he had only had time to remove his white tie and gardenia he was burning hot yet wringing with sweat as he took helen in his arms my beautiful child i ave longed for this moment he murmured in english too fast for the czechs to understand then sotto voce to clive get rid of everybody at once you will come on to our party wont you maestro pleaded donna elvira i bake birthday cake for you whispered donna anna pocketing his discarded gardenia i must have shower i will see you later said rannaldini zerlina said nothing but her mascara was streaked with tears as clive frogmarched her without any gentleness down the passage the moment they had gone rannaldini locked the door that was a most exciting pperformance stammered helen rannaldini smiled evilly you wait till later my angel helen blushed it was far more erotic without nudity i leesten to you said rannaldini gravely oh if i was some small help helen was in heaven and the way you control them all with this tiny stick she picked up his baton its a magic wand i weesh i could transform thees room into a bower of bliss said rannaldini fretfully nothing could have been less seductive than the fluorescent lighting the ugly brown carpet the repro desk and hard chair the fitted cupboards the pedal dustbin the fridge and shower behind a dingy beige plastic curtain you should see my room in new york rannaldini hastily kicked a purple garter under the desk but enduring art not surroundings are what matters said helen earnestly and thank you so much for this wonderful dress roberto and the flowers and the caviar and champagne and these beautiful diamonds but its not my birthday dont be silly cutting short her thanks rannaldini lifted the diamonds and slowly kissed her collar bone caressing it with his tongue until she was squirming with desire i must be the one person in the world who didnt know it was your birthday she whispered the only thing i brought you was a first edition of malises book but its at the hotel that ees the present i want second most in the world said a delighted rannaldini now i feel malise geeve us his blessing as he gently fingered her ribs the ball of his thumb was pressing against the underside of her breast the present i want you to geeve me most ees yourself but as he moved into the attack helen leapt away we cant people know were in here you ought to change youll catch your death rannaldini deliberated many women were desperately turned on by a burning sweating aprèsconcert body helen was probably too fastidious the elm is a patient tree rannaldini got a bottle of white out of the fridge and filled two glasses will you wait while i have a shower embarrassingly aware a few seconds later of rannaldini naked behind the shower curtain helen said she would put his roses in water they droop already unlike me rannaldini shouted over the gush of water i am so pleased you are here kiri and placido say the same everyone pours in and kisses you saying how wonderful it was then they drift away none of those young women wanted to drift away this evening helen was unable to keep the edge out of her voice i am sure everyone felt you should have played the don that boy was much too young for the part the libretto describe giovanni as a licentious young nobleman protested rannaldini i am neither young nor noble any moment you are going to be ennobled sir roberto said helen archly then as rannaldini emerged from the shower his sleek still brown body as smooth as butterscotch a big white towel slung around his hips she caught her breath and after malise she faltered you seem very very young to me that is kind rannaldini turned back to the basin to clean his teeth as i was saying people drift away after a concert theenking you have more important people to see so you go back to your hotel hyped up totally alone and you ring home and say the applause went on for fifteen minutes and they say yeah yeah ive got this ghastly problem with the deesh washer id never bother i mean genius should never be bothered with problems like that said helen aghast totally forgetting how often she moaned to rupert when he was showjumping in the old days rannaldini turned flashing beautiful clean teeth at her come here my darling stop playing games dont you want to go to your birthday party certainly not there would be far too many recently pleasured members of the cast wanting repeat feels sliding into a splendid red silk turnbull and asser dressing gown he picked up the bottle and glasses and sang in a rich baritone you lay your hands in mine dear softly youll whisper yes tis not so far to go dear your heart is mine confess you sing beautifully sighed helen taking his hand come let me show you mozarts theatre where is everyone quavered helen as he led her up and down steps along pitchblack passages gone home said rannaldini whod tipped the night porter more than he earned in a year wait ere dont move he let go of her hand helen was petrified the darkness was strangling her then she heard footsteps rannaldini there was no answer dont play games with me suddenly she saw a flicker ahead oh thank god rannaldini was lighting candles stumbling forward she gave a piercing shriek as she found herself looking up into the livid face of the commendatores horse over here you must not be so jumpy rannaldini drew her over some cables to where candles were flickering merrily on either side of a vast carved bed hung with turquoiseandwhite striped curtains and foaming with white linen sheets and laced pillows whos this for giovanni chase zerlina round eet in act one lets have some moonlight rannaldini tugged down the moon from act two so it shone dimly into the fourposter but as he drew her towards the bed helen began to tremble violently come rannaldini stooped to pull her dress over her head it is time for the butterfly to emerge from her chrysalis helen burst into tears it was the same trick she had used to halt the rakes progress of rupert twenty years ago rannaldini too was all contrition what ees eet my darling malise was just so like the commendatore tonights our weddinganniversary i feel he was trying to warn me off all those young women drooling over you this evening marcus told me you were dreadfully promiscuous a good boy to protect his mother said rannaldini smoothly vowing to sabotage marcuss piano career at the first opportunity and why didnt you call me for two weeks rannaldini sunk to his knees burying his face in her concave belly because i knew i was unworthy you are so lovely you would have stopped both casanova and giovanni on their road to ruin i too have been wicked oh helen save me from the flames rannaldini was gratified to feel tears dropping on his forehead gotcha leaping to his feet he pushed her back on to the bed im so scared rannaldini do not be we play little game behold your faithful lover lives for you alone sang rannaldini really straining to reach the top notes think no longer on that appalling moment your father and your husband shall i be you felt safe with malise he went on because he was both father and lover to you and made you feel like a little girl tonight let us pretend this little girl has sunk into a decline because she is so sad her family is worried so they invite important doctor from london to see her sitting on the bed helen felt a squirming excitement the doctor geeves her medicine rannaldini raised a glass of wine to helens lips stroking her hair with his other hand now she must undress very slowly he drew the brown dress over her head so the doctor can examine her all over gently he began to stroke helens freckled shoulders and arms she is lovely but much too thin rannaldini peeled off her grey silk petticoat the next moment her grey silk bra had followed slithering suit ah how sweet in delight rannaldini gently massaged her breasts how small they are but the kind doctor will prescribe injections and a diet to make them full and beautiful again look how the nipples shoot out like sycamore buds the leetle patient is very very excited he went on but she is frightened her mother is downstairs and the doctor seem to be taking a leetle too long now he has peeled off her very clean knickers helen gave a moan of helpless excitement look at her little bush like a damp fox naughty excited leetle girl rannaldinis smile was satanic the concentration in the heavylidded eyes was total his voice was deep slow hypnotic eef the doctor suggest an operation he would have to shave her so she is even more like leetle girl thats perverted helen leapt to her feet in agitation but rannaldinis great strength pushed her back every bit of her body must be explored he drew a magnifying glass out from under the pile of pillows see she has sweet little clitoris quite beeg enough for pleasure the doctor stroke it to see ifit is in good working order and it is see how easily he slides his fingers in one finger now two good little girl helen arched and groaned too excited to care any more buckling against the relentlessly stabbing fingers writhing beneath the delicately stroking thumb the doctor is excited too he knows with loving he can cure all her seekness just for a moment his fingers emerged and trailed downwards shall the doctor examine his little patient in an even more shaming and private place she will find it so naughty and exciting she will beg and beg for more no helen was struggling please rannaldini no another time his fingers were stabbing again her breath was coming faster and faster quickly rannaldini slid out of his dressinggown his body dark gold in the flickering candlelight his splendid cock raised for the down beat look he geeve you standing ovation this is most awesome steeple you will see in prague my darling helens aaaah rivalled the dons but hers was of ecstasy as rannaldini blew out the candle and plunged deep into her and darkness he had never dreamt he could make her so wildly excited nobilmente sed appassionata whispered rannaldini as he drove on to conquest and this time the metronome never faltered fifteen helen was woken by such beautiful music she thought she had fallen asleep with the wireless on at home then she took in the gutted candles the blueandwhite striped curtains and breathed in a feral waft of maestro clinging to the wolfcoat which rannaldini had solicitously laid over her naked body wriggling into the coat she stumbled across the dimly lit stage to find rannaldini already dressed he was holding a score and picking out a tune on the harpsichord hearing her he looked up and smiled i didnt wake you what time is it rannaldini glanced at his huge rolex quarter past seven i havent slept through the night since malise died thats because you were so tired and so loved whats that tune i know it so well on a different instrument i conduct missa solemnis in berlin tonight it is very difficult piece so i flip through score that was violin solo from the benedictus didnt you sleep i was too happy people say its mistake to get your hearts desire im thoroughly enjoying it edging through the musicstands he lifted her down from the stage my leetle lamb in wolfs clothing collapsing against him hoping hed make love to her again she whispered i love you roberto good smirked rannaldini what is the purpose of the lamb but to feed the wolf not taking on board what he said helen picked up the huge score covered in redandblue pencil marks you work so hard not so hard as beethoven in his own words you must sacrifice all the little things of social life for the sake of your art thats why you must never fret if i dont call you i am only making love to beethoven leading her to the harpsichord he picked out the exquisite tune again the violin ascend to heaven like we did last night when i conduct beethoven i am so proud i am halfgerman because beethoven had greatest struggle to write the missa he thought it his greatest work a friend drop in when he was composing the credo he found poor beethoven singing howling and stamping oh helen i dream of composing again you must be my muse seizing her hands he gazed deep deep into her eyes then he said playfully but muse and genius must be fed get dressed and ave a shower my darling i have to listen to some pianist who beg me to hear her the pianist dark plump very young was playing chopins fantasie impromptu quite brilliantly when helen returned to the auditorium instantly rannaldini halted the girl and introduced her this is natalia philipova now what ees it you want to know natalia the girl clasped her hands i know i have years of hard work in front of me maestro i am willing to practise eight hours a day and more all i want to know is if you think i can ever make it as a soloist rannaldini examined his fingernails not in a million years he said smoothly you will be able to give your friends and your family a lot of pleasure i advise you to leave eet at that you were a bit rough on that poor kid reproved helen i save her ten years of wasted time said rannaldini they were sitting in a little café in the main square which looked like an ideal home exhibition of best architecture down the ages they had breakfasted on croissants damson jam slivers of cheese rolledup slices of ham with cream billowing out of each end like brandy snaps and black expresso laced with cognac usually i go off my food if im attracted to a man said helen sounding perplexed but when youre around i seem to eat like a labrador thats because the strict doctor rannaldini ran a leisurely hand up her thigh into her groin has ordered his little patient to start eating again helen flushed horrified she should have been so wildly exhilarated by last nights games rannaldini waved for the bill come i have one hour to show you prague let us go to charles bridge which thank god is closed to cars as they walked down to the river helen gave a cry of joy on the opposite bank the old city stretched itself luxuriously in the first sunshine of the day all higgledy piggledly cupolas turrets domes roofs and spires in soft pink ochre peppermintgreen and drained turquoise rose like casually stacked stagesets against the blue skyline was a cathedral with a faded seagreen dome topped with a gold star next to it stood a tawny castle with crenellated battlements like a childs fort who lives there havel said rannaldini smugly i dine with heem on thursday but most breathtaking of all was the river itself mist was rising filling the great arches of the bridges curling in wisps over the icy water the result was a million shifting shadows the trees and the houses on the bank cast different shadows on the mist and the moving water the shadows of the mist wisps themselves and the swans and ducks gliding in and out of these wisps cast and received shadows of their own everywhere zeus is searching for leda said rannaldini softly and see how the sooty black statues across the bridge cast the darkest shadows of all furious not to have mugged up the city and because malise had always praised her recitations helen launched into the tempest the cloudcappd towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself yea all which it inherit shall dissolve and like this insubstantial pageant faded leave not a rack behind this rake is not going to be left behind mocked rannaldini putting his arm through hers to lead her over the bridge you are getting cold the russians may have left prague but icy wind still blow straight from moscow sixties music was belching out of a loud speaker the people pouring over the bridge as if to repudiate any accusation of communist drabness wore brilliant collars violet turquoise shocking pink but their bulky anoraks and strapundertrousers looked very out of date as the mist thinned in the sunshine the river seemed to be strewn with cobwebs the statues on the other hand were covered in real frozen cobwebs which glittered on the sad strong slav face of christ on the cross like a veil of tears i theenk of prague as sleeping beauty thats only just awaked two sleeping beauties rannaldini turned and kissed helens lips his dark glasses only an extension of his black impenetrable eyes and last night you awake theres st christopher moving on he pointed to more statues and st cyril and st barbara patron saint of miners kafka wrote story about bridge describing her beautiful hands the statues ave to be restored and rebuilt every year like a face lift said helen you will never need one rannaldini touched her cheek you have eternal youth they had reached the centre of the bridge upstream the river still steamed like a race horse downstream it was as smooth and green as crème de men the with a striped pink pleasure launch chugging towards them and cafés with their umbrellas down on the bank now we come to pragues most famous saint st john of nepomuk said rannaldini who was the queens confessor in fourteenth century her husband king wenceslas iv was a thug the story about him setting out in snow with page boy wine and pine logs to cheer up some peasant ees balderdash rannaldinis eyes creased up with malicious laughter this wenceslas was insanely jealous of his beautiful wife and torture her confessor to reveal her secrets when nepomuk refuse wenscelas pull out poor mans tongue and chuck him in river but rannaldini pointed to a brass plaque set into the side of the bridge showing the unfortunate monk being heaved over the side where he land five bright gold stars spring out of river and hover there until nepomuks dead body was fished out this is spot where he went in picking up helens hand rannaldini placed it on ajagged gold cross on top of the bridge wall over centuries lovers come to touch the cross together rannaldini spread his big hand over hers in the hope that their love will last and prosper burying his face in helens neck he breathed in the last vestiges of jolie madame now you know why i breeng you here what a beautiful story sighed helen glancing back at the plaque the body of the poor monk is bright gold too that is where people have rubbed his body for luck over the centuries rannaldini stretched out his hand idly caressing the upsidedown nepomuk the plaque also showed the queen making her confession to nepomuk through a grill nearby her cruel handsome husband idly stroked an adoring lurcher but the tension in his body showed how hard he was listening how often during her first marriage had helen lurked on landings and outside rooms trying to overhear rupert making assignations the king even looks like rupert she was thinking aloud now hes got the same greek nose and long eyes he love his dog more than his wife teased rannaldini i nearly cited ruperts dog badger as corespondent said helen bitterly i think you are more in mourning for your first marriage than the second mocked rannaldini my first one nearly destroyed me i cant go back to that again the mist had almost disappeared upstream a flotilla of air balloons hung like teardrops artists were setting up easels a street musician playing lili marlene on the accordian was tipped with unusual generosity by rannaldini we could have done with you in the orchestra last night my friend thank you maestro how good you are to everyone sighed helen one more saint rannaldini led helen beyond the bridge and down some stone steps to the waters edge on which stood a lone statue of a slim young knight with a lion at his feet and a gold sword glittering in his hand now listen carefully rannaldini paused in front of the statue st brunswick save the lion from a cruel and wicked dragon consequently the lion became brunswicks devoted companion and also the symbol of prague brunswicks job was to guard the city the day the communist walk in in rannaldinis beautiful voice flowed on like the river brunswicks gold sword totally vanish the legend was that it would only return when prague was freed the very night prague was liberated suddenly rannaldini seemed to have difficulty speaking the joyful crowds sweeping over the bridge notice the gold sword was back in place in brunswicks hand a miracle said helen shakily rannaldini nodded removing his dark glasses he drew helen into the lichened blackened arch of the bridge and kissed her since keety leave me i have not been able to put my heart into conducting let alone composing last night with young inexperienced musicians and singers we produce performance of a lifetime later while you sleep you look so beautiful i write my first music in fifteen years i dedicate it to you you have freed my inspiration and given me back my gold sword so i can protect you oh rannaldini tears were glittering on helens face like frozen cobwebs thats the dearest thing anyones ever told me who would have thought my shriveld heart could have recovered greenness murmured rannaldini remembering the open poetry book on the table at the old rectory thats my favourite poem said helen in amazement midges were dancing like mist shadows against the bridge wall tourists drifting by gazed down on the beautiful couple i must go reluctantly rannaldini tore himself away tonight i will conduct missa just for you my darling if he had asked her to follow him to the end of the world let alone berlin helen would have gone as they drove back to the hotel rannaldini told helen he was spending christmas in his house in tuscany with his children and two of his exwives ow about you he asked i shall be staying with rupert and taggie and my children said helen showing off how well she too got on with her ex the temperature dropped perceptibly no doubt you weel have the pleasure of meeting my third wife keety and her husband lysander ruperts leetle catamite helen looked startled ive always thought rupert and billy his best friend were unnaturally close but ruperts always been aggressively heterosexual typical homophobic behaviour said rannaldini dismissively not a very intellectual christmas for you my dear at least you can enjoy the sainted taggies cooking sixteen helen arrived at penscombe on christmas eve and hadnt been in the house five minutes before taggie realized what a dreadful mistake it had been to invite her she had put helen in the most charming spare room overlooking the lake and the valley and newly decorated with powderblue walls daffodilyellow curtains and a violetandpink checked counterpane flames danced in the grate and on the bedside table were a flowered tin of shortbread still warm from the oven and christmas roses in a silver vase helen immediately pointed out that taggie was so lucky to be able to afford to redecorate and this was the room shed so often slept in after fearful rows with rupert then when taggie stammeringly offered to move her helen sighed that all penscombe reminded her of how unhappy she had been taggie was also desperately worried about marcus who had driven his mother over and who looked absolutely wretched and was already getting on ruperts nerves why does he keep saying oh right when it plainly isnt unlike helen who drooped about not helping at all marcus despite his asthma exacerbated by ruperts dogs insisted on carrying in endless baskets of logs chopping onions until he cried spending hours peeling potatoes apples and most fiddly of all sweet chestnuts in return taggie had had the ancient yellow toothed piano in the orange drawingroom tuned but every time marcus tried to practise ruperts terriers started howling marcus in turn was also desperately worried about helen im sure shes having a nervous breakdown he confided to taggie she wont stop crying he felt as ineffectual as the flakes of snow that were drifting down and losing themselves in the raindrenched lawn and the gleaming wet paving stones they always say the first christmas is the worst said taggie sympathetically what neither of them realized was that helen was only suicidal because rannaldini hadnt been in touch since prague not a telephone call not even a christmas card she was far too proud to tell anyone that he had dumped her after a one night stand just because she was spending christmas with his enemy christmas day was even more fraught among the guests at penscombe was ruperts father a merry old lothario just liberated from his fifth marriage having opened and drunk all the miniature bottles in his stocking before breakfast he spent the day plastered pinching bottoms and calling taggie and helen by each others names opening presents had also been a nightmare because helen who seemed to have been given so little insisted on watching everyone else open their presents im honestly not interested in material possessions she kept saying quite untruthfully she was in addition appalled that despite marcuss entreaties rupert had not used christmas to slip her a large cheque or announce that in future he would be giving her an allowance tabitha was also acting up dreadully after two and a half years she still carried a torch for lysander who with kitty had been invited to christmas dinner she was insanely jealous that xav and bianca seemed to have been given many more presents than her finally she was enraged because rupert had only given her a new car a dark green golf convertible for christmas when shed wanted a brilliant young eventhorse called the engineer rupert however had desisted because tabitha had ploughed all her gsce exams in the summer and because the asking price of twenty thousand pounds for the horse was too high this omission had triggered off a blazing row which was exacerbated by tabithas refusal to come to matins what have i got to thank god for she shouted he hasnt given me lysander or the engineer and i dont know why youre uptight about my gcses your wifes never passed an exam in her life with that she stormed out banging the door unable to cope with his first wife at any time rupert spent most of christmas day out of the house traditionally the grooms had the day off so he used it as a marvellous excuse to escape with lysander to the yard to do the horses he was in a twitchy mood anyway because there had been a lot of dropped telephone calls since yesterday rupert was only too aware of how beautiful and young his wife was and he suspected dr bensons handsome new partner and kevin the leftie social worker whod overseen xav and biancas adoption of both being in love with her ghastly kevin had even given taggie a rose for christmas which had been planted outside the back door and which rupert kicked every time he passed and now kev had had the temerity to drop in natch at drinks time bringing colombian wooden dolls for xav and bianca he had been invited to stay on for smoked salmon and champagne by taggie desperate to provide helen very frosty from being called taggie and having her bottom pinched by ruperts father with some intelligent conversation helen who was now nose to nose on the sofa talking to kevin about nepalese folk music winced in anticipation of the inevitable upheaval as rupert swept in followed by xavier and his usual pack of dogs seeing ruperts bootfaced expression kevin tried to humour him this little chaps new he said pointing to an adorably floppy black labrador puppy with hooded tobaccobrown eyes and vast paws who was romping with ruperts lurcher nimrod hes mine said xav joining both dogs on the floor daddy gave him to me for christmas hes called bogotá you never stop nagging me to find xav a black friend kevin drawled rupert and now i have i didnt mean began kev his adams apple wobbling furiously of course you didnt said helen in outrage why must you trivialize everything rupert one simply cannot underestimate the importance of ethnic origins why arent you living in america then snapped rupert rupert said taggie appalled which gave rupert the excuse he needed i know when im not wanted he said and gathering up xav stalked out of the house running after him but failing to catch him taggie returned to the drawingroom its so sad helen was saying to kev that rupert hasnt got any easier over the years then turning to taggie said im afraid i cant cope with scenes like that im going to lie down there should have been eleven for dinner five women and six men as well as lysander and kitty taggie had invited lysanders father david hawkley who as a handsome widower and a headmaster would have been perfect for helen but unable to face an english winter he had pushed off to mykenos tabs boyfriend damian whom she tolerated as second best to lysander had taken umbrage after being called a leftie yobbo by rupert once too often and ducked out as well then after a mysterious telephone call this morning ruperts father eddie had asked if he could bring a woman friend which meant they were two women extra predinner drinks were scheduled for seventhirty by seven oclock taggie had reached screaming pitch the geese were sizzling enticingly the christmas pudding bubbling the red cabbage the celery purée the crème de marron were warming gently in the left of the aga and the potatoes cut round and as small as olives only needed frying very fast in clarified butter at the last moment bianca however had been given a maddening christmas present a cordless toy telephone which rang when she pressed a button and which everyone particularly an increasingly jumpy helen kept mistaking for the real thing in addition taggie had been driven crackers all afternoon listening to the chatter of mrs bodkin ruperts ancient housekeeper who was more hindrance than help and refereeing fights beween dogs and children these had culminated in a screaming fit from bianca because a bored nimrod had chewed the feet off kevins colombian doll this had resulted in taggie shouting at bianca and dispatching a disapproving mrs bodkin to take her up to bed and rupert wasnt even here to write out the place names for her it would be so humiliating if she spelt them all wrong in front of helen she couldnt ask marcus as hed gone off to collect flora who to helens irritation he had invited for moral support taggie was panicking she hadnt even changed when there was a knock and a plump smiling face came round the door oh kitty said taggie and burst into tears whatevers the matter kitty dumped brandy butter winter fruit salad apple sauce and mince pies down on the kitchen table everything sobbed taggie tabs in a screaming strop ruperts pushed off to the pub and i dont think hell ever speak to me again for giving annmarie christmas week off and asking helen to stay and shes been just awful she hasnt lifted a finger and cant stop looking at everything and saying new picture new carpet new sofa and its years since she bbbuggered off and rupert and lysander have worked so hard and done so well in the last two years were entitled to have something new kitty patted taggies heaving shoulders shed never seen her friend in such a state im sorry sniffed taggie and ive been vile to poor darling bianca and i havent said hallo to you arthur are you having a nice christmas arthur nodded a blond beaming bruiser just two and a quarter and capable of causing considerable havoc he was clutching a toy trumpet having wriggled out of his blue dufflecoat he was only interested in finding his hero xavier xaviers not back yet darling said taggie hes pushed off with his rotten father go and change said kitty soothingly lysanders gone to the pub to get some drink hell bring rupert back ill take care of everything if you could keep an eye on the goose and feed the dogs and put out a bowl of puppy food for xavs puppy when he gets back you do look nice taggie admired kittys blue wool dress its a bit ot admitted kitty lysander gave it to me im ashamed weve had such a lovely day arfur and i didnt get up till lunchtime and lysander came back to bed after he and rupert had done the orses and youve been slaving away wearily taggie climbed the stairs to biancas bedroom where there was no lack of ethnic reminders the yellow walls were covered with posters of colombian countryside sweeps of orchids giant waterlilies and the lake where el dorados gold was hidden which looked like a green yolk in a jagged grey eggshell of rock bianca was never angry for long now wearing new red pyjamas covered in reindeer her dark curls tied on top of her head to keep them dry in the bath she was bending over a dolls pram putting her new footless doll to bed no you tut up rosie she was saying sternly ive been working my ass off all day for you giving a gasp of horrified laughter taggie gathered up bianca and covered her with kisses oh my angel im sorry i swore at you i love you so much with her pale coffeecoloured skin flushed from the bath her big black eyes and her loving smile bianca was the most beautiful child in the world and had the sweetest nature although spoilt rotten by everyone mummy tired mummy crying said bianca then reaching over she pressed her new telephone hallo she said im afraid rupert cant take your call at the moment taggie giggled god knows what hes up to she took biancas hand come and talk to me while i get ready but going into her bedroom taggie gave another utterly uncharacteristic howl of rage half her wardrobe had been pulled off its hangers and dropped on the floor or on top of nimrod who was stretched out on the bed he now raised a purple seethrough shirt with his waving tail taggies tights drawer had been ransacked and the only sheer black pair filched the pale pink camisole top rupert had given her for christmas had vanished as well as her new pale amethyst satin blazer charging into the bathroom she found her makeup box upended and shampoo eyedrops hair dryer and god knows what else missing tabitha she screamed up the stairs how fucking dare you anything the matter helen appeared out of the bedroom opposite just your bloody daughter taggie wanted to shout but clenching her fists she managed to control herself sorry i was yelling at one of the dogs there was a pause helen was wearing long black velvet with a scooped neckline showing off jutting collar bones deciding to look tragic rather than stunning she had left off her jewellery except malises regimental brooch what a lovely dress said taggie dutifully its hanging off me quavered helen ive lost over a stone since malise died shutting the door firmly behind her she went on and i dont have enough shoes to let ruperts damn dogs eat them i suppose hes not back no he was always disappearing like this when i was married to him going towards the stairs she jumped as the telephone rang hallo piped up bianca is that tabiffa how fucking fucking dare you taggie had no time to do more than wash tie back her lank hair and put on a peacockblue dress covered with red poppies which rupert loathed but which was the only uncreased thing in her wardrobe have a drink she said going into the drawingroom oh champagne sighed helen i wish i could afford it at home she was obviously bored with kitty who encased in her blue wool was getting pinker by the minute how could rannaldini have married and been upset by the departure of such a frump wondered helen everyone except helen was cheered up by the arrival of flora who was wearing a grey silk shirt tucked into black velvet knickerbockers her red hair tied back with a black bow had all the shine and bounce that helens had lost she was also weighed down with presents a body shop basket for helen beethoven sonatas played by his hero pablo gonzales for marcus a tape called lets ride to music for rupert i thought your father would at least know the galloping major and a long clinging silvergrey silk jersey cardigan for taggie oh bliss cried taggie overjoyed marcus said your eyes were silvergrey ill put it on straightaway marcus darling can you open another bottle isnt this room gorgeous flora looked round then seeing helen looking broody and sensing her despair flora delved into her carrier bag i forgot boris sent you this mrs gordon how very dear of boris it was dear said flora cost most of boriss last advance from the bbc and its the first present hes ever wrapped up i cannot cope with this chello tape he kept saying open it mum urged marcus but helen had put it on a sidetable wheres grandpapa asked marcus gone to collect his mystery guest giggled kitty its like whats my line is she in show business does she provide a service thats probably them said helen as the dogs barked but soon the barks turned to wimpers of excitement as lysander weaved in beautiful in a dinnerjacket and already drunk having kissed kitty in delight hugged flora who was an old friend clapped an arm round marcuss shoulder and shaken helens hand he proceeded to tell them what a wonderful time he and rupert had had in the pub and how much xav had won on the fruit machine lysander was a beautiful rider and his sympathy with horses had contributed hugely to ruperts successful transition to the flat marcus says youve done brilliantly flora told him i did brilliantly at christmas giggled lysander look what arthur gave me raising a leg to show off luminous father christmas socks he nearly fell over how could kitty have left rannaldini for such a silly boy thought helen in amazement lysander nearly fell over again when taggie walked in wearing her new silver cardigan like penscombe streams in the winter sunshine it glittered so radiantly on her long slim body that noone noticed her lank hair or her laddered tights a second later she was followed by xav storming in on a new motorized tractor followed by bogotá and nimrod fighting noisily over a chewstik shoe xav had a glossy puddingbasin haircut these days his eyes were speculative arrogant and almost straight he had been so happy since he moved to penscombe that he had acquired all the confidence of a young rajah wheres your father asked taggie through gritted teeth changing said xavier hes changed rupert sauntered in doing up his cufflinks and headed straight for taggie who ducked her head when he tried to kiss her youre an absolute shite she hissed i am a shite in wining armour it is not funny there are masses of bottles to open and noones done the seating plan good i can sit next to you you are so beautiful and you are so drunk and late rupert tried to pull himself together go and open the red wine he ordered marcus and get some logs we havent met he nodded at flora then seeing kitty now scarlet in her blue dress said evening mrs hawkley youre well rugged up kitty was terrified of rupert and he in turn didnt see the point of her at all but she kept lysander on the rails and got him up in the morning even if she did look like boiled bacon did you bring me a present xav asked flora i certainly did but youve got to share it with arthur and bianca said flora handing him a large box of chocolate willies which triggered off screams of laughter and excitement only helen looked disapproving typical flora what with his exwife and his castoff she was reminded of rannaldini at every turn and now tabitha had stalked in ravishing in taggies pink camisole top and amethyst blazer a purple mini round her groin clean blond hair flopping over her angry blue eyes and flawless skin lovely jacket murmured flora enviously thats taggies snapped rupert so tabitha glared at her father i lent it to her mumbled taggie oh why was she so wet unable to face a showdown she fled to the kitchen where marcus was opening bottles of château latour and had lit all the candles in the diningroom you are an angel sighed taggie at least the little potatoes were a perfect golden brown as she topped them with chopped parsley the smell of truffleflavoured goose was too much for the dogs who formed a slavering crescent round taggie as she edged them out of the oven youre so lucky to be able to escape to the kitchen it was helens shrill voice again you shouldnt be humping logs marcus hi mrs bodkin helen embraced her old housekeeper surely youre not working on christmas day we used to get village girls in in the old days you are definitely going to get this boiling fat in your face in a minute vowed taggie it was twentypast eight everything would be ruined if eddie didnt show up soon cant wait to see my fathers latest bimbo rupert refilled everyones glasses then over more barking a deep voice cried cooee everyone were here oh no flora looked at marcus in horror timeo danaos et prima donna ferentes sighed marcus the next moment eddie wearing a dinnerjacket green with age and leering like old steptoe walked in with hermione who was wrapped in a cranberryred wool cloak with an erminelined hood looking as deeply silly as she did stunning so caring of you to include me in your festivities she said advancing on a flabbergasted rupert with outstretched hands i didnt know you knew my father eddie and i are old friends said hermione with a roguish twinkle other dear friends begged me to sing at their christmas eve soirée it was so late when i got to bed and the christmas day flights are so hopeless eddie persuaded me to fly out tomorrow where are you going asked rupert to rannaldinis where else my partner bobby and little cosmo are already out there rannaldinis taken a bohemian castle for the festive season he likes to have all his children and exwives around him not all said lysander putting an arm round kitty oh there you are kitty hermione ignored lysander whats happened to my merry widow contract sliding out of her red cloak and a redandwhite hermes scarf she handed them to eddie put them in the hall dear and bring in my gifts she was looking wonderful in boned red velvet with a bell skirt which showed off her comparatively small waist and pretty legs a huge ruby pendant glowed above her big breasts i cannot believe this thought helen in mounting hysteria rannaldinis exwife his castoff and now his mistress having handed round cds of her latest hit santa of the universe hermione was now embracing taggie before presenting her with a box of last years crystallized fruits and the salmonpink gladioli wrinkled in their cellophane which shed been presented with the night before barely acknowledging flora whom she detested she turned joyfully on helen how are you how are you we met many moons ago with rannaldini at bagley hall how is he whispered helen oh full of beans he was telling me your late husband hermione bowed her dark head im so sorry we wont discuss it wrote a wonderful book on the flute i want you to have an advance copy of only for lovers helen looked down at the cd case which showed a smirking rannaldini with his hands on hermiones bare shoulders thank you she mumbled then leapt as the telephone rang rannaldini must have got the number from hermione but rupert had already picked it up cun i speak to tubitha he said acidly cant you ever find a boyfriend who speaks the queens english snatching up the telephone tabitha flounced out helen was looking round at the turner of cotchester cathedral against a rain dark sky at the landseer of mastiffs and the stubbs of two chestnut mares under an oak tree thats new she said nodding beadily at the lucian freud of a whippet and a rather muscular nude it reminded me of nimrod rupert smiled down at his lurcher who was striped black and brown like a bulls eye having romped all day with his new friend bogotá nimrod was stretched out on the sofa fawn belly speckled with mud paws in the air chewstik shoe in his mouth gazing adoringly up at his master out of one shiny onyx eye what used to hang in its place asked helen perplexed the ingres i sold it how could you said helen appalled i hate big dark lardlike women said rupert glaring at hermione who bored with charming eddie came bounding towards him rupert was her real prey what happened to that colombian lad you were thinking of adopting hes here said rupert beckoning xav getting no reaction from the boys impassive watchful face hermione cooed may i have one of your chocolates as she helped herself putting her red lips over the knob lysander got such giggles he had to hide behind the curtain i bet you dont know what my name is hermione smiled winningly yes i do said xav bet you dont yes i do its mrs fat bum ruperts fathers brought a bumbo murmured flora as a shaking lysander disappeared again dinner announced taggie all taggies efforts to make the diningroom look pretty had paid off the pale scarlet walls and ivygreen curtains were echoed by a centrepiece of snowdrops holly and christmas roses the only lighting reflected in glass and silver came from the flickering fire fifty white candles and the picture lights over the family portraits that was me said eddie nodding at a handsome youth in uniform oh what a relief helens voice quavered youve changed nothing here except wives said rupert thatll teach her to be nicer to taggie he thought as helen brimmed and bit her lip rupert on the other hand had taken a shine to flora and as there was no seating plan put her on his left with hermione as the lesser of three evils on his right and helen between her and eddie who was on taggies right marcus tabitha lysander and kitty could sort themselves out its perfect he called out to taggie as he cut into the goose dropping the first slice into nimrods waiting jaws thats far too much for me whimpered helen as he handed her the first plate ill have it said hermione piling on most of the little brown potatoes having filled up glasses and handed round the vegetables marcus found himself sitting next to kitty she might have a face like boiled bacon but she was so adorable and having worked for rannaldini had lots of gossip about soloists conductors and helpful agents she refused red wine when he tried to fill up her glass because she was having another baby lysanders coming to the antenatal classes she said proudly i love rolling around on the floor with a lot of women yelled a jubilant lysander down the table that goose was something else sighed flora finally putting her knife and fork together have some more said taggie yes please said eddie tabitha didnt even bother to toy with a piece of goose as she read dick francis under the table please give me lysander she prayed please let rannaldini call prayed her mother i think we ought to drink to the cook said eddie with his mouth full to helen he said draining his glass everyone except helen howled with laughter i love you mouthed rupert down the table at taggie i think we ought to drink to absent friends hermione smiled round bobby and cosmo abby said flora and marcus and malise said helen with a sob of course said rupert malise after everyone drained their glasses there was an embarrassed pause and i think we ought to drink to absent fiends said flora as rupert filled her glass again to rannaldini seventeen the flickering bright blue halo had retreated like a genie into the christmas pudding chateau dyquem gleamed topaz in the wine glasses gertrude taggies little mongrel bristled in a green paper admirals hat on her mistresss lap xav who never seemed to go to bed was sprawled on his fathers knee tunelessly singing cars in the bright sky look down where he lay because it made rupert laugh why doesnt my father love me a millionth as much as that thought marcus wistfully he was so frantic to practise he was beginning to twitch like a junkie all the pieces hed been learning seemed to be sliding away across the table his mother looked shellshocked i cannot believe you are fortyfour hermione was telling her i hope ill be as lovely as you when i reach your age which is in about two minutes said flora crossly why dont you take an evening class urged hermione there are courses for antique restoration archery ballroom dancing you might find a new chap there theyve even got a class for understanding teenagers my father would profit from that said tabitha acidly glancing up from dick francis wheres grandpa she asked marcus ringing my grandmugger said xav i didnt ask you smart ass snapped tabitha its true rupert came to xaviers defence he proposes to her every christmas bored with counselling hermione looked sourly at xav still on ruperts knee which was exactly where hermione would like to have been rupert had always had a strong head but he had drunk so much during the day and xavs eyes were so much improved that it was debatable as to which of them was now squinting the most very caring to take on a coloured lad observed hermione piss orf drawled xav in exactly the same bored voice as rupert lysander got the giggles again why dont you run along to bed suggested hermione you could play my cradle song tape or mummy could read to you mummy cant read said xav ill be reading to her soon high time you went to boardingschool young man said hermione irritably are you going to harrow eventually said rupert forking up christmas pudding at great speed this is miraculous tag i suppose king faisal went there mused hermione but i do feel singlesex boarding schools encourage homosexuality not nearly so much as women like you said rupert coldly hermione burst into merry laughter you are a tease then turning to marcus she asked pointedly did you go to harrow no he went to bagley hall said taggie quickly seeing marcus go scarlet as a dayboy because of his asthma have you got a girl friend persisted hermione hes got me piped up flora noticing how helen winced hermione also shot flora a notmuchcop glance and mistakenly thinking she would endear herself to rupert by being good with a miserably squirming marcus asked how long have you had asthma all my life i think they say its inherited hermione was determined to keep ruperts attention must have skipped a generation then said rupert as eddie returned to the table and pretended to admire hermiones ruby pendant in order to gaze down her front marcus gets his heavy breathing from my father god ruperts a bitch thought flora and to distract everyone held her cracker out to xav this and subsequent bangs sent all the dogs including gertrude racing out of the room xav slid off ruperts knee in pursuit of his puppy feeling terribly sorry for marcus kitty who was wearing a paper crown redder than her face asked him if hed had some nice presents marvellous dad and taggie gave me some lightweight tails one gets so hot in concerts now youve got to get some work to try them out said rupert hasnt he told you cried flora hes too flaming modest hes got a recital in cotchester town hall on february youve all got to come marcus smiled deprecatingly at the excited faces but his moment of glory was shortlived talking of special occasions im going on desert island discs on saturday at seventhirty announced hermione my agent howie denston said that at least sue lawley and i have lovely legs in common i hope youll all tune in better alert the monkeys to evacuate the island muttered rupert looking up from the tangerine she was peeling taggie hastily asked what records hermione had chosen all my own so fascinating to compare the different accompanists and conductors rather exciting the programme coincides with a special new year announcement she beamed at rupert do tell us asked taggie my lips are sealed but im dying to see the inside of buckingham palace she added roguishly have you ever wanted a knighthood rupert no lady thatcher offered him one twice said taggie quickly because i have it on good authority that rannaldini is going to get his k in the new years honours list sir roberto said flora flatly that should increase his pulling power he can have oneknight stands said lysander unable to take the roars of drunken laughter helen fled the room outside she ignored nimrod and bogotá who were engaged in a furiously growling tugofwar over hermiones hermes scarf going in search of helen five minutes later taggie found her washing up in the kitchen rubbergloved hands whisking round the hot suds glasses upside down on a teatowel poor mrs bodkin looks so tired i thought id give her a hand the reproach was implicit its lovely and cool in here i always find goose a bit rich im sorry mumbled taggie ill take people upstairs and then we can have coffee im being a bitch thought helen miserably but i cant help it taggies got everything youth looks children ruperts love and the beautiful house and garden which was once mine although lysander beamed drunkenly across the table at him marcus had never felt more de trop than when left pretending to drink port with the men who talked nonstop about horses tomorrow lysander and rupert would hunt until two then the helicopter would take them and eddie to kempton in time for penscombe prides big race at threethirty hell walk it said lysander marcus took another surreptitious squirt from his inhaler the steroids hed been taking to combat his allergy to dogs and new paint had given him a wretched sore throat should be a good crowd out tomorrow said eddie always liked the boxing day meet mind you huntings gone to the dogs since so many people who do their own horses come out fortunately for marcus flora put on lets ride to music and the galloping major thundering through the house soon flushed out the men boom boom boom went the regimental drums as screaming with drunken laughter eddie and flora cheek to cheek clasped hands outstretched trotted up the hall to dyou ken john peel followed by lysander and kitty and rupert and taggie then broke into a canter to bonny dundee with a pack of dogs barking excitedly behind them right wheel halt dismount shouted rupert as the band swung into aida which had been his and eddies old regimental march unfortunately hermione returning from a respray upstairs couldnt resist singing very loudly along so everyone gave up marching and allowed her to put on santa of the universe jumping out of their skins as hark the herald angels filled the house what with my first wife continually hitting the roof and hermione taking it off im not going to have a slate over my head soon grumbled rupert flora rupert marcus kitty and tabitha whod actually put down dick francis were playing consequences taggie who was too slow at writing to play was handing out liqueurs lysander an even slower writer was playing chess with eddie who was telling him about ruperts mother played chess together during the first dark days of the war when noone knew if hitler was going to strike wonderful woman turned me down again this evening know well end up together hermione meanwhile had rather startled rupert by sinking to the floor at his feet her dark head in danger of being singed by his cigar hed go off piste down her cleavage in a minute where are we he asked womans name said flora putting down his cigar rupert wrote hermione handing his turnedover piece of paper to tabitha he touched her hand the rows over the engineer had upset him very much hed probably buy her the damn horse in the end eddie and lysander were so drunk they couldnt remember whose move it was think i should marry her eddie nodded in hermiones direction god no lysander turned pale shes awful damn fine looking damn rich sort out my lloyds lorses not worth it anyway shes got a husband must be loopy to leave a beautiful woman like that at christmas hes gay whaddja mean queer good god eddies teeth nearly fell out lysander giggled dont let her get her santa claws into you ha ha ha ha santa claws thats good eddie choked on his third glass of port good king wenceslarse looked out sang hermione on cd and in real life i cannot stand it thought helen who was perched on the arm of marcuss chair ive seen king wensceslas statue on the charles bridge she wanted to shout and he wasnt good at all and the stupid story about st agnes fountain and the pine logs is garbage but none of these drunken philistines would be remotely interested unless she told them she had been on the bridge with rannaldini sensing her anguish marcus reached back to retrieve boriss present please open it mum its really nice do have a drink pleaded taggie helen shook her head violently sending tears flying out of her eyes the group round the fire had finished the first round of their consequences you start tabitha said flora tabitha unrolled her piece of paper penscombe pride she began in her flat little voice then starting to smile met hermione on top of the muck heap pridie said give us a blow job hermione said to pridie i am about to have my period pridie gave her the clap hermione gave him a great kick up the ass and the consequence was tabitha burst out laughing tabitha protested taggie thats enough why must you spoil everything tabitha turned on her stepmother like a viper about to send her to bed rupert heard a clipclop on the flagstones and cheers and shouts of laughter greeted a grinning xav riding into the drawingroom on tiny lysanders delinquent shetland pony xav had got tinys measure completely and punched her on the nose if she ever tried to bite him but he couldnt stop her lashing out at hermione sending the discomfited diva scrambling like a camel to her feet having vented her spleen tiny proceeded to hoover up the straw from helens body shop basket until she encountered a pearl bath drop and curled up her lip quick get a camera rupert told marcus but tabitha had flipped you never let me ride ponies into the house she screamed that child is spoilt rotten he got far more presents than marcus and i put together its bloody unfair you love him far more than you do us bloody bloody unfair beamed bianca appearing in the doorway with her telephone hallo im afraid tabiffas in the bath and shes revoltingly spoilt too yelled tab i was never allowed down at this hour and storming out she slammed the door shaking every piece of china helen burst into tears why is everyone always fighting in this house she sobbed why cant you all be nice to each other you could start off by controlling your daughter thought flora mouthing dont worry at marcus they should bring back national service particularly for women said eddie checkmate appalled that xav and bianca could have caused such a terrible row taggie leapt forward to comfort helen who was now wailing i cant go on i cant go on oh malise take that pony back to the stable at once xav ordered rupert in the bleak midwinter sang hermione on the cd as mrs bodkin put her head round the door telephone for mrs gordon talk about the ungay gordon grumbled flora as helen shot out of the room sending boriss present flying and thats five hundred pounds down the drain poor boris shes a frightful drip she added rupert agreed god i hope you marry marcus looking into her eyes which were the light emerald of the winter barley rampaging over his fields he picked up the sadness and remembered the gossip still hung up on rannaldini i guess so he recurs like malaria you could do better and i have to say that when i was at bagley hall you were voted the man to whom we most wanted to lose our virginity rupert smiled if i wasnt bespoke he jerked his head towards taggie who was anxiously pouring a glass of armagnac for hermione i couldnt think of anything nicer you will go to marcuss concert wont you pleaded flora but rupert had been distracted by the return of helen suddenly looking radiant tears dried like raindrops in a heatwave bewildered by her mood swings marcus sloped off to check with mrs bodkin who had telephoned he wouldnt give his name but it was a foreignsounding gentleman marcus so hoped it was boris who had been screwing up courage to ask helen out but when she finally opened his present the beautiful porcelain nightingale had shattered into a hundred pieces alone in the kitchen taggie cried and cried an exhausted marcus had finally got helen to bed arthur woken by the din had been taken home by lysander and kitty who had annexed flora as well tab wasnt in her room and had probably taken refuge with the grooms over the stables eddie had passed out on the sofa leaving his teeth in one of hermiones crystallized greengages taggie had put a duvet over him hermiones limo had borne her away to an early flight in the morning the dogs had collapsed on their bean bags the dishwasher swished and swirled round the last consignment of rare glasses and coffee cups helen would have been appalled that taggie hadnt washed them by hand only rupert and gertrude the mongrel who had taken umbrage over the new puppy and the crackers and escaped through the cat door were missing nimrod the lurcher brought out a rubber cutlet he had been given for christmas and squeaked it to make taggie laugh but she went on crying so he slunk back to his basket ive lost my dog my husband and the present list noone will know what anyones given anybody sobbed taggie she jumped at the crash of the cat door there was a scampering of claws and in charged gertrude wearing ruperts black tie and hurled herself on taggie she was followed by rupert squinting worse than ever a blond lock of hair had fallen over his forehead an empty brandy bottle swung between his fingers gertrude and i have been hiding we dont want mrs fat bum as a stepmother shes gone sobbed taggie angel whats the matter i wanted to show i was a better wife than helen oh darling rupert folded her in his arms im sorry ive been such a shit but i cant stand my first wife and i loathe hermione and marcus gets on my tits and tabithas impossible and all i want to do is screw you stupid im stupid anyway said taggie but she stopped crying i was such a wreck when i met you mumbled rupert helen just reminds me how vile i was youve taught me to love he kissed her wedding ring finger youve twisted me straight ive got a present for you rootling in his pocket he produced a silver locket inside were daisy francelynch miniatures of xav and bianca taggie nearly started crying again oh how lovely i wish there was room inside for you as well oh thank you i want a night inside your shining armour said rupert fumbling with the pearl buttons of her silver cardigan im probably past it but lets go and try only if you promise to come to marcuss concert said taggie unable to sleep marcus heard the two of them come to bed softly laughing outside the clouds had rolled away leaving a pale grey sky so crowded with stars the constellations were indistinguishable he had just made the agonizing decision that he couldnt go back to the academy next term either tab would return to bagley hall in a fortnight he couldnt leave helen alone in the old rectory in this state eighteen dame edith spink composer conductor and musical director of venturer television and the cotchester chamber orchestra had been responsible for marcuss recital in cotchester built like thomas the tank engine she had leant on cotchester musical society of which she was president boys extremely talented she boomed glaring at the wilting committee through her monocle and incredibly cheap for one hundred pounds this was a considerable plus because the musical society never had any money marcus had already learnt chopins grande polonaise the bees wedding and beethovens appassionata sonata for the concert hed cancelled because of malises death so he decided to play them again the appassionata was fiendishly difficult but it would be a compliment to abby who had dominated his thoughts throughout the long winter in warwickshire and who had promised to bring rodney over from lucerne for the concert he would kick off with two scarlatti sonatas and then as a compliment to boris end the second half with his titanic siberian suite this had dismayed his piano teacher miss chatterton known at college as chatterbox when marcus visited her in her leafy north london suburb the day before the concert levitsky isnt remotely audiencefriendly chatterbox absorbed modern jargon then flogged it to death the provinces hate contemporary music particularly if they cant pronounce it youll have them leaving in droves at least end with the chopin so theyve got something to look forward to the programmes already printed sighed marcus anyway i cant let boris down hes so low boriss thumping great crush on his mother showed no signs of abating even though helen wasnt responding at all she had hardly thanked boris for the porcelain nightingale and claiming she was too busy with marcuss recital to see him had thrown herself into the role of supportive mother with a vengeance the lovely golden walled cathedral town of cotchester had been a royalist stronghold in the civil war after an appalling journey with wind and rain nearly sweeping him off the motorway marcus arrived around teatime at the town hall a splendid baroque edifice two hundred yards down the high street from venturer television his hopes of a peaceful couple of hours rehearsing were shattered by helen who was standing on the steps pointing in horror at his poster and brandishing a programme how could you bill yourself just as marcus black i dont want to cash in on dads name its the only thing hes given you except a lot of dosh protested marcus getting his dark suit and his music case out of the aston and why did you send them that awful photograph moaned helen your hair was longer than his was she pointed disapprovingly at charles is statue in the centre of the market square he was lucky only getting his head cut off ruefully marcus stroked his own short back and sides looks much better said helen who because rupert was expected had nagged him all week to have a haircut marcus glared at his reflection in the dark mirror in the foyer everyonell see my ears going bright red with nerves i hope you washed them muum they dont have opera glasses at recitals picking up the programme he gave a shout of laughter for above his name it said in large letters an explosive new talent dame edith spunk but helen was in no mood for jokes last night the cotswold hunt who seemed to epitomize ruperts disreputable past had hired the hall for their annual hunt ball apart from a disgusting stench of drink and cigarettes they had left three broken windows letting in a vicious east wind a lot of sick in the ladies a pair of red knickers and some suspiciouslooking stains on the sofa bed in marcuss dressingroom even worse there were drink rings cigarette burns spilt bourbon and candlewax all over the keys of a grand piano on which marcus was expected to play marcus was delighted his hands sweated dreadfully before a concert and it would be far easier to grip the keys particularly the black notes of which there were thousands in the f minor appassionata if the piano were sticky and dirty alas helen then explained virtuously that she had already set to with a flurry of meths and righteous indignation the keys were now so clean they would slip away from his fingers like minnows soloists have been known to sandpaper down the ivories of concert grands to get a better grip rubenstein had even sprayed the keys with hair lacquer but there was no way marcus could find lacquer on a late sunday afternoon just managing not to snap at helen he was cheered by the number of cards and presents in his dressingroom particularly when he found abby had sent him a beautiful greenleatherbound copy of the tempest postmarked lucerne inside she had written this music crept by me upon the waters allaying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air good luck marcus warmest lappassionata marcus trembled with excitement as he smelt the faint trace of her scent on the pages next he opened a silver shamrock from declan ohara and a bottle of moët from floras mother both thanking him for the invitation to the recital but regretting they would be away what invitation marcus felt a wave of anger helen had obviously been at work again there were other good luck cards from famous friends of his parents he hadnt seen since he was a child as he hung up his suit in the cupboard he found a pale gold silk dress with an yves saint laurent label which he hadnt seen before outside he could hear helen saying were expecting sir rodney macintosh declan ohara dame edith boris levitsky and georgie maguire and loads of students and teachers from the academy marcuss father is flying back specially from the yearling sales in florida and oh i forgot abby rosens coming yes the violinist my son has a bit of a reputation as a ladys man rushing into the passage before helen became even more cringemaking marcus found her talking to an old biddy in a long grey overcoat who had the face of a rather overexcited dromedary and a drifting white bun like an icepack on top of her head helen introduced her as miss smallwood the social secretary our artist bleated miss smallwood eagerly are you like your father well perhaps not she sounded slightly disappointed i was wondering if you could give a little talk to our members before the concert aaabsolutely nnnot stammered marcus and mum georgie and declan cant make it all he wanted to do was to get at the piano slippery keys and all he found the sound hard and bright in the treble but after having lydia pinker and american pie bashed out on it all last night it was very woolly in the bass he would have to pound the keys to make the lefthand lines in the appassionata clear enough nor unlike the cotswold hunt could the musical society afford to heat the hall which was getting colder by the minute marcus couldnt play if he were cold he couldnt play now helen stationing herself bossily round the hall to test the accoustics kept snapping his concentration i cant hear you from here youre very faint from here then up in the gallery where she found a white bra with tabithas nametape inside you really must project more from here hed reached screaming pitch when the piano tuner rolled up and proceeded to bang out chopins grande polonaise far better than he had so marcus retreated to the upright in his dressingroom to run through certain tricky passages only to be interrupted by helen again venturer television bbc cotchester the times and classical music all wanted to interview him wasnt it exciting as he wasnt prepared to give a little talk shed arranged a press conference with sandwiches and glasses of wine marcus was aghast i cant mum for christs sake theyre only here because of dad i have to go into myself before a concert and be completely alone with the music uhuh helen shook her head playfully youre not going to have a moment to feel nervous you mean youre not risking a rerun of the cockup at malises funeral thought marcus were jolly well going to show rupert this time said helen marcus started to shake and wheeze and took a couple of puffs from his inhaler hed already used it too much in the last fortyeight hours his throat was very sore he had the beginnings of a rash round his mouth out of the window in the dusk he could see the great shadow of the cathedral like a warning finger and the wind pleating the flooded water meadows and lashing the trailing twigs of the weeping willows almost horizontal marcus managed to smile at the press but he could hardly remember his date of birth only when they asked him which pianists he most admired he had no difficulty in saying emil gilels myra hess and solomon and among the living pablo gonzales as he suspected the press were only interested in him in relation to rupert but was trying to master that big black brute of a piano all that different to getting the best out of a difficult horse he wondered as a child marcuss worst nightmare had been going into restaurants or to airports with rupert who so instantly and effortlessly attracted the limelight it was ironic that he had chosen a profession entirely dependent on limelight but it was the only way he could express himself and more recently the only way he could tell abby what he felt about her but it was not to be as the press were trailing out abby telephoned im so sorry marcus but rodneys been hospitalized with bronchitis i guess it isnt serious but i darent leave him i know youll be great and see you very soon as marcus put down the telephone almost weeping with disappointment miss smallwood handed him some drooping crimson flowers hellebores from dame hermiones own garden she said reverently her gardener brought them all the way from paradise dame hermione wishes you all the luck in the world but darent risk a cold in this weather such a caring person by seven oclock the hall was filling up with members of the musical society variations on miss smallwood in flat shoes long coats with triangles of brightly coloured scarves around their necks all huddling together for warmth any hell fires fanned by the cotswold hunt ball had receded long ago two more telephone apologies came from ruperts friend basil baddingham and the bishop of cotchester who both claimed to be laid low by the same bug as a note of bathos the hunt saboteurs had got the night wrong and rolled up to wave placards saying cotswold butchers and dont victimize our vixens and generally hassle the hunt ball learning rupert whod hunted with the cotswold all his life was expected later they decided to hang around as marcus changed into his dark suit and had fearful difficulty putting cufflinks into his greyandwhite striped shirt he noticed the coloured windows of cotchester cathedral lit up for evensong he should be the one on his knees praying for his hubris in thinking he could play the appassionata and the siberian suite even the chopin was so clear and linear it gave you nowhere to hide and the lefthand part was just as challenging as the right having showered and washed her hair helen had changed into the gold silk dress and wanted approval you look stunning mum you really think so and it goes with these shoes perfect said marcus dutifully i guess i had to have something new its your first professional date she has no idea thought marcus in despair as he put on a crocusyellow tie bought for him by flora to jazz up his whole outfit isnt that rather loud began helen there was a rattattat on the door fifteen minutes mr black cried miss smallwood and lady baddinghams just arrived she added excitedly but shes afraid dame edith has been struck down by the same dreaded lurgy as our bishop marcus fought an hysterical desire to laugh monica baddingham basils sisterinlaw had caused an uproar last year when she had walked out on her vicious venal husband of nearly twentyfive years standing and moved in with dame edith such was monicas popularity in the area she had worked endlessly for charity and been kind to everyone and she seemed so blissfully happy with dame edith that the scandal had blown over helen would normally have disapproved violently of such bohemian escapades but realizing how influential monica had suddenly become in the music world she scuttled out to say hallo she was less amused by the arrival of a very jocund company from the academy who congaed in led by flora in order to drink on the way down they had hired a minibus and had now stationed themselves on the left side of the hall so marcuss ravishing female fan club could drool over him while he played boris also on the bus was in a frightful state of nerves his hair looked even more electrocuted than usual he wore a grey track suit the loose trousers of which kept falling down his chunky body and his suede feet seemed to curl round each other like bear claws i dont want siberian suite to be hackled he was longing to sit next to helen who meanly introduced him to marcuss teacher miss chatterton so they could be nervous together do tell marcus miss chatterton begged helen that the audience will only enjoy it if marcus smiles and enjoys it too not many people thought flora in disappointment it was crucial to have bums on seats because anyone who contemplated booking marcus in future would check with cotchester musical society whether he pulled the crowds oh thank god here was taggie looking ravishing as always in a dark red suit and rather tentatively leading bianca by the hand they were followed by kitty mrs bodkin all ruperts grooms and estate workers and finally tabitha who might have been very jealous of marcus if she had not received seventeen valentines and been danced off her feet at the hunt ball the sight of bianca enchanting in a tartan smocked wool dress with a white collar and dark green tights gave helen a legitimate excuse to express her jealousy of taggie with a burst of anger is that wise its a long programme taggie flushed bianca adores marcus shed have been heartbroken if id left her behind if she starts acting up ill take her out i promise hallo monica taggie turned in delight to embrace lady baddingham for whose dinner parties she had often cooked before she was married isnt this exciting ediths been so wonderful to arrange all this for marcus ediths hopping mad not to be able to make it said monica a bigboned handsome woman whose red veins clashed merrily with her emeraldgreen coat is this one of your smalls she beamed down at bianca isnt she adorable you cant start them off at concerts too early helen could have screamed wheres rupert she snapped he should be here taggie looked at her watch i hope the fog isnt bad about a hundred and twenty said miss smallwood counting heads not bad for a beastly february evening its nearly halfpast we ought to start marcus was hunched over the table in his dressingroom panic about an impending asthma attack making him even more breathless he couldnt let everyone down again his reflection glittered silver with sweat in the mirror then helen had burst in in a rage absolutely typical your bloody fathers helicopters been grounded by fog he and lysander rang from the m they wont make it before the interval if at all so were going to start a great calm swept over marcus at least rupert wouldnt be bored witless or sneer at the low turnout quickly he washed the sweat off his face and straightened his tie nerves overwhelmed him again as he fell up the steps to the platform and sidled towards the piano hangdog as the last person picked in a team please smile marcus begged miss chatterton will you nudge me when im meant to clap taggie whispered to monica baddingham with a brief shy nod to acknowledge the rattle of applause marcus sat down fiddled with the height of the pianostool gave his fingers a last wipe hairs too short muttered a member of his fan club i like it more butch said another hes utterly gorgeous any way sighed a third on her right flora noticed an old man in a beret getting out a score for a second marcus sat clasping his hands to stop them shaking then one seemed to escape like a white dove above the keys then it fell in a skirl of bright notes a weightless shimmer of sound and the scarlatti was away forgetting the cold members of the cotchester musical society smiled in relief the estate workers and the grooms looked at each other in amazement was this their sweet diffident marcus at the end of the scarlatti marcus got a splendid round of applause augmented by the whooping cheering and stamping feet of his friends from college good boy marcus piped up bianca when there was a pause which set everyone laughing and clapping again as marcus came on to play the appassionata he was smiling the bass was still woolly but suddenly the sound blossomed producing such thrilling contrasts of loud and soft of tender and so fierce that the big black piano shook on its legs how could such unleashed forces be contained in such a slender youthful body wondered the audience marvelling too at every angelic ripple of sound as marcus captured not only the nobility but also plumbed the extraordinary depths and dramas of the piece part of the intense pleasure for marcuss friends was to see the almost unearthly happiness on his face flora clutched herself in ecstasy and looking round noticed a tear like an icicle glittering on the wrinkled cheek of the old man in the beret the middle movement was so beautiful as theme and variations chased each other round the keyboard that the tears sprung in marcuss eyes too but as he lingered over the runs and pauses which bridge the second and last movement he told himself that he must keep something in reserve for the fireworks of the finale allegro non troppo beethoven had warned he had known the dangers that awaited the unwary pianist the temptation to show off and run out of puff marcus was usually nervous as the end approached like the last looming fence in the showjumping ring this evening he was utterly confident but as he tensed himself to leap into the fray there was a kerfuffle at the back of the hall you cant go in now cried miss smallwood i can do what i fucking like drawled an alltoofamilar voice weve come all the way from america to hear this bloody concert and rupert stalked up the aisle trailing a redfaced lysander daddy crowed bianca rupert proceeded to kiss an enraged taggie climb over her to his seat and shove lysander into the one beyond next to kitty last time rupert had been to a concert was at the end of term at bagley hall when the auditorium had been packed to bursting because it was compulsory for all four hundred and fifty pupils their parents and eighty teachers to attend a hundred odd people huddled in the stalls many of them dingily old and plain didnt seem a very satisfactory turnout not many people here he muttered to taggie shut up she hissed tut up daddy reproached bianca glancing up rupert saw marcus huddled over the piano staring at him in terror a baby hare caught in the headlights carry on marcus he said sharply then turning to taggie demanded why didnt you bring xav and whats she doing out of school he glared at tabitha now engrossed in a new dick francis from then on it was nightmare the endless swirling semiquavers of the last movement escaped in all directions like ants under a jet of boiling water marcuss fingers seemed drunk had changed shape icy cold and sweating they scrabbled and missed helens clean keys then ruperts mobile rang and lysander whod been at the brandy on the way down couldnt stop laughing and loudly said oouch when kitty kicked him on the ankle distracted marcus played a repeat for the third time wrong notes clattering down like hailstones surreptitously rupert opened a catalogue to check the prices his yearlings had reached forgetting himself lysander suddenly said that was a bloody good horse tut up lysander said bianca reprovingly aware of his fathers utter boredom marcus lost his place and ground to a halt there was a dreadful silence marcus put his face in his hands take your time called out monica baddingham kindly somehow marcus stumbled through the prestissimo and fled to his dressingroom bolting backstage flora found him slumped white and shaking on the sofa bed his breath coming in great wheezing gasps i cant go back not with dad there it was wonderful you were playing better than ever before you cant let that bastard get to you youve got to remount and finish the course anyone for orange squash or coffee miss smallwood popped her white bun round the door marcus clenched his fists he needs something stronger flora drew a halfempty brandy bottle out of her pocket he cant have alcohol said a horrified helen who was dripping around like a wet hen flora looked round for a tooth mug hes got to relax thisll zap the asthma much quicker the cotchester musical society didnt have a licence so rupert who couldnt understand why taggie was so cross when hed bust a gut to get there swept lysander off to the bar sinister basil baddinghams dive in the high street most of marcuss fan club followed them in wonder by the time they returned marcus had dispatched the chopin adequately and was now playing the bees wedding rupert proceeded to get out his blue silk handkerchief and pretend to be trying to catch the bumble bee which reduced lysander to even more helpless laughter stop it hissed taggie over the applause at the end if bianca can behave herself you two bloody well can at the prospect of boriss siberian suite many of the audience including four girls whod come in off the street mistakenly hoping it might be warmer inside hadnt bothered to return from the pub cheered by another slug of brandy ignoring the bewilderment of the audience marcus kicked off playing the suite quite beautifully boris was in ecstasy delighted that in sympathy the rain was rattling the windowpanes that werent broken and the icy gale whistling through the ones that were was billowing out of the dark blue curtains at the back of the platform rupert was reduced to shuffling his feet sighing and reading taggies programme his face quite expressionless as he clocked the marcus black twitched slightly when he spotted the dame edith spunk dame spunk has put up a black in more senses than one he thought sourly after this fiasco there was no way the society would ever ask marcus back and what the hell was venturer doing advertising in the programme the musical society were exactly the kind of old trouts who were always complaining about sex and violence and television going to the dogs the penultimate movement allegro furioso in which marcus had to drag his nails up the strings inside the piano to emulate the shrieks of the siberian gales dispatched more musical society members into the night even if television was going to the dogs it was preferable to this din which you couldnt even nod off to crash crash deliberately bringing down rows of notes at a time marcuss whole arm was now moving up the piano im bored can we go rupert whispered to a seething taggie lucky things he sighed enviously as two more bids scuttled out boris was in despair soon there would be noone left to hackle his music seeing his father asleep marcus lost his place and stopped and too embarrassed to bow he fled to his dressingroom fortunately the remaining audience thinking he had finished and blissful it was over clapped cheered and stamped their feet to get marcus and their circulation back so he returned to take a couple of bows monica baddingham whose ringing voice was used to calling to labradors across open spaces then shouted bravo several times and announced that the composer was in the audience so everyone clapped boris too dreading helens reproaches marcus was relieved to pass her on the pay telephone on his way back to his dressingroom with trembling hands he put his encore piece schumanns dreaming back in his case with the other music and wondered miserably if hed ever have the guts to play in public again the poor professional however must always smile after a concert so people may be fooled into thinking it wasnt too bad his friends crowding in accepting glasses of white were kind because they loved him how was the piano asked flora terrible what was wrong with it too many wrong notes and his friends giggled in relief that he didnt seem too cast down you were dazzling until your bloody father arrived grumbled flora abbyll be livid she missed it you were terrific tagggie hugged him were all dying of pride bianca loved it good boy marcus said bianca as he gathered her up into his arms hallo darling you were good sorry about the ghastly cockups he added to taggie taggie was too loyal to say she was sorry about rupert who had been sidetracked talking to monica baddingham an old chum whom he hadnt seen since she had shacked up with dame edith he was amazed how good she looked and even more so when she insisted marcus had played very well ive got to whizz home and tuck edith up with a hot toddy but ill drop him a line have you got his address hes living with helen thats most of the trouble how much would he have made this evening oh about a hundred pounds plus expenses and hes been practising for this concert for months thought rupert darkly he was overwhelmed by the greyness of the whole occasion wandering backstage he was enraged to find himself at the back of a queue of more old biddies who wanted their programmes signed particularly when one not realizing he was no longer her mp gave him an earful about the poor dustbin delivery in the area he was so fed up that he took it out on marcus when he finally reached him at least you got round this time monicasjust told me how much they paid you i think you should consider another career something more lucrative like nursing marcuss friends on the way out laughed in embarrassment rupert reproached taggie seeing the brave smile slipping on marcuss face hes only joking she whispered then relieving marcus of a sleeping bianca added defiantly everyone else thought you were marvellous as they all drifted away marcus could see helen was off the telephone and steeled himself to face her bitter disappointment to his amazement she was very chipper ive just been talking to the evening standard they want to run a big story tomorrow marcus had very regretfully refused to go out on the toot with the bus load from the academy because hed promised to have dinner with his mother now she suddenly cried off janey lloydfoxe is having er marriage problems i promised id pop in and see her so you go out with your friends but as marcus ran outside he saw the minibus lurching off down the middle of the high street the musical society were pointedly turning off lights and locking doors wearily marcus returned to his dressingroom he ought to change his shirt was still ringing wet his neck was stiff his arms and elbows were sore his back ached as he slumped in the lone chair close to tears next month he would be twentyone and going nowhere he was roused by a knock on the door and an old man staggered in on crutches long white hair trailed out from under his black beret and he was wearing a black belted mac and dark glasses i am not too late oh christ thought marcus of course not he leapt to his feet would you like a chair please and a glass of wine please but when marcus poured it the old man put the glass shakily on a nearby table and took both marcuss pale strong beautifullyshaped hands in his own which were covered in liver spots and as bent and as arthritic as oak twigs the contrast could not have been more marked for a second the old man gazed at them then to marcuss horror he dropped a kiss on each palm letting them drop he took a sip of wine those are the hands of a great pianist whom one day the world will know really stammered marcus perhaps the old poofter was harmless after all really i ave never ear appassionata play like that so beautiful so eentense i had a memory lapse stupid jargon you stop so eef one takes reesks one makes meestakes you work ard on piece no marcus nodded you will always have to eef you have no originality it is easy to reach perfection the levitsky piece is beautiful too but next time put the chopin at the end so the audience stay because they have some bonbons to look forward to my piano teacher said the same i dont take pupils any more went on the old man but eef you feel like a week in spain i have lovely house you would be very welcome i would be appy to geeve you lessons in what wondered marcus he never knew what to do when men made advances the old ones in particular were much harder to turn down it seemed so rude he was also sure hed seen this man before youre seriously kind he mumbled but my stepfather died and basically i have to look after my mother she will recover the old man creaked to his feet then holding his sticks with one hand he got a card out of his pocket dont forget the invitation is always there but i may not be much longer thank you marcus pocketed the card then to his intense embarrassment the old man raised a hand and started stroking his cheek you have beautiful face which help in our profession marcus just managed not to leap away in horror thank god there was a knock on the door he never thought hed be so pleased to see miss smallwood who was anxious to pay him and get off home she even gave him a fiver for petrol about enough to get the aston round the statue of charles i and back only when hed thanked her and signed the receipt and was letting himself out of a sidedoor did he bother to glance at the card he gave a gasp and rushed under a streetlight it couldnt be it couldnt it was too the card said pablo gonzales with a whoop of joy marcus swung twice round the streetlight then fighting for breath tore up a sidestreet to see if he could catch the old man his hero his utter god but like the minibus the huge bentley had swept off down the high street towards london the only media reference the next day was that as rupert had been leaving his son marcuss concert he and lysander hawkley the man who made husbands jealous now married to kitty rannaldini etc had got into a fight with the hunt saboteurs nineteen taggie was of such a forgiving nature that rupert was amazed the following morning when she still only snapped back in monosyllables and crashed his bacon and eggs down in front of him at breakfast what is the matter you should have switched off your mobile not when someone was trying to tell me my best three year olds been kicked shes as lame as a cat this morning thats more important than some tinpot concert not to marcus it wasnt tut up daddy beamed bianca and you can belt up you cheeky monkey rupert turned on her stop being horrible to all your children you great bully shouted taggie and rupert stalked out kicking kevins rose even harder on the way rupert was as skilled as stalin at sustaining cold war but it was such a beautiful day and the robins and blackbirds were singing yellow celandine and coltsfoot exploded on the verges and after yesterdays downpour all the little streams hurtling into his lake had set it glittering like a tiara on the brow of the valley best of all the vet had reassured rupert his filly would be fit for the one thousand guineas returning from lunching with an owner remembering that kitty was taking xav bianca and arthur to a childrens party rupert felt suddenly springlike and decided to slope home early a great orange sun was filling his rear mirror and warming the lichened trunks of his chestnut avenue as he roared up the drive ringing taggie to tell her he would check things were all right in the yard and then be in and she was to get upstairs and out of all her clothes was met with an extremely icy response taggie then hung up storming into the kitchen rupert found his wife still fully dressed her face pink and shiny as she took the skin off a justboiled ham why are you still sulking i am not sulking im angry the only thing i really hate hate hate about you is the way youre so vile to marcus it was a good concert the people who know about music gave him a standing ovation all five of them they were just relieved such a bloody awful din was over youre beeeeestly screamed taggie see pigs jolly well can fly grabbing the ham she hurled it at rupert who ducked so it crashed into the dresser behind him breaking two coronation mugs and smashing the glass on a framed photograph of gertrude the mongrel who led the stampede of dogs from the room rupert couldnt stop laughing which made taggie crosser than ever get out of my life she shrieked having cleared up chuntering like a squirrel the while washed the ham and sprinkled the fat with breadcrumbs taggie had cooled down and went in search of rupert she had been turning out the attic and nearly filled up a skip with the contents by the time she had searched the house the huge gold sun had deepened to scarlet and was flaming the puddles in the yard then she saw rupert on top of the skip he was sitting on an ancient sofa whose springs had gone sharing a packet of crisps with nimrod the lurcher and reading horse and hound as taggie burst out laughing rupert leapt down pulling her into his arms nuzzling at her neck lets go to bed not until you promise to be nicer to marcus thats blackmail i mean it and we ought to give a twentyfirst birthday party for him next month and then he can invite all his ghastly bearded musical friends oh all right you can see how badly i want to go to bed with you and youll be nice at the party i promise and if you dont come upstairs ill take you here and now in front of all the lads rupert started to pull taggies jersey over her head so she scuttled protesting inside marcus however quashed the idea helen he said was still in mourning and not up to a party privately after the horrors of christmas and his début concert he couldnt face a family gettogether rupert was relieved he didnt have to cough up but again pestered by taggie gave marcus a beautiful munnings of one of eddies old steeplechasers pylon peggoty whod won a lot of races rupert had been trying to track the painting down for years marcus wasnt wild about horses they gave him asthma but he was deeply touched knowing rupert would have given anything to keep the painting flora who was broke but always incredibly generous had gone busking for three days and bought marcus pablo gonzales recording of all chopins piano music marcus listened till he was crosseared abby sent him a crate of champagne and said they were all missing him in london while she was in lucerne with rodney shed discovered a fantastic nineteenthcentury composer called winifred trapp whod written among other things a wonderful piano concerto perhaps youll play it if i can get a record company interested helen was delighted marcus got so many presents it made her feel less guilty about standing him up again on the night of his birthday marcus didnt mind on the strength of the cheques hed been given he had just bought a secondhand steinway on the nevernever and was dying to try it out it had arrived late that afternoon after helen had gone out and big black and shiny was now dominating the charming porcelaincrammed drawingroom at the old rectory like a bull trying to be good in a china shop marcus hoped helen wouldnt be too upset by the intrusion shed been so strange lately ringing up and pleading he came home for supper sobbing that she couldnt stand another evening on her own then he would find a brief note when he arrived saying that shed had to go out after all leaving him nothing for supper having heated up a tin of tomato soup and noticed some surprisingly sexy underwear gold satin french knickers with a matching bra and suspender belt clinging to the side of the tumble dryer when he put in his shirts marcus settled down to the bach preludes the steinway was magical unlike the brute at cotchester where every note had been like lifting a ton of coal he so wished malise was still alive helen pretended to be interested in music but he and malise had really been able to dissect pieces together and malises detached kindly criticism had been such a help and a comfort marcus hoped he was ok in heaven he had been such a courteous man but strangely shy underneath perhaps he was playing duets up there with boriss wife rachel miss chatterbox used to tell marcus that he must practise as though he was performing even if it were only for the cat tonight to make up a little for letting him down at the funeral marcus played for malise about midnight he started to worry outside he could hear the foxes barking the central heating had gone off so he put a hotwater bottle in helens bed and turned on her bedside light she was only saying yesterday how she dreaded sleeping in a big empty bed reaching out in the night to find malise wasnt there to his relief he heard the front door bang he had never seen his mother look so beautiful she was wearing a dress of crushed tobaccobrown velvet which caressed her wonderfully slender figure and brought out the redgold highlights of her sleek bobbed hair which seemed to gleam with health for the first time in months she wore no lipstick so her slender oval face was dominated by her huge hazel eyes marcus didnt recognize the necklace of amethysts which ringed her throat as softly flattering as violets nor the long dark fur coat slung around her shoulders nor the flat but beautifully cut dark brown shoes which set off her perfect ankles helen had arched insteps and always preferred high heels she was so spaced out she didnt even notice the new piano as she hugged marcus she reeked of a musky feral scent she had never worn before why was he so instantly and disturbingly transported back to that endofterm concert at bagley hall then helen who drank very little amazed him by suggesting they open a bottle of malises ancient sancerre for your birthday she said tenderly i cant believe its twentyone years since i first held you in my arms youve brought me so much joy but as soon as hed fetched the bottle which was covered in cobwebs and in no need of being chilled from the cellar and poured it out helen raised her glass and said she must share her great happiness with him oh markie im going to marry rannaldini in chelsea register office tomorrow you what then it all came spilling out the weekend in prague the cancelled evenings her almost suicidal misery at christmas and all because rannaldini had backed off not sure if he was capable of making a commitment marcus was utterly aghast mrs edwards had dropped some heavy hints that a foreign gentleman had been calling but marcus assumed it was boris boris would be heartbroken and of course that explained the kissedoff lipstick the new fur coat the amethysts and the flat shoes so she wouldnt be taller than rannaldini her other great love jake lovell had been small she even smelt of rannaldini the same disturbing scent that he had wafted round the hall years ago when he had arrived so late for the school concert in despair marcus begged his mother not to go ahead with the wedding malise has only been dead five months mum rannaldinis a monster you dont know him actually hes worse than a monster hes a coldblooded sadist who wiped out rachel and flora and made kittys life a nightmare you havent heard his side said helen who was in a pontificating mood to justify the white heat of extreme sexual passion and the joyous expectation of becoming megarich again rannaldini she explained was so caring he was going to put on a concert to raise thousands for her branch of the nspcc which would attract maximum attention now that he had been awarded his knighthood hes specially composed an elegy for sad children its so beautiful and hell buy you your steinway outright and help tabitha in her eventing career i believe in redemption helen smiled mistily rannaldini came into my life and saved me when id reached an alltime low so youve settled for an alltime gigolo lady rannaldini said marcus savagely dont be obnoxious you sound just like your father you were nearly destroyed by dads philandering and look what happened when daddy met the right woman reproved helen though even now she had a slight edge to her voice you never stop telling me how blissfully happy taggies made him at least warn dad its only fair begged marcus no no hell do something horrible to sabotage it i deserve some happiness markie ive been so desolate since malise died if helen hadnt wept and begged marcus would never have gone to the wedding but he could never bear to see his mother cry earlier that same day tabitha had had another blazing row over the telephone with rupert because he still refused to buy her the engineer you shouldnt tangle with inferior regiments rupert had snapped and tabitha had hung up on him late the following afternoon taggie in an attempt to heal the breach had rung bagley hall to find out if tabitha would be coming home for the weekend only to be told that tabithas mother had taken tab out of school for a very special occasion her house mistress had been very mysterious and refused to let on what it was in a rage how the hell was tabitha going to pass any exams if she was always being yanked out of school rupert telephoned helen in warwickshire getting no answer he rang bagley hall and left a furious message that tabitha must ring him the moment she got back tabitha finally telephoned so early the following morning rupert was still asleep where the bloody hell have you been in london at mums wedding since you ask wedding thundered rupert yes at chelsea register office she really looked gorgeous in pale crimson silk like the tailor of gloucester a big dark crimson hat and some gorgeous garnets i thought youd be pleased she wont need to ask you for money any more and youll never guess who shes married who for christs sake rannaldini hes really really nice for once rupert was silenced are you there daddy we all had lunch at the ritz afterwards we said rupert ominously marcus and jake lovell were witnesses gosh hes attractive said tabitha blithely and rannaldinis going to buy marcus a steinway as a joiningthefamily present and guess what hes bought me the engineer so nice to have a father who loves me again and jake lovells going to train him mums going to adore being lady rannaldini rupert went ballistic particularly when he saw the exclusive in the telegraph one of the bonuses of marrying the most beautiful woman in the world rannaldini was quoted as saying is that i acquire two beautiful step children marcus and tabitha as a musician and an owner i intend to help and guide them in their chosen careers malise was a brilliant horseman a flautist and a wonderful stepfather i hope they wont feel his loss too much any more they have both been delightfully welcoming as well as a picture of the happy couple there were also photographs of rannaldini smiling at tabitha with his arm possessively round her shoulders and worst of all of marcus beside jake the telephone rang rupert dived on it how about your ex marrying rannaldini said the scorpion kitty read out the telegraph piece to lysander wowee game and first set to rannaldini he said in horror hell break her shivered kitty helen had been dreadfully patronizing to her at christmas but she couldnt wish such a fate on anyone kitty jumped as the telephone rang it was rupert had she got rannaldinis telephone number in london he was so appalled and enraged at the thought of rannaldini getting his filthy hands on tabitha that he rang up at once helen and rannaldini were still in bed later to fly to milan where rannaldini was conducting don carlos at the scala poor marcus picked up the telephone why the fuck didnt you stop it i tttried stammered marcus like hell and why the fuck didnt you warn me have you considered what that paedophile might do to tab your mothers a whore she might as well have married the devil marcus lost his temper she did that the first time round noone could have made her more miserable than you did shes a parasite howled rupert shes always been greedy never bothered to earn a penny in her life now shes sold out to the highest bidder and youll never make it either youre a parasite too dont expect to get another penny out of me go and sponge off rannaldini i dont want your bloody money yelled marcus ill get there on my own and he slammed down the telephone he was struggling for breath desperately delving in his pocket for his inhaler when rannaldini came smirking out of the bedroom he was wearing the blueandgreen paisley dressinggown which marcus and tabitha had clubbed together to give malise for his seventyfifth birthday a month before he died whats the matter dearest boy crooned rannaldini hes the erlking thought marcus in terror you bastard he gasped how dare you tell the papers ive been welcoming you know i was dead against the wedding and only came to it because of mum if you hurt a hair of her head ill kill you i dont want any of your bloody money or your steinway either somehow he got himself to floras digs without collapsing and then had to cope with flora for once dropping her guard and sobbing wildly that there was no hope of her getting rannaldini back any more rupert was so incensed he proceeded to cancel both marcuss and tabs allowances and write them out of his will its tabitha rannaldinis after wept flora thats whats driving rupert crazy the only thing that cheered flora up was the new dame hermiones fury over the marriage talk about caterwauling for her demon lover helen oblivious of the devastation she had created returned from her weekend in milan more in love than ever and reprimanded marcus for being horrid roberto so longs for everyone to be friends as rannaldini already had five houses she also felt magnanimously that she should put the old rectory on the market because it had such unhappy associations for her and hand half the proceeds over to malises daughter its such a good time to sell in the spring when the tulips the apple blossom and the crown imperials are all out the final straw for marcus came when he wanted to listen to myra hess playing the appassionata on monday evening and discovered helen in a flurry of tidying had chucked out all malises old s marcus was on to her at rannaldinis london flat in a trice how could you theyre irreplaceable dont be silly theyre all on cd now rannaldinis getting them for you as a surprise i want the s malise left them to me darling be reasonable they were only cluttering up the place like me shouted marcus slamming down the telephone outside the window white daffodils lit up the garden and the dark yew hedges a little unkempt now which malise had planted to divide it did malises ghost astride his old hunter jump them in the moonlight would the new owners cut them down marcus who had lived here since he was four years old was now not only penniless but soon to be homeless he was surveying the wreckage of his life when the telephone rang he couldnt cope with a reproachful helen but it was abby jibbering with excitement ive got my first gig conducting the rutminster symphony orchestra rodney and howie squared it for me only one problem right ive gotta learn the repertoire in a fortnight will you help me there was a pause you dont sound very excited for me marcus mums just married rannaldini i read it not the ideal stepfather im really sorry but think of the doors hell open for you and at least itll get your mom off your back and you can come back to the academy its poor flora whos been blown out of the water god im scared about this gig appassionata second movement twenty abby was as driven as a conductor as she had been as a violinist sweeping into the old rectory she hardly noticed how ill marcus was looking it was ironic that one of the pieces he had to help her learn was ein heldenleben a heros life richard strausss tone poem which included a portrait of pauline strausss capricious demanding wife abby was a lot like pauline thought marcus she interrupted him for help whether he was practising or just firing off hundreds of letters to orchestra managers concert halls and music clubs in a desperate attempt to get work she had also commandeered marcuss cd player and would drag him out of bed in the middle of the night to listen to some rival violinist as she sobbed im better than that arent i this would have been the ideal moment for marcus to have made a move but he was haunted by his failure with ruperts hooker so each time he bottled out lying for hours afterwards twitching with desire he was also heartbroken that he couldnt afford to stay on at the academy when rannaldini and helen returned from their extended honeymoon he would have to move into a tiny room in ealing he could pay the rent and keep up the instalments on the steinway on which fourteenthousand pounds was still owing only if he took half a dozen pupils a day by the time hed paid off his college debts the bank had started bouncing cheques he had torn up all his credit cards the only card in his pocket was pablo gonzaless but meeting him now seemed like a dream marcus didnt have the bottle to write to him his asthma was awful he couldnt walk twenty yards without stopping to rest if abby was exhausting she was also expensive seeing such a large beautiful house and this was only marcuss mothers place flora had already told her about the glories of penscombe abby assumed marcus was just another trustfund baby and marcus was too proud to tell her otherwise as she had lived with rodney now she would live with marcus she was not grasping her records had left her very well provided for just thoughtless having worked for twelve hours sustained only by granny smiths and black coffee she would emerge at dinner time im exhausted and absolutely starved if dinner wasnt ready she would insist they took her scores out to the nearest restaurant where having wolfed down a couple of baskets of bread she often found she wasnt hungry when the two courses shed ordered arrived and marcus being his fathers son picked up the bill back at the old rectory her mess spread from room to room and had to be hurriedly tidied away by marcus each time a buyer arrived to look at the house as the concert approached abby grew more histrionic dickering over what to wear on the night i gotta look dignified and dropdead gorgeous and having screaming matches with howie denston her agent the new lady rannaldini thought marcus would go bananas when she saw the telephone bill but that was sir robertos problem mrs edwards was in her element lady rannaldinis residence she would announce as journalists started ringing up so they simply assumed abby was rannaldinis protégée to keep the tabloids at bay howie installed bouncers as a result the more enterprising reporters disguised themselves as prospective buyers the man from the telegraph got so into the part he even put in a bid for the old rectory and was furious to be gazumped later in the week by a girl from the independent marcus took two days off to hold abbys hand for a start he drove her down to rutminster how far is it malise and i always reckoned it was beethovens ninth to rutminster and the creation to cotchester it would have been far quicker in the aston said abby petulantly as a lastditch measure to appease the bank manager marcus the day before had sold his beloved aston and bought a thirdhand mustardyellow maestro which abby didnt feel had sufficient gravitas she was not even amused by jokes about taking the maestro down in the maestro the next two days were going to be lean on laughs thought marcus with a sigh still it was a beautiful day with primroses fizzing along the bright green verges like sherbert and the cottage gardens still full of daffodils after a steep climb marcus stopped the car get your head out of richard strauss for a sec and look at that abby gasped with joy for down below in a bowl of wooded hills softened by opalblue mist rising from the same river fleet that flowed through cotchester lay the ancient town of rutminster there was the racecourse where ruperts horses battled with rannaldinis to win the famous rutminster cup there was the cathedral its spire soaring into the air like a litter prong trying to catch the tiny paperwhite clouds hurtling across the the bright blue sky along the river bank weeping willows rinsed their blond hair in the glittering aquamarine water theres the herbert parker hall where the gig is said marcus pointing out a hulking victorian monstrosity standing in its own park to the west of the town how awesome sighed abby oblivious of the hideous proportions and the oxblood walls which clashed vilely with the faded russet of the rest of the high street who was herbert parker she asked oh some nineteenthcentury haberdasher who made his pile and then built one his descendants own parker and parker the department store in the high street that queen anne house overlooking the river to the east of the town is the old bell hotel where youre staying what you cant see is the secret passage from hp hall as its known to the shaven crown in the high street youll be sent flying during the break by stampeding musicians goodness theyve got portaloos they must be expecting huge crowds dropping into the valley they entered thick woods through the first faint blur of hawthorn and larch gleamed a lake reminding abby of lucerne and the ghost horn player then she jumped at the sight of her own photograph smouldering down from a large oak tree from then on there were lappassionata posters everywhere oh marcus her voice quivered i feel as if im coming home even though the concert wasnt until the following night rutminster swarmed with press megagram abbys record producers were reissuing all her old records and had spent a lot of money promoting the concert the tickets could have been sold five times over big screens had been put up in the park so disappointed punters could watch from outside for a tenner double cherries lining the path up to hp hall were still in bud we thought of forcing them out with a blowlamp in your honour said mark carling the extremely harassed managing director of the rutminster symphony orchestra who came rushing out to shake abbys hand he had thinning mousy hair and tired redrimmed eyes peering furtively through granny spectacles which seemed too small for his big worried face desperately shy he found the social side of running an orchestra a torment im in the middle of a rather sticky conversation with the arts council who tend to call the shots i hope youll forgive me if my secretary miss priddock shows you round miss priddocks very much the power behind the throne he said scuttling off in relief miss priddock had once been pretty and for a brief period sir rodneys plump monobosomed and given to pussycat bows she looked as though she pulled on her bluerinsed hair like a tea cosy each morning she lived in the close with john drummond a large selfimportant black cat with a white shirtfront which made him look as if he were wearing tails drummond who accompanied miss priddock to work and doubled up as office mouser was known as the purr behind the throne seeing the imperceptible toss of abbys head that she was being abandoned to a secretary miss priddock mentally branded abby a madam and said they had never had a concert like this before poor mr carling was run off his feet hes lucky to have you said marcus sensing ruffled feathers you must be seriously busy i deal with everything said miss priddock ushering them into a palatial foyer whose peeling burntsienna walls were almost entirely hidden by lappassionata publicity material light bulbs blocked toilets computers breaking down she went on they run to me im also clare rayner to the entire orchestra if theyre homesick got marital problems cant pay their mortgage or the gas bill they end up in my office i cant do much but im a good listener and a conceited old bag thought abby as led by john drummond his black tail erect miss priddock swept them along the inevitable labyrinths where under naked light bulbs groups of musicians pretended not to stare this is the band room added miss priddock where the musicians relax and this is the hospitality room where we entertain sponsors and friends of the orchestra and this is the instrument room flinging open the door miss priddock surprised a couple in flagrante abby caught a quick glimpse of a girl spreadeagled naked on the glockenspiel her long silverblond hair trailing like a river fleet willow beside her stood an equally blond man with wicked slitty dark eyes and broad bare shoulders tapering to a narrow waist unbuttoning his jeans with one hand he had the other rammed between the girls legs miss priddock didnt turn a bluerinsed hair buck up viking she said briskly rehearsal begins in ten minutes and almost dotingly closed the door who was that asked abby flabbergasted viking oneill first horn and juno meadows second flute dont musicians get fired for that kind of behaviour not viking said miss priddock firmly hes got two horrendous horn solos in oberon and ein heldenleben said abby i hope hes up to it vikings up to everything said miss priddock skittishly the platforms through that door with a shiver of excitement abby could see the stage set up with chairs and musicstands and hear the glorious heady din of musicians all practising different passages from the oberon overture and heres your dressingroom its sir rodneys normally but he vacates it for guest conductors on a low marble table abby was touched to find a huge bunch of white hyacinths and narcissi and a note from rodney telling her not to seduce all his orchestra before he saw her tomorrow night the room befitting him had an extremely comfortable double bed only thinly disguised as a sofa by a few embroidered cushions a massive bath a buckling wine rack a store cupboard filled with large glasses tumblers tins of caviar foie gras and artichoke hearts on the walls were photographs of gisela and shosty outside flashers folly of rodneys late wife playing in her nightie and of rodney and the orchestra out in the park under the turning trees on the occasion of his seventyfifth birthday in the wardrobe abby found a set of his tails and breathed in a waft of english fern oh i wish he were here miss priddocks face softened we all do im afraid lionel fielding our leader is away guesting with some northern orchestra she gave a morefoolthem sniff but his coleader the warmth returned to miss priddocks voice a most delightful french canadian hugo de ginèstre will do everything to smooth your path hugo was very smooth as he swept in all fire and flourish brandishing his bow like dartagnan like dartagnan too he had a glossy moustache a neat beard cavalier curls just beginning to recede from a noble forehead and big soulful dark eyes which kept suddenly twinkling with merriment the musketeer image was further accentuated by a dark brown velvet jacket and a floppy white silk shirt tucked into black cords which were in turn tucked into boots kissing abbys hand and then both her cheeks he said how honoured the rso were to welcome such a great musician marcus who was feeling exhausted and spareprickish looked at his watch ill take what you dont need and check in at the old bell he said dont be long i need you suddenly abby looked vulnerable and marcuss heart leapt then fell as she added to help me if i get stuck courage mon enfant said hugo as he led her into the auditorium gripping the brass rail of the rostrum to disguise her shaking hands abby looked down at the rso spread out before her many of them were paunchy most of them pale and drawn after a long winter of late nights long hours teaching playing other dates to make ends meet not seeing the sun and gazing at black dots a handful were brown from skiing some of the girls were young and very pretty the men handsome but on the whole they needed an iron over their faces and their clothes their gleaming instruments gold silver conkerbrown burntumber and black looked in much better shape but together they had the power of a wolfpack they looked at abby curiously but coolly poised to cooperate or gang up then abby smiled its great to be here with you guys today well concentrate on oberon and ein heldenleben by ill luck oberon would start with a solo from the first horn who was now dressed in black jeans and a spoilt bastard tshirt and laughing his head off blushing abby looked up at him and nodded viking sat there his horn to his mouth but not making any sound abby nodded again when youre ready first horn im ready maestro there was another long agonizing pause the orchestra grinned into their instruments i think hes waiting for you to give him the upbeat maestro whispered hugo oh shit i never thought of that abby whipped her stick up and then down and they were on their way she was dying of nerves but expecting one of rodneys bimbos the last one had got lost in the new world the rso were staggered how good she was thanks to marcus she was embedded in the music giving every important cue detecting wrong notes from the babble of sound musicians detest stopping and starting and abby luckily also had the ability to shout out or sing instructions on the wing simon painshaw first oboe had carrotcoloured dreadlocks and screwed up his thin face when he played as though he was drinking vile medicine out of a straw that was fantastic abby called to him after a particularly beautiful solo but three bars after twentynine you should have played a flat blushing beetroot like an unattractive winter salad at the unaccustomed praise simon mumbled that his part said a then yours is a misprint the musicians looked at each other in awe the brass players when they got excited made enough din to strip the rest of the paint off the foyer abby managed to shut them up i gather that the rso brass section are the wonder of the west country she beamed across at them but it would be kinda fun occasionally to hear what the rest of the orchestra can do the brass section shuffled their feet sulkily but they forgave abby when she overheated and whipped off her dark blue jersey mistakenly taking her white tshirt with it to display a pair of stunning breasts hugo was also a joy playing with panache never taking his soulful dark eyes off her clapping his hands to shush any chatter pleased that abby consulted him throughout and the first horn was more than adequate after the ridiculously delayed start abby nearly dropped her baton because he played with a radiance and purity completely at variance with his distinctly louche appearance he was also the most outrageously attractive man abby had ever seen lounging high up at the back of the orchestra his french horn like the sun in his arms matching his streaked gold hair his dark brown eyes seemed permanently narrowed as if he were taking aim before firing one of cupids arrows he had a pale narrow face darkened by stubble a snub nose and his big mocking lips somehow managed to compose themselves round the mouth piece of his instrument this was an eighteenthcentury horn with a pretty painted bell made of gold leaf beaten very thin and giving it enormous range hes the ghost horn player thought abby in wonder you do very well said hugo as he and abby had a cup of tea in the conductors room you gave me so much help said abby and the orchestra sure take their lead from you and i from you said hugo who was having a little bet with himself that it would be under ten seconds there are some very interesting players mused abby six seconds thought hugo particularly first oboe and er first horn a wonderful primitive sound whys he called viking he wore an eyepatch to his audition to hide a black eye given to him by a jealous husband said hugo gratified to have won his bet but disappointed that abby had reacted like all the rest when victor thats his real name first came here he went on he reminded everyone of a viking blowing a conch in a flatbottomed boat before nipping ashore for a spot of rape and pillage does he abby removed her earl grey teabag then added supercasually have a particular partner well hes slept with most of the girls in the orchestra getting up hugo tested rodneys bed he only has to say hallo sweetheart in that peatsoft irish voice to some pretty new cellist next minute shes horizontal in the carpark horn players hugo rearranged the cushions up one end live on the edge first horn and first oboe are the riskiest instruments to play because theyre so heard and so exposed vikings the hero of the orchestra because he stands up to visiting conductors and the management the management on the other hand think the sun shines out of vikings brass rising from the bed hugo prowled round the room because he pulls in the punters if he isnt playing they ask for their money back hugo opened rodneys food cupboard examining tins and jars with rapt gallic interest abby who hadnt had any breakfast dipped a piece of shortbread in her tea how old is he twentyeight same age as me no disrespect to the rso but why hasnt he been snapped up by one of the london orchestras or made a fortune as a soloist vikings lazy and unambitious squatting down hugo whistled over the vintages of the wines in the rack he prefers hellraising with his friends theyre known as the celtic mafia and playing football on sundays there was a mass walkout when the management tried to introduce sunday afternoon concerts anyway why should anyone want to work in london asked hugo have you ever tried carrying a double bass on the tube you can get to work in ten minutes here and park and you have a salary even if its a pathetic one you get a chance to rehearse before a concert and the audiences are loyal i like it when people stop me in rutminster high street and say that was a great concert hugo the countryside is marvellous and the cottages are very cheap you make it sound so attractive said abby wistfully hugo laughed dashing dartagnan again and the pickings are good there are many many single women in the country others have husbands who go to london in the week i dont approve of married men having affaires said abby primly nor do i said hugo im divorced out of the window abby could see extras running up the path to take part in ein heldenleben which required a much bigger orchestra than oberon has viking ever been married she asked hugo shook his head too polite to snap that hed been quizzed so often about viking that he was thinking of making a tape but there is evidence he is taking life more seriously recently he left the ramshackle house on the edge of the blackmere lake which he shares with the celtic mafia and moved in with juno meadows second flute who lives hugos dark eyes gleamed with laughter in a converted squash court does she have long blond hair thats the one ravissante in a dolllike way hugo tested the bed again wondering what abby was doing this evening he had a terrific strikerate with girls disappointed by viking juno he added wickedly is so refined she insists on eating bananas sideways abby burst out laughing and continued hugo despite being a hypochondriac who rings in sick with a dislocated eyelash she is very tough the orchestra call her the steel elf she refused to sleep with viking till he moved in he nearly went mad now shes pushing him to get a better job thats why he was playing at covent garden last night hes already picking up her mortgage but all the orchestra including viking hes a gambling man are having bets as to how long it will last i ave to say i love the bloke and we all forgive him because hes such a marvellous musician hugo looked at his watch we better get back here endeth the first lesson omigod said abby appalled i forgot you had that horrendously difficult violin solo coming up i should have left you in peace probably stopped me worrying said hugo philosophically what a pity thought abby that he was at least three inches shorter than she was the tattered bottlegreen curtains had been pulled back as far as possible to accommodate the increased orchestra viking had four extra freelance horns in his section there were two gold harps soaring like a king and a queen and an exciting array of percussion including a snare drum which made a sinister relentless rattle and cymbals gleaming like ben hurs chariot wheels irritated there were more players on stage the orchestra were involved in their usual grumbles about overcrowding musicstands and chairs in the wrong place lighting and heating tomorrow they would have to cope with television cables and cameras as abby mounted the rostrum she noticed juno meadows vikings girlfriend to the left smugly aware of taking up hardly any room at all feeling disappointed viking was taken why the hell was she lusting after profligate horn players abby was now in a didactic mood ein heldenleben she told the players whod heard it all before means a heros life she was interrupted by the arrival of a very fat very pretty blonde who sent several musicstands flying and waved frantically at viking before plonking herself down beside a furious steel elf who the hell booked fat rosie muttered hugo you only need thin musicians for strauss a heros life went on abby could be described as kinda autobiographical it was written when strauss was only thirtyfour must have been bloody arrogant said viking applying the second horns strawberryflavoured lipsalve to his big mouth just like you said the second horn retrieving it quiet please hugo clapped his hands in this piece continued abby strauss paints a savage picture of the critics who attacked his music they are portrayed by the woodwind scraping squeaking and playing out of tune juno wont have to try sneered the first trumpet who had a cruel redbrick face who said that viking was on his feet dont rise the second horn pulled him back by his spoilt bastard tshirt only joking grinned the first trumpet unrepentantly sorry juno the orchestra particularly the prettier girls who entirely agreed with the first trumpet smirked into their musicstands strauss also portrayed his tempestuous relationship with his wife pauline went on abby who was a coquette and very capricious the first trombone who had a complexion like red rock very blue bloodshot eyes and hair the colour of wet sand rather like a south of france travel poster put down his copy of playboy you mean she was an absolute bitch he said the orchestra giggled abby decided to ignore him as i am sure you all know pauline is portrayed by the leader of the orchestra abby smiled fondly at hugo hope youre going to wear a pretty frock hugo dearie shouted the first trombone and strauss even portrays himself in the closing pages on the french horn abby smiled up at viking who put down auto express and smiled back after a terrific battle concluded abby when the brass and percussion can really play fortissimo the work ends with the hero and his wife reconciling their differences in one of the loveliest tunes ever written with the solo violin singing and sobbing and the solo horn er weaving round her like a great purring panther grrrrrr growled viking show us your tits again shouted the first trombone abby blushed crimson lets get started it was like hanging onto the coattails of a hurricane thought abby as she opened her raised arms and whipped the orchestra to a frenzy in the battlescenes then quietened them for the love duet here she felt hugo although a dashing and technically faultless player lacked passion if only she could have taken his place providing viking with a player up to his weight as she sang along with them she realized how unendurable life would be until she could play again she hadnt done any physio for weeks confronted by genius however abby was always generous passing viking on her way out as he put his horn back in a battered case lined with crushed purple velvet she stammered you were terrific im not just bullshitting its like being a racing driver or a test pilot said viking you just got to believe youll come out the other end hugos right thought abby he does have the sexiest peatsoft voice in the world and he was a good three inches taller than she was twentyone hugo took her to the shaven crown for lunch the record shop in the high street had a display of her cds and a coloured cardboard cutout taken from an old photograph when shed been all wildhaired and smouldering dyou think people will recognize me she asked hugo in alarm of course the explosive element is still there the lovely body the lovely face was her face lovely he wondered the nose was too big the eyelids the bottom lip even the jaw too heavy and yet and yet genuflect to our benefactress he added sourly as they passed a big department store draped in banners saying parker and parker welcomes abigail rosen there were even windows devoted to men in tails and women in spangled evening dresses playing instruments youll meet peggy parker tomorrow night said hugo shes as squat and brick red in the face as the herbert parker hall she loves to patronize the arts patronize being the operative word and shes not very keen on rodney because he remembers her when she was a junior in the underwear department with a tape measure hanging from her neck and he was always nipping in to buy lingerie for his various popsies that was before peggy married the boss shes now on the rso board and a force to be reckoned with because she pumps in a lot of dosh i hope she doesnt force the orchestra into those awful dresses shuddered abby the shaven crown had a thatched roof kept in place by a wire hairnet and pale pink walls inside it was already packed with musicians and full of inglenooks black beams barmaids in medieval dresses and a longsuffering landlord who wore a monks habit when the antics of the rso became too much for him huge orange logs in the fireplace gave the impression of having smouldered for centuries having installed abby in an alcove on a black bench which said leaders chair in gold letters hugo went off to order abby was soon distracted by shouts of laughter edging along the bench peering through a pair of hanging lutes she saw viking surrounded by cronies including his second horn who had bright blue eyes and the first trombone whod acted up during the rehearsal absolutely flagrante viking was saying what happened asked the first trombone draining his pint of beer i had a bit of a day began viking i had lunch with thin rosie went back to her place and did the business came out and on my way to the garden bumped into fat rosie so i went back to her place and catered for her thats why she was looking so cheerful this morning said the second horn glancing up from the independent then i gave my considerable all to tristan and isolde went on viking three hours of it i kept falling asleep jesus i was tired i josst managed to drive home to rutminster fell into bed josst dropped off when i was woken by an imperious tap on the shoulder her indoors saying havent you forgotten something then over the howls of laughter added thats why i had to reaccommodate her on the glockenspiel this morning and in barges priddock john drommond and lappassionata as hugo crossed the bar with his bottle of red wine viking leant round to see who he was lunching with and seeing abby without any embarrassment raised his glass to her all the girls behind the bar want your autograph said hugo and bernie the landlord wants a photograph taken with you she still loves the recognition he thought as he filled up their glasses i shouldnt drink yes you should to celebrate and eat two steakandkidney pies are on the way thats the nucleus of the celtic mafia the wild men of the orchestra said hugo after another roar of laughter from vikings table thats blue donovan reading the independent the quiet one a seriously good guy and usually broke because he sends so much money back to his family in deny always falling asleep because he plays most nights in a jazz club very attractive mused abby very blue covers for viking musically and in real life beneath the sangfroid vikings pretty neurotic first horn has to have iron in his soul oh wow this looks great cried abby as a steakandkidney pie with gold pastry billowing out of the little dish a baked potato and broccoli were put in front of her im starved can we have some mustard debbie called out hugo french or english asked the pretty barmaid abby smiled sideways under her lashes at hugo i always prefer french feeling encouraged hugo continued his run down on the celtic mafia sitting next to blue is the first trombone dixie douglas a brawny fearless glaswegian dixie comes from northern brass band stock lips of steel his light duties as a trombone player give him rather too much time to booze letch and mischiefmake you want to watch him abby hes trouble he already has been said abby this is so good i shouldnt eat the pastry but im gonna finally the man with a moustache who looks like a sandyhaired clark gable is randy hamilton third trumpet another fearless hellraiser from a barrackroom background randys energies when not boozing and womanizing are spent improving his golf handicap and loathing the first trumpet charles jones nicknamed carmine jones because he goes bright red during solos carmine you may have noticed had a go at juno this morning just to wind up viking because he hates the celtic mafia and hes been trying to get juno into bed ever since she joined the orchestra and hes livid viking got in there first he always moves in on any pretty girl that comes on trial if you sleep with me darling ill put in a good word along with my dick hes a very very nasty piece of work both randy and dixie are married with wives living in scotland whom they go back to sometimes at weekends otherwise they live in a house on the lake known as the bordello with blue and until recently viking thats about it really thank you hugo said abby earnestly halfwatching a pretty waitress carrying a tray of shepherds pie across to the celtic mafia its crucial for conductors to learn as much as possible about their musicians yeah yeah smiling slightly hugo undid an oblong pat of butter and dropped it on his potato when did you leave canada asked abby hugo started to tell her but immediately lost abby because a large black collie had jumped onto the bench seat between viking and blue had a red paper napkin tucked into his collar and started wolfing his own dish of shepherds pie plumey tail wagging as he carefully ate round the cooler edges first whos that asked abby in amazement mr nugent goddamn silly name the fur on the top of his head was too heavy and kept falling into a middle parting which together with a slightly unctuous manner gives him the appearance of a victorian grocer hence mr nugent vikings had him since he was a pup filling up an oblivious abbys glass hugo edged his corduroy thigh within a millimetre of hers nugent often sleeps in vikings car which adds to the general stench and mess he also rounds up the celtic mafia after hours and always gets first place for the horn section in the tea queue during the break abby didnt even feel hugos thigh against hers because viking had strolled over to the bar to buy another round she noticed his leather jacket was cut short to emphasize a high jutting bottom and long muscular legs hes in good shape she turned to hugo does he work out only how to get his next lay thats how he gets his exercise mr nugent crawled across the floor to reach his masters heels surely dogs arent allowed in here exclaimed abby theyre not but when bernie banned nugent the entire celtic mafia defected to the old bell and the bartakings halved so nugent was allowed back again the bottom line is that juno cant stand dogs thats whats going to cause a rift between her and viking talk of the devil he added as juno walked in she was wearing a fluffy pale pink track suit her blond hair was tied back with a pale pink ribbon her face was delicately flushed like a wild rose to match she couldnt have been prettier having kissed viking on the mouth refused a drink and asked if there was any room for a little one she plonked herself between blue and viking what have you been up to said dixie snidely aerobing or jogging yogaing or yoghurting or aromatheraping like the rest of the celtic mafia dixie was torn between jealousy of viking for having pulled her and jealousy of juno for annexing viking ive been to the gym said juno and i went to see my bank manager he gave me a glass of sherry mine gives me bounced cheques said randy gloomily and i bought our tea someone has to although juno had a squeaky little voice like a mouse orchestra her blueygreen eyes were as cold as distilled fiord water nice track suit said blue the peacemaker i got it from the childrens department of parker and parker and i got us two chops said juno looking disapprovingly at the refilled pints of beer dixie ruffled nugents black fur good thing the old boy stocked up on that shepherds pie dogs only need one meal a day snapped juno we ought to go back i need to pick up a grapefruit and some cottage cheese wow you are going to have a blowout mocked randy vikings eating habits are shocking juno pursed her pretty lips then her eyes widened as marcus rushed through the door even deathly pale black under the eyes and wheezing frantically he was beautiful abby darling he panted im desperately sorry i crashed out on my hotel bed for five minutes next thing i knew it was a quarter to two are you ok dont i look it said abby warmly its been wonderful having someone to discuss the finer points of repertoire and what have i been fucking doing for the last two weeks thought marcus feeling she had been a little harsh abby added to hugo marcus is a marvellous pianist we could use you in the tchaikovsky tomorrow night grumbled hugo whos playing said marcus some crumpet of rodneys called anthea hislop known as hisloppy shes so slapdash hugo grinned at abby with two of you on the same night the orchestra was going to paste ban the bimbo posters all over hp hall then seeing abbys expression of outrage hurriedly added but youre no bimbo sweetheart she did great today he told marcus i want to find some truly revolutionary way to do the tchaikovsky said abby earnestly get the horns to come in in tune at the beginning instead of splattwothree suggested hugo and you could try to make hisloppy play occasionally at the same tempo as the orchestra twentytwo the runup to the concert was distinctly fraught anthea hislop turned out to be as curvacious as she was catastrophic as a pianist this resulted in several spats with abby which enlivened the rehearsal but put abby into the deepest gloom as an thea was one of shepherd denstons most successful artists howie denston insisted on motoring down from london to take her abby marcus and mike carling the rso managing director out to dinner marcus thought that after rannaldini howie was the most dreadful man he had ever met allegedly the most cutthroat agent in london he was short and plump with a white oily face little black eyes black hair which fell in a kisscurl over his low forehead and very long arms from lugging potted plants to ingratiate himself with large lady artistes he plainly didnt give a stuff about music and like his father was only turned on by the deal howies only redeeming feature during a very sticky evening when abby and anthea completely ignored each other was that when he wasnt jabbering into his mobile he was talking incessantly about himself which at least kept the conversation going i have absolutely no private life i exist only for my clients my mobile is never switched off he clearly thought it was a huge concession to travel out of london and seemed to expect wild boars covered in woad to ramraid the restaurant at any second mark carling who hardly ate anything left after the main course to look after a wife who had shingles seeing the bill was imminent howie jumped thankfully into a hovering limousine and steamed back to london for a breakfast meeting with his most illustrious client hermione harefield howie owned a fivebedroomed house on the canal at maida vale and earned at least four hundred thousand pounds year he was not a day over twentythree anthea bored because there was noone to vamp disappeared shortly afterwards whereupon marcus lost his temper your agent is the most revolting little man ive ever met hes pigignorant and hes a bloody shirtlifter marcus said abby appalled what has got into you im the one whos got the big date right i dont want to hear this kinda shit howies an absolute powerhouse power bungalow you mean revolting little man marcuss attitude didnt change when he was woken by a call from howie at six oclock the following morning hi pretty boy for gods sake keep the daily mail from abby hermiones rage at rannaldini marrying helen had been exacerbated by a piece in the scorpion about abby staying at helens house and therefore being rannaldinis protegee in revenge hermione had given an interview to lynda leepotter how abby rosen slashed her wrists because her lover filled my aeroplane seat with yellow roses fucking hermione yelled marcus how dare she these dames are all the same hermiones not a bit like abby shes your client you should bloody well control her but hermione was a more important client as was anthea abby might easily bomb this evening got to go tiger see you at the press conference dont forget keep the mail from abby abby was too busy rehearsing to see the mail but the rest of the media pouring into rutminster had read the piece they had all promised not to question abby about christopher or her attempted suicide but within seconds beattie johnson from the scorpion was on her feet if christopher shepherd caused you so much grief arent you getting your own back on him and men in general by becoming a conductor so you can boss them around abby had immediately burst into tears and stormed out leaving the place in an uproar at least the programme looked splendid with a lovely new picture of abby on the front and even more lovely to the rso eighty pages of expensive advertisements for banks cars credit cards clothes jewellery and makeup it was also a lovely mild night the birds were still singing the sun had just set in an orangeandpink glow but to combat any symbolism the moon was rising out of the blackmere woods as abby arrived she was gratified not to be able to see an inch of the park round the hp hall for spectators with rugs and picnics there was an explosion of flash bulbs police held back the cheering excited crowds and there to abbys joy and relief was rodney smiling rubicund and waiting at the front door with his silverandblack cummerbund embedded in his vast belly to the width of a snake belt good evening maestro he raised her hand to his lips dont let them see how frightened you are he whispered you look utterly sensational abbys short hair was brushed straight back from a lily pale face her only makeup was eyeliner round the hypnotic eyes which seemed to glow like tourmaline the maharishi effect was heightened by midnightblue silk trousers and a long collarless matching jacket which buttoned up to her neck she wore no jewellery the only note of frivolity was the diamanté buckles twinkling on her black suede pumps in her pocket warding off evil was ruperts silver garlic they havent had a turn out like this since pavarotti in hyde park rodney led her into the conductors room oh darling im so proud theyve only come to see if ive got two heads said abby as mark carling barged in you look wonderful maestro what the hell are we going to do rodney weve got about two hundred too many press and nowhere to seat them put up a few fences suggested abby through desperately chattering teeth thats what they like sitting on best she started to run through oberon in her head moving her hands to the music vikings opening solo followed by the strings then that spinechilling shimmy downwards on the flutes then blank she simply couldnt remember what came next in panic she turned to rodney i guess i better use a score darling child itll come back relax he shoved a glass of champagne into her hand take the edge off your nerves next they were interrupted by howie whod nipped for a second out of antheas dressingroom good luck kid you look to die for sorry about the press conference forget it fact that you survived heartbreak and a suicide attempt creates public sympathy get out howie said rodney icily there was another knock it was hugo sleek and glamorous in tails he had sent two dozen red roses to the unbimbo at the old bell which had made abby laugh now he said are you ready beautiful maestro abby nodded quite unable to speak good luck hugo sauntered out onto the platform fiddle aloft to great cheers he was very popular good luck marcus gave abby a quick kiss he was so nervous for her he was going to stay outside in the park the auditorium was fuller than in buenos aires many of the audience and all the press were poised for the public humiliation that so often accompanies a dramatic change of career for a second abby paused panic stricken on the edge of the platform then turning she saw a smiling rodney his pink bald head gleaming under the naked light bulb as he blew her a kiss abby touched her silver garlic then she was on her way sweeping into the light to an impassioned bellow of applause which was taken up by the crowds in the park she shook hands with hugo courage mon amie then abby forced herself to smile and bow to the audience listening to the manic rattle of palm on palm which was so near in sound to a firingsquad kerist shes gorgeous said blue shades of imran khan agreed viking or something that edwina mountbatten wouldnt have been able to resist abby noticed the steel elf enchanting in black silk with her blond hair piled up and then she looked up at viking who smiled at her wonderfully confident at her nod he put his horn to his lips abby gripped her stick the upbeat rose and fell like a wand in fairyland and as if by magic the notes floated out from the midgy dark green depths of oberons forest then she remembered nothing until an avalanche of applause crashed over her bringing her back to earth throughout the overture she had been completely in charge yet able to become the music her beautiful body undulating like seaweed in the dark blue silk the orchestra noticing the cruel scar on her left wrist every time she raised her arm realized how important the evening was to her and had played as though their lives depended on it the tchaikovsky was less successful the mood was set by the first and second violins who had to rise and stand back muttering bloody concerto as abbys rostrum was shoved forward and the steinway was wheeled onto the centre of the stage by the stagehands in their dinner jackets once the musicstands and chairs were rearranged hugo struck an a on the piano and the orchestra halfheartedly pretended to retune they loathed concertos soloists stole the limelight and particularly in the case of pianists obscured half the orchestra and made conditions even more cramped most of them however found it difficult to keep a straight face as anthea swept onto the platform in a kingfisher blueandgold brocade dress strewn with tassels that appeared to have been tugged off the sofa in her suite at the old bell she then attacked the piano with the fury of a secretary whod been asked to stay late and type a fifteenpage report on an old remington whose ribbon had run out the only drama was whether one of her large blueveined breasts would fly out of her soft furnishings and whack the principal of the second violins in the eye that is the worst pianist ive ever heard abby shouted as she stormed back to the conductors room afterwards hush darling a very sheepish rodney put his hand over her mouth mea culpa mea culpa i must have been drunk or very tired when i hired her probably both she played the whole thing in boxing gloves furiously abby tore rodneys hand away none of the audience will have noticed and those who did will have marvelled at your restraint listen theyre still clapping rodney handed her a glass of champagne i dont want a drink i need my wits for heldenleben come in it was a distraught mark carling thank you maestro you were magnificent then turning to rodney he groaned that soloist was dreadful dreadful how could we have booked her you must have had a tipoff said rodney blandly and you know how the arts council love women anyway she was called back five times she cant have been that bad only because they wanted to look down her dress snapped abby anyone with binoculars could have seen her pubes it is customary even after the most terrible performance for the management to visit a soloist and tell them they have been wonderful mark a man of integrity was in despair what can i say to her without perjuring myself rodney particularly with that creep howie taping every word as evidence follow me rodney winked at abby back in a tick darling heart hair dripping with sweat aching all over abby was dying for a quick shower to clear her head before the strauss but curious she lingered as rodney flung open the door of antheas dressingroom then pausing in the doorway opened his arms anthea my darling he boomed magnificent is not the word very clever muttered mark in admiration must remember that one magnificent he tapped it into his pocket computer is not the word as anthea was temporarily tied up with rodney howie felt it safe to sidle out and pay court to abby for a second he was going to have his work cut out at the party later anthea and hermione would want his fulltime attention so would abby and after hearing oberon howie was determined to sign up viking who was a really hot man probably straight but howie wouldnt mind getting his jaw broken finding out the audience were flowing back now the piano had gone and there was nothing to distract them from abby and a vastly enlarged orchestra the tchaikovsky had done her no favours with the critics she had forty minutes to redeem herself everything was going wonderfully ein heldenleben was drawing to a close the woodwind had made horribly crabby and discordant critics the brass had been so loud and exuberant in the battlescenes they must have roused strauss in his musicians heaven the drums had thundered continuously the four cymbals had clashed in perfect unison to mark the end of hostilities and don juans horn call the warrior returning from the wars in search of dalliance had echoed joyfully through the park abbys hair was sopping her face lurexed with sweat under the hot lights she could see the shadow of her hands moving on the bare lectern somehow she must hush the huge orchestra to make the pianissimo contrast of the love duet all the more touching the cor anglais was now gracefully paddling like a swan throughout the piece abby had felt like a pilot faced by a massive dashboard of dials and switches her aeroplane had survived the thunder and lightning of a great storm she was now bringing its precious cargo of musicians safely in to land then as she cued in the horns nothing happened she tried again nothing she gasped in horror cramp gripped her right hand which had never let her down in three years totally immobilizing it after a threehour rehearsal this morning then threehours practising in front of the mirror followed by all the tension of the performance it had finally seized up for a few seconds the orchestra cruised on automatic pilot realizing something was wrong the cor anglais kept paddling hugo was poised to take over when abby grabbed her right elbow with her left hand yanking it through the motions one two down three to the left short four and five back and six up to the centre and one two down to reestablish the tempo the pain was so excruciating she thought shed black out but there was only one more discordant outburst from the orchestra to go as the weathercock shrieked the wind howled the enemies trumpeted then the heros theme was back with the horns basses and cellos leaping nobly and majestically up the scale and they were into the love duet on the big screens outside the vast crowds could see hugos sleek dark head cocked to listen and viking never taking his narrowed eyes off abbys face which was now shining with tears as she cajoled them through the last few bars and as suddenly as it had gripped her the cramp melted away soothed as much by the solo violins exquisite lullaby as by the unearthly beauty of vikings dark tender reply lifting both arms she was back on course bringing the great aeroplane down down through the blue and landing without a bump on the runway she felt so relieved she almost forgot to bring in carmine jones and his trumpets to echo the heros theme fortissimo then a mighty crash from the wind and brass faded into the final peaceful reassuring chord the hero finally triumphant bringing the hp hall and the park outside yelling to their feet marcus leant against the rough trunk of a big horsechestnut tree clutching himself his debts lack of recognition loneliness unrequited love ruperts animosity all totally forgotten he had never heard anything so wonderful in his life particularly as the gruesome butchering of the tchaikovsky had nearly broken his heart oh darling darling abby and darling st cecilia or polyhymnia or euterpe or whoever guides the fortunes of musicians prayed marcus make the same thing happen to me after the sixth callback miss priddock braved the stage with a huge bunch of red roses and employing her old trick an exhausted tearful ecstatic abby broke the cellophane with a stab of her baton and handed a rose to viking and one to hugo who was near enough to kiss her the next time she returned with a beaming rodney who got a great roar of delighted recognition and immediately hushed the audience my lords ladies gentlemen musicians we have just heard a masterpiece about a hero overcoming his enemies most beautifully played he winked at his orchestra triggering off a volley of bravoes but tonight were speaking about a heroine he shushed more cheers who in the last three years has battled with dreadful pain adversity selfdoubt only to emerge tonight into a new career as triumphant as she looks beautiful one final time he raised his hand for quiet i am proud of the rso but the night is abigail rosens ladies and gentlemen a star is reborn twentythree as she fled back to her dressingroom it was like the old days people pressed themselves against the wall to let her pass cheering her others reached out to shake her hands for others it was just enough to touch her for luck howie was in raptures fluttering round her taking credit for everything anthea was a hasbeen she didnt even get the limo to take her back to london instead it swept abby on to a party at the sort of shabby grand house much featured in british miniseries before the stylist moves in it belonged to lord leatherhead the chairman of the orchestra dont get him on to bottled water for gods sake hugo had warned her hes changed his family motto to springs eternal as the limo clanked over a cattlegrid abby caught a glimpse of a llama and a couple of yaks blinking in the headlights having insisted on showering and changing first she had arrived so late that she was relieved to see mr nugent still there plumey tail waving as he paid court to the house springer spaniels who were more interested in finishing up abandoned plates of moussaka and spitting out the aubergine howie was delighted that although megagram had bankrolled the party half the record producers in europe seemed to have crashed it climbing in through large georgian windows or bribing the kitchen staff he was less amused that half the agents in europe had done the same thing and were now circling abby like jackals the fuckers the fuckers why didnt megagram put bouncers on the door but theyre gonna have to fight to keep you tiger he told abby you stick with me ill field any difficult questions orchestras arent generally invited to parties being a large number to cater for but tonight a representative selection of the glamorous and wellbehaved had been allowed in to impress potential sponsors old henry the oldest member of the orchestra a rankandfile fiddle player who could tell you whether heifetz had started up bow or down bow in but hadnt heard of abby before yesterday came over and kissed her hand its not often i know why i became a musician abby longed to talk to him but he was immediately sent flying by dame edith spink massive and monacled with the solid waistless figure of a cooling tower edith promptly whipped the dark red carnation out of her dinnerjacket and presented it to abby bloody good show particularly the strauss that anthea needs her bottom spanking dame edith looked as though shed quite like to oblige but you kept your nerve made the rso play out of their boots which i have to say theyve grown much too big for you must come and guest with my boys and girls at cotchester you were lucky to have hugo heldenleben really sorts the leaders out from the leaders that little squirt lionel fielding would have made the most ghastly cockup i love your work stammered abby we all odd on the persuaders at college id just adore to discuss conducting with you some time come to lunch said edith then proudly almost shyly as though she were drawing forward a boat by its splendid figurehead she reached for the handsome highcomplexioned woman behind her have you met my partner lady baddingham the press were everywhere snapping everyone desperate for a new angle on abbys triumph whos the latest boyfriend asked a subtly smiling journalist that has nothing to do with my conducting said abby haughtily my goal is for people to judge me as an artist not a woman mm of course said the journalist taking in abbys tight leather trousers and clinging yellow bodystocking on cue anthea wiggled past hotly pursued by randy hamilton does anthea feel the same noone could regard anthea as an artist snapped abby howie meanwhile had buttonholed viking i work twentyfour hours a day he was saying i am married to my clients but i could find a window in my schedule to buy you lunch how about le manoir aux quat saisons next week the celtic mafia were getting drunk thats the most important agent in london youve just told to piss off blue reproved viking time is fleeting said viking holding out his glass to a waitress and artists agents very long winded dyou think rodneys bonked abigail aye said dixie she stopped at his place long enough whos the boy with dark red hair pretty as a picture never takes his eyes off her thats marcus campbellblack said the steel elf warmly hes lovely looking that explains it said dixie must be picking up her bills not after this evening said viking the musical press determined to refute strausss unflattering portrait of critics were falling over themselves to praise both abbys conducting and her newly reissued records which theyd mostly slagged off in the past as being overemotional and teetering on sentimentality now as they poured double cream over their chocolate roulade they were bracketing her with jacqueline du pré praising her passion her lyricism her wondrous lack of inhibition furious to be outcleavaged by anthea every valley should not be exalted hermione had tonight done up two buttons of her yellow chanel suit in her pocket however was a promising note from rannaldini carissima our love was too important to be ruined by marriage i needed another kitty to run my life and free me to embrace you again rannaldini was little cosmos father reflected hermione perhaps she should forgive him fortunately abby hadnt seen the lynda leepotter piece and in a mood of euphoria kissed hermione on both cheeks and allowed them both to be photographed arm in arm by hello this didnt stop hermione telling the telegraph how much she admired the rso for giving amateurs a chance to conduct it was the same when edward heath did cockaigne with the bournemouth symphony orchestra they were so supportive to him and ordinary folk in the audience loved feeling they could have got up and done the same thing music should be brought to the people my next openair concert by the way dyou happen to know the name of the first horn ok darling shouted rodney teetering on a sofa to see over abbys ring of admirers just off to look at the conservatory climbing down he linked arms with a voluptuous brunette wearing a lot of fuchsiapink lipstick on their way they had to go through lord leatherheads office where on another sofa rodney noticed his third trumpet pleasuring a blonde and patting him on his broad bobbing glaswegian bottom called out keep to the left keep to the left you never know who you may meet coming the other way then bending down to ascertain the identity of the blonde added hallo anthea darling so glad my boys are taking care of you patrick leatherhead ought to put some of your brass section in his wildlife park said the brunette as she and rodney reached the conservatory terrified of being interrogated about his mothers marriage by dame edith lady baddingham the press or even worse hermione marcus lurked behind a huge bamboo plant expecting the viet cong to attack at any moment peering through the leaves he could see abby still surrounded by admirers the ringed moon before bad weather again he was agonizingly aware of his own desperate poverty and abbys leap back to fame she would vanish from his life now hallo darling boy it was rodney wiping off fuchsiapink lipstick hasnt abby done well marvellously been a bit like rescuing a blackbird with a broken wing observed rodney however fond you get of the thing as you nurse it back to health youve got to set it free and just hope it survives and comes back marcus gave a start the old buffer was more perceptive than hed thought im away for ten days added rodney but give me a ring when i get back and come and play for me must go and have a word with darling norma major abby was dying on her feet drunk because she hadnt eaten since breakfast running only on adrenalin the good thing about fame was you never talked to yourself at parties the bad thing was you tended only to talk to the people who wanted to boast theyd met you the interesting ones were usually too shy peggy parker a nonexecutive director of the rso and chairman of parker and parker in the high street had wanted to meet abby all evening ay must thank yeou abigail for a most enjoyable concert your outfit was spoton very tasteful and understated as befitted the occasion clad in thousands of silver sequins weighed down by makeup fatnosed littleeyed mrs parker looked like a hippo whod spent an afternoon at estée lauder pinioning abby against a suit of armour similar to the corsets which somehow induced curves in her massive bulk she launched into the offensive but next time you return to rutminster abigail i hope you will feature one of our evening geowns on the podium ay even thought of creatin a new colour for you a light cerise called podium pink ay can see you in cerise and ill see you in hell thought abby fingering her silver garlic she felt boarded up like the canterville ghost behind mrs parker howie was hopping from foot to foot desperate to whisk her off to impress someone else she would have liked to talk to the first flute peter plumpton who had played so exquisitely in the slow movement of the tchaikovsky or to have picked over the concert with hugo but hugo was a political animal and having chatted up all the record producers was now deeply engrossed with dame edith anyway abby really only wanted to talk to viking she could see his blond head against the peacockblue wallpaper but he had been besieged as she had all evening and she was leaving first thing in the morning and oh hell hugo had shaken off dame edith and was moving in on the left then miraculously as if magnetized by her longing viking looked round stared for a fraction longer than was polite and then smiled abby felt her exhaustion and depression vanish as her cramp had during the concert almost imperceptibly viking jerked his head towards a door on the right marked private must go to the bathroom mumbled abby great to meet you mrs parker she found viking in a library reading a book on fly fishing mr nugent stretched out on a dark green damask sofa behind him well done he said softly thats one concert id have done for nothing which is the greatest compliment a musician can pay abby flushed you were terrific too viking noticed how tired she looked but how the clinging gold bodystocking brought out the blazing yellow of her eyes and how enticingly it clung to her breasts and flat midriff and how his hand itched to follow it inside the black leather trousers down between her legs nigel dempster just told me you dont want to be regarded as a woman he said mockingly not if it means the press only concentrating on my sex life sure sure what happened just before the love duet cramp my stick hand gave out viking picked it up idly shooting a thousand volts through her poor little hand probably jealous of all the attention the left ones been getting ive got a mentally handicapped sister in doblin shes otterly gorgeous but everyone makes such a foss of her her brothers and sisters sometimes feel very neglected he picked up abbys other hand subtly drawing her nearer as he examined the scar hows this one coming on i dont know abby snatched both hands away i cant talk about it although she wanted to terribly mosst have been hell watching hugo said viking gently hell confessed abby his techniques to die for and he has a beautiful sound ok but he lacks drama right i kept thinking how outrageously id have acted up at the beginning and then how passionately and tenderly id have abdicated at the end abbydicated murmured viking embarrassed close to tears she glanced up at him noticing the dark blur of beard on the hard lean jaw the big laughing lips slightly reddened and bruised from having been pressed so long against his mouthpiece oh lucky lucky mouthpiece the wide nostrils of his snub nose the fan of dark gold eyelashes above the long speculative eyes that were slowly searching her face oh yes sweetheart he said softly abby jumped as mr nugent shot off the sofa and out of the door wheres he gone mustve heard your heart beating nugents terrified of thunder it wasnt said abby confused and indignant how can you assume thats ridiculous panic made her ungracious anyway they say youre just a stud sure thats why im stoddying you he had such an untroubled smile so utterly confident of approval abby wondered if the silver locket round his neck contained a picture of juno bad luck getting trapped by mrs parker said viking she puts such a strain on her corsets blue and i thought of getting up a petition to save the whalebone abby laughed relieved yet disappointed at the shift in subject must be kinda fun playing for the rso she said hearing tarzan howls coming from next door kinda viking mimicked her you dont earn any money the difference is if youre a bank manager and youre caught holding hands with a cosstomer youre fired here if the second bassoon is caught bonking a fifteen year old in the hp carpark or the instrument room said abby drily or the instrument room indeed rodney will just say which car where is she i want part of the action whos taking my name in vain my two favourite people rodney put his arms round both their shoulders hell hell hell thought abby am i pushing myself too hard rodney frowned at himself in the lookingglass opposite what have you been up to said abby noticing fuchsiapink lipstick all over his shirt pressed against his belly abby and viking stared at each other oh there you are rodney at last ive caught up with you it was mark carling looking distraught closely followed by nugent licking his lips can i pin you down on repertoire you know were planning a haydnstravinsky festival for next march the rite of spring hasnt been taken i was just wondering darling boy i couldnt do the first fucking bar of that you know im useless at those big orchestral thingies juno darling you get prettier by the second it was the steel elf oh there you are victor said juno coolly get off the settee nugent as nugent slid off the sofa viking slid out of rodneys embrace youre tired sweetheart his voice was gentle and solicitous a little ill take you home as he put an arm round junos shoulders she looked as tiny and delicate as one of oberons fairies night mark congratulations maestro viking nodded at abby see you when you get back rodney watching him dropping a kiss on junos hair as they went out abby felt as though shed been kicked in the gut why does he wear that goddamn locket round his neck it contains the mingled earths of northern and southern ireland said rodney i wondered if i could introduce you to some of our sponsors abby asked mark diffidently the next moment shouting call you in the morning viking howie erupted into the room where in hell did you get to he reproved abby you gotta meet sir larry lockton of lockton records theyve just had a massive injection of japanese dough but everything was suddenly too much for abby all i want you to do she begged howie tearfully is to tell christopher i did well this evening and she fled from the room marcus finally tracked her down in the spare room where people had dumped their belongings she had taken someones violin from its case and had it under her chin her right hand was wielding the bow but the fingers of her left hand with all the pathos of a crushed daddylonglegs were impotently scrabbling at the strings she was crying helplessly horrified marcus ran to her abby darling please dont you did brilliantly this evening i dont give a damn about conducting all i want to do is play the violin again and you can fuck off and get out of my hair pissed commiserated dixie coming out of another spare room as marcus stumbled down the stairs my wifes the same drink always gets women like that rodney took abby back to the old bell in the morning she discovered marcus had gone twentyfour abbys reviews were sensational mighty like a rosen wrote the observer abby international said the telegraph even the rutshire butcher a local malcontent who strung and strung up for the times who had a terrifying influence over the arts council and who usually flayed the orchestra alive was extraordinarily complimentary and compared abby to lester piggott galvanizing a seaside donkey into winning the derby the rso grumbled that it was always the same if a concert was bad the orchestra got slated if good the conductor was praised but in reality they were euphoric and so were the management the takings plus an unexpected one hundred thousand pound legacy from some local philanthropist went a long way to wiping out the massive overdraft run up by rodney overpaying his famous friends despite the accolades abby felt very flat and restless after the concert she was also ashamed of being vile to marcus but when she rang the old rectory mrs edwards in high excitement revealed that marcus had moved out and not left an address back at hp hall however mark carling had received a fax from boriss agent boris wanted to duck out of conducting the modern music series because he was still wrestling with rachels requiem which would now have to be rescheduled yet again as a result howie and mark engaged in a little horse trading abby would be allowed to cut her teeth on the modern music series and howie would let the rso have shepherd denston soloists and singers at a discount megagram were delighted abbys reissued records were racing up the classical charts the orchestra was thrilled the modern music series known as squeakygate and only put on to suck up to the arts council was anathema and now they could at least relieve the boredom by lusting after abby abby was equally thrilled and already getting above herself talking to flora in grandiose fashion about being the next giulini temporarily she decided to stay at the old bell and was put in the lord byron suite overlooking the river there was a facsimile of so well go no more a roving on the wall and a painting of byron in a turban looking as dark and explosive as abby herself with concerts most saturdays the orchestral weekend fell on sunday and monday arriving on her first tuesday abby found the dark red hp hall rising out of a ruff of white cherry blossom standing on a flat roof letting down rolls of different brands of lavatory paper to test which was the longest were miss priddock assorted secretaries and john drummond the cat who fancied himself in an andrex ad this was yet another economy measure along with stopping the orchestra using the management telephones reducing the wattage of the light bulbs and not replacing musicians when they resigned on the way to the dressingroom abby passed the sanctimonious and detested general manager of the orchestra miles brianknowles inevitably known as brownnose miles had thatched mousy hair a complexion like luncheon meat caused by frequent outbreaks of acne a permanently pursed mouth and eyes so close together they could see through the same keyhole a bornagain christian who held prayer meetings with selected members of the orchestra miles always wore shirts with a high white collar giving him an ecclesiastical look and softly soled shoes enabling him to spy out bad behaviour and then sneak to peggy parker hed achieved olympiclevel at sucking up to his superiors hence the nickname he was now having a row with viking you were not at your greataunts funeral he was saying in an aggrieved fluting curates voice i saw you with my own eyes playing on television for the london met indeed you did not viking was saying indignantly that was my twin brother danny hes a far finer player than me why wasnt he burying your greataunt danny has no sense of duty viking raised his eyes piously to heaven i do not believe you viking you did not apply for a letter releasing you to play for the london met you could be sacked for this and please dont bring that dog in here he glared at mr nugent who sat listening with his head on one side vikings spreading his wings thought abby covent garden last month the festival hall this junos pressurizing was beginning to work in the auditorium the orchestra were reassembling discussing rooms theyd wallpapered or plants theyd bought over the weekend a violinist was cutting his nails two women viola players were trying to organize a dinner party abby was given a desultory clap when she came in in return she thanked the rso for a wonderful concert and said how happy she was to see them again now lets have an a simon she asked the first oboe because it was april fools day simon painshaw with a completely straight face played a flat everyone transpose half a tone up said abby who had absolute pitch and knew it was april fools day and brought her stick down caught on the hop the orchestra burst out laughing and gave her a proper round of applause the morning was spent sifting through repertoire struggling with a lot of swearing through a horror by a member of the lesser avantgarde of bulgaria full of grunts and shrieks as though a tomcat was being gangraped by elderly badgers they then moved on to an appalling serenade for solo triangle cow bells and tomtoms with extended catawauls on the strings written by someone called roger parker viking immediately took out a final reminder from british telecom and on the back drew a bucket and wrote crap on the side then handed it down the row abby of the same mind called a halt after five minutes were not programming this garbage maestro dixie douglas the troublemaking first trombone put down page three of the sun and raised a large red hand i would respectfully submit that this is a work of towering genius the orchestra laughed dixie then explained that the garbage entitled eternal triangle had been composed by sonny parker peggys ghastly son the rsos composerinresidence it was hoped mrs parker would give a quarter of a million pounds towards the orchestras centenary celebrations next year a concert has been planned for her sixtieth birthday concluded dixie in the greounds of her uge house i dont care said abby mutinously its still garbage the orchestra exchanged delighted glances a runin between lappassionata and nosy parker had distinct possibilities later abby had a cup of coffee with mark carling who was beginning to meet her eyes and joke with her magnificent is not the word youd use about this office he gazed round at the chaos mark was a sweet man who loved music with a passion and who had previously been very happy running an early music group in london hugo says you did awfully well today he told abby its lovely to see the orchestra happy they do tend to grumble a lot but i believe they have a tough life for very little money i try to think of that when they barge in here and behave horribly i envy you winning their confidence so quickly he added wistfully when i go into the band room they part like the red sea i guess they think a lot of you abby tried to sound convincing theyd forgive me if i were able to give them rises sighed mark the malaise is general orchestras everywhere are finding that with audiences plummetting reduced arts council and local government funding and sponsorship being harder to come by theres less and less money to spare abby was too wrapped up in the next week digesting the arcane repertoire and imparting her findings to the orchestra to notice how bad things were financially not only had rodney overspent dreadfully but the obscure music chosen by mark to appease the arts council had not pulled in the crowds recordings television and film work had dried up there had been no more proms since rodney fell asleep on the rostrum during daphnis and chloé and for the first time in years the orchestra had not been invited to take part in the next countys prestigious cotchester festival on her second tuesday morning abby got an ecstatic letter from rodney the swiss were going to name a train after him just imagine the darling boy chugging through the mountains we can all go for rides on him and gaze at the wild flowers running into the general office in excitement to break the news abby found miles brianknowles tearing out his thatched hair herman the kindly german guest conductor known as vun two vun two who had been standing in for rodney for a month was that evening doing the hellishly difficult missa solemnis the stage had already been extended losing three hundred stall seats to accommodate the soloists and the valkyrie might of the rutminster choir and now herman was sitting sobbing in miless chair saying i am not a nazi if the orchestra wont apologize im going home meanwhile in the auditorium the orchestra were playing silly buggers and singing he was herman and he did us wrong hermans paid five grand a concert to stand up and be electrifying grumbled viking to blue hes got no right to bore us and be incompetent hugo who had another very difficult solo in the missa had retired to the leaders room to practise in case herman was coaxed back stupid kraut thought abby hubristically hasnt a clue how to handle musicians even more dramatically at lunchtime mark carling resigned the arts council after all he had done to please them had slashed the rso grant by per cent so now with inflation running at per cent they would be plunged into debt again having no money meant mark couldnt plan ahead and would have to scrap big productions like fidelio scheduled for later in the year the final straw was an enraged letter about the music put on to please the arts council dear sir if you continue to programme this drivel i shall cancel my subscription disasters come in threes about to fly from lucerne to take over the baton later in the week from poor harassed herman rodney suffered a massive heart attack the orchestra were shattered forgetting how rodney had led them into debt and borrowed money off them they only remembered his wonderful anecdotes about the famous his kindnesses rigging up a big screen so they could watch wimbledon and the way he swept them all out to dinner when he was in funds rodney avoided tax but not attacks said viking whod gone very white hell be ok he added to a distraught abby i must go to him ill drive you to the airport your car wouldnt make the outskirts of rutminster said hugo scornfully ill take her well take him my st christopher for luck said viking as the rso were now facing a megacrisis of cash and morale an emergency board meeting was called with mark carling gone the executive directors included miles brianknowles who acted everso humble at board meetings because he wanted mark carlings job and harry hopcraft the financial director who was within a year of retirement and against any innovation particularly if it involved spending money among the nonexecutive directors were the chairman lord leatherhead who was tone deaf but who had been fond of an aunt who played the tuba lady chisleden a stuffy old trout whose reputation for virtue had been somewhat tarnished a few years ago by rumours that she had been seen pleasuring rannaldinis ancient gardener during the famous valhalla orgy peggy parker who referred to the orchestra as we and who never missed a concert various bankers brewers and building society supremos the three bs which keep orchestras going and canon airlie a handel freak known as the unloose canon because like mrs parker he was always inveighing against hooliganism finally there were two directors from the orchestra simon painshaw principal oboe who was a walking groves dictionary if given the chance and the principal viola dennis strickland known as el creepo because he was always brushing against breasts these directorships which lasted two years were supposed to be chosen from the best people to fight the orchestras corner but such was the distrust of management that simon and el creepo had been the only people last time to put their names forward the boardroom itself looked across to the russet spires and roofs of rutminster the ruby blur on the horsechestnuts in the park was turning buff as the green leaves pushed out of each sticky bud the spring sunshine however cruelly highlighted the faded dusty brown velvet curtains with the hems coming down the worn blue carpet the peeling blueandfawn wallpaper the paisley design concealing the damp patches on the walls were also an oil of herbert parker who looked like bach after a short back and sides an aerial view of rutminster showing the concert hall some framed programmes from the early days and a photograph of a drooling peggy parker shaking hands with the duchess of kent the room however was dominated by rodneys portrait over the fireplace ruskin spear had brilliantly captured his falstaffian merriment any moment you expected him to wink canon airlie opened the meeting with prayers for his recovery miles really shut his eyes and said the loudest amen miss priddock who was taking the minutes burst into tears and was comforted by a swig of brandy from one of the brewers miniatures lord leatherhead then suggested they offer abby rodneys job shes got a high profile shell pull in the sponsors and the advertisers shell attract fat record contracts we were all impressed by the way megagram chipped in and shes played with many of the top conductors so shell pull in the big names shes also a fine musician chipped in lady chisleden i dont want to speak ill of the ill but rodney hated learning new pieces abby will bring in a younger audience ours is getting a bit hoary and the orchestra like her said harry hopcraft the financial director i havent heard such laughter coming from rehearsals since rodney fell off the rostrum and shes cheap howie denston whod been on the telephone before rodney reached intensive care had offered most reasonable terms look how well dame edith has done at cotchester said peggy parker the english have always thrived with a woman at the helm think of boudicca elizabeth i victoria she waited expectantly miles didnt fail her and of yourself heading your great parker and parker empire peggy parker bowed graciously with respect though mr chairman continued miles in his fluting voice i feel abigail rosen is too young and inexperienced el creepo who liked abby because she was beautiful and had praised his solos said that simon rattle and toscanini had taken over when they were even younger auditioningll take months urged harry hopcraft and think of the air fares and the hotel bills we ought to consider the alternatives persisted miles what about olaf talks far too much in rehearsals and bores the orchestra said simon whose solos abby had also praised what about vladimir liable to turn nasty said el creepo uses us to familiarize himself with obscure repertoire then rushes off to record it with other orchestras what about hans asked lady chisleden such a charmer said he wanted to live in the area and get to know us then pushed off on the first plane back to switzerland after every concert and hes always drunk on the rostrum sheratons miserable in germany added simon but it would take six months to extricate him rannaldinis restless in new york but we could never afford him and boris levitsky is dishy said lady chisleden eagerly but totally unreliable snapped peggy parker none of them is as famous as abby said lord leatherhead we must have someone who can haul audiences away from the television miles cracked his knuckles what about ambrose he suggested in desperation everyone shuddered ambrose the principal guest conductor known as the fat controller was a bitchy old queen whod been guesting for three months in san fransisco coals to newcastle said viking ambrose is bound to block abbys appointment when he returns said lady chisleden he loathes women all the more important to engage abigail at once insisted peggy parker envisaging a whole series of concerts in which abby dazzled in a different parker and parker evening geown and blissfully unaware of abbys comments about her sons composition dont you think we should consult the orchestra said simon painshaw examining his red dreadlocks for split ends heavens no said harry hopcroft theyll disagree on principle miless was the only dissenting voice he was even more fed up when over earl grey and digestive biscuits the board showed no inclination to appoint him as managing director everyone agreed with lord leatherhead that they needed a new broom with a city background who could capitalize on abbys marketability he must be musical urged lady chisleden and able to give the orchestra spiritual guidance urged canon airlie lord leatherhead said he and one of the bankers had someone in mind will you approach him then my lord said peggy parker and ill never suck up to you again you old monster thought miles furiously glancing out of the window lord leatherhead saw abby back from lucerne leaping out of a taxi running up the path as lithe and graceful as the white cherry blossom tossing in the april breeze as a treat the board decided to call her in and offer her the job id like to hear how rodney is too said lady chisleden there was a rip in abbys jeans a smudge on her forehead and her dark curls stood on end she had had a frightening and exhausting three days and had only come back because she had exchanged a few comforting words with rodney who had urged her to carry on with squeakygate he was so darling she said as miss priddock bustled in with a fresh pot of tea he sent you all his love particularly you miss priddock and said please dont worry he said hed get much better much quicker if they added some krug to his drip and at one moment he looked round at all the tubes abby gave a sob and then said darling girl im not frightened of death its just getting there that worries me when they offered her the job she burst into tears for a second time and hugged everyone including el creepo her delight and her impassioned promise that she would work her heart out for rodneys orchestra until he could take over again touched them all the problem with modern orchestras she went on is that conductors are so busy jetting round the world they never have time to learn the repertoire or get to know the orchestra i want to live in rutminster and become part of the community thank you all for giving me this wonderful chance can i sign the contract as soon as possible in case you change your minds who is going to tell the orchestra asked el creepo nervously after shed gone oh tell them after the contracts signed said harry hopcroft we dont want them putting their oar in twentyfive having been nearly flattened by musicians charging out of rehearsal to the shaven crown abby floated off to ring howie who gave her a bollocking for overenthusiasm if you hadnt rolled over we could have screwed another grand a concert out of them im only going to draw up the contract for a year right to see how you get on privately he was convinced the rso would have folded long before then as everyone had gone home abby stole into the auditorium which seemed filled with the ghosts of former players herbert parkers haberdashers gold crest of interwoven thimbles needles and cotton reels glittered on the faded dark green velvet curtains even the gold cherubs decorating the fronts of the boxes seemed to be tooting their long trumpets to welcome her my band my own band sang abby waltzing down the aisle in ecstasy im gonna make you the greatest band in the world leaping onto the rostrum she was singing beethovens fifth symphony de de de dum de de de dum de de de dum at the top of her voice and conducting with wild flourishes when someone started playing the first violin part whipping round abby nearly died of embarrassment to find hugo whod been working late how was rodney better it would seem i figure hell pull through abby leapt down from the rostrum hes determined to ride in his new train thank you so much for driving me to the airport somethings happened to her shes glowing thought hugo in disquiet and its nothing to do with rodney god he hoped viking hadnt got there first you look like the cat thats got the cream you must be in love oh i am abby whirled round the platform bugger viking thought hugo in love with a whole big orchestra right promise promise you wont tell anyone sure sure you are looking abby paused in midwhirl nearly falling over at your new boss what no cymbal crash could have been louder the boards just appointed me musical director hugo was enchanted particularly because it had nothing to do with viking and suggested dinner at a discreet outoftown restaurant the heavenly host in paradise the sunny day had turned into a beautiful evening with the first green leaves spotlit by the falling sun against a navyblue sky lambs were racing in the fields cricketers in sweaters were practising in the nets hugo pointed out various pretty thatched cottages belonging to members of the orchestra including his own which was smothered in clematis montana with a front garden filled with grape hyacinths and primroses this is where you should get a place i come home in the evening see cows in the fields and stop thinking bloody orchestra we can have a nightcap there later if youre not too tired id just love to said abby hugo was such a gentleman hed never try anything unless she wanted it but looking at his beautifully manicured hands on the wheel and his powerful thighs in those lemon cords she thought perhaps she did hugo would be the perfect man kind sophisticated utterly honourable with whom to celebrate the end of three years celibacy thats rannaldinis house hugo halted putting a caressing hand round her left shoulder and pulling her across the same powerful thighs so that out of the sidewindow she could see valhalla towering and tasselled with emeraldgreen larches how can he leave such a fantastic place to work in new york as they arrived at the restaurant hugo pointed out a pilgrimage of frogs laboriously crawling across paradise high street on their way to the river fleet just like the rso no matter who theyre bonking how much theyve drunk whatever mischief theyre up to oversleeping or missing the bus some inner clock tells them the time and somehow they always make the gig thats so dear said abby in a choked voice and this is so gorgeous she cried as they went into the restaurant angels reclining on clouds and twanging gold harps had been painted on the walls pretty waitresses in flowing white robes and haloes handed out scrolls instead of menus vases of lilies stood on each celestial blue table being midweek the restaurant was pretty empty hugo felt free to talk and over a celebratory bottle of moët he told abby about the berlin wall existing between the musicians and the management who were known as the fourth reich the management think the orchestra are a bunch of capricious maledominated backbiting moneygrubbing hooligans the orchestra think management is inefficient lazy uppity tone deaf overpaid and spends its time drinking coffee and taking threehour lunches the candlelight gave a warmth to hugos sallow skin his dark eyes gleamed with laughter the only time the orchestra venture onto the top floor is to ask for days off or more money or make private telephone calls in fact the orchestras attitude to management hugo picked up the menu was summed up this afternoon by the chairman of the players committee telling the press about mark carlings resignation what did he say asked abby fascinated he said i feel great joy and sadness joy that mr carling is leaving but sadness that it wont be for another three months thats obnoxious abby was shocked rigid and that sighed hugo after all marks done for the orchestra poor guy was so upset hes walked out and well have to put up with that dickhead miles brownnose until they appoint another managing director but with an average rso salary of fifteen thousand pounds and most of them forced to take teaching jobs and freelance work to pay the mortgage said hugo fairly its not surprising theyre tired tetchy and demoralized theyre all spoilt he went on theyve been the best player in their school in the local youth orchestra probably at college parental hopes centred on them so on the one hand youre dealing with eightysix pavarottis who all think they can play the concerto better than the soloist on the other hand theyve been soured by being told how to play beethovens fourth symphony every week by a different idiot who earns more in an evening than they all do put together in a month the hall is terrible he went on a blackbird on the first day of spring would sound dire in there and theres no money to repair it are you ready to order monsieur de ginèstre an angelic waitress put down a plate of little pies filled with salmon mousse and scrambled eggs and topped up abbys glass hugo who had hardly touched his because he had been talking so much ordered garlic mushrooms for himself and abby as a first course after a lot of french chat du jour with the manager they agreed on boeuf bourguignonne new potatoes and haricot verts as a main course musicians love food said hugo the best thing about a concert is eating afterwards tomorrow night he put a leisurely hand on abbys jeaned thigh i will cook for you abby who hadnt eaten all day was trying not to wolf all the little pies go on about the orchestra i guess i better know the worst the main problem hugo was studying the wine list with intensity is that there isnt room in the area for two orchestras and the arts council are dying to close one down theres only fifty miles between us and the cotchester chamber orchestra who are smaller and much better run by dame edith spink and theyve got the backing of venturer television as a result theyre pinching more and more of our dates and more of our sponsors they specialize in early music when they are not programming dame ediths junk theyve done fifteen cds in the last seven months and theyve got some really good musicians the rso used to be a terrific orchestra specializing in heavyweight nineteenthcentury music and will be again interrupted abby firmly but first i gotta fire some of the musicians juno meadows for a start shes awful and there are some dreadful string players and an old boy in vikings section who should have been pensioned off years ago as should that old bass player with the hearingaid for christs sake and the first clarinets a basket case his wife keeps threatening to leave him normally hes a good player protested hugo she doesnt miss a trick he thought omigod abby gave a moan of greed as a huge cloudshaped plate of mushrooms dripping in garlic butter and parsley was placed on the blue tablecloth for them to share tuck in said hugo abby however was reluctant to be distracted dunking a piece of bread in the butter she said most of that lot will have to go well thats a good thing hugo popped a mushroom into her mouth because therell probably be a mass exodus once they hear youve been appointed then you can slot in your own people will they be very hostile said abby in alarm they wont like working for a woman but there are lots of women in the orchestra thats different theyre in subordinate positions mary melville principal second violin and clarissa principal cello are the only section leaders but theyve been darling so far abby felt champagne garlic mushrooms and too many pies churning unpleasantly round and took a slug of water thats because noone takes squeakygate seriously confessed hugo they loved rodney but they still winged about him now hes gone theyll canonize him orchestras see the fronts of conductors so they only fall in love with their departing backs you must be tough with them abby or theyll walk all over you and you must keep your distance youre a very attractive woman but once one of them gets you into bed the rest will be wildly jealous and lose any respect for you and dont think theyll keep it a secret you cant be a member of the celtic mafia unless you report back on every conquest sidling down the heavenly blue velvet banquette hugo slid an arm round abby and pressed his lips to hers abby was so startled she kissed him back a glorious exchange of garlic butter her first french french kiss sitting down hugo was the same height as her i cant wait to show you my cottage he whispered i havent showered since this morning stammered abby then kicked herself for being so gauche frenchmen were supposed to relish unwashed women like camembert ive just had a jacuzzi installed hugo seemed to read her mind i thought you said i mustnt screw any members of the orchestra chided abby who was nevertheless getting wildy excited i did hugos eyes were no longer soulful but smiling wickedly dartagnan of the flashing rapier again quite frankly i cant stand playing second fiddle to lionel fielding any more hes back the day after tomorrow and hes such a wanker so im off to lead the cco edith and i were bashing out the nuts and bolts after your début concert i gave my notice in this afternoon he added triumphantly im no longer a member of your orchestra my darling so theres nothing to keep us apart and he lunged back into the attack abby was so enraged that her great ally was abandoning her in her hour of need that she leapt to her feet and emptied the plate of mushrooms and butter all over hugos yellow cords then she shouted across to the manager if you bring in the boeuf bourguignonne ill empty that over the sonofabitch too and she stalked out twentysix abbys spirits were scarcely raised the following morning when she went into the general office to study the wall chart of future engagements it was like a wallflowers dance programme there should have been bookings two years ahead the rso hardly knew what they were doing in the autumn a moment later miss priddock rushed in brandishing the rutminster echo as if thered been a death in the family rutminster abby shrieked the huge headline someone probably hugo incensed by the destruction of his yellow cords had leaked the story of her appointment some achieve greatness some have greatness thrust upon them wrote the rutshire butcher arguing that abby was an example of the john major syndrome you push someone young and inexperienced into a position of huge responsibility and then you pray like hell which didnt make abby any happier the orchestra with predictable artistic caprice were absolutely livid they had not been consulted abby hadnt worked her way up as a conductor she had no track record its a nice day lets go on strike said randy hamilton whod had a big win on the grand national and wanted to play golf with dixie the rest of the orchestra were too strapped for cash to strike and plotted rebellion it had been a lark having abby poncing around with squeakygate but there was no way they were having her as musical director planning the repertoire and taking over all rodneys concerts they vowed to break her in a month poor princesse lointaine sighed viking when she gave him back his st christopher the honeymoons over before you even had time for a wedding night instantly the orchestra started making her life a misery turning rehearsals into the worst kind of blackboard jungle barracking her anwering back carrying on when she told them to stop passing notes farting burping and in her first concert as musical director totally ignoring her and playing the dvŏrák cello concerto and beethovens fourth symphony exactly as they had always played them abby felt as effectual as a tiny child trying to flag down a passing helicopter at this initial concert she first fully appreciated the deficiencies of the hall the acoustics were frightful the whole building trembled every time the express to paddington went by every fire engine backfiring car and tolling cathedral clock could be heard rain poured through the roof now she realized why theyd installed portaloos for her début concert only the most deafening tutti could drown the clanking of chains in the ladies nor did abby get any support from lionel fielding the leader and hugos reason for leaving when he returned he should have acted as a buffer between her and the orchestra but accustomed to being a big fish and finding a far greater violinist had been appointed over him he flew back in a rage that he had not been consulted lionel was a very vain man whose romantic good looks were marred by a petulant expression although he spent more time blowdrying his flowing ebony locks in the leaders room than practising his solos he wasnt above launching into a paganini caprice before concerts just to unnerve less experienced string players he loved all the little marks of respect owed a leader musicians standing up for him being asked to dinner with the board and to parties after concerts and since he had been guesting with a northern orchestra who had a very lush leaders room with an en suite bathroom a sofa fridge and coffee machine he was very discontented with the chair in a large cupboard provided by the rso and determined to replace it with something grander known as the incredible sulk because of his black moods lionel had a sweet wife miriam who used to play second oboe lionel however had insisted she return home to look after their three children i will not have latchkey kids leaving him free to pursue the second clarinet hilary lloyd nicknamed the swan of purley because she was the leaders mistress hilary lloyd was an organizing bitch in her late twenties who ran the rso conker competition and terrorized any young pretty girl in the orchestra by raising her eyebrows and sighing every time they played a wrong note she also put in industrial earplugs in protest against the din of the brass section and to unnerve her section leader a gentle old boy called eldred whose job she wanted a school sneak hilary never forgot a birthday nor an insult the players tended to suck up to her because as leaders pet she could make life very difficult particularly in a time of recession she had a very inflated idea of herself and would suddenly yell out lionel the first violins ought to be more pianissimo in the middle of a rehearsal which was completely out of order hilarys best friend was ostensibly juno meadows but they enjoyed a spiky relationship hilary envying junos fragile beauty and her acquisition of viking and juno envious of hilarys minor publicschool background and her acquisition of lionel who as leader outranked viking much of their conversation revolved round whether juno would reform viking or lionel leave miriam hilary prided herself on being better at sex cooking and cherishing than miriam she would set her alarm for am so she could listen to lionel playing the kreutzer sonata on the world service hilary had a cottage outside rutminster which lionel visited on the way to and from work but unlike viking he didnt pay the mortgage having a large one of his own already as a result hilary was very tight with money never buying a drink and always taking the manilla envelope round to collect for leaving presents so noone would realize she hadnt put in any money the departing hugo had been muchloved and hilary collected enough money to buy him some new yellow cords a pair of waterproof trousers and a symbolic gym slip and hockey stick because he was defecting to join the headmistresss team in cotchester his leaving party in close encounters wine bar near the cathedral was extremely wild viking and dixie brought the house down with a touching rendition of the lost cords canon airlie taking a midnight stroll with his welsh terrier trigger was appalled to see a shrieking schoolgirl with only a hockey stick for protection being chased across the close by the celtic mafia and a large barking black dog the schoolgirl was then stripped of her gym slip and thrown into the river fleet rushing to her rescue the canon nearly suffered a coronary on being confronted by a thick hairy chest and worse as hugo emerged laughing uproariously bellowing french expletives from the foam abby had not been invited to the party youre management now duckie but heard the sounds of revelry as she leant wistfully out of the lord byron suite breathing in the smell of white lilac and newly mown grass and praying that one day she would be accepted but noone could accuse abby of cowardice her first job was to sort out the rso i know youre all desperately underpaid and hungover she told them with a smile the following morning the orchestra green to the gills did not smile back and im going to push for more bucks for you went on abby but not until you play better youve got sloppy and lazy and there are too many players not pulling their weight faking or being protected by their colleagues she then produced the bombshell that she wanted the entire orchestra to reaudition behind a screen and in front of a listening panel in the american fashion so no bias against women foreigners young or old black or white can creep in this wont mean mass sackings we cant afford it abby smiled again at the orchestra who glared back stonily i just want to locate the bad apples we could start with you shouted the bullying brickred faced first trumpet carmine jones miles brianknowles the general manager who was already cross with abby because she claimed she was too busy to meet and charm any sponsors was absolutely furious you cant sack anyone its not just the money the unions wont let us and any musician fed up with working in london is far too expensive the board however supported abby as did one of her few fans the stage manager tony charlton known as charlton handsome charlton was a larky boy who looked almost as good in jeans as viking and resented the fact that the celtic mafia creamed off the prettiest groupies after concerts theyre a lot of prima donnas abby you stick to your guns he encouraged her as he rehung the dusty brown velvet curtains across the board room to provide a screen and turned the big mahogany table sideways he then lined up chairs on the far side for a listening panel which would consist of abby miles relevant section leaders when they werent auditioning themselves and miss priddock with a list of numbers for each member of the orchestra to be ticked off yes or no after theyd played most stretched of all by the event was nicholas digby the incredibly harassed orchestral manager nicholas had an anguished face ginger hair falling like salukis ears on either side of a very bald cranium and looked rather like mr pinch in martin chuzzlewit one of his many jobs along with providing complimentary tickets and seeing the soloists dressingrooms were all right was getting the correct number of musicians on and off the stage for every concert he had a nervous breakdown every winter finding extras when the rso were laid low with flu he now had the thankless task of feeding members of the orchestra one by one in to the board room and attempting to preserve their anonymity by stopping them speaking leave off your aftershave and stump in in doc martens dixie advised randy and theyll assume youre a woman and pass you automatically sections varied in size in the rso lionel as well as leading the orchestra presided over thirteen first violins peter plumpton first flute on the other hand only had the steel elf and an occasional piccolo player to boss section leaders or principals as they were known were responsible for the various problems within the section stopping personality clashes deciding who should sit where and next to whom generally improving the sound they also tended to shield bad players barry the principal bass a greyhaired giant with a gypsys face who came from a rock band had an old boy known as el squeako in his section el squeako who relied on his double bass to hold him up had a hearingaid which frequently let off eldritch squeaks during the most intimate pianissimo reducing the entire orchestra to hysterical giggles somehow el squeako had to be nursed past the listening panel it was a matter of pride for viking to get all his section through his only worry was old cyril the fourth horn whose lips and teeth had gone so he couldnt centre the notes any more and who drank too much out of nerves and despair once a great player and friend of dennis brain old cyril always wore a tie and a jacket to rehearsals sat up straight was polite to everyone loved his garden and miss priddock for the thirty years he had been with the orchestra viking knew he ought to take the old boy aside and tell him he was holding the section back but cyril had looked after viking when he joined the orchestra eight years ago he would never survive if he were fired and had to eke out an existence teaching and viking wasnt going to dump him now cyril however hadnt helped himself by downing beer after beer in the shaven crown on the day of the auditions by lunchtime abby had reached screaming pitch why in hell had she started the beastly thing if she heard another mozart concerto murdered shed go ballistic shed forgotten too how terrifying auditions were for players with throats constricting fingers stiffening tongues tying and breath shortening to nothing it was worse than ironing someone elses silk shirt number thirtynine whod just come in played exquisitely for three minutes before launching into a flurry of wrong notes and bursting into tears appalled abby jumped up pushing the brown velvet curtains apart to find little jenny the roundfaced baby of the orchestra who sat at the back of the second violins you did great abby put her arm round jennys heaving shoulders we all thought you were a far more experienced player of course youre through go and have a large drink it was your idea to audition everyone said lionel nastily as abby flopped back into her chair we better all go to lunch and cool down said miles primly abby who was not remotely hungry went in search of jennys section leader mary melville known as marythemotherofjustin because she was absolutely bats about her baby son abby wanted to tell mary how good jenny had been and that she ought to play at a desk nearer the front the band room acted as a sittingroom where musicians dumped their instruments ate their packed lunches and relaxed when they werent needed in a piece of music as well as low sofas chairs and tables there was a pingpong table a noticeboard and a small bar at the far end providing bacon sandwiches hot dogs and soft drinks tea and coffee the room fell silent as abby entered im looking for mary gone shopping said clarissa principal cello who apologized for speaking with her mouth full and to everyone elses horror invited a pathetically grateful abby to join her for a cup of coffee clarissa like charlton handsome was another of abbys supporters she admired her as a great player and as the mother of three with a husband out of work clarissa was always too worried about paying the mortgage and the school fees and scurrying from teaching jobs to cabal and bitch with the rest of the orchestra slumping down on one of the uncomfortable olivegreen sofas trying to ignore the hostility all around abby was amazed to see viking who normally went to the shaven crown at lunchtime with the celtic mafia unenthusiastically eating cottage cheese between two pieces of ryvita beside him the steel elf was looking at colour charts this room is terrible she glared up at walls painted a vile shade of hens diarrhoea green why dont we all pitch in and rag and drag it a nice peach one weekend needs some decent pictures said viking not looking up from viz perhaps we should commission a portrait of our new musical director said hilary who had her back to abby wont be here long enough said juno bitchily ignore them whispered clarissa returning from the bar with two cups of coffee thanks whispered back abby whats viking doing here dixie has a tenner on at that juno will kick viking out before the end of april murmured clarissa picking up the black tights she was darning so its in his interest to lead viking astray on sunday viking was supposed to be putting up shelves dixie lured him out to the pub and viking didnt get back till midnight madam was hopping clarissa lowered her voice even further and has refused to sleep with viking unless he stops drinking and carousing and he has my god for how long about fortyeight hours viking meanwhile was trying to look as though he was enjoying cauliflower florets and vegemite sandwiches what did you put in for nugent nothing i keep saying dogs should only be fed once a day with the warmer weather he can soon sleep outside what dyou think of that colour for our bedroom victor onspeakable nugent will not sleep outside he handed nugent half his sandwich which nugent promptly spat out regarding it as no substitute for his own shepherds pie at the pub any chocolate biscuits asked viking juno cut a grapefruit in half and handed one part to viking with a plastic spoon and a napkin heres your dessert some achieve grapefruit some have grapefruit thrust upon them sighed viking oh christ old cyril had come in cannoning off both sides of the band room door before collapsing hiccuping on a sofa gazing out unseeingly at the chestnut candles tossing in the park he was followed by marythemotherofjustin angelic face flushed with excitement over the photos she had just picked up from boots this is justin she brandished a photograph of a gorgeous two year old in front of abby and clarissa gorgeous sighed abby and thats darling of you and him i expect my husbandll put that one in his wallet mary said happily you dont have a photograph of me in your wallet victor nagged juno havent got a wallet said viking who was returning from the bar with a cup of black coffee for cyril and a penguin for nugent havent got any money either neither covent garden nor the london met had yet paid him and junos mortgage was eating into his salary hearing guffaws from the window he swung round it was dixie and randy grinning and red faced from the pub weve bought you a box of after eights victoria dear to round off your slapup meal viking auditioned in the middle of the afternoon and he mobbed the whole thing up somehow he had persuaded the pianist to play a piece of music more suited to a strip club the listening panel pursed their lips and looked even more disapproving when after a couple of bars from the french horn a lacy black bra flew over the brown velvet curtains followed in leisurely succession by fishnet stockings scarlet satin garters and finally a purple gstring which landed on the shiny boardroom table in front of abby abbys cries of this is obnoxious were then drowned by don juans horn call before viking launched into the love duet from ein heldenleben establishing no doubt as to his identity sauntering out he left a note on his chair please leave this seat as you would find it for randy hamilton who laughed so much he could hardly play fuck randy said after the tenth wrong note shut up you are not allowed to speak hissed a sweating nicholas who was supposed to be calling out players numbers to the listening panel as he fed them in fuck said randy for a second time so distracting nicholas that blue plus horn was able to slide into the board room unnoticed and hide in a big cupboard in the corner thus when a swaying cyril was posted in by viking and nicholas had called out his number fiftyfive blue put his horn to his lips and played the horn solo from a midsummer nights dream so beautifully the panel halted him after a couple of minutes thats fine abby turned to miss priddock put a yes to number fiftyfive definitely agreed lionel and miles the next moment to their horror a beaming cyril staggered through the curtains solemnly shook hands with them all blew a kiss to miss priddock and tottered out miles and lionel and abby were all furious but not so cross as quinton mitchell vikings third horn who threatened to sneak to the panel about blues playing instead of cyril i have to sit next to the drunken old bugger if you breathe a word viking seized quintons lapels ill tell mrs mitchell exactly who you were op to at hugos leaving party fiftysix shouted nicholas the piano started playing a few seconds later a flute joined in lionel and miles stared fixedly at their notes abby felt as though steel nails were being drilled through her head a wave of vindictiveness overwhelmed her thats enough warming up she shouted a few minutes later were pushed for time right can you get started there was a pause then a furious squeaky little voice said ive just played the slow movement of poulencs flute sonata abby shook off miless restraining hand can you come through anger made juno look even more enchanting putting a rare warmth in her cold eyes its no good juno said an unrepentant abby i guess youd better look for another job youre just not up to it i was good enough for your predecessor hissed juno and stormed out that was very unwise smirked lionel wonderfully lyrical he murmured mistily a minute later as hilary whom hed coached between bonks last night started paddling laboriously through the slow movement of mozarts clarinet concerto she was interrupted however by viking barging in without knocking all slitty eyes and blazing irish rage how dare you sack juno he yelled at abby ssshes useless she must have slept with someone to get that job shes sleeping with me and if she goes i go and in barged blue if viking goes i go and in marched dixie and randy and if viking and blue go we go they chorused woof woof woof barked mr nugent bringing up the rear you fucking band of brothers i dont understand you guys yelled back abby i guessed love was blind but i never figured it was deaf as well i dont know why youre being so supportive she added to nugent junoll have you out in a trice miles who disapproved of swearing and dogs looked very shocked as a result the steel elf was reinstated but abby had made herself an implacable enemy twentyseven poor abby had such good intentions but being musical director of the rso continued to be an absolute nightmare after one particularly rowdy rehearsal towards the end of april during which viking had peremptorily summoned the entire brass section out into the carpark to push his ancient bmw because he was late for the dentist abby received a summons from the manager finding lord leatherhead and miles whod given her even less support than lionel awaiting her abby steeled herself for a wigging instead they told her they had found a new managing director its george hungerford said lord leatherhead in tones of awe weve been very very lucky abby had no idea who george hungerford was and was even less impressed when they told her he was one of the few property developers who had managed to increase his fortune during the recession a rough tough yorkshireman who in his youth had sung bass in the great huddersfield choral society george had always fancied running an orchestra and reckoned he could sort out the rso in one or two days a month with his hands tied behind his back he would take over at the beginning of may all the female musicians and the secretaries on the top floor were wildly excited that he was also between marriages gorgeous george as they already called him could also be relied on to take lappassionata down a peg blood in the aisles was joyfully predicted abby was too worried about next weeks concert and her even more revolutionary plans to reaudition the entire and often frightful rutminster choir before the german requiem in june really to take in georges appointment wrestling with the complexities of the last movement of sibeliuss fifth symphony she had only fallen into bed at five oclock by which time the dawn chorus who sang infinitely better than the rutminster choir had started she was woken by a maid coming in to clean the room at ninethirty leaping out of bed she frantically tugged on yesterdays sweaty clothes racing down the high street she reached the auditorium at seven minutes to ten only to find the place deserted unlike american orchestras british players had a maddening habit of scuttling in at the last moment as a final insult viking wandered in yawning at halfpast ten sorry im late he smiled unrepentantly at abby i was having a helicopter lesson and i couldnt find anywhere to park hi sweetheart he paused on the way to kiss the steel elf incensed because the french horns start the fifth symphony abby proceeded to dock half an hour off vikings pay which triggered off the orchestra she had vowed to be accommodating today and as a joke had even circulated a photostat of a dictionary definition of the word pianissimo to all the brass section to stop them drowning everyone else but they had merely made paper darts and thrown them back at her lionel the leader who should have supported abby made no attempt to hush the chat that rose like a fountain whenever there was a pause now he asked if he might have a word abby jumped down from the rostrum acutely conscious of her scruffy appearance and dirty hair beside lionels coiffeured glamour even his breath smelt of peppermint as he said look weve recorded this symphony with rodney and ambrose if you want to get through it just sit on top of the orchestra and coast and leave you in charge no thank you snapped abby lionel and hilary exchanged toldyouso shrugs two minutes later abby called a halt excuse me flutes you were dragging a little you amaze me juno lowered her long blond eyelashes we were only following you ignoring the jibe abby tried to inspire them by telling them of sibeliuss emotions when he wrote the symphony but they all started yawning as you know the last movement ends with the six huge hammer blows of the god thor persisted abby my backs thore after all those semiquavers said a voice from the back of the violas cut out the programme notes and get on with it shouted randy dixie got out a porn mag abbys messianic streak emerged five minutes later when the horns launched into a glorious swinging tune this is a great euphoric affirmation of hope she said earnestly which sibelius wrote after he discovered that he wasnt dying of cancer after all so i want you horns to play as though the sun was bursting through dark clouds and viking let her run on for a minute before looking up you mean you want it louder he drawled the orchestra cracked up no i do not screamed abby i want you to play with more passion and build up to a splendid sforzando it says fortissimo in my score oh for gods sake lets get on nellie nicholson the orchestra nymphomaniac was a third desk cellist whose cello was nicknamed lucky by the male musicians five minutes later she came in loudly in one of the long pauses between the final hammer blows sorry sorry abby she called out apologetically a fly landed on my score and i played it by mistake again the orchestra cracked up abby totally lost her cool what in hells the matter with you guys you are piped up a voice from the back of the violas abby couldnt detect the offender who was hidden by fat isobel who was even larger than fat rosie fat isobel had a big jaw and always looked as though shed cleaned the grill pan with her hair despite this on last years tour of the oman lots of arabs had seriously tried to buy isobel leaping down barging between the second violins and violas somehow circumnavigating fat isobel abby found clare the orchestra sloane and candy her best friend from australia both ravishing blondes playing battleships and discussing their sex life you will not hide behind isobel stormed abby as she yanked their musicstand into view the viola part of sibeliuss fifth fluttered to the floor excuse me maestro steve smithson the rsos union rep was beside her in a trice breathing fire its mr charlton and the stage hands job to move the musicstands if you observe rule he brandished the book under her nose for a second he and abby glared at each other behind him abby could see nicholas the orchestra manager bald head bobbing like a buoy at sea as he hopped from one foot to another in the wings terrified at the prospect of a walkout before the concert wearily abby climbed back onto the rostrum lets play the last page again and noone is to come in between hammer blows with respect maestro said lionel silkily its halfpast eleven and was nearly knocked sideways by junior members of the various sections and a barking mr nugent racing out to be first in the tea queue abby slumped in the conductors room burning face in her hands having had no time to put on a deodorant she could smell last nights sweat now sour with fear dipping a towel in cold water she rubbed it under her armpits then groaned as she glanced in the mirror the rust jersey was far too hot and clashed with her hectic red cheeks her hair rose like strewel peter she knew the orchestra were trying to goad her into resigning she mustnt be beaten outside she could hear the cuckoo beyond the park over the palest green rolling fields of barley she could see the blackmere woods and knew what she must do splashing her face with cold water she picked up her stick with resolve the second half went better the horns and trumpets were swinging joyfully like monkeys in the jungle through the glorious heroic tune the bows of the string players were a blur they were going so fast but as abby paused to improve the ensemble playing of the second violins little claude cherub wilson put up his hand cherub second percussion had blond curls and blue eyes and hardly looked old enough to be playing in a primaryschool band all the orchestra adored him miss priddock baked him cakes even the celtic mafia allowed him to travel in their car to concerts to act as court jester he was now sitting in the percussion seat behind viking scuse me miss rosen yes cherub abbys face softened you know that bit in the first movement abby picked up the score and patiently started to leaf back through the pages which bit cherub the bit when the horns come in an the trumpets an the strings there are a lot of bits like that cherub leant forward consulting vikings score i found it a minute ago it goes la la la la la la la he sung in a shrill falsetto or maybe its la la la la la la the orchestra were clutching their sides dont laugh at cherub snapped abby i know that bit she flipped more pages here it is but youre not even playing she cried in outrage then realizing shed been hoodwinked in fact theres no percussion in this symphony i know cherub beamed at her but its a nice bit isnt it we do like nice bits you know can you play it again no we flaming cant abby contemplated hurling her score at him but she couldnt throw that far quivering with rage she clutched the brass rail counting to ten deciding to give them one more chance during the break she leafed forward to the last movement i looked out at the blackmere woods and realized how all the different greens contribute to the beauty of the spring merging together like a great orchestra cynical bored impatient menacing the rso spread out below her i like to think of you eldred and hilary and your clarinets providing the acid yellow of the poplars right and the trombones abby smiled at dixie like the stinging saffron of the great oaks and the flutes the lovely eerie silver of the whitebeams barrys basses splendid dark evergreens and of course the horns viking and blue and co soaring like beech trees topped with radiant dancing pale green i dont want nugent lifting his leg on me grumbled viking but abby was in her stride looking round at the rapt faces she thought ive got them at last i could find trees to illustrate the wonder of the trumpets and the bassoons she smiled forgivingly at steve smithson the union rep but all i want to say is that like the spring the sound of your individual instruments can blend together to create the beauty of sibelius but as she paused to wipe away a tear dixie douglas let out a long and hellish fart immediately hilary leapt to her feet flapping her score in horror lionel do something and abby flipped she was screaming so hysterically at dixie that she didnt hear the door opening at the back of the hall or notice the laughter freezing on the faces of the players hearing voices however she swung round get out get out how many times have i told you visitors are not allowed in the hall during rehearsals unless they wear gas masks said viking but the visitors came on abby swung round again with the words didnt you fucking hear me dying on her lips for it was the chairman a smirking miles and a handsome belligerent stranger sorry to interrupt you abby said lord leatherhead heartily but i just wanted to introduce you all to your new er chief executive george hungerford all the orchestra clapped in delight surreptitiously from behind the bulk of fat isobel candy got out a huge red brush powdered her nose then handed the brush to clare george hungerford had a square jaw a broken nose a mouth set like a trap and tired hard turned down eyes behind hornrimmed spectacles he looked as tough as a limestone cliff and about as unscalable he had thick hair which was cropped very close to his head and the colour and strokeable texture of a bullrush his dark grey suit was well cut to set off flat broad shoulders but also to disguise a spreading midriff he looks like a bouncer murmured randy hamilton and we all know who we want him to chuck out murmured back dixie george then mounted the stage and told the orchestra in a broad yorkshire accent how much he was looking forward to working with them as he talked his eyes moved solemnly over each player as though he was memorizing their faces for some future conjuring trick he didnt envisage any great problems he said running an orchestras like running any other business if it doesnt make a profit you make changes id like to look at what youre all up to before i make any decisions then he added without a flicker of a smile and i hope you all play a bloody sight better this evening why the hells george hungerford interested in us viking asked blue his usual form is bribing planning officers and kneecapping little old sittingtenants id lie down in front of his bulldozer any day sighed candy looks ruthless said hilary with a sniff he is too giggled clare the orchestra sloane his wife was called ruth they split up last year i read all about it in the news of the world ruth ran off with one of his even richer rivals shes very beautiful in a weybridge skirtontheknee matching accessory way those classical types always screw like stoats beneath the elizabeth arden exterior you should know said hilary bitchily abby slunk back to the old bell mortified that georges first impression should have been of a sweaty shaggy screaming virago tonight she would wow him as if in anticipation two cardboard boxes of geowns were awaiting her from parkers horrors in mauve limegreen jaundiceyellow and the most shocking pink encrusted with rhinestones sequins and diamanté overbusy with cowled necklines floating panels and kick pleats accompanying them was a handwritten bullying note urging abby to make georges first night special with an evening gown fitting the occasion in every sense mrs parker had somehow got hold of abbys measurements incensed at being dictated to abby didnt even try them on merely washing her hair and dressing in the flowing indigo trouser suit shed worn at her début concert she wished she had a friend in the orchestra with whom to discuss george he had seemed so forceful because hed made no attempt to ingratiate himself he had certainly electrified the women in the orchestra parkers sold out of scented body lotion by closing time and scuffles broke out in the changing room as the prettiest girls fought for a glimpse in the communal mirror as they applied blusher and knotted coloured ribbons in their hair hilary was livid on georges first night that eldred and not she was playing the clarinet solo in the mother goose suite that dress is much too low nellie she snapped you know we cant show bare arms or cleavages some of us havent got cleavages to show said nellie rudely as she sprayed anais anais behind her knees george hungerford wont know i havent got plunging permission with all the different floral scents wafting from the orchestra giggled candy to clare abbys going to get her image of a spring meadow if not a wood abby was desperate for everything to go well but alas the concert was a disaster some joker had slotted a page from dixies porn mag into the middle of her mother goose score scrumpling it up in a rage she chucked it over her shoulder where it landed in the massive corsetted lap of mrs parker who was already spitting because no geown had been worn the hall was halfempty and the pouring rain which had discouraged random ticket buyers dripped through the roof on abbys head but failed to extinguish the fire in a local bakery so the first movement of sibelius was ruined by clanging fireengines worst of all one of miss priddocks programme sellers overexcited by the arrival of george hungerford charged back and forth to the ladies throughout and when a chain wouldnt pull started furiously clanking in syncopation to the heroic swinging tune in the horns reducing the rso to more fits of laughter delhi belly variations murmured viking to blue as he emptied water out of his horn but at last they reached the six wonderfully dramatic hammer blows which test any conductor because an audience can often assume the whole things finished and start clapping too early abbys pauses were the longest and most dramatic ever heard in the hp hall but during the penultimate silence the chain in the ladies clanked again dixie douglas promptly corpsed and came in a beat too soon forgetting herself an incensed abby raised two very public fingers at him and running off the platform locked herself in the conductors room refusing to acknowledge any of the applause she needed a showdown with george so she could pour out her grievances but when she finally unlocked the door the place was deserted and the caretaker was locking up escaping through a sidedoor abby found the rain had stopped and breathed in a lovely smell of wet earth and the lilies of the valley which old cyril had planted under miss priddocks window during concerts the orchestral carpark was jampacked with small used cars vans old volvos with different coloured doors morris minors and vikings ancient bmw with the hit me i need the money sticker in the back it was now deserted except for a blue rolls royce and one of george hungerfords heavies in a chauffeurs uniform and a state of shock fort wed never escape wivout injury he patted the rolls bonnet but it was empty in five minutes vroom vroom vroom noone it us never seen driving like it glad they do something well it was a grite concert dont know how you remember all them notes thanks said abby wheres your boss the chauffeur nodded up to the chairmans office where george hungerford puffing at a cigar blotted out light from the window as he paced back and forth talking and talking probably about me thought abby wearily as she entered her hotel a yawning receptionist handed her a big bunch of wild garlic a child has just delivered this imagining some kind of voodoo abby was about to chuck the starry white flowers into the street when she found a note which she ripped open with trembling hands she read dear miss rosen sorry i upset you love cherub wilson it was the first kindness anyone had shown her in weeks abby started to cry helplessly she must get a grip on herself her honeymoon with the rutshire butcher it seemed was also over his review of the concert was headlined flushed with success the lavatory chain he wrote was the only thing that played at the correct tempo in sibeliuss fifth symphony twentyeight fortunately george hungerford disappeared in his helicopter the following morning no doubt looking for properties to develop he also had several acres in central manchester to think about after a slight blip in the recession the developers cranes were flying again in the afternoon the rso who were supposed to provide music for nine counties and who had at least two away fixtures a week were due to set off to starhampton in the west country two coaches had been laid on for the hundredmile journey the first coach which included nonsmokers and nondrinkers a bridge four who played regularly together and a highminded group headed by hilary who sang madrigals was known as pond life the second which included drinkers smokers and brass players was known as moulin rouge the musicians union is one of the few unions virtually untouched by thatchers reforms steve smithson set out on every trip armed with a tape measure because any gig over seven miles away entitled the musicians to a meal allowance a stop watch so they got sufficient breaks the other end and a thermometer to make sure the hall cathedral or school in which they were playing reached the required seventy degrees before an away fixture there was always an argybargy between steve and nicholas the orchestra manager who was known to the musicians as knickers orchestras are sustained by silly jokes when poor nicholas was unhappy and stressed out which was most of the time they all chorused knickers down or knickers in a twist today knickers had caught steve trying to persuade the bus drivers to leave at one and dawdle instead of onethirty so that the musicians could claim for a lunch allowance it was now twentynine minutes past one and knickers stood beside the artists entrance of hp hall ticking off names in a tartan notebook as musicians clambered aboard the two coaches by onethirty only little jenny was missing as she played at the back of the second violins it wouldnt be a major crisis if she didnt show up so the buses set off splashing down the high street out into the angelic springtime stopping to pick up simon painshaw from his bachelor pad in the close and hilary from her thatched cottage and barry the principal bass from his converted barn with his beautiful new second wife running barefoot across the lawn to kiss him goodbye after yesterdays downpour cricket pitches under water glittered in the sunshine and puddles reflected thundery grey sky pale green trees and clashing pink hawthorns it was an incontrovertible fact that however capable the rso were of pulling rabbits out of hats and playing superbly when they reached their destination many of them behaved like hyperactive children before and afterwards usually viking drove to concerts in his battered bmw which had been fitted with a hooter that played don juans horn call into the car he would cram juno blue randy dixie and cherub so they could all apply for a petrol allowance or on occasion a train fare but at the last moment juno had cried off with flu finding a replacement at such short notice had added to knickers problems as it was also vikings birthday he and the celtic mafia decided to travel on moulin rouge viking whod been blasting his lip away moonlighting with a local jazz band hadnt been to bed and was drunk when he got onto the coach freed from junos beady chaperonage he was soon pouncing on every girl in sight that guys got no stop button observed candy who was sitting beside her friend clare who was flipping through hello and tatler recognizing all her friends when hes plastered hell bonk anything clare lowered her voice juno gave him a black amp decker for his birthday such an affront to his manhood i think hes miserable then why does he leap to her defence whenever appassionata has a go at her must be elfobsessed giggled candy oh theres you she peered at tatler that ball gowns great from the back of the coach came shouts of laughter and the snatch of a rugger song followed by cherubs highpitched giggle which set everyone off blue sat slightly apart sipping malt whisky immersed in alan clarks diaries randy and dixie were obviously determined to catch up with viking who was now snogging an overjoyed nellie the nympho in the pond life coach in front as they drove through the outskirts of bath the madrigal group could be seen making silly faces april is in my mistress face and july in her eyes sang lionel in a light tenor as he gazed at a simpering hilary also in the group was simon painshaw his red dreadlocks flying as he tossed his head in time to the music and molly armitage a rankandfile viola player known as militant moll molly had short spiky hair an aggrieved face a triangular figure with narrow twitching shoulders falling to massive hips and thought everything degraded women she was having an affaire with ninion second oboe who was half her size and normally very meek molly however had so fired him up that he had become very assertive and wanted to oust simon as first oboe militant moll also wanted ninion to leave his wife and take her name fa la la la la la sang militant moll gazing into ninions blinking fieldmouse eyes lardi da da da da da giggled nellie buttoning up her dress as she collapsed behind candy and clare that hilary is such a bitch look at her vamping lionel in her piefrill collar she gave me another bollocking about my cleavage last night you are not allowed to show flesh nell we are all supposed to look black at distance nellie caught hilarys mincing whine to perfection ill black her eye you wait till she sees what im wearing tonight the slit up my skirt meets my plunge headon i wonder how long itll be before lappassionata is shoehorned into one of nosy parkers ghastly geowns wonder how long it will be before gorgeous george shoehorns her out of the job said clare you cant get away with vsigns on the platform even if its only at dixie taking my name in vain as usual any of you girls want a drink dixie armed with paper cups and a bottle of southern comfort was swaying above them his normally red face and neck were now as brown as a builders from so much free time playing golf and reading the sun on the flat roof of hphall there you are again candy had found another picture of clare this time at a wedding in hello and theres my wicked brother and theres mummy cried clare dixie glanced at hello i wouldnt mind getting orf with mummah myself he mocked as he handed paper cups to both girls clare giggled despite that ghaaaastly accent she thought dixie frightfully attractive dixie also had the hots for clare despite those awful corduroy culottes and the matelot jersey tugged down to cover a big bum and an alice band holding her brains in clare was a natural blonde with lovely skin and slender ankles ill fix lady clare dixie muttered to randy on his return ill wipe daddys smile off his face in hello as candy emerged from the coach which was shaped like an upended coffin viking ready for new sport called out thats a gorgeous tshirt on special offer in parkers this week said candy all my offers are special retorted viking pulling her onto his knee abby who still hadnt had time to buy a car hired one to drive to starhampton popping into the hall to pick up a black satin trouser suit from the conductors room she found little jenny in floods her round face red from the hairdresser her brown hair a mass of preraphaelite curls they kept me under the dryer so long i missed the bus knickersll murder me no he wont hop in said abby you can remind me to drive on the left have you had any lunch there are sandwiches in the glove compartment it soon became clear that jenny was thrilled not to be going on the coaches if you ride in pond life hilary and molly sneer at you its all right going there on moulin rouge at least you can smoke but its terrifying coming back all the guys pounce on you who does asked abby el creepo and carmine jones jenny bit into an eggandcress sandwich they both told me id get the job if i went to bed with them she shuddered thats gross said abby in horror who else the celtic mafia they all think theyre gods gift all brass players are chauvinist pigs and homophobic they despise simon because hes gay and ninion because hes gentle dixie and randy are the worst the other day jenny went absolutely scarlet the coach was driving past a sewage farm and dixie looked round at me and shouted close your legs woman i was so embarrassed thats george hungerfords new place up an avenue of limes abby could see a large red georgian house big enough to be a school or a mental home no doubt george would convert it flog it and move on the changing rooms are a nightmare went on jenny tucking into cucumberandtunafish every time you take your clothes off you feel the scorn i know im overweight but they make you feel like an outcast and none of them seem interested in learning to play better they accuse me of being a creep if i take my music home or if i practise during the break and theyre so awful to conductors dont i know it sighed abby desperate for reassurance oh they dont like you because they hate taking orders from a woman i think its mean said jenny and having finished all the sandwiches she fell asleep as abby drove towards the slowly sinking sun the countryside changed white houses with grey roofs replaced the thatched cottages the verges became banks filled with anemones and violets fields divided by winding streams lined by osiers rose into rounded hills wild garlic was taking over from fading bluebells she must thank cherub for his flowers and she must fight on and restore some idealism to the rso and protect people like simon ninion and poor little jenny she arrived at starhampton town hall as the instruments were being unloaded from a huge grey van with rutminster symphony orchestra written in red letters on the side barry was worried about a missing double bass which had already been unloaded carmine jones was having a row with charlton handsome the stage manager whom he claimed had dented his trumpet youll bloody well have to pay for it viking was on knickerss mobile calling juno hi shweetheart howsh nugent as abby followed the winding passages backstage she could see through a door marked ladies of the orchestra musicians hanging up black dresses from next monsoon and laura ashley and taking instruments out of cases which also contained dusters lockets for sore throats ibuleve for aching backs apples fruit drinks in oblong cartons and pictures of husbands boyfriends and children having driven here with abby jenny was delighted to find herself an unaccustomed centre of attention what was she like ok she shared her sandwiches with me i think shes lonely and wanted someone to talk to after a quick rehearsal and dash into starhampton for something to eat and in the celtic mafias case to drink the orchestra emerged transformed and mysteriously glamorous in their tails and black dresses to face a packed hall both hilary and peggy parker had a fit when they saw nellies slit skirt fall open to reveal a red suspender belt and black fishnet stockings peggy parkers piggy little eyes were soon distracted by francis fairchild who played on the second desk of the first violins a wonderful musician francis was known as the good loser because he was always mislaying his possessions tonight he had lost his black shoes and padded onto the platform with black socks tugged over his brown shoes the magic flute overture fizzed along the provinces were crazy about mozart and the audience were looking forward to his second horn concerto but just as abby was returning to the platform she heard crashes and shouting coming from the green room rushing in she found lionel nicholas miles charlton handsome the pond life driver and two stage hands in dinnerjackets trying to restrain viking who was plainly out of his skull seeing abby he shook them off maestro mockingly he bowed his slitty eyes going in all directions as he swayed in front of her let me play i know i can play the concert the scores of haydns trumpet concerto were kept stacked in the van for any emergency the sneering bully boy carmine jones despite his dented trumpet would be more than happy to play it quinton mitchell the third horn who badly wanted vikings job was equally happy to stand in for him and play the mozart but abby hadnt mugged up the haydn and despite his disruptive behaviour she still carried a flickering flashlight for viking ok if you figure you can do it go ahead it was a terrifying gamble drink stops tongues and fingers coordinating throughout the concerto over her left shoulder abby was aware of viking swaying like a white poplar in a high wind but he played flawlessly as though the shade of his hero dennis brain was lovingly guiding his breath and his long fingers perhaps it was his sadness over juno thought abby wistfully which made the middle movement unbearably poignant having glassily acknowledged the roars of applause however viking staggered back to the band room and passed out elgars second symphony was a success after the break particularly with the orchestra because abby was so carried away by the melancholy nostalgic music that she slowed down again and pushed the orchestra into overtime which put poor knickers in a twist once more as there were some excellent chip shops and indian restaurants in starhampton knickers was also worried he might lose several musicians but the quickest dressers in the world within seconds the orchestra were back in their clothes tails back in plastic hangers crushed velvet dresses shoved into carrier bags and the instruments stowed away in the van francis the good loser was chucked out of the pond life coach for trying to smuggle on a takeaway curry let him go and stink out moulin rouge shouted randy hamilton well all go and mob up pond life so clanking bottles carrying bags of chips and campfollowed by clare candy nellie and jenny and four percussion players the celtic mafia changed buses having had a good sleep in elgars second symphony during which quinton did stand in for him viking had woken up and was raring to go its my birthday i can behave exactly as i like he then remembered the birthday cake miss priddock had baked for him and tried to cut it on its silver cardboard disc with blues penknife as the coach moved off through the empty streets of starhampton however he upended it spreading cream and chocolate buttericing all over the floor of the bus to the noisy cheers of his supporters the bridge four looked on stonily particularly when viking bore a pretty thoroughly overexcited married piccolo player off to the back of the bus the madrigal group decided to ignore such infantile behaviour militant moll got out her song book we better call in the pestcontrol officer she said sourly to hilary whod just given nellie yet another lecture on being improperly dressed in the final analysis i prefer byrd to gibbons ninion was telling simon painshaw unfair to gibbons shouted randy making monkey faces and scratching himself under the arms the celtic mafia corpsed again lionel cleared his throat come away come sweet love the golden morning breaks he sang to a dimpling hilary all the earth all the air of love and pleasure speaks sang ninion blushing as he gazed up at militant molls granite jaw a rival singsong however was soon in full swing at the back of the bus if forty whores in purple drawers were walking down the strand bellowed randy and dixie do you suppose the walrus said that we could raise a stand dixie had clare on his knee her big bum felt nice and warm as he stroked her slender ankles just ignore them and keep going hissed hilary my bonny lass she smileth when she my heart beguileth sang simon casting nervous glances at the back of the bus fa la la la la la screeched hilary bloody sight too far la la la la la sang dixie chucking clares velvet alice band into the passing pale green woods i doubt it said the carpenter but wouldnt it be grand sang randy pulling candy onto his knee thats enough snapped lionel but to no avail and all the time the dirty swine was coming in his hand chorused the celtic mafia disgusting do something lionel hilary had gone pink with rage afraid to confront the celtic mafia headon slipping on chocolate buttericing and cream lionel strode down the bus to lodge a complaint with knickers who was far too busy sitting on top of the driver urging him on like ben hur if the coach reached hp hall later than twelvethirty they would be into the next day and by union rules the musicians would be entitled to an extra free day later in the year youre the leader lionel you sort it out said knickers firmly then to the driver left here then we can shortcut to bath nellie the nympho had other plans installing herself in the righthand seat just behind the driver she unbuttoned her pink cardigan enough for blue still immersed in alan clark to rub ibuleve into her shoulders as it fell upon a day in the merry month of may sang the madrigal group with grittedteethed desperation the love juice running down my index finger hollered back dixie the way we used to come and how we lingered sang randy in harmony oh how the smell of you clings joined in viking finally letting go of the ecstatic piccolo player these foolish things remind me of you sang randy smiling into candys eyes rather like being an air hostess giggled cherub as he slid down the gangway carrying paper refills of whisky to blue and nellie who by this time had undone most of her buttons in his rear mirror the bus driver could see her splendid breasts wriggling as she writhed under blues expert fingers the bus was definitely slowing down may st was nearly over anxious to win his bet dixie was geeing up viking why dont you ring juno he handed him knickerss mobile hi schweetheart said viking a couple of minutes later after punching out three wrong numbers howsh nugent the bitch hung up on me he said furiously abby who had been coerced into attending some mayoral reception caught up with the coaches around eleven fortyfive shed been thinking of ways to make little jenny happier and looking into the coach was horrified to see viking whisky bottle raised to his lips like a conch coming down the gangway well like a viking and pulling a girl into his arms abby nearly ran into a stone wall the girl had long brown preraphaelite curls drawing level abby peered in definitely jenny she must be rescued at all costs crawling along behind the coach ignoring cherub and lincoln vikings fifth horn who recognized her and started waving like children abby waited for the next pee break spitting with righteous indignation she fought her way into the bus seized jennys hand and catching her off balance dragged her out into the balmy night where huge moths were bombing the buss headlamps what dyou do that for said an aggrieved jenny shoving her left breast inside her bra vikings a beast an animal im so sorry jenny i should have insisted i drove you back home i didnt mean viking squeaked jenny ive wanted to snog him ever since i joined the orchestra and with that she shot back into the bus but by this time jennys innings were over seeing fat isobel stampeding him like a rhino viking looked up the coach and saw hilary come here crosspatch as his beautiful mouth came down on hers hilary pretended to fight him off but she was secretly delighted just wait until she told juno fat isobel however was still bearing down come on said viking pulling hilary down the steps to the vertical coffinshaped lavatory where he found militant moll on the way out sweet moll malone taunted viking pushing her back into the coffin come and be degraded although moll fought him off she was also delighted just wait till she told juno then she discovered viking had hilary in tow and had locked the coffin door on all three of them furious banging followed whatever did viking do to you said lionel furiously when at last hilary emerged with her feathers ruffled im not going to tell you but hes got to apologize i cant wait to ring juno slightly too long afterwards militant moll emerged looking equally ruffled ive been sexually harassed she hissed at ninion why didnt you come and rescue me hilary had just finished wising up juno when the coach doors opened to let her out at her cottage see you in about twenty minutes she whispered to lionel who for appearances sake had parked his car at h p hall clarissa and marythemotherofjustin were so tired they had slept through the whole journey marys head was resting on clarissas shoulder pretty thing murmured viking stopping in his tracks to admire marys madonna face and bending down kissed her on the lips for a second mary smiled then opening her eyes and realizing it wasnt johnno her husband she clouted viking across the face sliding to the floor he passed out cold as randy dixie blue and little cherub carried viking like another coffin to the door of junos converted squash court singing the death march from saul mr nugent started howling and in the darkened bedroom above the net curtains twitched furiously oh how the smell of you clings sang randy fa la la la la la sang cherub giggling hysterically and trampling on a lot of pink tulips the cathedral clock tolled the halfhour dingdong dingdong dingdong sang the rest of the bus to wind up knickers they would reach hp hall after twelvethirty and get their free day down below a dingdong of a different kind was taking place as randy played the last post waking up the entire street and nugents howls increased a furious juno whod been given a blow by blow account by hilary greeted viking with a rolling pin viking didnt make it until the break the following afternoon staggering in looking greener than the band room followed by an exuberant mr nugent behold el parco shouted randy theres a special offer for rolling pins in parkers basement yelled dixie but all vikings offers are special said blue drily all right all right wearily viking held up a shaking hand will anyone ive got to apologize to please line up you can start off with me said an angry northcountry voice and everyone nearly dropped their cups of tea as george hungerford stalked in if you ever behave like that again youre fired how the hell did he become a section leader george asked lord leatherhead later rodney thought it might make him more responsible but im afraid vikings a lawlessness unto himself twentynine as soon as the rehearsal was over george bore abby off for a pep talk theres a light bulb out there he added grimly as he frogmarched her up the aisle and this curtain was hanging off its rail the first time i came down this is an unloved hall its an unlovable hall snapped abby we need a new one or at least a couple of million to restore it right not to mention the chairs that all squeak and the musicstands which clunk she was still listing imperfections when they reached georges office which had already been rewallpapered in brushed suede in a rather startling ginger and recarpeted in shaggy offwhite it was also now humming with smart computers the stock exchange index on the television screen showed that george hungerford shares were up ten pence the news of his appointment to the rsq couldnt have reached the city yet thought abby sourly the threepiece suite in shabby liberty print had gone too replaced by squashy pale brown leather sofas and chairs a big oak desk dominated the room and on nearby tables like dolls houses stood exquisitely made perspex models of domestic properties and office blocks which george was currently developing on the walls a keith vaughan and an edward burra of rugged northern landscapes and a lowry of a bleak school playground mingled uneasily with aerial views of buildings and a huge map of the british isles with various property sites ringed george had clearly found himself a nice base in the west country john drummond washing his black fur on the windowsill as he eyed up the brushed suede as a potential scratchingboard and a green vase of old cyrils lilies of the valley beside the four telephones on the oak desk provided the only cosy note having dispatched a swooning miss priddock to make tea and peremptorily ordering miless secretary to hold all calls george launched into a list of abbys imperfections the trumpets in the first movement of elgars second symphony had come in two bars too early and the whole thing had been ten minutes too long immediately abby was on the defensive rattle and previn have both taken longer i dont bluddy care it pushed the orchestra into overtime i want the leaders ass off his seat by ninethirty same thing this afternoon your little masterclass on the dance of the seven veils again pushed them into overtime and i know whose head id like on a platter muttered abby particularly when george said he wanted her to attend the receptions after every concert so she could chat up sponsors and council members thats your job grumbled abby my job is to improve the orchestra havent made a great success of it so far said george bluntly and you wont have an orchestra at all if we go on losing money like this he then ordered her to turn up at tonights party youre still a celeb theres no price put on the buzz folk get from meeting you sponsors need more than their names on the programme they want their clients to meet the stars and you can put on a dress i gather you havent been out of trousers since youve been here your legs are probably the only hidden asset this orchestra possesses removing his spectacles he made his eyes redder by rubbing them he looked very tired but abby refused to be mollified i dont have the time to socialize uhuh countered george youre coming to this do and youll chat up tonights sponsor dick standish he runs standish oil hes bringing another potential sponsor paul nathan ceo of panacea pharmaceuticals we cant be sponsored by drug companies they do such horrific things to animals protectively abby stroked john drummond who purred in loud agreement dont be fatuous said george irritably there wouldnt have been any michelangelo without the medicis swiftly changing the subject before she could argue he added and you ought to know your orchestra by now americans are supposed to be good at names first flute second trombones far too impersonal then as abby opened her mouth to protest he continued it has far more effect when youre bawling people out if you use the correct name right godfrey said abby briskly then as miss priddock came in with a tray weighed down by rainbow cake and daisypatterned porcelain no i havent time for a cup of tea thanks miss prism the party was held in a blueandwhite striped tent outside the hall the section leaders had been invited to mingle with the great and the good but were far more interested in stuffing their faces with as much food and drink as fast as possible an eagerlooking matron in chewstikpink polyester immediately collared davie buckle the timpanist davies face was as round and as blank as a satellite dish and he wiled away long bars of rest playing patience on top of his kettle drums what dyou do asked the matron skittishly im a basher davie grabbed two glasses of white and thrust one into her hand whats a beasher i play the drums said davie seizing a fistful of prawns in batter how exciting id love to do that if i had the time percussion looks so easy accustomed to such inanities davie didnt rise why dont you have any time he asked well i have to look after dick my husband she added by way of explanation he sponsored tonights concert hes in oil what is he a bleeding sardine asked davie and choked on his drink because abby had just stalked in looking absolutely sensational in a red body no bra and the minutest wrapover skirt i said a dress not you oonderwear said george furiously peggy parker was even crosser she was livid about abbys plans to audition the choir and her suggestion that peggy and several of her more august cronies including lindy cardew the wife of rutminsters planning officer who all screeched like hungry seagulls should stand down nor had peggy been charmed by the scrumpledup photograph of charlene playing the flowers of the field on a slitkilted scotsman without the aid of bagpipes which had landed in her lap in the middle of mother goose two nights ago she now ambushed abby on her way to the bar why dyou persist in rejecting my geowns as musical director you should be projecting an image of femininity graciousness and dignity abby was about to snap back that weighed down with peggy parkers rhinestones shed hardly be able to lift her stick but opting for tact mumbled that she didnt feel confident enough as a conductor to draw attention to herself so dramatically mrs parker swelled like a bullfrog you clearly feel confident enough to dispense with most of the choir must get a drink and circulate abby cut across her in midflow george only invited me this evening to brownnose sponsors and she was gone leaving peggy parker furiously mouthing and appropriately pegged to the damp grass by fourinch scarlet heels the party was spilling out of the tent emerging into a starry evening lit by chestnut candles abby was waylaid hi abby im jison jison turned out to be a dodgy local cardealer after threequarters of a bottle of sancerre and a long look at abbys legs he agreed to put ten thousand pounds into sponsoring messiah which the orchestra was performing in cotchester cathedral at the end of november and which would later be transmitted on christmas eve grite to drive one of the ferraris up the aisle jason said excitedly great agreed abby absentmindedly because viking had walked in he had skipped the rest of the afternoons rehearsal it was latenight shopping and blue had discovered him and nugent fast asleep in one of the fourposters in parker and parkers bedding department just in time for the concert whiter after yesterdays excesses than his crumpled evening shirt he was still surrounded by admiring women glancing at abby however he raised his glass of red and wandered over you look glorious sweetheart totally thrown by a compliment abby became ungracious cant say the same for you why in hell dyou drink so much viking laughed making his bloodshot eyes narrower than ever if youre as charming as i am you get your glass filled up more often to prove this as he emptied his waitresses converged from all sides to fill it up again this is jason abby introduced the beadily hovering cardealer i thought youd given up drink anyway she added reprovingly not any more junos thrown me out how come asked abby trying desperately not to show how thrilled she was juno wasnt entirely pleased with the state in which i returned the prima donna had been on the mobilé to her and i left nugent with her glancing down he ran his fingers through the dogs silky fur i hoped if they spent some time together they might make friends alas nugent escaped in disgosst and rolled and in disgosst at the state in which he returned home juno went out and bought a kennel and chained him up in the garden i was also in the dog house when i got home so i crawled out and joined nugent but he was a bit smelly so we decided to walk home to the bordello abby couldnt help laughing but arent you miserable its over she asked not at all thanks sweetheart gathering up a handful of sausage rolls from yet another lingering waitress viking fed them to nugent nugent certainly looks pleased he is blue gave him a bath this morning in fact the only casualty went on viking was his bmw which had finally packed up you should invest in one of my ferraris said jason patronizingly then you could really pull the birds viking replied with considerable hauteur that he could pull the birds when he was riding a tricycle and threw a goatcheese ball at lionel who after a quick bonk in the leaders room had waited until the party filled up to smuggle in hilary who had not been invited why is vikings arrogance to die for and lionels so repulsive wondered abby as she watched lionel licking his teeth fluffing up his ebony locks squaring his shoulders as with head erect he awaited his stampede of fans he was delighted at first to be clobbered by mrs dick standish but less amused when she asked him what was his daytime job you may see us looking glamorous in our tails he said petulantly but you dont realize how much practising rehearsing travelling and admin goes into each concert at least you have job satisfaction not so as youd know it said hilary glaring over at abby then bristling with disapproval as clare whod been smuggled in by dixie bounded up to them i say romeo and juno have split up thats very stale buns said hilary crushingly but seriously exciting viking seems to be getting on rather well with our musical director perhaps shell be the next swastika on his fuselage abby was trying not to feel wildly elated that viking had stayed beside her so long he was just telling her about a cottage by the lake when she was accosted by a little bearded man in sandals with a pasty face and a straggling ponytail who immediately introduced himself as peggy parkers son roger but everyone calls me sonny the composer of the eternal triangle suite had abby fixed a date for the première abby said she wasnt sure with georges arrival the schedule was all up in the air is anyone recording your stuff she asked him as sonny shook his head his ponytail flew like a horse irritably swatting at flies after all the popular easily digested fare around people tend to find my music gritty and complex but i am philosophical the marriage of figaro was a disaster when it was first programmed i was so moved he went on earnestly to hear the toilets flushing during the sibelius two nights ago particularly in the last bars that i have commenced a new work for full orchestra i plan to provide sound effects of a rumbling train pneumatic drills people coughing rustling toffee papers cars backfiring he ticked off the list with blacknailed fingers and finally a chorus of flushing toilets abby burst out laughing you must include the snoring of the rutshire butcher then but receiving a sharp kick on the ankle from viking she realized sonny was utterly serious my goal is to prove great music can overcome any interruption i look forward to hearing it mumbled abby sonny was droning on and abby was praying hed leave her and viking alone when blue came over who are all these spivs in sharp suits wandering around hp hall sticking penknives into the brickwork he said in a low voice george hungerfords henchmen answered viking i think so too george hungerford seems very able said sonny pompously more like cain if you ask me said viking abby was screwing up courage to ask viking to show her the cottage by the lake when mrs standish rushed up such fun to be a woman conductor you did fritefly well why thank you my husbands tonights sponsor oh wow abby remembered georges brief thats so good of him were so grateful i just wanted to know mrs standish went pinker than her dress as she turned to viking how you musician chappies address a female maestro we call her mattress said viking idly then seeing abbys lips tighten he added softly because were all dying to lie on top of her abby tried and failed to look affronted im afraid my chariot of fires grounded went on viking but ill walk you back to the old bell if you like he ran a finger down abbys arm setting her heart hammering ill give you a lift abby said jason proprietorially we can discuss things over a spot of dinner miserably remembering hugos warning about getting involved with a member of the orchestra and georges insistence that she chatted up sponsors abby accepted jasons invitation popping into the ladies on her way out she noticed someone had already scribbled joyfully on the walls mr nugent rolls ok she could have wept and even more so as jason held open the door of his red ferrari for her im definitely going to sponsor that messiah who wrote it by the way nor did george hungerford seem very impressed when she told him she had found a sponsor the following day looks like a wide boy better get it in writing he then announced he had axed mahlers symphony of a thousand at the end of next season because it was too expensive thats defeatist said abby furiously we cant afford the extras if the orchestra were up to full strength said abby shirtily we wouldnt have to spend so much on extras she took a deep breath the musicians must have more money to stop the exodus barrys threatening to leave because he cant pay the mortgage on the barn and the child support agency clarissas also looking around shes a really good player pleaded abby shes gone for an audition with the lso this afternoon because shes having sleepless nights worrying about the school fees george watched john drummond stretching luxuriously in his outtray i have absolutely no sympathy with people who send their kids to pooblic school he said coldly thats rich revoltingly rich exploded abby from someone whos just bought a property up the road which makes buckingham palace look like a rabbit hutch we are not talking about me george glared at her i didnt go to pooblic school never did me any harm i wouldnt put it to the vote anyway im not a musician thats quite obvious how can you replace the symphony of a thousand with boléro and tchaik five because youve reduced the choir to such a state of disarray snapped george that i dont imagine they can possible reassemble by next season anyway tchaik five has a beautiful solo for viking abby raised her fists to heaven oh we mustnt forget viking there are worse things viking pulls in the punters this orchestra is an endangered species we need more booms on seats more recordings more touring more gala evenings this brought him to mrs parkers birthday concert at the end of july which coincided with the centenary of the store a treat in store asked abby sarcastically no replied george booting drummond up the backside for attacking the brushed suede the concert he went on was to be held in the grounds of rutminster towers peggy parkers neogothic excrescence above the town you better provide umbrellas and clothes pegs to hold down the music in case of wind and rain taunted abby mrs parker has chosen the music said george heavily william tell liszts first piano concerto the polovtsian dances omigod why doesnt mrs parker sing lady in red to crown a really intellectual evening abby was goading george she could see a muscle going in his clenched jaw his squaredoff nails whitening as he clutched the oak table but he said quite mildly in case the arts council regard the repertoire as insufficiently adventurous were going to programme sonny parkers eternal triangle suite after the interval jesus as the function will attract a lot of media attention went on george quickly mrs parker would like you to be appropriately dressed she will give an extra one hundred thousand pounds to the orchestra if george didnt quite meet abbys already furious eyes parker and parker are allowed to dress and restyle you from top to toe new gown new makeup new hairdo jewels youll enjoy it i will not seeing the fury on abbys face george busied himself lining up paperweights and files on his desk and its bluddy good pooblicity for the orchestra parkers are planning a massive promotion all the nationalsll cover it the telegraph are planning a huge feature on the new revamped abigail so youve already agreed abby was outraged with your permission said george placatingly we need the money abby youre a beautiful yoong lady and we all know youll look chumpian abby whod been feeling her age in the last month was so startled that like viking yesterday george had actually paid her a compliment that she rolled over and reluctantly agreed the messingup of a maestro she said gloomily the instant he got her consent george reverted to normal belligerence and said brusquely that that would be all last nights concert was better he opened the door for her but the symphony was still too long miss priddocks been handling complaints from people who missed their last trains and buses all morning in a rage abby went back to the conductors room and leafing through the eroica pencilled in a huge no beside every repeat sign which meant a lot of work for the library who had to change all the parts before the evening during the brahms second piano concerto in the first half abby noticed viking smiling at a pretty redhead in the audience and pointing to his watch to suggest a rendezvous after the concert abby then proceeded to knock a quarter of an hour off the eroica giving heart attacks to several ancient bass players and everyone got their last trains for an orchestra whose hobby was grumbling the rso were delighted with george hungerford socially maladroit he was deficient in small talk but he asked the right questions and listened carefully to all the answers aware that a grievance aired is usually a grievance forgotten he also recognized individual players in the building and then put up their photographs in the foyer on the premise that the public ought to recognize them too and he invited them back to drinks at his splendid new house george would generate work the rso decided and get them out of trouble he certainly generated too much work for miss priddock and very tactfully provided her with an ea an executive assistant so miss priddock felt upgraded too the ea turned out to be a ravishing bimbo called jessica whod just returned with an allover tan from the seychelles nothing could more successfully have demolished the berlin wall between musicians and management as male players who hadnt visited the top floor in years plied jessica with flowers chocolates and invitations like lovesick schoolboys el creepo even got stuck up the tallest horsechestnut tree in the park the day it was rumoured jessica was sunbathing topless on the flat roof isnt george a ball of fire exclaimed a besotted miss priddock as she handed abby her mail fires the operative word said abby gloomily hell have me out of here the second my contract ends desperately tired and unhappy she was grateful to have three weeks break at the end of june while ambrose the fat controller who was back from san francisco took over as guest conductor but she dreaded the caballing when he miles and lionel got together thirty abby found it impossible to recharge her batteries while staying at the old bell she was too conscious of the rso festering at the other end of town too proud to call howie and say she wanted out she decided to think positively and look at the cottage by the lake of which viking had spoken longing to capture the fun and friendship of her days at the academy she telephoned flora who was uncharacteristically listless wiped out by helens marriage to rannaldini she had found herself increasingly marking time and unable to concentrate at college and ive got another year to go theres a viola vacancy at the rso said abby why dont you audition for it dont say you know me right then you could come and share a cottage with me down here god id like that im fed up with london particularly in this heat hows marcus asked abby carefully reluctant to confess how much she missed him i hardly see him hes so busy writing letters taking in pupils and fending off their frightful mothers he hasnt got any time to practise let alone come out in the evenings mothers are far too old for marcus goddamn cradlesnatchers abby was predictably outraged hed find lots of teaching work down here he could start with any soloist booked by the rso perhaps hed like to share this cottage as well there was a long pause he might said flora im sorry abby but you were such a bitch to him i know i was so uptight that night i dont know what got into me i really miss him well youd better ring him then why dont you get him to drive you down to the audition then we can go and see the cottage afterwards they werent at all enthusiastic at college grumbled flora as marcus turned off the m just because im missing a days rehearsal for the endofterm concert youd have thought my career was more important they probably cant forgive you for not becoming a singer thats what they tell me every day sighed flora what dyou think about sharing a cottage with abby i dont know it would be nice to have somewhere i could practise i started playing rachmaninovs second sonata at eleven oclock last night and people on both sides started banging on the walls but im not sure i can cope with abbys ego in his shirt pocket was a letter which he already knew by heart darling markie please forgive me im sorry i chewed you out i miss you so much both as a friend and as an advisor we used to have such fun discussing repertoire fun for her thought marcus wryly remembering the hysterics the endless demands and the interrupted nights along the gloucestershire lanes he noticed the trees were losing the tender green of early summer the hedgerows were festooned with wilting dogroses buttercups and dog daisies shrivelled amidst the newly mown hay heaven after london sighed flora maybe we could cope with abbys ego if there were two of us you could do the night shift i practise at night jesus its hot marcus looked terribly white and had lost a lot of weight lets get an icecream and a bottle of wine suggested flora then looking down at her sawn off tshirt frayed bermudas and dusty bare feet wondered do you think i look smart enough for an audition frankly no weve got time to nip into bath and buy you something do i really want this job if ive got to tart up yes you need some fun marcus took his hand off the wheel and stroked her cheek hows your mother asked flora ok floras second question was more difficult hows rannaldini getting on with tabitha shes in america for a year working in some racing yard marcus didnt tell flora helen had caught rannaldini leering at tabitha undressing through a twoway mirror ive got a new viola joke he said to distract her how many viola players does it take to wallpaper a room how many three if you slice them thinly candidates at auditions are judged per cent on their playing per cent on their ability to fit into the relevant section the right attitude was needed a core of hardness to cope with the cut and thrust of orchestral life you couldnt be too sweet or likely to cry if you were shouted at neither shrinking violets nor violists were encouraged auditions could be very acrimonious the leader of the orchestra could favour one candidate the section leader another the musical director or a member of the board another steve smithson opposed anyone from abroad on principle but noone felt remotely enthusiastic that morning about the colourless bunch struggling through solos from telemanns viola concerto they seemed to encapsulate all the jokes about the dumbness and dreariness of viola players the boardroom clock edged towards five past one flora seymours late said miles looking at the last name on the list give her another five minutes said el creepo the section leader who dreaded the prospect of readvertising the job if she cant turn up on time theres no point in employing her said lionel who was longing to share a bottle of chilled white wine in the long grass with hilary they were the only people left except the accompanist who was thinking of the marmiteandscrambledegg sandwiches in tin foil at the bottom of her music case it was a measure of the lacklustre nature of the mornings performances that none of the other section leaders had bothered to stay for more than a few minutes ok thats it sorry flora miles ran a red pentel through her name floras the one whos sorry said a clear piercingly distinctive voice i cant even pretend there was a pileup on the motorway we stopped in bath to buy suitable clothes to be auditioned in and i forgot the time im really sorry miles was the first one to speak its absolutely no problem at all can i get you a glass of water or a cup of tea before you start asked lionel would you like five minutes to freshen up and unwind said el creepo there was nearly a pileup on rutminster high street as word got round and musicians on their way to the shaven crown did a speededup uturn worthy of benny hill flora proceeded to play with such insouciance and joie de vivre in every note that the board room soon filled up apart from cherub who crawled under peoples legs and chairs and ended up to his horror practically sitting on the fat controllers knee latecomers had to lurk in the passage floras new coffeecoloured silk shirt fell so charmingly over her wrists as she romped through the first movement of the walton concerto and her short fawn suede skirt clung so enticingly to her dancing hips that afterwards even simon painshaw and the fat controller were making thumbsup signs to el creepo and miles to offer her the job one of the reasons george hungerford had taken over the rso was because he loved music he had been dismayed to find admin was taking up per cent of his time leaving hp hall at nearly midnight yesterday he had taken his soaring intray home but had fallen asleep at the kitchen table over a large whisky and a forkful of roll mops and had had to bring the intray back untouched this morning coming out of his office he found the passage crowded with musicians peering in through the boardroom door with the rapt attention of a pack of hounds watching basil brush on television then he recognized his favourite piece of music elgars in the south overture in amazement as he stood on his toes to see into the jampacked board room he realized a young girl with a shiny dark red bob was playing elgars transcription of the piece with a fresh and exquisite sound her eyes were closed in anguish her head shaking almost in bewilderment at the dark sad liltingly beautiful tune pouring out of her viola george felt all the uncontrollable kneejerk reactions the sudden catch of breath hair rising on the back of the neck tears swamping the eyes hastily turning to the window through which was wafting the sweet lemony smell of lime flowers so noone could see how moved he was he was overwhelmed by the emptiness of his life since ruth had left him he was brought back to earth by a most unusual round of applause that was absolutely beautiful said el creepo blowing his nose beautiful agreed lionel after hastily checking hilary wasnt within earshot what are you working on at the academy at the moment mostly singing eve were doing the creation as an endofterm concert dyou have to strip off shouted dixie from the back flora laughed im allowed to keep on my figleaf going to give us a demo asked dixie thats quite enough snapped lionel trust you to lower the tone dixie i only wanted flora to lower her figleaf i would like to ask miss seymour miles glared at dixie why she wants to play in an orchestra and the rso in particular for once flora seemed lost for words as her eyes ran over the men staring at her then she beamed from ear to ear i guess id like some fun everyone beamed back much too sexy for her own or anyone elses good thought george in the end the rso offered flora six months trial in case either of us dont like each other said el creepo which is most unlikely im afraid we can only offer you thirteen thousand a year said miles apologetically you couldnt make it thirteen and a half asked flora ill probably have to pay back my grant then shaken out of her habitual cool added i cant tell you how pleased i am so were the men in the orchestra even the celtic mafia charged round in jubilation saying shes got the job shes got the job abby was jubilant too because shed set the thing up ive organized chilled french champagne scotch salmon alligator pears and fresh berries she told marcus and flora well have a picnic by the lake and then well go and look at the cottage in the third week in june abby marcus and flora moved into woodbine cottage which lurked like the palest red fox cub peering out of its woodland undergrowth it was situated two hundred and fifty yards from the lake up a rough track which would become a running stream in wet weather they would have difficulty getting out if it snowed but at least they wouldnt be gawped at by locals or tourists wandering round the lake the cottage itself was early nineteenth century and quite enchanting pale pink roses arched over the rickety front gate pink geraniums in pots leant out of every window and a stream hurtled under the mossy flagstones that led up to the pale green front door clematis white roses and honeysuckle swarmed up the soft red walls the front garden was crowded with pinks snapdragons and tall crimson hollyhocks behind the cottage a lawn bounded by ancient apple trees sloped up into soaring woods which protected the cottage from north and east winds beyond the front gate red and white cows grazed in a wild flower meadow rising gently to poplars on the horizon you wont get much sun until midday the owner a sweet widow told them apologetically suits us said flora were not early risers you will be now youve joined the rso said abby firmly inside the cottage to abbys delight had adequate plumbing a modern kitchen with a cotswold stone floor and a big scrubbed table the drawingroom had a huge mirror in which she could practise conducting and plenty of shelves for scores and books upstairs were two largish bedrooms looking over the meadow a bathroom and an attic bedroom under the eaves marcus was worried the place was so isolated with every move he had to find a doctor and locate the nearest casualty department he would have to make doubly sure that he always had spare inhalers and a prepacked syringe to inject himself but the real plus was that under a spreading chestnut tree in the top lefthand corner of the back garden had been built a studio this had a shower a a fridge in which he could put his pillows to kill the dust mites plenty of room for a bed and the steinway on which he had just managed to keep up the payments my late husband was a sculptor who liked to work at night the sweet widow told marcus i like to think of another artist living here with a studio marcus could also take in private pupils without bothering the others and retreat to avoid the dust and fluff bound to be created by abbys and floras sloppy housework and the two blackandwhite kitten brothers sibelius and scriabin which abby had rushed off and acquired from the nearest rescue kennels the moment they moved in two for joy theyre just like magpies said flora in ecstasy as the kittens with thunderous purring buried their faces in a plate of boiled chicken can you imagine poor schubert moving twentyfour times im exhausted after a day of it added flora there was still masses of sorting out but she wandered off to the kitchen returning with a bottle of moët and three glasses abby raised a disapproving eyebrow it was only three oclock im not going to make a habit of it said flora airily but it is a special day we are going to introduce a new regime insisted abby virtuously no pop music no tv well go for long walks read aloud and discuss music and ideas in the evening no television thats a bit steep cried flora in alarm what about men behaving badly blind date and keeping up appearances youll soon get used to it abby raised her glass to us we better start making our own wine muttered flora go and jump on a few elderberries marcus and make our own amusements said marcus and he and flora sat down to bash out a fourhanded version of schuberts marche militaire on the ancient upright in the drawingroom abbys clearly going to take rural life very seriously giggled flora shes already bought galoshes gloves a rain hat and a dryzabone for country walks she can count me out sighed marcus i cant do more than forty yards at the moment wandering out into the back garden clutching a still purring scriabin the browning lawn scratching her bare feet like horsehair abby jumped as she heard the glorious horn call from don juan echoing through the woods for a second she thought the others bored of duets had put on a record but noone could mistake that radiance and clarity it was viking practising for next weeks concert there it was again hardly muffled by the leaves the celtic mafias bordello rented so they could play music and hellraise as loudly as they liked lay on the other side of the lake perhaps they could start giving woodbine cottage dinner parties round the big kitchen table was viking putting out signals playing don juan on her first day perhaps he didnt know she had moved in she must get some change of address cards printed she thought with a shiver of excitement that night she fell asleep instantly for the first time in months soothed by the sound of the stream under her window rushing down to join the lake returning to work after her three weeks break was like going back to prison miles and lionel whod chiefly employed flora to put her nose out of joint couldnt wait to break the news of her appointment we would have waited for you to ok her said miles smugly but shes so talented we decided to snap her up the academy says shes got a fantastic voice even lionel was looking quite moony which is useful if we ever need an understudy whats her name abby was idly flipping through her post flora seymour miles laughed heartily we all want to see more of flora georgie maguires daughter said abby opening a typed envelope with a london postmark i said seymour not maguire still georgies daughter you sure youve got the right girl quite said abby with a malicious smile flora and i were at the academy together she auditioned while i was away on vacation right so i couldnt be accused of bias shes living in the cottage ive bought by the lake bought a cottage spluttered lionel youre planning a long stay with the rso sure am crowed abby get a look of this it was confirmation from howie denston that megagram wanted to record all fanny mendelssohns music and all four of winifred trapps harp concertos with abby and the rso whos winifred trapp asked miles scornfully its pronounced vinifred said abby rudely shes a terrific nineteenthcentury swiss composer she had to stop home and care for her elderly parents so her oeuvre was only performed by family and friends which meant she used a very small orchestra which means jackboot hungerford can cut down on extras i discovered her when i was living with rodney in lucerne she makes marvellous use of yodelling and cowbells yet another hallemptier snapped miles but even he couldnt argue with a fat record contract wandering back to her dressingroom abby bumped into viking and her heart stopped his lean normally pale face was tanned a warm gold sunbathing with his hair drenched in lemon juice had turned it nearly white he was wearing a seagreen polo shirt and dirty white shorts abby couldnt resist telling him she had heard him last night viking looked alarmed dont tell anyone you heard me practising its terrible for my image on an ego trip abby had to break the news about winifred trapp and fanny mendelssohn its nearly the hundred and fiftieth anniversary of fannys death fanniversary viking grinned broadly must you trivialize everything i have a theory about obscure repertoire said viking if its onplayed theres very good reason its either onplayable or onotterably bad if you record it however you get a reputation for brilliance and innovation because theres nothing to compare it with you would have an utterly defeatist attitude abby flounced off in a fury to save money it was decided to run a joint mendelssohn and trapp series in the late autumn then megagram could perhaps be leant on to pay for the rehearsals there was just time to slot this change of repertoire into next seasons smart brochure which had a picture of abby on the front george had also effected a saving of thirty thousand pounds a year by sacking the marketing manager whod kept coming up with fatuous ideas about laser beams and back projections and the orchestra playing in their national costumes to prove how international they were abby returned from her holiday to find clarissa had left as threatened not to london but to join hugo and the cco abby felt betrayed and as though she had lost an ally but she wasted no time in bringing in a new principal cellist called dimitri who refused to be parted from his cello because it was the only possession he had managed to smuggle out of a russian labour camp speaking precious little english he had difficulty getting a job and was as thin as a skeleton but after spending a couple of nights in the attic bedroom at woodbine cottage and playing chamber music with flora and marcus he soon regained his confidence although he cried everytime the orchestra played the great gate of kiev he added wonderful gravitas and a great deep russian sound to the cello section as a result dimitri adored abby and was horrified by the orchestras deep disrespect for her despite miless and lionels belief that it would put abbys nose out of joint to employ flora abby liked pretty women in the orchestra as long as they played well she had therefore spiced up the back of the violins with an enchanting japanese girl called noriko noriko couldnt pronounce her ls and kept everyone in stitches ordering river and bacon at the shaven crown and suggesting the steel elf who was having trouble paying her mortgage since viking moved out should take in a roger viking and juno were both too proud to make it up but romancewatchers had noticed juno definitely making big blueygreen eyes at george hungerford that would be a dangerous liaison said dixie gloomily she would have us all out in a trice floras first rehearsal with the rso at the beginning of july was greeted with a chorus of wolfwhistles she had tied back her newly washed hair with a grey ribbon she wore no makeup on her gold freckled skin her legs in grey linen shorts were almost chunky but there was an undeniable sexuality about her perhaps because she was totally lacking in newgirl nerves used to playing solo at college she attacked every piece with vigour and if she came in too early or played a wrong note she burst out laughing thus giving confidence to other newcomers like jenny and noriko who were too shy of scorn even to practise in public flora took foxie her puppetfox mascot everywhere with her reducing the nearby players to fits of giggles by making him conduct with her pencil or putting his paws over his ears and shaking his head at moments of discord or stress flora also chattered to everyone and was absurdly generous in her second week when they were waiting for abby whod been delayed by some management wrangle flora plied her own section and the surrounding players with lemon sherbets they were about to rehearse the valse des fleurs which required a harpist and even contained an important harp cadenza harpists are often regarded as something of a joke in orchestras but if the rso laughed at miss parrott they also loved and admired her a middleaged spinster with piledup strawberrypink hair she always wore high heels and very bright colours if youre in the shop window for a long tayme you tend to fade so ay like to look colourful and rose above the orchestra as dignified as her gold harp which she plucked at with long red fingers miss parrott looked on and missed nothing passing the time when she wasnt playing knitting brightly coloured scarves for her favourites in the orchestra blue and viking had two each she always had a beta blocker and a glass of sherry before concerts and liked to play her harp beside the flutes complaining bitterly if ever she were relegated to the back of the second violins although miss parrott claimed my feet are danglin from the shelf she had no shortage of male admirers to mend plugs and tyres for her and carry her harp in and out of concert halls finally she was an inveterate moonlighter and that very evening after shed dispatched valse des fleurs in the first half at rutminster would be belting over to cotchester to play debussys dances sacres et profanes with the cco having finished her lemon sherbet she asked flora if she could have another one goodness miss parrott piped up cherub youve got a big suck if you were ten years older and ay were ten years younger ayd show you young man said miss parrott calmly shouts of laughter greeted this as poor cherub went as red as his bass drum as a new girl flora had been placed behind fat isobel beside militant moll and in front of juno and hilary none of whom were at all enthusiastic about her arrival viking who usually claimed droit de seigneur over any pretty girl who joined the orchestra had noticed floras bitten nails at the audition and the occasional flicker of desolation on her face and didnt believe she was as bonny and blithe as she appeared writing will you have a drink with me after this on a paper dart he chucked it in her direction alas the dart flew over floras head and fluttered down onto the massive bosom of fat isobel who still disappointed at being passed up during vikings erotic bonanza on the bus to starhampton swung round nodding frantically in acceptance jesus ill have to empty oddbins muttered an appalled viking isobels got lovely skin protested miss parrott kindly pity theres so much of it sighed viking the rest of the celtic mafia were still crying with laughter when abby arrived quiet please lets get started she said briskly where are clare and dixie still in the pub said juno primly shall i go and get them piped up flora eager to escape for a quick one noriko can go said abby adding pointedly she doesnt drink she couldnt help feeling wildly jealous that flora had been accepted so easily and had this gift of making people love her everyone wanted to play chamber music with her the telephone rang the whole time at the cottage her pigeon hole at hp hall was filled with notes i must start playing the violin again thought abby fretfully so people want to play chamber music with me its only because floras new abby overheard juno saying bitchily to hilary theyll soon get bored of her thirtyone rutminster was gripped by a heatwave plans for holding piggy parkers sixtiethbirthday concert inside or providing the orchestra with a canopy were shelved as the ground cracked the huge domed trees in the grounds of rutminster towers shed their first yellow leaves and mrs parker repeatedly cursed her mother for conceiving her in a ramsgate boardinghouse in october rather than in september which meant her birthday fell at the end of july by which time the roses had gone over short of glueing back every petal the only answer was to bus in furiously clashing bedding plants from parkers horticultural emporium lorryloads of electricblue hydrangeas and scarlet petunias were racing armies of caterers up the drive as the orchestra struggled in for an early rehearsal and to check the timing of the fireworks in william tell before the heat became too punishing rutminster towers itself stood in all its neogothic glory surrounded by a formal garden and parkland overlooking the river fleet a platform for orchestra and choir had been set up on the rivers edge bronzed workmen putting up a large redandwhite striped vip tent eyed flora as she paddled and splashed water over a panting mr nugent mrs parker was frantic everything should go well as a year ago a pleasure launch of hoorays playing pop music and drunkenly yelling hellair had disrupted panis angelicus she was personally prepared to dam the river with her vast bulk to stop anyone sailing upstream during the concert she had however graciously invited the ladies of the orchestra to hang their dresses in the long gallery is that a genuine picasso asked nellie as she peered in awe into the leounge no no giggled candy look on the back it says do not freeze this side up admiring my picarso said a loud voice behind them it was a silver weddinggift from my late hubby shes even matched her grand piano exactly to the panelling clare told dixie as she returned from the house and every piece of ghastly furniture is for sale you dont think an old bag like piggy porker would pass up an opportunity for commercial gain said dixie you could probably buy that oak tree for twenty grand ill pay sonny twenty grand to stay away said clare hes been so preoccupied with his première he even forgot to buy mumsy a birthday card today was also the birthday of ninion second oboe and oppressed partner of militant moll just proves what utter crap astrology is sneered carmine jones getting his trumpet out of its case when a thug like piggy porker and a wimp like ninion have birthdays on the same day ninion ignored the crack but his hands shook as he read his and mrs parkers horoscope in the rutminster echo which was part owned by mrs parker anyway and which said it would be a good day for fireworks underneath his mild blinking fieldmouse exterior ninion was hopping mad second oboe often doubles up as cor anglais but knickers and abby had humiliatingly not thought he was good enough to play the long ravishing cor anglais solo in william tell and brought in carmine joness wife catherine as an extra militant moll should have been pleased a woman had been given the job instead she berated ninion for not standing up for his rights you are quite capable of playing that solo nin why dyou let people push you around catherine jones is a drip not to have left carmine years ago moll was taking ninion to a woman composers workshop in bath as a birthday treat ninion brooded he was fed up with women the surrounding fields were silvered with dew as the orchestra tuned up but no breeze ruffled the forgetmenots languishing on the riverbank as flora returned a dripping nugent to viking she breathed in a heady scent at first she thought it came from a nearby lime tree then she realized it was blues aftershave which he never wore normally and that he had put on a ravishing new duckeggblue shirt blue was so handsome quiet and dependable but there was a sadness about him flora wondered if he were gay and secretly in love with viking he never had any women around god its baking said viking who was sharing his breakfast of a pork pie and a kitkat with mr nugent oh go away he snapped at fat isobel whod been panting after him like a st bernard since hed taken her out for a drink flora looked up at the house how the hell did piggy porker get permission to build such an excrescence in such a beautiful park she asked every councillor has his price explained viking contemptuously all the fat cats on rutminster council who youll see guzzling champagne this evening probably received a nice nestegg in a swiss bank or holiday home in barbados i wonder if alan cardew the planning officer would enjoy knowing that his wife lindy is currently being knocked off by carmine jones how could she hes loathsome imagine that brickred sneering face kissing you thats why lindy was so livid when abby sacked her from the choir she cant pretend to be sloping off to choir practice any more all right lets get started abby had arrived looking deathly pale after a sleepless night wondering whether to do a runner rather than be made over by peggys beauticians she was wearing a dark red vest and black bicycle shorts and her lips tightened as she saw flora gossiping with viking the orchestra quickly whizzed through william tell catherine jones wasnt turning up until the concert so ninion had to deputize for her which made him crosser than ever the fireworks would be let off after the trumpet fanfare during the rousing finale which everyone knew because it had once been the lone rangers signature tune fortunately the electrician whod spent the morning hammering roman candles rockets and catherine wheels onto posts liked music and knew exactly when to start the display miss rosen were ready for you im crystelle by the way called out a parker beautician who hovered smiling like a crocodile her makeup was so thick you could have chucked rocks at it for a second abby stared down at her terrified and proud sidney carton at the scaffold then she gathered up her sticks and her scores please dont ruin her shes so beautiful called out flora as crystelle frogmarched abby back to the house you need your eyes tested flora said carmine jones nastily and you need a face transplant shouted flora the orchestra roared with laughter singly most of them were too frightened to take on carmine whose face was now engorged with rage like a slice of black pudding it was now time for sonny to take a last rehearsal of his eternal triangle for orchestra cow bells and yodeller a little man with a very large ego sonny or rather mumsy had paid for several extra rehearsals many contemporary composers prefer to be programmed with other twentiethcentury music not sonny im not frightened of comparison with the great masters crash bang plink plonk went the orchestra sonny a hopeless conductor looked as though he were swimming through deep water and occasionally spearing a jelly fish nor did he know anything about music but fancying viking whose body was turning dark gold above his dirty white shorts called out four bars after twenty horns marked gestopft could you play it on your own gestopft means putting the right hand up the bell of the horn to produce a muted buzzing sound viking however muttered to his section oklads play flat out the next moment five horns blared out making two nearby pigeons and the rest of the orchestra jump out of their skins for goodness sake spluttered hilary who hadnt imagined shed need her industrial ear plugs in the open air sonny however was in raptures splendid viking splendid he thrust forward a circle formed by his first finger and thumb nor does the silly bugger realize that the trumpets been transposed into the wrong key by the copyist for the last three rehearsals said viking scornfully hes been too busy jogging so he can rush up onto the platform in time to catch the applause said blue shaking water out of his tuning slide sonny had also been active organizing a claque of comely youths from the softfurnishing department to provide a standing ovation now really clap your hands boys shout bravo and stamp your feet sonnys favourite however was rumoured to be a plump young man with soft brown curls in all the right places who was going to dress in lederhosen and provide the yodelling tonight at ten oclock by which time the temperature had soared into the nineties the orchestra were released many of them to sunbathe so they would look good in their summer uniform of white dinnerjackets or for women dresses in a single colour whose skirts must fall at least nine inches below the knee as rutshire was playing yorkshire on the cricket ground next to the cathedral old henry and old cyril found a couple of deckchairs as he opened a can of beer old cyril thanked god for the millionth time that viking and blue had carried him through his audition having spent the morning on the telephone shouting at his builder who had omitted to put a staircase in a new office block now thats one i really cant lie about george george hungerford had also hoped to slope off to the cricket ground to cheer on his home county coming out of his office however he had found eldred the first clarinet in tears they were so badly in debt that his wife had left him you better tell me about it sighed george going back into his office carmine joness face grew even redder as he pleasured lindy cardew wife of rutminsters planning officer on her peach nylon sheets ill get you back into the choir lindy if it kills me poor catherine jones had no time to practise her cor anglais she had been far too busy washing and ironing carmines dressshirt and getting suspiciouslooking grass stains out of his white tuxedo and sobbing over the primroseyellow taffeta dress with huge puffed sleeves which had been fashionable the year the princess of wales had married prince charles the same year she had married carmine apart from a black polyester shift to wear to winter concerts she had not had a new dress since then tonights outfit had to be one colour cutting the orange fire bird made of sequins from the yellow taffeta bodice as she shoved baked beans down fractious children catherine had jagged a large hole in the bodice at this rate she wouldnt have time to wash her hair as carmine was pathologically stingy he had ordered catherine to come home immediately after william tell to relieve the babysitter and not even stay for drinks in the interval catherine fingered a large bruise on her left cheek and hoped makeup would hide it the soloist in liszts piano concerto that evening was benny basanovich a halffrench halfrussian pig who could only play loudly he therefore chose pieces and women said viking where he could bang away good looking in a brutal fashion benny had thick black rams curls falling to his shoulders a hooked nose slanting eyes beneath thick brown eyebrows and a big light red mouth a shepherd denston artist hed always been wildly jealous of abby because she was more famous than him but he got much more work than he deserved because howie fancied him after a brief telephone call to lionel both men decided that lionel would follow benny and bring in the orchestra as necessary and that everyone would ignore abby by two oclock the beauticians had abby corsetted dressed madeup and coiffeured she was then subjected to an interview and a long photographic shoot with the daily telegraph followed by a press conference and photocall in the burning heat cant i even take off my panty hose pleaded abby certainly not luvlilegs have taken a fullpage ad in the programme said crystelle shutting up such subversion with a huge powderpuff slap in abbys face always remember to brush powder upwards it raises the hairs on your face and gives you a far livelier expression dont you look a poppet cried peggy parker in ecstasy what a transformation peggy herself already madeup and wearing a white kimono over her massive corseted bulk looked like an allin wrestler on the windowsill as more dark blue lines were drawn under her lashes abby noticed a giftwrapped present to abigail rosen thank you indeed for a very pleasant concert sincerely peggy parker said the accompanying card there was one for benny too out of the window abby could see a beautiful sunken garden crammed with red white and blue rock plants she wanted to dive into the lily pond in the centre crack open her aching head and never wake again catching sight of a dreadful drag queen in the mirror she gave a moan of anguish but abby had never lacked courage one hundred thousand pounds for the rso was worth twelve hours of humiliation the sweet heady smell of honeysuckle and tobacco plants grew stronger with the coming of night mingling with the hundred different fragrances of mrs parkers invited guests who had paid one hundred and fifty pounds for their tickets and hospitality throughout the evening and who were now noisily spilling out of the vip tent most of the women had streaked hair and wore a lot of makeup which looked better as the light faded they enjoyed a concert they knew the tunes from classic fm and it was such fun to look at each others jewels and clothes and see whod been asked they all longed for a word with george hungerford whose manly attractively rumpled face was always looking out from the financial pages but sadly he was being monopolized by their husbands hoping perhaps that some of his huge success might rub off on them george in fact was in a foul temper he had somehow mopped up eldred and persuaded him to play but he was fed up with being bossed around by peggy parker he had also just had a frightful row with benny who had refused to come out of his dressingroom and give a very pleasant concert to anyone unless he was paid cash up front the orchestra were nearly all in their seats miss parrott had availed herself of peggy parkers offer of geowns at trade a symphony of harebellblue tulle with a mauveblue beehive to match she smiled across at dimitri the principal cellist who started the concert knickers was in a terrible twist again running around in his shirt sleeves livid that hed had to hand over his white dinnerjacket to francis the good loser whod brought tails by mistake francis had also forgotten his black socks and rectified the mistake by smothering his ankles with old henrys black boot polish catherine jones was late as a second oboe wasnt needed in william tell ninion propped up the bar and festered he wasnt going to help them out if cathie didnt show up at halfpast seven on the dot mrs parker resplendant in a diamond tiara and red bustier with matching organdie skirt swept down the hill in a white opentopped bentley beside her a third of her size but radiating equal complacency sat sonny in a white silk tunic with his lank dark hair loose round his silly beaky face he looked like a parrot peering out of its baize cloth dismounting from their triumphal car mrs parker and sonny were clapped onto the rostrum by the audience led by sonnys claque from soft furnishing they were followed by abby clad in an electricblue lurex shirtwaister which fell to midcalf she was shod in electricblue shoes whose fourinch heels kept falling into the cracks in the ground due to the tightness of her skirt it took her three goes to climb onto the platform she was bowed down by vast rubies at her neck ears and wrists her hair was bouffant lacquered and blonded her makeup thick as a raddled old tart in the early evening sunshine the orchestra ably led by lionel were clutching their sides flora was torn by horror and helpless laughter oh poor abby marcus who loved abby was absolutely furious he wanted to punch mrs parker and george on the nose he was also having increasing trouble breathing because of the heat dust and pollen and because the chauffeurs were keeping their engines going to enjoy the airconditioning as they waited in the carpark viking who had not forgotten the beauty of abbys figure in a red bodystocking was equally appalled jesus he muttered to blue she looks like michael heseltine in drag joan of arc burnt at the stake did not do more for france than i have for this orchestra hissed abby to the first violins as she passed throw a few faggots round the base then murmured lionel to bill thackery the coleader plenty of those around said bill who was very straight glaring at sonnys claque dominating the third row well done abby you look chumpion lied george having countenanced this transformation he had to support it publicly but was secretly horrified mrs parker and sonny had already mounted the platform vast and tiny a telephone box beside a small snowman they were joined by an electricblue beanpole and the photographers went berserk peggys done it again have to hand it to her the gals got style chorused her friends at a distance abby had a certain splendour like the statue of liberty mrs parker then introduced the new look parker and parker had especially created for abigail rosen abigails coiffeure has been softly styled and highlightened by guiseppe clap clap clap clap went the audience maquillage mrs parker had been practising her french by crystelle rubies by precious armpits mrs parker allowed herself a little joke by braun hope militant molls listening muttered candy abigails geown is designed by myself do a twirl abigail you will all notice the kickpleat clap clap clap clap this is terrible groaned viking foxies going to write a new book of martyrs starting with abby said flora surreptitiously getting her puppet fox from underneath her chair she made him wave at abby who continued to gaze grimly into space not a smile lifting her bloodred lips those in the front rows vulpine mrs parker leered round will notice abigail is wearing peggy my new inhouse fragrance im wearing piggy stage whispered clare reducing the entire viola section to hysterics which were fortunately drowned by the orchestra playing happy birthday peggy mrs parker nodded graciously thenk you thenk you then turning graciously to abby and now maestro will you make music thirtytwo ninion still brooding propped up the bar he had drunk a litre of cider and a large gin and tonic as a chaser he should have been playing that solo then he had a brainwave pushing his way through the crowds he reached the electrician who was doing the fireworks its my birthday he began pathetically my parents were so poor we could never afford fireworks at home touched by this tale the electrician who wanted to get drunk with his mates accepted a tenner and handed the job over to ninion the only person who looked worse than abby was cathie jones her tired redrimmed eyes were as worried as an alsatians above a muzzle scurf from nerves encrusted the prematurely grey roots of her lank coppery hair her tights were mostly darn her makeup thicker than abbys to cover the bruise on her cheek she was so thin that the ghastly primrose dress looked like a handmedown from a much older sister a cheap brooch covering the hole she had torn this afternoon resembled an outsize nipple what a dog said quinton mitchell third horn in disgust no wonder carmines humping lindy cardew blue swung round to land quinton one but just in time abby raised her baton an exercise in weightlifting as her ruby bracelet glittered in the fading sunlight dimitri was just about to draw his bow across the strings when a loud voice said if youre into harcheology turkey is definitely the place thank you very very much it was lindy cardew coming in late blowing discreet kisses at carmine thats im she whispered to her friend you just wait till he blows is trumpet abby shot lindy an absolutely filthy look not lost on any of the audience and brought down her stick buoyed up by a betablocker and several swigs of sherry from miss parrotts hipflask dimitri and his four cellos brought tears to everyones eyes with the beautiful introduction which was followed by the thrilling crashes of the storm abby found it almost impossible to conduct in high heels only the thought that she would land on el creepo stopped her falling into the orchestra it was time for catherine joness cor anglais solo and the instant she started playing the mockery faded on peoples faces she looked as though she was sucking some heavenly nectar out of a bent straw as if an angels hand had fun over her strained tortured face restoring its former beauty even the waitresses stopped washing up glasses to listen to the langourous hauntingly lovely tune no wonder carmine was jealous even abby looked at peace her hand rising and falling in slow motion like a dancers as she smiled down at cathie such enthusiasm was too much for ninion a plague on both you hussies there was a deafening explosion for a terrifying moment people thought it was a bomb then twenty thousand pounds worth of fireworks erupted crash crash crash went roman candles jumping jacks catherine wheels spilling out red white and blue sparks whoosh went the rockets exploding miles into the air lost against a fading turquoise sky including the climax which said happy birthday to peggy parker in red white and blue cathies solo and peter plumptons flute variations were totally obliterated and there were no fireworks left for carmines fanfare and the rousing finale piggy parker was not the only one going ballistic blue was on his feet im going to strangle that focking electrician as he dived for the edge of the platform viking pulled him back wait for the break and well both throttle him i need you to drown benny he added as an afterthought as a ninefoot steinway was wheeled on to the usual grumbling from the first and second violins clare candy flora juno nellie noriko and marythemotherofjustin who had all been taken individually aside and told that benny was playing the concerto just for them waited expectantly cherub who was playing the famous triangle solo in the third movement shook with excitement his triangle swinging from its silver stand like a hangmans noose benny was definitely drunk when he came onto the platform even the lingering sulphur of the fireworks couldnt disguise the wine fumes hed hardly bothered to warm up he just regards this as a breadandbutter concert thought abby furiously twiddles from the orchestra followed by rigidfingered banging from benny had the audience who were all now fanning their sweating faces with their programmes jumping out of their seats marcus put his head in his hands how could anyone play so insensitively and so badly oh god give me a chance at first abby tried to cover up bennys missed entries and fluffed lines then she realized that half the orchestra were ignoring her and following benny others like dimitri blue viking and flora feeling desperately sorry for abby were following her instead the result was almost more contemporary than sonny beam and as benny skipped a few bars whenever things got too difficult everyone was soon jumping around like tom and jerry i played the last page three times muttered viking at the end of the first movement library gave me the wrong concerto said blue grimly ninion by this time had escaped across a little bridge to the opposite bank with another litre of cider and a duck caller so the slow movement despite bennys bashing was accompanied by furious quacking as though donald duck had joined tom and jerry further hassle was provided by the mosquitoes unchecked by the darting swallows who were now attacking players in droves particularly the balder heads of older members of the orchestra finally a huge dragonfly landed like a helicopter on the baldest head that of dimitri quack quack queeack called ninion plaintively from the reeds any giggling by the orchestra was then obliterated by benny crashing into the last movement interspersed by the silver shimmer of cherubs triangle cherub looked so angelic with his blond curls pink cheeks and his excited smile that the audience gazed at him which made a furious benny bash louder than ever at the end abby stormed off catching a fourinch heel in a chair leg and falling off the platform into georges arms let me go she hissed enveloped by his strength and solidarity longing to sob her heart out on one of his wide shoulders the press want a photograph of you and benny said george i do not share that pianists interpretation said abby through gritted teeth nor do i to be honest conceded george who had vowed never to book benny again but lets just get through this evening fortunately the audience whod chatted throughout hadnt noticed a thing wrong and were now looking forward to bubbly and nibbles in the vip tent what is the matter with eldred asked quinton as abby returned and raised the horn section to their feet for a special clap wifes just left him said blue is that all thought he must be upset he was half a tone sharp in that last solo but blue had gone leaping into the crowd like a bloodhound in search of the focking electrician the setting sun balancing on the horizon gilded the huge trees of the park and softened the oxblood stone of rutminster towers house martins dived in and out of the eaves feeding their young in the vip tent the ice had run out all peggys pals expecting bubbly were disappointed to be fobbed off with mulled pimms so looking forward to meeting abigail they all chorused artists dont like to break the mood in the middle of a concert mrs parker was telling them sententiously you will all have the chance of a few words later hum said flora whod been smuggled into the tent by viking i dont know what sort of mood abbyll be in its a terrible concert viking shook his head acoustics are always dire outside unless youre up against a brick wall like the management said dixie scooping up half a dozen asparagus rolls also like the management agreed viking the strings get totally lost thank god said dixie i dont know how you lot got in here said miles beadily but if youre going to crash parties and avail yourself of mrs parkers hospitality you can jolly well stop coffeehousing and mingle with her guests george hungerford is awfully good at mingling observed flora as she watched him pressing the flesh talking to mps lawyers local businessmen shop owners along the high street never stopping long too shy or too busy to want to get caught but making each person feel important and welcome you must come to hp hall and hear the orchestra ill send you a couple of tickets weve got some good dos coming up in the autumn hes sponsor hunting said dixie up to a point said viking hes also bought fifty acres on cowslip hill and wants to build on them my guess is hes greasing palms flora was screwing up courage to talk to george she and abby had been discussing marcuss poverty and his heartbreakingly slow progress over supper last night if i push him the managementll resist sighed abby theyre still pissed off i smuggled you in ill try and introduce him to george said flora the only problem is that marcus is so shy and unpushy hell probably bolt now marcus had joined her and flora could see george getting nearer like most of the men hed removed his dinnerjacket showing a roll of fat over his trouser belt his evening shirt was transparent with sweat his square face red and shiny why on earth did all the women in the orchestra find him sexy and oh god here was benny black curls soaked from the shower cream silk shirt unbuttoned to the waist deciding flora was the most seductive of all the girls hed propositioned benny sidled up how about a leetle deener at my otel noone would mees you if we slope off piss off you disgusting frog said viking coldly benny was about to land viking one but was distracted by the arrival of george mrs parker and lord leatherhead who had been boring mrs parkers guests silly rabbiting on about bottled water good concert well done all of you he said heartily peggy i dont think youve met our latest recruit flora seymour she plays the viola jolly well mrs parker who was even redder in the face than george didnt look remotely interested until lord leatherhead added that floras mother was georgie maguire oh hell thought flora im a large fan of ers said mrs parker in excitement ive got all her records perhaps shed like to visit the store one day we could find her something really outstandin for her next concert thats sweet catching vikings eye flora started to giggle then seeing george glaring at her added quickly i wonder if i could possibly introduce a friend of mine marcus campbellblack beautiful boy thought george looks as though he was born in a dinnerjacket she would go for someone like that are you the son of asked mrs parker skittishly very delighted to receive you marcus winced as her diamonds dug into him ive shot with your father brayed lord leatherhead a very fine shot marcus is a very fine pianist piped up flora no he is she continued ignoring marcuss hands frantically waving for her to stop he was at the academy and he plays like an angel could he audition for you some time mr hungerford or we could send you a tape good idea said lord leatherhead phone me at the office said george then as the warning bells started you lot better get back i ope you will play at one of my soirées at rutminster towers marcus said mrs parker graciously or come to afternoon tea under the walnut tree perhaps your father would like to look in too im sure hed appreciate how much the rso do for young people marcus however had boiled over i havent seen any sign of it he said furiously or you wouldnt have humiliated darling abby by forcing her into that seriously hideous dress then seeing the horror and fury particularly on mrs parkers face added you succeeded in making one of the most beautiful women in the world look like a disgusting old slagheap you should be bloody well ashamed of yourselves and turning on his heel he stumbled out of the tent if your friend wants to get to the top as a soloist an enraged george turned on flora i dont think hes going about it the right way the choir had a good screech and the audience a good chat during the polovtsian dances by which time the sun had set leaving an orange glow on the horizon so noone could read their programmes any more not that it mattered during the pièce de résistance which was only too easy to resist sonnys eternal triangle crash bang wallop plinkety plonk catawaul screech went the orchestra to an increasing crescendo of shifting bottoms and mutterings as people ducked to avoid a night raid of bats yodelayayo carolled the plump young man in lederhosen abbys electricblue shoes were killing her her wrists and shoulders were agony but that was nothing to the ghastly humiliation ahead being hawked round peggy parkers vulgar friends like one of tamberlaines captured war lords amidst the frightful din she could hear cherub ringing cowbells reminding her that tomorrow she was flying out to lucerne and rodney for a month and this nightmare would be over there was only a page left cherub had finished his last little solo then during a dramatic pause when the orchestra were completely silent for three bars lindy cardew could be heard saying loudly to her friend no no no she hasnt got a black one shes got a long furred marmalade one abby flipped swinging round she howled will you flaming well shut up which was fortunately drowned out for many of the audience by the final deafening tutti manic that such a frightful din was over geed up by the claque from soft furnishing who all wanted cherubs telephone number the audience gave the piece a great reception which gave sonny plenty of time to run on and take his composers bow as abby came off the stage clutching redandwhite gladioli and royalblue delphiniums she was accosted by a bbc crew and a horde of press asking her about her new image exactly on cue a mallard no doubt unnerved earlier by ninions duck caller dumped copiously on abbys electricblue bosom whereupon abby laughed for the first time in days and said straight to camera well done duckie thats a distinct improvement the next moment horrified parker minions charged forward to hurry her into the house and sponge her down upstairs crystelle waited ready with a respray before abby met her public the most important part of your evening im terribly sorry i have to distance myself for a few minutes after a concert said abby and dived into mrs parkers bathroom locking the door on the way to the long gallery to dump her viola flora flexed her aching back and wondered what had become of marcus hed probably cooked all their geese with the management but how brave and wonderful he had been hearing a kerfuffle flora edged forward round the corner blue had got hold of ninion and hung him by his white dinnerjacket on a row of pegs you snivelling little bastard he hissed glaring into ninions terrified blinking eyes then he hit him very hard across the face with the back of his hand what did you do that for bleated ninion swinging helplessly dont you ever do anything like that to cathie jones again youre not fit to lick her boots blue was about to hit ninion again when george arrived clicking his fingers for two heavies who pulled him off thats enough snapped george throw him in the river to cool him down he told the heavies and i want you in my office first thing on monday morning ninion what was all that about whispered flora to miss parrott brass have a problem when its humid sighed miss parrott righting her mauve beehive in the mirror then seeing the sceptical expression on floras face added blue has rather a soft spot for cathie jones and i think hes upset carmine made her go home before the interval knickers was in a further twist retrieving his white dinnerjacket from francis to wear at the party he found it covered in black boot polish francis would lose his job at this rate benny was even more upset having decided to plump for second best he couldnt find nellie the nympho anywhere yodellayayo came an ecstatic cry from the shrubbery someones dropped a pair of lederhosen sniffed fat isobel who was crying because she wouldnt see viking for a month im going to miss you lady c dixie was telling clare in that ghastly glaswegian accent which had become music to her ears the moors will be purple with heather daddys going up to scotland for the th said clare i could go with him then we could meet we certainly could said dixie looking much happier piss off you disgusting frog he added as benny slid a too high hand round clares waist peter plumpton the first flute being small always got drunk very quickly putti putti putti he cried as he advanced with an outstretched hand on a group of reconstitutedstone cherubs miss parrott was sharing a log a bottle of white and a plate of dover sole and lobster poached in sauterne with dimitri that opening to william tell was the loveliest thing ayve ever heard she was telling him your solo in wrists piano concerto was perfect confided noriko three agents have tried to sign me up im going to be the next evelyn glennie giggled cherub squeezing her little hand meanwhile favoured customers who hadnt heard abby yelling at lindy cardew were congratulating peggy parker who hadnt either on the graciousness of the occasion abigail will be deown shortly promised mrs parker regally mrs parkers bathroom had a dressingroom mirror with lights going round in a semicircle watching the moths helplessly smashing their wings and bodies against the burning bulbs abby gave a sob it was just like her and the rso out of the window she could see members of her orchestra chucking the stuff down their throats no doubt laughing themselves sick to see her so humiliated she jumped at a banging on the door were waiting called crystelle just a sec shouted abby turning on the shower at home having checked her sleeping children and paid the babysitter out of her pathetic housekeeping allowance cathie jones climbed wearily upstairs she was too tired to eat gazing out of her bedroom at the stars she started to cry then not wanting to wake the children fished in her skirt pocket for a tissue and found a piece of paper on which someone had scrawled the words darling cathie thou art fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars five minutes later abby stalked out into the garden and as usual everyone fell silent she had changed back into her red vest and bicycle shorts her hair was slicked back and still dripping her makeup totally washed off there was a long long pause what the fuck snarled george huge menacing he bore down on her get bluddy oopstairs and back into that dress abby had never seen anyone angrier except perhaps mrs parker whats happened to your beautiful geown she screeched i left it and the shoes on your bed and what about those rubies theyre on your dressingtable said abby then waving an ironic hand at the rso who were now filling their faces with dover sole and lobster why should i need rubies when my orchestra are my jewels thirtythree the month of august was traditionally a holiday for the rso all in all abby got a rotten endofterm report an enraged mrs parker was threatening to withdraw her promised one hundred thousand pounds and in cahoots with miles and a horrified canon airlie who had both heard abby shouting at lindy cardew were agitating for her dismissal george fired off a written warning about consistently subversive behaviour pointing out that abby had only seven months left on her contract abby promptly tore up his letter she should have spent august relaxing and in the light of her disastrous conducting career seriously attempting to play the violin again the physio and the london specialist both said there was nothing more they could do the block was in abbys head but abby couldnt bring herself to try terrified her genius had deserted her and after her strad any violin would be a letdown she had hoped to spend august in lucerne enjoying giselas cooking and having her feathers unruffled by rodney he appeared to have made an excellent recovery from his heart attack and was now teaching himself the cello playing with great vigour and a lot of wrong notes in lucerne as in england the heatwave showed no signs of abating and had already singed the woods around the lake whose level had dropped more than a foot two days after her arrival abby stretched out in an orange bikini lake water drying on her darkening gold body despite the heat she and rodney had just polished off the palest green avocado mousse and an exquisite fish salad which gisela had made for lunch plus a bottle of pouillyfumé abby was now miseryeating her way through a bowl of figs her big white teeth tearing at the scarlet flesh from the nearby shadow of a blue striped umbrella rodney sat drinking armagnac puffing at a large cigar and listening as he had done since she arrived he was very distressed to see her so unhappy which of my naughty boys is causing you the most bother they all hate me moaned abby dixie randy that vile carmine quinton el creepo beneath his smarmy manner davie buckle lionel viking most of all are you apologizing enough darling if you start with the wrong beat if you show three instead of four you must say its my fault thats weakness stormed abby basically they hate taking orders from a woman right and weve got such terrific stuff coming up i told you about fanny mendelssohn and winifred trapp you dont want too much of that rodney tipped his ash on the parched yellow grass celebrating women in the arts demanded abby lot better places to celebrate them then seeing the outrage on abbys face added hurriedly you know i adore your sex but i dont feel theyre at their best composing music thats because youve never bothered to listen to them christ its hot angrily abby peeled off her bikini top and i bet theyd have delivered on time if any one had really appreciated their music not like boris levitsky were recording rachels requiem next season and not a squeak out of boris and i gotta learn the wretched thing wasnt viking a friend of boriss always she returns to viking thought rodney feeling his cock stir as he glanced at the beautiful breasts only slightly less golden than the rest of her body not really a friend he said vikings spoilt he and boris were in spiky competition over who could pull the best girls lionels your main problem one cant operate if the leaders against one im afraid hell always be a thorn in your deliciously firm young flesh darling not so young any more grumbled abby ill be twentynine in october and im going to be seventynine in october dont be a sillybilly abby sat up swinging her legs sideways i wish all men were like you im not that different from the rest of them stretching out a warm hand as though he was testing a peach rodney gently fingered her breast abby gasped amazed at the sudden quivering warmth between her legs ii see you as the grandfather i never really had she stammered really rodney raised a mocking eyebrow as his thumb caressed a rapidly hardening nipple wheres gisela whispered abby making crabapple jelly artists are oblivious when they are in the process of creation abby shut her eyes as the languid practised caress continued youre the one turning me to jelly dyou really want me rodney my child a slow burn doesnt mean the flame isnt poised to singe the ceiling oh christ exploded abby as unwelcome as the bones singing in ezekiel the white cordless telephone rang it was flora youre not the only one in the doghouse abby hitler hungerford says hell tear up boriss contract if he doesnt deliver on september and he wants boris to pay back the twothousandpound advance boris is in hysterics he hasnt got two pence let alone two grand ive asked him to stay i hope you dont mind perhaps marcus and i can prod him into action and at least copy the stuff out for him abby looked down at rodneys hand wrinkled covered in liverspots yet making it almost impossible for her to think rationally boris can sleep in the attic bedroom she glanced sideways at rodneys watch ill try and get the four oclock plane rodney sighed as she switched off the telephone probably just as well darling tell boris to give lionel a long flashy but not too difficult solo to keep him quiet haydn said you could do anything with musicians if you gave them the chance to show off he was sad to see abby go but quite relieved he wanted to learn the cello part of don quixote and he didnt think he could have coped with a month of such obsessive introspection noone could have been more obsessively introspective than boris abby reached home before he did and was pleased to see her little faded redbrick cottage peering out of the yellowing woods the fox cub now seeking refuge from the hunting season you dont think boris has topped himself said a worried flora we expressed him some cash for his train fare and a taxi boris arrived with the first stars having drunk his taxi fare on the train and drenched himself falling into the lake on his stumbling walk from the station his only luggage was a bulging waitrose carrier bag of which flora speedily relieved him have you brought us some goodies i vish inside frantically scrawled on a mass of manuscript paper were the endless abandoned beginnings of rachels requiem i cannot write i cannot pay back the rso i cannot pay astrid my lovely au pair so she has taken the cheeldren to rachels parents who think me murderer anyway for one month to geeve me peace to write his upended dark curls were streaked with grey his eyes were black caverns he was shaking uncontrollably but after a very hot bath and a change into marcuss sweatshirt and jeans which now fitted his formerly stocky body boris had cheered up enough to tuck into a large steak french beans and mashed potato cooked by marcus and was soon pouring out his troubles and a great deal of red wine schumann say requiem is a thing one writes for oneself i shall not leeve long boris coated a piece of steak with mustard i am like mozart someone vill have to finish vork for me flora who had scriabin on her knee removing goosegrass burrs out of his plumy white tail picked up a spoon and helped herself to some french beans who could finish it for you she asked innocently edith spink or perhaps sonny parker suggested marcus equally innocently never boris crashed his hand down on the kitchen table spilling his halfpint of red wine ovair my dead buddy its going to be dead anyway giggled flora youll be twanging a harp on a cloud beside rachel flora reproved marcus mopping up the wine with a piece of kitchen roll scriabins proximity was making his eyes water i listened to john tavener at the proms last night flora ignored boriss scowl it hardly left the note of d you can be less boring than that how far have you got asked abby i sketch most of it in the head but i am so tired vorking sixteen hours a day then as flora played an imaginary violin moaned i am so disappointed and frustrated at nonperformance of my vork how can they perform it when you dont write anything but rude postcards to edith spink said flora returning to the french beans are you still not having singers asked marcus trying to lead the conversation into less thorny paths boris nodded his shaggy head britten write requiem to his parents wizout singers i ate singers i hate musicians sighed abby youve licked that spoon flora why dont we dispense with them as well then we could have sixty minutes of silence said flora jolly peaceful and much cheaper the arts council would find it very meaningful added marcus you all joke grumbled boris scooping up the rest of the mashed potato and adding an ounce of butter none of you realize not lear nor oepidus nor amlet suffer like i do im so vorried im written out course youre not said flora youll feel better after a good nights sleep and no bottles of red under the bed well all help you tomorrow i go on vagon said boris refilling his glass because marcus stayed at home to practise and give piano lessons while flora and abby left the cottage to work it was assumed that he had the time to shop cook unload the dishwasher transfer dripping underwear from washingmachine to dryer feed the cats change duvets let in plumbers and electricians and often pay for them too predictably the lions share of helping boris fell to him thus the following morning it was flora who read out the nine sections of the mass so marcus could copy them down and boris could later tick off each section as he finished it dies irae read flora who was wandering round the kitchen with scriabin a purring blackandwhite ruff round her neck thats a joke for a start rachel was such a crosspatch she gave boris months and years of irae always making him smoke outside and not putting salt in anything except wounds next marcus looked up rex tremendae what a terrific name for a dog got that agnus dei flora giggled sounds like doris days sister doris was seriously kind to dogs and filled her house and the annexe with strays i wish we could have a dog well you cant clad only in her bikini brahms second symphony under her arm abby was on her way out to the garden what are you doing she asked crossly as she went through the livingroom and found boris sitting on one of her pale beige habitat sofas with manuscript paper several pencils and erasers on an uncomfortably low table in front of him im thinking what to put said boris sulkily its august and the birds are mute from feeding their young as i am zee muse as desert me we are not a muse murmured flora to marcus rodney suggested you wrote a long easy solo for lionel to keep him quiet suggested abby i ate lionel little vanker i will make eet impossibly deeficult cheered at the prospect of lionel on the rack boris started to scribble down notes but having been bawled out by abby for spilling a sneaked glass of red wine over her new yellow rushmatting he retreated sulkily to marcuss studio here he worked feverishly sometimes stopping to discuss ideas with marcus working out details on the piano together singing phrases which marcus who had absolute pitch could take down like shorthand but marcuss main task was emptying wastepaper baskets of scrumpledup paper the progress was desperately slow boris spent a lot of time ringing astrid ostensibly to check on the children such a good father sighed abby a week later boris had struggled to the end of the dies irae and rex tremendae and flora and marcus were copying them out in the garden helped by the kittens who kept jumping on top of the manuscript paper and shooting their black pens all over the place probably improving it muttered flora talk about slav labour and how many times do i have to tell you not to clean up after abby youre too nice to her they were harvesting in the field beyond the front gate huge gold blocks rising like ingots out of the platinumblond grass but suddenly over the roar of the huge combine flora and marcus heard boris tapping out a tune on the piano rising fourths and fifths tentative but haunting he was playing it again changing it slightly shoving in a few discords then he played the first version marcus and flora looked at each other oh please dont spoil it they said in unison as boris introduced an interrupted cadence and started messing around with the tempo we must tell him flora leapt to her feet he told us not to disturb him we should before he buggers it up write it down that is the most glorious glorious tune cried flora pushing open the door of marcuss once immaculate studio play it again marcus followed removing boriss wine glass from the top of the steinway which was already covered in drink rings then scribbling down the notes on a piece of manuscript paper as he finished he said in ecstasy its miraculous boris boris shook his head and retrieving his glass filled it up its too good too little too nice too predictable youre crazy boris interrupted abby who had heard that last version its so beautiful stunning flora picked up the piece of manuscript paper and sang the tune lifting the hair on the back of everyones necks thats it rachels lament said marcus sitting down and playing it on the piano abby fingered the curves of boriss violin never more longing to join in please make it a horn solo for viking she begged viking wouldnt sentimentalize it boris looked sulky it is too sweet for my rachel and snatching the page he tore it into little pieces and stormed off into the wood not returning until nightfall all the same the composition of such a beautiful tune unleashed something in boris the next day although he grumbled every time the others sang it he kept working feverishly sixteen hours on the trot increasingly encouraged by what he had produced wading through the rapids clinging to one steppingstone after another until by the last evening of the third week he had written six out of nine sections it was still so hot they had all the cottage windows open abby was upstairs working on the brahms second symphony which the rso were playing their first week back flora was copying out the agnus dei in the kitchen and also watching a prom production of götterdammerung on television fulminating because brünnhilde had just jumped siegfrieds horse into the funeral pyre bloody bitch ill report her to the rspca she had turned down the sound because marcus who had a recital in the north of england the next day was practising schumanns scenes from childhood even on the old sittingroom upright it sounded exquisite and marcus had hardly had any chance recently to play anything except boriss stuff hes the most talented of all of us thought flora guiltily and hes the one who makes all the sacrifices marcus had reached a little piece called by the fireside when boris burst in tears streaming down his anguished face rachel play that very last time i see her she too have recital next day he sobbed i pull her off pianostool in middle and we made love seizing floras yellow sarong from the floor he wiped his eyes and blew his nose marcus leapt up in horror ill stop boris im dreadfully sorry no no go on play it on steinway it ees catharsis marcus was not very happy with his recital he drove all the way to a small lancashire mining town noone welcomed him except the caretaker there were thirty people in the audience who clapped him politely afterwards a secretary paid him one hundred pounds the whole trip cost him almost as much in petrol as he drove on the following day to see his grandmother in cheshire whod been hit by lloyds and her sixth husband and who never stopped grumbling about the small allowance given to her by rupert marcus stayed a couple of nights trying to cheer her up but depressing himself realizing how desperately he missed his father and everyone at penscombe returning to woodbine cottage in the early evening he found the usual chaos the washingup machine was full and unloaded the sink full of mugs glasses and plates in the fridge there was no milk half a yoghurt some apricotandnut pâté and half a grapefruit there was also no bread tapes and cds lay out of their cases like loose change on the sittingroom carpet the plants had wilted noone had emptied the dustbin finding a squirming sea of maggots when he opened the lid marcus closed it quickly the cats were weaving round his legs reproachfully rejecting a bowl of whiskas covered in flies eggs marcus wanted to yell at someone but the place was deserted he had just finished straightening things out and was gasping for breath as he staggered round the house with a wateringcan when the others rolled back from the pub in total euphoria weve had a brilliant few days cried flora boris has finished except for the orchestration you did the trick playing the schumann the other night boris thumped marcus on the back so that the wateringcan missed a pot of geraniums and spilled all over the sittingroom table that night i dream my rachel forgive me i weave by the fireside into lachrymosa and into rachels lament which reappears again as the most ravishing solo in the libera me at the end its stunning sighed abby how did you get on marcus asked flora getting a bottle of white wine out of a carrier bag not brilliant many people not a lot but at least they paid me ah well thats good then flora picked up the corkscrew if youre not too tired asked abby perhaps you could play us what boris has written they were all so happy he couldnt shout at them noone could be bothered to stagger over to marcuss studio besides he was fed up with the drink rings on the steinway so flora lit one turquoise candle and one blue and put them in the candleholders on the old upright their soft light flickered on marcuss face which gradually grew less pinched and strained as he miraculously deciphered boriss scrawl his fingers moving with increasing assurance over the sticky yellow keys meanwhile flora on the viola and boris on the fiddle when he wasnt reaching for his pencil to scribble some change or sobbing his heart out joined in harmonizing as they went often the music was dense and hideously discordant particularly when boris muddled through lionels appallingly demanding solo muttering happily thisll fix him zee vanker but often some magical tune or cadence would emerge and marcus would pause and shake his head in wonder this is incredible boris after the beautiful solo of rachels lament had faded softly away the requiem ended most uncharacteristically with a joyous fanfare and trumpets sound for rachel on zee uzzer side said boris wiping his eyes the next moment utterly exhausted but triumphant the three of them collapsed in each others arms youve done it youve done it no you play zee schumann marcus you deed it said boris after zat i produce in trance like handels messiah levitskys messier giggled flora if were going to compare handwriting and crossing out as marcus started to play the lachrymosa again really making it sing boris raised his glass to abby who was huddled on the sofa clutching sibelius i zank you abby for giving us roof over the head were the three tenants announced flora shimmering down a glissando with a flourish of her bow eat your hearts out placido luciano and josé glancing round marcus realized abbys shoulders were shaking whats the matter he jumped to his feet abby looked up her face crumpled and soaked with tears youre all so lucky and dropping sibelius on the carpet she ran out into the garden shes pissed and boris has been getting too much attention recently leave her said flora i cheer her up boris went towards the french windows i think you should have a bath first said flora i dont believe youve touched a bar of soap for a fortnight putting the kettle on marcus realized he hadnt eaten all day there didnt seem any point starting when he took out a cup of coffee to abby in the garden all the daisies that had shrivelled on the parched yellow lawn seemed to have sprung up in the starcovered sky boris was sitting on the old white bench under the greengage tree with his arm round abby you must guest more he was telling her when i conduct the london met or the new world the musicians adore me because they ate rannaldini so much dont cry my darling i vill dedicate requiem to you thirtyfour boris had cracked the requiem now as flora said he had only to add the rough edges the next morning having bathed at length and washed his hair in marcuss shampoo and put on yet another pair of marcuss boxer shorts he took the draft into the garden looking handsomer than most dawns as he sat in a deckchair eating dried apricots all great artists sacrifice the emotions and lives of those around them to further the interests of their art in a mood to be expansive boris realized he had pushed marcus too far you are sad im ok i wish my father would forgive me and i could see taggie and tab and the kids again i wish my mother wasnt married to that shit rannaldini and i wish my career wasnt going backwards boriss face softened i will write a very good piano part into the requiem not much point i was so rude to old mother parker george hungerfordll never let me over the rso threshold again markie it was abby calling from the kitchen looking radiant in a new scarlet bikini she had also washed her hair and was reeking of amarige i cant open this jar of coffee she said as marcus went inside my grip still isnt right isnt it a beautiful day forecast says rain marcus said handing back the jar out of the window he could see huge white clouds gleaming like arctic cliffs in the sunshine banking up beyond the wood god we could use it oh markie suddenly abby looked wildly excited dyou think boris fancies me it was the question hed been dreading im sure oh darling markie abby hugged him giving him the cruel benefit of her hot scented nearly naked body youre the little brother i never had hearing the postvan rattling over the dry stones up the lane marcus had an excuse to wriggle free before she felt the frantic hammering of his heart he was absurdly pleased to get a letter from the musical society in lancashire dear mr black yours was the first concert our society has ever had we all enjoyed it very much indeed we would like to thank you and take the opportunity of booking you again next year boris had a letter from astrid i havent ring her since vendesday because of vork said boris mortified i vill ring her once i get to end of sanctus at least i can pay her now abbys good mood evaporated when she read a postcard with a photograph of a donkey on the back which had arrived from viking to flora saying how much he was looking forward to seeing her and that he hoped lappassionata had recovered from her strop conscious of a froideur despite the heat flora decided to make herself scarce she was fed up with copying black dots she wanted to buy a new dress and get her hair cut and tried to persuade marcus to go into rutminster with her i ought to practise and theres still a mass of copying to do protested boris can i borrow your car marcus said flora left alone with abby and boris marcus felt increasingly claustrophobic as abby stretched out on the grass in her bikini and pretended to make notes on the huge score of brahms second symphony boris flat stomached and lean hipped now hed lost so much weight his sallow skin turning a smooth dark brown pretended to orchestrate the sanctus hes absolutely gorgeous abby gazed at boris through splayed fingers it was lovely that he was dedicating the requiem to her imagine her biog not only was abigail rosen the paganini and the toscanini of her age but also boris levitskys immortal beloved rodneys caresses had made her aware of how desperately she needed a man sheet i ave run out of manuscript paper boris glanced down at the laboriously copying marcus you got any more this is my last page and floras taken the car wailed abby i wonder whos got some certainly not the celtic mafia said abby with a sniff then exchanging a languorous eyemeet with boris volunteered ill call old henry marcus was passionately relieved to escape the busstop was only half a mile away if he took a short cut through the woods twenty yards down the track he turned round to find abby hovering at the gate just wanted to check youve got your inhaler she had the grace to blush please take it slowly just to make sure ive really gone thought marcus bitterly i must ring astrid thought boris as he put down the orchestrated sanctus but on his way to the house he passed abby poring over lionels impossibly difficult violin solo which marcus had just copied out and left on the garden bench god this is wonderful if only i could play it you vill said boris i used to be a teacher i taught marcus i vill help you to play again you take the bow in this hand boris kissed her fingers you take the violin in this one he picked up her left hand examining the palm such a strong fate line so much passion slowly he ran his tongue along her heart line abby shivered with excitement not least because shed got all the feeling back she and boris were exactly the same height for a second he gazed at her then buried his lips in her scented neck below the left jawbone this ees where you put your violin he whispered i weel make you bettair as he kissed her lips he was enchanted by the wild enthusiasm of her response rain brought back the wild flowers the butterflies and viking oneill to rutminster he had enjoyed his time in dublin he had recorded the strauss horn concertos played chamber music romped with his numerous nephews and nieces gossiped to his mother until four in the morning looked up old girlfriends and drinking pals he had also acquired a secondhand bmw convertible into which he had transferred the don juan horn call but by the end of three and a half weeks he had had enough he lusted after flora about whom hed had a lovely erotic dream last night but which had faded like a rainbow when he tried to retain it and then there was abby he had had a letter from rodney darling boy beneath that golden exterior you have a heart of gold please be kinder to abby she is so isolated and sad genius should be pruned but also sunned and fertilized i suspect she analyses far too much and should let her instincts take over if you as leader of the pack eased up on her a little the boys and girls would follow suit dear me i miss you all so much viking wondered about being taken over by abbys instincts he didnt really fancy her she was too overbearing too selfcentred too troublesome but she irritated him all the time like a sharp piece of apple lodged in his teeth the downpour stopped as he approached rutminster pausing in a lane of traffic he noticed harebells glinting like amethysts in the verge and meadow browns and common blues dancing ecstatically over the drenched fields a red admiral had also upended itself on the top of a thistle avoiding the prickles as it sucked the sweetness from the mauve flower with abby youd have to accept prickles and all odd to have a traffic jam on this road then he realized all the drivers were slowing down to gaze at a beautiful girl at the busstop her long blond hair and faded denim dress seemed to echo the gold wheat fields and the blue of the sky with her were a boy and a girl both very dark haired pale and sloeeyed must be the childbride of some rich arab thought viking dismissively pulling up he smiled and offered her a lift the girl brightened viking was very brown his lions mane bleached in the last three weeks hed got a little more sleep than usual such an attractive man with his arm round such an adorable dog surely couldnt be an abducter you know she consulted a letter the vay to voodbine cottage i go right past the door hop in over you go nugent leaping out viking gathered up a pile of scores paperbacks cds and a big bag of duty free and dumped them in the boot as the big black dog jumped obediently into the back seat he loves kids he added as he opened the back door for the two pale dubiouslooking children and ushered the heavenly blonde into the passenger seat then raising two fingers at the furiously jealous crescendo of car horns behind him he drove off with a retaliatory flourish from don juan my names viking mines astrid they gazed at each other in delight who are you going to see boris levitsky at woodbine cottage viking was horrified at the idea of boris hanging round flora and abby exuding russian machismo he finish requiem said astrid in her lilting singsong voice he have crisis someone called george wanted boris to pay money back vikings opinion of george hungerford rocketed boris dedicate requiem to me went on astrid happily he say eet almost over we stay weeth his inlaws horrible people astrid lowered her voice marmite sandwich for supper salad viz no dressing feenish up every bit only childrens television bed by eight so we decided to surprise boris the two children soon cheered up when viking stopped and bought them icelollies travellers joy falling in creamy drifts stroked the top of the car the rain had polished the dusty trees viking breathed in a smell of wet earth and moulding leaves as he splashed through the puddles up the rough track are we nearly there asked astrid as nugent began to sniff excitedly nearly said viking driving as carefully as possible over the stones to enable astrid to apply pale pink lipstick to her delicious mouth you look gorgeous he added wasted on that russian i miss heem so much oh what a pretty leetle ouse exclaimed astrid as the car drew to a halt getting out viking put her hand on nugents collar just hang onto my dog till i see whos in hes not safe with cats sauntering up the lichened path viking found the pale green front door locked ill check round the back in the garden he found abby and boris asleep lying naked in each others arms wonder at abbys amazing body rage at what shed clearly been doing with it gave way to consternation that boriss children mustnt catch him like this alas marcuss car had conked out on the way home and flora meeting a returning marcus and the cats had walked back through the woods with them as they came through the back gate mr nugent had ducked out of his collar and joined his master suddenly seeing the two kittens he hurtled across the lawn in a frenzy of barking sending both cats scuttling up the horsechestnut tree rudely awoken abby and boris groped for their clothes boris hadnt quite pulled up marcuss boxer shorts when astrid appeared round the corner but a huge smile spread across his face astrid oh my astrid he cried running slipping across the lawn with arms outstretched you have come to me ow i have meesed you you avent meesed me at all screamed astrid sizing up the situation you peeg you absolute peeg and she slapped boris very hard across his face my darling vy you do that boris clutched his cheek i finish my requiem abby and i just embrace for celebration then turning most unflatteringly to abby said tell astrid it was nuzzing seems to have been a good deal of nuzzling observed flora oh do shut up nugent you peeg repeated astrid and i dont want requiem dedicate to me bursting into tears she ran back to the car i do see her point said viking coolly i was just returning your kids boris here they are as boris was safely covered now he drew the two children round onto the lawn and as astrid hasnt had a day off for a month i thought id take her on a jaunt no roared boris but viking was too quick for him whistling to a reluctant nugent while sprinting back to the car he jumped in beside a stillsobbing astrid and reversed down the lane to the victorious accompaniment of don juans horn call boris was demented run after my astrid tell her it was a moment of euphoria he beseeched abby i love her and more important i cannot afford to lose a wonderful nanny for keeds dont be such a shit boris said marcus putting an arm round abbys heaving shoulders everyone ees against me said boris and stormed off to the bordello abby was livid what was the point of being the immortal beloved if you had to share the honour with a swedish au pair and for someone who delayed for ever when producing music boris had proved disappointingly precipitous when it came to making love twenty minutes later boris was back drenched again finding the bordello locked he had hammered on the door until astrid had poured a bucket of water over him he had then hovered in the bushes until viking emerged to check he had gone and knocked out one of vikings front teeth i hope he suffer he wont its always being knocked out its only crowned said flora boris proceeded to tear up the horn solo of rachels lament bloody hell i spent all yesterday copying that out grumbled flora shuddering at the increase in maggots as she retrieved the page from the bin nor was she very pleased herself boris had promised to dedicate the requiem to her and shed spent far too much on a pair of new blackwatchtartan dungarees for vikings return and now hed shoved off with astrid the astrologers had been absolutely right that jupiter bringer of jollity was about to be rammed by a comet boris was now looking helplessly at his children who were trying to coax down scriabin and sibelius vot would you like for supper oh marcusll find them something said abby marcus will not said flora catching sight of his stricken face marcus and i are off to see four veddings and a funeral appassionata third movement thirtyfive the first rehearsal of rachels requiem took place on the afternoon of the rsos first day back at work expecting to be bored rigid the musicians trailed in weighed down by sweets knitting magazines even computer games ayd take a good book advised miss parrott id take a library said viking who had had his front tooth put back but was secretly incensed that rachels lament had been given to the cor anglais carmine was livid that his wife was going to play it and would be around spying on him his first week back simon painshaw and peter plumpton were also livid they hadnt been given the big solo as promised eldred had also been promised it but was too upset to mind his wife hadnt come back and after four and a half weeks respite he would have to endure hilarys scorn and sighs once more francis the good loser was also fed up he had mislaid the cup of coffee and the doughnut hed bought at the buffet which in fact had been nicked by the first bassoon known as jerry the joker who was now sitting innocently at his desk heard the latest viola joke he said to steve the union rep who was his second bassoon if youre driving down a hill and your brakes fail who dyou hit a viola player or a conductor dunno said steve the conductor said jerry business before pleasure too right said steve as abby marched in looking tightlipped and embattled immediately like a great aviary the rso launched into a frenzy of tuning up determined to stand no nonsense abby asked the eternally goodnatured charlton handsome to move the horns upstage excuse me maestro drawled viking is that a good idea why not said abby irritably if were too far away you wont be able to follow us abbys explosion was averted by the librarian running in here are the parts for the cor anglais and the piccolo well have the rest of the woodwind parts by the break why bother said hilary nastily shooting her a withering glance abby opened the score she was relieved that boris was still too angry with viking to show up she could have done with his support but composers tended to shoot themselves at first rehearsals because their music sightread sounded so terrible quiet please abby looked round at the orchestra spread out like enemy snipers in the forest even miss parrotts harp reared up like a chesscastle waiting to whizz across the board and take her abby took a deep breath we are about to play the most beautiful piece of music probably of the entire twentieth century it is a requiem written in memory of boriss young incredibly talented wife who committed suicide lucky boris what was his secret sneered carmine jones cathie jones whod gone white as she digested the importance and extreme complexity of her solo now flushed scarlet with mortification you basstard carmine blue was on his feet only cathies anguished terrified glance stopped him hitting carmine across the stage whose incredibly talented wife committed suicide in repeated abby firmly you must have identified with that simpered hilary dont be a bitch called out flora this is a masterpiece rankandfile viola players were not supposed to express opinions flora was getting much too uppity hilary scowled at her tell us about your famous mother flawless said dixie putting down his tax returns why isnt boris conducting this grumbled juno we used to have schnappsbreaks every halfhour said nellie wistfully dyou remember the time he gave us miniatures of brandy before we recorded mahler one and we got through it in an hour with no retakes i loved boris sighed juno youll have to put up with me snapped abby give us an a simon lets get started after a month off the orchestra were very rusty fingers and lips couldnt be trusted effing and blinding under their breath they began ploughing through the dies irae jerry the joker played god save the queen on his bassoon to see if abby noticed i heard you get out jerry she shouted as a section leader youre supposed to set a good example what a frightful piece of music this is sighed dixie cheer up said jerry going out grinning and licking doughnut sugar off his fingers youll only have to play it once were recording it abby who was battling for at least four performances as well yelled after him but not till the middle of october to give you the time to digest the complexities and puke them all up again called out randy abby tried another tack youve got to familiarize yourself with it to love it she pleaded in when they first rehearsed prokofievs scythian suite the orchestra raised their eyes to heaven and started to yawn ostentatiously scythian suite persisted abby one of the cellists said to the conductor just because i have a wife who is sick and three kids to support why must i be forced to endure such hell musicians have always resisted innovation if you know what i mean thats the trouble said carmine rudely none of us know what you do mean musicians dont want to be lectured said davie buckle starting another game of patience on top of his drums they want to play the concert then go out get pissed and have a curry the orchestra fell about it was time for cathie to play rachels lament for the first time initially just as an extended echo in the lachrymosa then leading up to the long final solo in the libera me surely they must realize how beautiful it is prayed abby but cathie was so nervous so exhausted at the end of the school holidays and so conscious of carmines angry little red brakelight eyes boring into her that she made a complete hash of it gee you screwed up on that one said abby in disappointment after the third botched attempt and leapt down to talk to cathie if she fluffed the lachrymosa how the hell was she going to cope with the libera me i thought boris was giving the big solo to viking whispered dixie boris has changed his total lack of tune whispered back randy evidently boris is knocking off his au pair and vikings nicked her but only after viking caught boris in flagrante with a wicked smile spread over randys face as he lowered his voice even more you gotta be joking dixie looked at abby his eyes on stalks then immediately turning to his second trombone did you know that boris is bonking soon the story was whizzing around the orchestra like starlings alighting on different trees at dusk what are you reading flawless asked viking sohrab and rustram snapped flora who hadnt forgiven viking its about much more heroic men than you lot someone should write a poem called so bad on rostrum thats not funny if you hadnt jumped on astrid youd be playing that solo as they struggled for another ten minutes abby felt utterly superfluous the orchestra were far too busy sightreading to look at her where the fuck are we viking asked blue as resounding crashes twangs and shrieks rent the air two bars to go ill bring you in abby called a halt that was terrible it would help if you beat a little more clearly called out juno abby ignored her the next bit is really sad abby attempted a weak joke could you play it i guess as lionel looks lionel was furious confronted by a series of glissandos and teethgritting shrieks achieved by drawing the side of the bow down the strings he pretended to cry i cannot bear it he said putting his head carefully in his hands so as not to disturb the lustrous blowdried waves my string players have dedicated their lives to producing a beautiful sound abby raised an eyebrow and they are forced to make fools of themselves playing this junk lionel was acting up because over the page he had discovered the long solo boris had deliberately made difficult for him which was only accompanied by the basses compelled to tackle it he pretended to be fooling around and deliberately making the most ghastly cock up youre not trying raged abby beyond any awareness that it was below the belt to bawl out a leader in front of his orchestra the rso brightened at the prospect of a screaming match its unplayable said lionel flatly dont be such a goddamn wimp you only say that maestro furiously hilary leapt to the defence of her beloved because theres no way you could ever play it putting down the selected poems of matthew arnold flora said calmly boris used to play the violin in an orchestra hes perfectly aware of its limitations and capabilities you hold your tongue young lady said hilary furiously its impossible unplayable junk intoned lionel it is not screamed abby it fucking well is fucking isnt jibbering with rage abby leapt from the rostrum snatched lionels fiddle and played the solo absolutely perfectly there was a stunned stunned silence long enough to play a bruckner symphony the musicians looked at abby in amazement but not in nearly as much amazement as abby looked at lionels violin as she handed it back flora roused out of her habitual cool rushed forward sending a musicstand and its music flying oh abby she said in a choked voice dont you realize what this means its come back you can play again oh abby and the whole orchestra except lionel hilary juno and carmine stood up and cheered abby looked utterly shellshocked thank you everyone thats it for today well start with the brahms violin concerto first thing after lunch tomorrow she said ending the rehearsal twenty minutes early and emerging from the dark inferno of boris levitsky into the sunshine flora brought a couple of bottles of muscadet back to woodbine cottage and she and abby celebrated with marcus abby was still shellshocked i cannot believe it im sure it was a fluke did it really sound ok she begged flora over and over again course it did said flora and that miraculous bloodcurdling wonderful sound couldnt have come from anyone else play something now pleaded marcus picking up abbys coat and hanging it up in the hall just to convince yourself i want to hear it too i darent not yet i dont want to tempt providence and i dont want any more to drink abby put her hand over her glass i gotta work i dont know why you bother grumbled flora topping up her own glass after the way those pigs treat you just walk out and go back to reducing the whole world to orgasm on the violin come on lets get pissed but abby refused desperate to be alone she disappeared to her room to mug up the brahms concerto it was the last piece she had done before she had cut her wrist it would be unendurable not to be playing it tomorrow perhaps a miracle had happened and she could return to the violin but she still hated giving up the rso without a fight she couldnt concentrate every note remembered was anguish throwing open her bedroom window which looked on to the front garden she disturbed a swarm of peacock butterflies gorging themselves on the buddleia was it proverbial vanity which made them match their rustandpurple wings so perfectly to the pale purple flowers thistledown floated through the air the fields of stubble platinumblond in the morning sunshine were now redgold after the rain the white trumpets of the convolvulus rioting along the hedgerow reminded her of her brass section she could smell frying garlic and onions marcus must be cooking supper banging pans after all that muscadet he had been so kind when boris had humiliated her she must find him work then everything was forgotten as through the dusk she heard viking the ultimate peacock practising idling around with rachels lament the sound carrying across the still lake oh god he should be playing the solo it would be tragic if lionel persuaded george to drop the requiem lionel was also poisoning the orchestra against her how she longed to follow the path of meadowsweet down the stream and ask vikings advice maria kusak who was playing the brahms violin concerto was yet another shepherd denston artist booked at per cent less because the rso had employed abby a contemporary of abbys at the moscow conservatoire she was like benny very jealous of abbys former success a charming curvacious bottled blonde with high cheekbones and naughty slanting brown eyes she had been one of rodneys pets and was upset to find such a dear doting old man had been replaced by her greatest rival lionel after yesterdays humiliation was revving up for a showdown he had already had a word with george i wept for my musicians he repeated sententiously and she mocked me it is an honour to sit in the first chair of a great orchestra but how can i have any authority as a leader if she constantly undermines me in front of the players shed better go back to playing the fiddle said george and had a sharp word with abby to softpedal the histrionics marias very popular with the rutminster audience he added brusquely weve nearly sold out this evening give her her head maria was also very popular with the orchestra who gave her a round of applause when she arrived the following afternoon but although she dimpled and smiled she was in fact in a furious temper having decided that george was as attractively macho as he was rich she had slipped into tower records in rutminster high street to buy her own recording of the saintsaëns third concerto in order to sign it for him she was not pleased to be told by the assistant who did not recognize her that she ought to have bought abigail rosens version it was still easily the best on the other hand maria had a trump card which she knew would crucify abby she was playing on abbys old strad simon painshaw was also uptight and tearing his red dreadlocks because he had to open the second movement of the concerto with one of the most beautiful solos brahms or anyone had ever written all the woodwind were busy in that movement but they were still only the supremes to first oboes diana ross arriving at the hall simon had been accosted by hilary bossily ticking him off for not tuning up half an hour earlier so he could play in his quarterfinal match in the rso conker competition as a result she had rescheduled his match for this evening in the mealbreak before the concert simon had become wildly agitated he had been making reeds the thin pipes through which oboists blow which was a hellishly finickety job since ten oclock that morning he said and im not playing any conker match this evening ive got to psych myself up for my solo half the orchestra are in the conker competition said hilary furiously and theyre not going to wait around at your convenience all you think about are your silly reeds simon had flipped and started screaming about fucking kids games abby coming out of the conductors room had backed him up and told hilary to eff off love conkers all said a passing viking in amusement hilary rushed off to tell lionel who started the rehearsal in an embattled mood bill thackery lionels coleader predictably nicknamed makepeace because he was kind equable and always defusing squabbles had heard the shouting in the passage whats up with lappassionata he asked as lionel took his seat beside him pmt that was yesterday said lionel spitefully shes got the rags up her today bill winced he loathed lionels coarseness he glanced up at abby whose face was a mask to hide her fear fasten your seatbelts murmured hilary to juno in front of her turbulence ahead from the first note it was quite clear that maria had totally different ideas of interpretation to abby and lionel totally agreed with her they both completely ignored abby as benny had done abby tried to be accommodating but she felt as though a great bloodblister was swelling inside her brain and she wanted to snatch back her strad she couldnt bear to see it in such insensitive hands the second movement was even worse sulking because simon had the good tune maria played flatly and lazily when she came in thirtytwo bars later abby let her scratch away for four or five pages then aware that lionel was deliberately holding back his first violins she stopped the orchestra can we please start this movement again it was too slow why not beat a bit faster said hilary rudely refusing to rise abby took maria aside suggesting a few changes maria snapped back that rannaldini had warmly praised her interpretation sure sure maria if you could just play with a little more passion as abby stepped back onto the rostrum maria made the orchestra laugh by sticking out her tongue at abbys back ok from the beginning of the second movement abby gave the up beat nodding at the bassoons who played a and f followed by an octave from the horns before simon came in with the rest of the woodwind simon looked as though he were in a trance sucking his reed like an opium pipe his fingers tense on the silver keys to distract everyone from such a breathtakingly beautiful sound maria pointedly rummaged in her violin case for some rosin to give extra grip to the horsehair in her bow as she did so a folded page fell out of her primroseyellow shirt fluttering down and landing on the rostrum but as her panicstricken hand shot out abbys black ankleboot stamped down on the note abby recognized lionels flamboyant scrawl give it to me squealed maria youre not supposed to read other peoples letters ignore the stupid cow and follow me read abby slowly then she went ballistic hurling her score at lionels glossy head quick hissed carmine to steve smithson get miles and knickers down to witness this you sonofabitch abby howled at lionel youre fired maestro maestro lionel retrieved her score it was only ajoke as maria says you really shouldnt read other peoples letters go on get out get out confronted by such fury lionel went the picture of injured innocence steve who played squash with lionel and was feeling well disposed towards him promptly called out the orchestra who all filed off into the band room weve got her steve murmured jubilantly to lionel dont worry well return a vote of no confidence to the board george miles mrs parker ambrose canon airlie all want her out theyll be over the moon at last weve broken her said lionel melodramatically putting two shaking hands together in prayer and dont you dare go back in there flora he called out sharply or youre fired as randy and dixie started an idle game of pingpong up at the far end of the room viking looked up at abbys framed photograph which charlton handsome had somewhat provocatively hung over the fireplace she has a lovely face he quoted thoughtfully god in his mercy lend her grace then turning to lionel added i dont like conductors used as targetpractice i think we ought to discuss this rationally we cant go on like this said bill thackery maria who was thoroughly overexcited said shed never been so insulted in her life and she was very happy to add her weight to the vote against abby left alone in the empty auditorium abby slumped on the rostrum slowly all the lights were flicked off except the one over her lectern she accepted it was the end she knew she had overreacted but it would never be any good with lionel the thorn in her firm young flesh had proved poisonous she would leave not him the brahms had jinxed her again so sweet was neer so fatal for a second she fingered the scar on her wrist sadly she picked up the violin which francis the good loser had inevitably left behind on his chair caressing its glossy brown curves francis would soon be back to collect it for a second she put it under her chin it was still warm idly she tuned it then as if in a dream she started playing the lovely tune with which the oboe opens the second movement somehow out of the black depths of her despair and the sense of utter failure the notes came to her first faltering many of them wrong the tempo very shaky then gradually gaining in strength and beauty she played it again totally immersed in the sound and the sadness then jumped out of her skin as through the darkness she heard a stealthy footstep and then the scraping of a chair then miraculous like the horns of elfland she heard the bassoon luminous and beautiful echoing round the hall then the octave on the horns and then simon starting the movement again he didnt need light he knew it by heart like orpheus abby had to steel herself not to look round then her heart leapt as she heard more footsteps and scraping chairs and the flute the clarinet and the second bassoon joining in it couldnt be real she must be dreaming but someone was switching on the lights and now there was an arpeggio which could only have come from viking and the strings came in which was the cue for the solo violin somehow her trembling hand managed to force her bow back and forth over the strings tears were streaming down her face so fast she wouldnt have been able to see anyway but through some mystical inspiration the notes came back to her as the boards squeaked with more and more footsteps at the first tutti it was clear that half the orchestra were back in their seats she jumped as a double bass was knocked over abby had played better technically in her life but never with such passion as the horns and the woodwind returned to the first subject she had some wicked syncopation six against four but she kept her nerve and then viking was accompaning her swooping divinely alongside then peter sweet and ethereal then rippling deep arpeggios on the bassoon and the strings came in like a great flotilla guiding the returning roundtheworld sailor safely into port until she had soared up to the final a absolutely noone spoke or moved as abby stood trembling with her head thrown back her eyes closed as though awaiting a blow bravo said a voice then there was a storm of cheering and out of the corner of her eye abby saw that the first chair was empty unable to face anyone she jumped off the rostrum handed francis his violin leapt off the stage stumbling as she landed then racing up the gangway pushed through the swing doors out into the park seeing her face deathly pale and still wet with tears as she ran down the high street the shoppers parted to let her through cars screeched to a halt as she bolted across the road drawn helplessly towards the lake following her in his car viking caught up with her as the town gave way to fields well done he yelled out of the window dyou want a drink but abby was completely dazed unable to speak gazing at him with huge haunted reddened eyes we all walked out of the union meeting he said gently we were glad to get shot of the bastard none of us liked him youve won sweetheart thirtysix the next morning george hungerford received a letter of no confidence in lionel as leader and upheld abbys decision to sack him hilary steve smithson carmine juno militant moll and ninion who was still smarting over catherine jones getting the big solo in rachels requiem were the only members of the orchestra who didnt sign although it was rso policy that its musicians were not allowed to talk to the press george caught cherub on the telephone to the evening standard diary yes we called lionel the incredible sulk he was saying in his shrill voice because he sulked all the time what did he sulk about well people nicking his hairdryer mostly can i think of anything nice about him thats a tricky one cherub scratched his blond curls and after a long silence not really oh yes i can thats enough george pressed the cutoff button then out of curiosity asked what was the nice thing you remembered about lionel that his brother was much worse said cherub going off into such giggles that george had to join in all the same the rso were left without a leader the post was hastily advertised and leaders applied from all over the world many expected to have their air fares paid others crept surreptitiously into auditions hoping noone would recognize them and sneak to their respective orchestras or later know they had suffered the humiliation of not being offered the job it was a laborious expensive process miles and mrs parker whod lost a powerful ally in lionel were all for asking hugo back but abby would have none of it the sight of hugo sleekly smirking in the leaders chair at the albert hall during the ccos prom had convinced her she never wanted to work with him again bill thackery whod acted as leader since lionel left put himself forward but was rejected as too stodgily dependable and too lacking in charisma rodney had only employed him in the first place because he had once played cricket for rutshire and scored centuries in the rsos annual needlematch against the cco aware that she had hurt bill abby had a restless night wandering round the garden at sunrise leaving footprints on the dewy lawn she realized after the long silence of the summer a robin was singing again in the old crabapple tree revelling in the sweet liquid notes abby was suddenly reminded of julian pellafacini the kind diplomatic infinitely charismatic albino leader of rannaldinis new york orchestra shed kept the letter hed written her after shed cut her wrist not caring that it was the middle of the night in america she called him at once did i wake you no i have insomnia over rannaldini he sack everyone i never come back from coffeebreak to find the same musicians yesterday he make me play three times alone in front of the orchestra how obnoxious said abby furiously adding hastily id never do that to you please come and lead my orchestra were premiering boris levitskys requiem in three weeks and i need you to show the strings how to play it and in november were recording winifred trapps harp concertos a wonderful composer sighed julian youre the first person whos heard of her said abby joyfully rannaldini told me you were leaving not any more then i will come my wife love england and ate new york we will find you a house how will you escape leave it to me sweeping onto the platform a week later to conduct a concert version of parsifal rannaldini found his orchestra crying with laughter and his leader sitting at the front desk in an emeraldgreen pleated dress green high heels a white puddingbasin hat and full makeup and sacked him on the spot by this time julians contract with the rso had been signed julian arrived at the beginning of october and moved with his wife and children into a beautiful rented house in the close paid for by the rso he was paid twice as much as lionel but he was worth every penny he was so kind so respected so gravely charming that he had only to clap his hands in rehearsals for everyone to shut up and listen he agreed that rachels requiem was a masterpiece explaining it to the more inexperienced or resistant players until everyone found themselves singing the tunes the young players seemed to absorb his talent by osmosis and old henry at last had someone to appreciate his stories and argue with about which quartet was beethovens finest abby was appalled by julians appearance when he arrived his long straight white hair had receded he was as black under the eyes as his dark glasses and he had lost over twenty pounds which his thin storklike frame could ill afford but gradually he stopped talking too much about rannaldini miss priddock was soon baking him cakes miss parrott knitting him scarves even flora picked a lot of sloes intending to make him sloe gin but they only gathered fluff in the fridge hes terribly attractive said candy but far too nice to be heterosexual sighed clare that was before theyd met his lovely bosomy wife luisa whom he adored and who gave uproarious spaghettiandredwine parties at the house in the close on sundays to which rankandfile players were asked with section leaders so relations within the orchestra improved dramatically to make good music said julian you need to have confidence and people you trust on either side of you julians a mensch said abby thats someone with standards a good friend a man you are proud to know she had achieved great kudos for finding him he also gave her confidence she could easily have been jealous of his popularity but he never took decisions without her and gradually she became less aggressive and tactless saying please and thank you and taking people aside for a quiet word in the break rather than humiliating them in front of the entire orchestra i think thats been played better in the past she suggested to jerry the joker after hed made an appalling cockup of a bassoon solo yes but not by me said jerry to howls of laughter all round morale was so high in julians first weeks that everyone was convinced his leadership had been entirely responsible for the new world and rannaldini sweeping the board at the gramophone awards they didnt even mind that edith spink and the cco had won an early music award for purcells king arthur as the date for the première of rachels requiem approached boris still minus astrid started hanging around hp hall tearful apprehensive aggressive by turns changing everything the rows between him and abby were pyrotechnic im conducting this piece i wrote zee bloody thing you didnt even remember youd introduced a variation of rachels lament as a violin solo in the agnus dei after hearing cathie jones still desperately nervous in the libera me boris went into an orgy of selfdoubt and threatened to withdraw the lament altogether it sound immaculate in the head then you hear orchestra hacking through eet fortunately george hungerford whod become a terrifying figure of menace to boris since threatening to make him pay back his advance had been listening unnoticed in the stalls and came up and shook boriss hand congratulations it was well worth waiting for boris was so overcome he burst into tears abby then put on the pressure persuading him that rachels lament would only work if viking played it in the interests of art boris reluctantly gave in as a result viking nearly got his tooth knocked out again wandering into hp hall after another latenight moonlighting and no doubt pleasuring astrid he noticed julian in the leaders room poring over a score beside julian viking could see lustrous black curls and a beautiful lean body in a checked shirt and jeans confronted by such a delectable bottom viking couldnt resist pinching it next moment an enraged boris had swung round and viking was belting down the passage sorry sorry boris he pleaded dont hit me again ive josst spent five hundred quid at the dentist youve lost so much weight i thought you were abby look he went on as boris kept on coming astrid wants to come back to you shes absolutely miserable with me she is boris lowered his fist oh my astrid terrific news thought abby overhearing the conversation as she came out of the conductors room and boris has agreed rachels lament sounds better on the french horn so hes written it back in for you she told viking sweet of boris said viking coolly but im flying to glasgow tomorrow to play a mozart concerto with the royal scottish national orchestra their first horns dislocated a shoulder i cleared it with george he added as abbys face contorted with fury blue would have killed him reflected viking if hed stolen cathies solo abby could have killed him anyway and that hugh grant hairstyle doesnt suit you at all she yelled after his departing back view the première in fact was a success all the london critics came down for a number of reasons levitsky was still a name they were curious to see how abby was making out but most of all they wanted to hear this great new leader who had graced little rutminster with his lustre even the rutshire butcher deliberately invited to the last rehearsal and forcefed lobster thermidor and moët afterwards by george wrote that it was good to have some meaty tunes after all those onenote jobs which had dominated the classical hitparade for so long the two representatives attending from the arts council were positively orgasmic about the piece nothing got them going like per cent of the audience looking bewildered by carefully placing round the hall a number of the friends of the orchestra to cheer and stamp george managed to generate a standing ovation for boris who looked so mournfully handsome and romantic that the audience kept on clapping particularly when he led cathie jones forward aware that blues goodluck card was hidden in the pocket of her black dress she had played exquisitely seeing the pinkandorange chrysanthemums miss priddock was bringing on for abby boris thrust them into cathies rough red hands i zank you viz all my eart i feel rachel forge eve me at last well you must be happy with that said abby chucking down her baton and the requiem score as she and boris finally returned to the conductors room noone hackled noone booed said boris darkly maybe i am not avantgarde any more maybe im too predictable oh for christs sake but the next moment predictability and the avantgarde were forgotten as astrid wearing a new lilac suit no doubt bought with the proceeds of vikings moonlighting barged into the conductors room without bothering to knock straight into boriss arms thirtyseven after the première george took a party out to dinner at the old bell his guests included abby julian and his lovely bosomy wife luisa serena westwood head of artists and repertoire at megagram who were recording the requiem at the end of the month jack rodway the evenings sponsor who was a specialist in receiverships in a leading firm of accountants and representing the arts council a caring beard called gilbert greenford and his partner a folkweave biddy called gwynneth having laid on limos to the old bell george was extremely irritated to be lectured by gwynneth all the way on the evils of airconditioning in large petrolswilling cars you ought to get a cycle she stared beadily at georges straining waistband gilbert and i cycle everywhere indeed gilbert has had his cycle clara after clara schumann of course since he was at keble it was clearly going to be difficult reconciling the middleofthe road tastes of serena westwood a single parent whose calm beautiful face was belied by a rapacious body with those of gilbert and gwynneth from the arts council who only liked the obscure and discordant and of jack rodway who had a penchant for boléro because it makes me feel right randy to georges further irritation he arrived at the hotel to find a joyfully drunk boris whod been on the red wine all day had rolled up not only with astrid but also marcus and flora who was totally unsuitably dressed in sawnoff blackwatchtartan dungarees george hadnt spoken to flora since shed brought marcus over to be impossibly rude to peggy parker at the sixtiethbirthday concert but he had noticed her cool deadpan face among the violas or more often the top of her redgold head because her freckled nose was always in a book he knew she was trouble once the waiter had added another table boris marcus astrid and the pallafacinis commandeered it wanting to mull over the concert and talk musical shop they had kept a place for flora but determined flora shouldnt cause any more trouble and to keep her away from gilbert and gwynneth george frogmarched her down the table into the seat nearest the window with jack rodway next to her hissing hes paid for this evening so bloody well be nice to him planning to put himself opposite her to keep an eye on her and at the same time talk business with jack rodway george held out a seat for serena westwood intending her to sit next to him so they could discuss recordings for the rso but alas a second later ghastly gwynneth had landed on the seat like a wet lump of potters clay i feel you and i should get to know each other mr hungerford and you sit on my left mr brianknowles she added archly to miles nearly giving him a black eye with one of her huge silver earrings hanging like gongs on either side of her round smug pasty face gwynneth had buck teeth beady little dark eyes a pepperandsalt bun and was also a great lardmountain of selfimportance as she was constantly fawned on by men who ran orchestras and ballet and opera companies who knew she had the power to slash their grants seeing flora gazing at gwynneth in horror george snapped at her not to stare so flora looked out of the window at the yellow willow spears falling into the dark river and at the lights on the bridge silhouetted against the russet glow of the rutminster sky on all sides at other tables ancient residents were ekeing out slices of cheddar and halfbottles of red nudging each other because they recognized abby some of them also recognized george from the local papers because of the row he was having with the council over planning permission for the fifty acres on cowslip hill george certainly had a terrific effect on waiters who had all converged on the table handing over red velvet tasselled menus gabbling about plats du jour and filling glasses particularly boriss whenever they were empty penny for your forts asked jack rodway whod been admiring floras profile i was thinking replied flora with a sweet smile what an ugly cow that is opposite her partner gilbert is worse murmured jack i sat next to im on the drive down stinks like a pole cat flora giggled obviously thinks avantgarde is more important than right guard jack looked blank for a second then roared with laughter thats right flora jack rodway had dissipated blue eyes in a ruddy expensive face wore a sharp navyblue suit and was such an alley cat that flora expected to see furry pointed ears protruding through his thatch of blond hair i suppose she observed receivers and divorce lawyers are the only people making any money these days too right flora with twenty thousand firms going belly up every year its a growf industry nime of the gime must be awfully depressing like being an undertaker or a nurse in a vivisection clinic flora shivered all those poor employees losing their jobs we try and mike it as pineless as possible for the personnel involved no fanks jack rejected a wholemeal roll over forty a flat stomach required sacrifices moules are nice flora just come in suggested the head waiter who was a great pal of floras mother lovely ill have those flora beamed back at him im so hopeless at decisions ill have smoked salmon followed by steak and french fries said jack rodway suddenly flora twigged you must be an invaluable contact for george presumably when companies go into receivership they often have huge crumbling old buildings that no longer qualify as listed if you knock off a few cornices but are ripe for development as office blocks or supermarkets what a very astute young lidy you are flora said jack rodway filling up her glass wasted on the violas george from his bootfaced expression had obviously heard every word but was being monopolized by gwynneth i shall not let my sword sleep in my hand she was saying affectedly until i have routed out sexual apartheid in british orchestras and until per cent of the repertoire is by women composers george choked on his glass of wine gwynneth turned greedily to the menu as megagram and the rso were splitting the bill she and goaty gilbert who had granny specs and green teeth surrounded by a straggly ginger beard chose all the most expensive things on the menu disgusting pigs muttered flora receiving another glare from george but nothing could dim her happiness in the pocket of her blackwatchtartan dungarees was a postcard left in her pigeon hole darling flora astrid is moving out thank god the pillow talk was very limited will you have a drink with me the second i get back from glasgow all love viking viking was another alley cat reflected flora but she felt he was the only person who could get her over rannaldini for the moment she could practise on jack dyou know fatima singh mr hungerford across the table gwynneth was returning the attack does she asked flora what said gwynneth impatiently sing giggled flora no no she composes you must be familiar with her elegy for oppressed lesbians in the harem best place for them said jack all girls togewer she makes lovely use of the sitar went on gwynneth totally ignoring them gilbert and i note you have no asian music in your repertoire mr hungerford down the table boris was gazing into astrids eyes and murmuring pushkin in his deep husky voice abby on an aprèsconcert high was bending gilberts dirty ear about the wonders of winifred trapp and fanny mendelssohn we have a terrific harpist miss parrott whos mad about the trapp solos the pellafacinis were talking about children with serena westwood im not an achiever luisa was saying apologetically i look after julian and the kids abandoning george for a second gwynneth was now discussing madrigals with miles the musicians sing them on the coach on the way to concerts he was saying how joyful gwynneth brought her hands together with a clash of bangles when i come down on my threeday assessment of the orchestra i hope i may be permitted to join in we could sing motets as well they are the religious equivalent of the domestic madrigal and she went off into a flurry offa la las in a quavering soprano if she got locked into the coffinshaped lavatory with viking decided flora there wouldnt be room for hilary and militant moll as well marcus sat in a daze his fingers playing idly on the white table cloth still coming down after the requiem unable to say a word on the noisy journey to the hotel when everyone else was going beserk expressing their approval suddenly he turned to boris and blurted out that was one of the most beautiful pieces of music ive ever heard like discovering america or walking round chartres cathedral for the first time there was a pause as everyone suddenly remembered the requiem was why they were there serena westwood who believed that a bonk a day kept the doldrums away and who had high hopes of george turned and looked at marcus for the first time what a beauty such a sweet sensitive yet strong face and he was the only man shed met whom the hugh grant hairstyle really suited marcus is why requiem happen said boris excitedly ee copy ee transcribe ee listen ee encourage is super pianist you must give him a contract he added to serena lets all dreenk to marcus having drained his glass he smashed it in the fireplace the other diners looked wildly excited the waiters came running in in alarm until george waved to them to forget it and to bring boris another glass what have you done recently serena asked a desperately blushing marcus tteaching mostly i had a recital in bradford last week good not brilliant a string broke in the middle of bartóks allegro barbaro it sounded like a bomb going off all the audience tore out not many of them bothered to come back marcus smiled deprecatingly you must send me a tape said serena enthusiastically perhaps you should have a crack at a piano competition its good experience and the best way of getting known its a lousy idea snapped abby abandoning gilbert in midflow marcus doesnt need gladiatorial contests hes gotta develop at his own pace marcus opened his mouth and shut it again well at least get an agent urged serena i could suggest if he needs an agent snapped abby he can go to howie denston oh abby sighed flora when will you learn not to be a bitch in the manger thank you gwynneths small mouth was watering like a waste pipe as a great vat of caviar was placed in front of her did you mention bradford she called out to marcus marcus nodded mortified still to be the centre of attention did you have time to visit the early music shop asked gwynneth what a pity gilbert brought a portative organ set from there and made it up for my birthday hes thinking of tackling a crumhorn or even timbrels next what wild ecstasy murmured flora contemplating a black shiny mountain of mussels and wondering how hungry she felt did you listen to the cco at the proms asked gilbert forking up lobster at great speed there is no doubt they are the best orchestra in the south of england and played as such thats rubbish called flora down the table we can play just as well as the cco ow ow ow she glanced reproachfully at george why dyou kick me like that just as well particularly now weve got julian zat is true boris dragged his eyes away from astrid zank you for your support julian and welcome to england let us drink to julian another glass smashed in the fireplace flora turned giggling to jack who had demolished his smoked salmon in a trice and was now helping himself to her mussels weve had boris living with us on and off for the last two months hes exactly like a two year old smashing everything and getting his words muddled up boris grinned down the table at them always flora take the puss out of me but she is good friend who help me to flora crash went a third glass cheaper to hire them by the two dozen suggested julian but gwynneth had put on a soppy artistswillbeartists smile and what is your next opus mr levitsky hes going to write a moonlighting sonata for viking announced flora gwynneth raised a reproving hand with another crash of bangles i asked mr levitsky im going to write opera of king lear that could be very fine mused gwynneth good womens roles and you could make an important statement about paternal oppression oh get real muttered flora will you use a russian translation or tackle iambic pentameter asked gilbert earnestly dactyl and sponsor grinned flora raising her glass to jack rodway who promptly put his arm round her shoulders i ave to say george ill only sponsor concerts in the future if i can have flora sitting next to me afterwards george ordered me to be nice to you said flora and it hasnt been difficult at all she added kissing jack on the cheek george was clearly hopping but trapped by the need to behave well in front of gwynneth he was powerless youve no idea the fun ive had playing on gilberts small organ she was now telling him of course todays musicians need an organ that will fit into an estate car or in gilberts case to fold up in a briefcase were you aware mr hungerford that small organs were neither usual nor common until recent times ive always said they had more fun in the middle ages interrupted flora ow ow why dyou keep kicking me just shut up whispered george with a flash of clenched teeth finishing up the juice under her moules flora missed her mouth with the spoon and realized how drunk she was she looked at george through her eyelashes why did they all think he was so attractive he almost had a treble chin from so many sponsors dinners and the big hornrimmed spectacles emphasized the tired belligerent eyes he also had the restlessness of the emotionally involved elsewhere for such a macho man it must have been a terrible blow when his wife walked out gwynneth was obviously thinking along the same lines dyou have a partner mr hungerford im separated said george curtly did you both try relationship counselling i dont hold with that sort of thing george was fed up with being nice to her dont be so on the defensive teased gwynneth even gilbert and i are counselled every six months a sort of spiritual mot her mouth was watering again as a waiter flambéed her tournedos au foie gras on a sidetable i am not a meateater normally but when in rome gwynneth smiled round as if she were making a colossal concession my mother went to a marriageguidance counsellor said flora she said they were useless and had more problems than she did gwynneth ignored flora but persisted with george you want to get in touch with your feelings flora decided george needed rescuing she must be drunk what id like to ask she said to gwynneth is why the london met yes i read it in the times are allowed to push off for three months every summer so their hall can be used for jazz pop concerts gospel cajun music and other relative garbage and you pay them a massive thirteen million a year which is more than the rso grant for the next forty years meanwhile we play all the year round except for a month in the summer we travel fifty thousand miles in coaches providing music for nine counties and we pay more back to the government in vat than you give us in rotten subsidy so actually were a net earner thats enoof flora said george who entirely agreed with her but couldnt be seen to support her in public i cannot reveal the reasons we give subsidies to other institutions said gwynneth primly why not demanded flora you receive government money therefore the public and thats me has the right to know everyone needs rises down here hear hear agreed jack ignoring a glare from george and filling floras glass too much bloody fudgin gwynneths little brown eyes were suddenly as dead and opaque as sheeps droppings her furious face twitching i adore that top gwynnie said miles hastily you look marvellous in indigo it comes from a planetfriendly range said gwynneth looking most unfriendly towards flora even the buttons are biodegradable ill give you their card for your partner marcus could feel serenas ankle rubbing against his leg like scriabin making him incapable of eating his dover sole hed given eight piano lessons earlier in the day he ought to practise for a couple of hours when he got home but hed do anything for a fat record contract and serena looked rather like grace kelly in high society across the table abby and julian had hardly touched their food it was a wonderful concert julian was saying im really looking forward to conducting winifred trapp next week said abby must have a slash said jack getting up as long as noone slashes our grant any more flora shouted after him relieved to see that gwynneth was still nose to nose with miles george looked across at flora pleased with julian oh yes sighed flora hes given us such confidence and hes so approachable after lionel no problems too small for him not even gilberts organ george shook his head youre a minx im a cunning little vixen your doggy bags mr hungerford the waiter put two foilwrapped packets beside georges plate youve got dogs said flora in surprise three rottweilers four counting you said flora i like rottweilers she added remembering wistfully how she used to romp with rannaldinis you havent eaten much george glanced up at the pudding trolley rumbling towards them you better have an ice kids like ices flora shook her head her red hair splaying out like a marigold no no i dont like anything that gets in touch with my fillings then george did smile lifting his heavy face like a sudden shaft of sunlight on a limestone cliff everyones having a ball said flora thank you its been a terrific evening but she had reckoned without gwynneth whose ethnic crimson skirt was about to pop and thick pepperandsalt hair about to escape from its bun as she washed down her final mouthful of tournedos au foie gras with her fourth glass of pouillyfumé you are driving gilbert gilbert looked livid but his mouth was too crammed with monkfish to refuse gwynneth then turned her shiny offwhite face to george isnt it bizarre the way you hear a name for the first time and then hear it again and again miles has just mentioned winifred trapp did you know that rannaldini has just recorded all winifred trapps harp concertos with american bravo there was a stunned horrified pause lovely shimmering music went on gwynneth delighted at the consternation she had caused an advance copy arrived on my desk this morning although rannaldini or rather sir roberto tells me he recorded it in prague very cheaply the quality is superb i thought hed lost his fire after his last wife left him but his new partner has regenerated him watching the colour drain out of floras flushed happy face miles wondered if shed had anything to do with passing on the information of course rannaldinis always been innovative went on gwynneth smugly and what is more he and dame hermione have just recorded all fanny mendelssohns songs with winifrid trapps orchestration quite marvellous dont you agree gilbert indeed said gilbert who was trying to scrape hollandaise sauce out of his straggly ginger beard i think if fanny and felix had lived she would have been the more significant composer although i agree with the mendelssohn society that had felix lived he would have been greater than richard wagner georges face was limestone again when did rannaldini record this he asked bleakly in september said gwynneth who was now leering at the pudding trolley that gateau does look tasty they get these things out so quickly these days but rannaldinill want to give winifred its pronounced vinifred actually a real push so i doubt if theyll release it before january or february such a slap in the face for folk who say there are no great women composers i knew nothing about this said julian appalled nor did i said serena westwood grimly american bravo were megagrams biggest rivals abby was frantically trying to work out how rannaldini could have preempted her the brochures already late because of so many changes had only been sent out in september who else could have told him hugo lionel perhaps unthinkingly marcus could have said something to helen shed heard rannaldini was enraged that the rso had snapped julian up but that wouldnt have given him enough time either way shed been left with egmont on her face thirtyeight as a result of gwynneths revelations megagram pulled the plug on abby serena westwood had been singularly uncharmed by her peremptory behaviour throughout dinner and she and megagram had no desire to record obscure repertoire they had been led to believe was exclusive in competition with the mighty rannaldini and harefield george and miles were equally uncharmed to be lumbered with a fanny mendelssohn and winifred trapp series with no recordings to back it up vikings new nickname poverty trapp proved to be prophetic at the first concert there were more people on the platform than in the audience having worked flat out in september and october abby was due for a break in november and flew to america to see her mother she spent most of the vacation locked in her bedroom familiarizing herself with the remaining trappmendelssohn repertoire and rachels requiem which was now being recorded in december anything to avoid her mothers constant moaning that abby would never get off the shelf and provide her with grandchildren there must be some guy in your life abigail for a second abbys thoughts flickered towards viking then sadly she admitted there was noone november had been so mild that as she was driven back from the airport she noticed palest green hazel catkins already blending with the amber leaves still hanging from willow and blackthorn it was a beautiful day reaching the hp hall in the lunchhour she found viking asleep under a horsechestnut tree hed probably been up all night moonlighting like some victorian personification of autumn his gold hair was spread out on the bleached grass and his slumped yet still graceful body was almost entirely covered in kiteshaped orange leaves happy days for him thought abby wistfully seeing an unusually angelic smile on his face she was about to wake him then she noticed a piece of cardboard cut in the shape of a tombstone propped against his feet on it someone had written here lies viking very much to all our liking who fucked himself to death with a howl of misery abby turned and ran inside her mood was not improved when she learnt that george had axed the last two trappmendelssohn concerts and replaced them with lollipops and that megagram were now having cold feet about putting up the money for rachels requiem this would be catastrophic for boris who had already spent all the advance at an emergency board meeting peggy parker said she might bankroll the requiem but only if sonnys just completed interruption serenade could be used as a filler on the cd with a little picture of balding parrotfaced sonny beside shaggy boris on the sleeve the plan was that the requiem would be recorded in a studio but the interruption serenade would be recorded live at its première just before christmas then sonny could include as many interruptions as possible peggy parker was not at all happy about abby conducting either work and after a few telephone calls to serena westwood at megagram who would still be marketing and distributing the record felt she had discovered an ally and was biding her time abby felt her authority ebbing away worse was to come the rso were due to play messiah at the cotchester festival in december at the last moment jason the rackety owner of macho motors ratted on his agreement to sponsor the performance this was because hed failed to get abby into bed and because the bbc wouldnt allow one of his flash cars to be parked in the nave during the concert i cant see why not grumbled flora triumphal cars are always turning up in miltons religious poems its a ferrari not a triumph said marcus abby was in no mood for jokes as the concert was to be transmitted on christmas eve it would be a ghastly humiliation if the rso had to pull out through lack of funding they had only been invited to take part in the festival because dame edith impressed by abbys début concert had nagged the organizers if they werent careful their bitter rivals the cco locked in mortal combat with the rso for the same audiences sponsors and subsidies from the arts council would step into the breach as a final straw that even more famous dame hermione harefield whose single of i know that my redeemer liveth had sold over a million copies had been booked as one of the soloists and would rejoice greatly which was on the flip side of the single to see abby so discomfited abby was determined not to be beaten as she had just received a large royalty cheque from the reissue of her early records she blew the lot on a hefty insurance policy with honesty insurance in rutminster high street on condition that they sponsored messiah honesty insurance drove a hard bargain they wanted their slogan honesty is the best policy on posters all over the cathedral as well as their name on the credits the bbc refused the deadlock was only broken when the bishop of cotchester a pompous old fossil on the venturer board agreed to mention the company and the slogan in his interval address abby was livid george wasnt more impressed by her white knight gesture when she barged into his office to tell him the good news honesty insurance are a bunch of crooks he said only giving her half his attention because he was trying to sign his letters around a weaving purring john drummond theyve given me this abby waved a cheque under georges nose we better bank it at once jack rodway says theyre about to go bellyoop i hope you dont lose out on that policy youd have done better to sponsor the concert yourself like most successful property developers george believed only in using other peoples money when he took over the rso he had vowed never to give them a penny he did however have a longterm crush on dame hermione she was thirtynine like him he and ruth also an avid fan had enjoyed many of her concerts and worn out her famous lp of the verdi requiem hermione like ruth was someone george thought of as a real lady he would therefore have been prepared to bankroll messiah and pay hermione her vast fee her firstclass air fare and her bill at the cotchester hilton now thank god abby had saved him the trouble to avoid her nagging him about rain pouring through the hall roof he had swarmed off for a lunchtime meeting with rutminster district council perhaps one of mr hungerfords builders could put in a cheap tender suggested miss priddock abby laughed without humour there is nothing cheap nor tender about mr hungerford after a long and obviously successful lunch george was back wafting brandy fumes chewing on a huge cigar and making a nuisance of himself at the afternoons rehearsal youve got to keep messiah moving he told the orchestra particularly in part two when there arent many good tunes before the hallelujah chorus wakes the audience up and youve got to really belt it out to be heard in a big cathedral abby lost her temper just because you come from huddersfield it doesnt mean you own the work nor do you shouted carmine who was anxious to put abby down and to ingratiate himself with george i dont know what youre doing conducting messiah when it was your lot who crucified the poor sod in the first place thats out of order carmine snapped julian it was handels descendants yelled back abby who sent six million of our lot to the gas chambers please everyone julian broke the horrified silence george is right abby luisa and i visited the cathedral last week its huge i know you all know messiah backwards but the audience knows it backwards too so we cant afford to make mistakes aint it rarver like takin coals to newcastle said barry who was hugging his double bass to keep warm i fort it was the cco whod cornered the baroque market theyre the ones always winnin prizes thats why our reputations on the line said george messiah requires a very small orchestra just strings bassoons oboes two trumpets timps and a harpsichord so it was a depleted and resentful bunch who boarded the coach in the bitter cold under a lowering mustardyellow sky the following afternoon they had all been refused rises and resented having to trail over to cotchester for no extra money with no eldred and peter plumpton the bridge four was incomplete with no hilary and lionel gone ninion and militant moll couldnt sing madrigals on their own without miss parrott dimitri gloomily shared a back seat with his cello all the pretty girls nervous of appearing on television drooped because there was no celtic mafia except randy who was now an item with candy to jolly things along the only cheerful note was flora running on at the last moment clean hair flopping handing out tabloids like an air hostess all the orchestra except hilary who pretended to despise gossip were obsessed with the collapse of the prince of waless marriage and had divided themselves into procharles and prodiana factions now they fell on the latest update in ecstasy i fancy the brigadier such piercing blue eyes sighed nellie and thats a lovely new holdall flora she added glancing up from the daily express for a second louis vuitton isnt it clever you flora stroked the dark green leather proudly abby was so ashamed of me turning up at gigs weighed down by carrier bags of knickers that she gave it me as an early christmas present i can hang my black dresses up in it and theres room for foxie sponge bags books and things here let me to everyones amazement carmine leapt to his feet and put the holdall and floras viola case up on the rack come and sit here he ushered her into the windowseat beside him gosh thanks stammered flora have a kitkat then because carmine had to play the trumpet shall sound towards the end of the evening asked arent you terrified about your solo carmine shrugged just because its tv im bound to crack a note in an embarrassing closeup but this is a doddle compared with the solo in the b minor mass at the end of that you really see stars and he went on to be fascinating about trumpet music carmine in fact was not in a good mood he had given cathie hell because he actually was nervous about the solo and because alan cardew the planning officer suddenly appeared to have won the pools and had just whipped his wife lindy off to the seychelles for three weeks then they were off again skiing over christmas denied his mistress and uninhibited today by the endless mockery of the celtic mafia carmine decided to have a crack at flora hed always fancied the snooty upmarket little bitch once the tabloids were exhausted everyone started grumbling about foul letters from their bank manager barry the bass had had to pawn his rings and medallions to get his telephone reconnected mary darning socks was fretting about paying for christmas presents noriko had sold her little car and nearly died of cold walking to the coach old henry couldnt afford to get his stereo mended life without music in a tiny bedsit was very bleak after the première of messiah handel gave all the profits to the poor which meant one hundred and fortytwo people were released from the debtors prison announced simon painshaw cant see sonny parker doing that for us sighed candy and the hall was so packed went on simon that men were asked to leave off their swords and the ladies their hoops oh look said flora its started to snow at first it didnt settle on the roads only laying clean sheets over the fields and crawling like a white leopard along the branches of the trees but gradually as the light faded sky and snow merged becoming the same stinging sapphire only divided by evergreens black trunks branches and hedgerows that became walls as they crossed over into gloucestershire the coach started crackling over frozen puddles and sliding all over the place in the steep narrow lanes flora wished viking were on the coach shed been so upset by rannaldinis poaching of the rso repertoire then shed read the inscription on vikings cardboard tombstone not able to bear being hurt again she had refused all vikings invitations but she still caught him smiling at her appraisingly which always made her heart beat faster the snow was blanking out signposts and roadsigns the coach drivers were all for turning back knickers in a serious twist was more terrified of georges wrath if they didnt arrive and urged them on twenty miles from cotchester the snow started drifting and they ran into blizzards trees reared up out of the diminishing visibility like ghosts climbing to the top of a hill the coach skidded into the verge and ground to a halt wheels whirred impotently raising fountains of snow what do we do now asked knickers as he put his long nose outside his spectacles filled up with white flakes the wind was blowing straight from siberia you all get out and push said abby whod been in a car just behind them im not going to be beaten by that bastard hugo how beautiful are the feet with chilblains sang flora wincing as she landed on iron runnels of frozen mud as she righted herself she was amazed to feel a coat round her shoulders and even grateful to be offered a pair of awful driving gloves cant have you catching cold said carmine and as swearing and panting they all pushed the coach she felt his hand over hers i may be gone some time said randy sliding off to have a pee two hours and eight miles later the coach descended into cotchester to find completely clear roads starry skies and the great cathedral floodlit theyd never have believed us if we hadnt got through said abby whod abandoned her car her orchestra in various states of hypothermia and mutiny gazed at her stonily they hadnt even the heart to boo as they passed a window in the high street entirely devoted to dame edith and the ccos latest recording of the christmas oratorio or at huge posters everywhere advertising dame hermione sings messiah in huge letters with the other soloists and the rso in tiny print underneath inside the packed cathedral lit by hundreds of candles a huge christmas tree and television lights the four soloists choir crews and audience were raring to go there was no time for a rehearsal abby went straight up onto the rostrum to explain what had happened we came through a white hell ok the orchestra are frozen theyre just having something hot to eat i hope youll bear with us the audience were more than happy to do so but not dame hermione she was the one who kept people waiting as the harpsichordist had already arrived from london hermione had been about to offer the audience an impromptu concert of her latest album soothe the sad heart which with the television coverage would have sold an extra fifty thousand copies over christmas she had upset the other three soloists by her histrionics about catching cold and her demands poor alphonso the twentyfivestone italian tenor was forced to have blue drops put in his eyes and his bald patch blacked out by the makeup girls in a howling draught because dame hermione had commandeered the entire vestry as a dressingroom fortunately george hungerford had missed all these hysterics because he had arrived only five minutes before the orchestra so the first thing he heard was dame hermiones deep voice saying take me to the fans the first thing dame hermione heard was george telling miles that hed have his goots for garters if the orchestra didnt turn up surrounded by twenty blow heaters dame hermione shivered from excitement rather than cold she adored masterful men meanwhile steve smithson charged around with his thermometer complaining the cathedral was too cold and that there was no proper band room since dame hermione had hogged all the space fortified by a glass of red wine each paid for by abby and pizzas in the bar sinister opposite the orchestra had perked up enough to engage in the usual argybargy with the television crews there was simply not enough room on the stage to accommodate fat isobel and fat alphonso and the harpsichord let alone having cables to trip over mikes up your nose lights shining in your eyes and cameramen bossily shoving chairs and musicstands aside to give them a clear camera angle on dame hermione a bbc minion in a fake fur coat and strawberrypink trousers who looked as though he ate choirboys for breakfast sidled up to handsome randy as he blew a few testing blasts on his trumpet hi clark gable you playing the big solo no him randy jerked his sleek sandy head in carmines direction shame youre so much more the bbc minion ran his eyes over randys body photogenic particularly when you smile carmine wouldnt like it very much well have to use green face powder to take his colour down what are you doing after the show your admirers got an admirer giggled clare yes ive lucked out there sighed candy tightening her gstring theres absolutely no way im swapping seats with moll flora was now telling the bbc minion even to appear on television moll would kill me on cue moll rushed up in a state of chunter there are no ladies toilets so i had to squat in the gents and someones written rso stands for really shitty orchestra on the wall its not funny flora youre to cross it out in the interval she shouted to a cringing ninion on came julian smiling broadly fiddle aloft to relieved applause and some barracking from the gallery take off those dark glasses deary urged the bbc minion looks a bit camp then as julian lowered them a fraction showing his redalbino eyes said well perhaps not jesus its cold said bill thackery looking at the hundreds of candles flickering in the draught a rustle of excitement and some cheering greeted abby and the soloists dame hermione diamonds sparkling in the camera lights was clad from top to toe in rannaldinis sleek dark christmas mink ring up animal rights at once snarled flora hermione had no competition from the contralto who looked and sang like a sheep and was eight months pregnant having bowed to the audience abby thanked them once more for being so patient and i just wanna tell you guys she hissed at the orchestra that the entire cco including hugo are up in the gallery waiting to boo so flaming well play out of your boots and dont let the soloists drag this had the desired effect the rso played with that brilliance and attack often engendered by rage and irritation and even without a rehearsal the cotchester choir were infinitely superior to peggy parkers screeching seagulls despite the icy cold of the cathedral the sopranos led by dame ediths helpmate monica baddingham had absolutely no difficulty in hitting top a as they romped through the glory of the lord not wanting to bump into any of his fathers friends marcus crept into the concert after the overture returning to cotchester which was only a few miles from his home in penscombe made him feel desperately homesick the great cathedral was as filled with memories as shadows his father had always read the lesson at midnight mass and despite being divorced had managed to have his second marriage to taggie there much to the rage of the bishop it had snowed that day too and marcus remembered his desolation as a young boy as his father and his ravishing new stepmother took off by helicopter into the blizzard alphonso the hugely fat tenor seemed to be singing comfort ye comfort ye directly to him marcus also noticed because of a shortage of basses george hungerford had joined the choir and could be heard belting out oonto oos a boy is born in true hoodersfield fashion marcus thought how attractive george was so aggressively macho compared to the bobbing adams apples and waggling beards around him george in fact was very happy that very afternoon the ministry of the environment had overturned rutminster district councils decision and given him planning permission to cover cowslip hill with houses now he wouldnt have to revert to his contingency plan of letting new age travellers onto the site at the dead of night which normally melted any opposition his orchestra were also playing champion he couldnt have borne it if theyd let him down in front of dame hermione whod been all hed ever dreamt of and had asked him up for a nightcap in the rupert of the rhine suite at the cotchester hilton after the aprèsconcert party the dazzling overhead lights gave a blond halo to hermiones glossy brown curls monocles glinted in the eyes of a thousand colonels and george caught his breath as she slithered out of her sleek dark fur to reveal shoulders as smooth and white as sand dunes rising out of a deep purple velvet dress looking up at the monitor george longed to kiss the blue hollows made by her collar bones the hairs rose at the back of his neck at the unbearable purity of her voice there were shepherds abiding in the fields because of the late start and the shortage of lavatories it was decided to dispense with the first interval which had many of the rso and the elderly audience crossing their legs in agony not so the cotchester chamber orchestra in the gallery whod all been to a christmas party before the concert and who kept slipping in and out with a great banging of doors throughout the second half in delight they also counted the number of people reading their programmes or plaques on the wall or gently snoozing until the hallelujah chorus and a good shout woke everyone up moving her body like a rock star in her dark blue suit abby abandoned her stick and directed the orchestra and choir with clenched fists and power salutes backed up by davie going berserk on his drums and by barry and his basses all of whom knew how to swing it her interpretation was gloriously exhilarating and made the lovely descending chorale of the kingdom of this world all the more moving leaving the audience reeling now it was time for the bishop of cotchester to give his little sermon working in honesty insurance whose staff had been waving banners of the logo like football supporters every time the cameras panned to the audience awfully chic to match his ring to dame hermiones dress whispered nellie as exuding gravitas and pomposity the bishop mounted the rostrum if we behave ourselves on this earth he thundered glaring at the cco up in the gallery who were guilty of even higher jinks than their rutminster rivals it is an insurance against our going to hell he then carried on to the rippling snoring counterpoint of some drunk in the gallery to say people should be honest in their deeds and in their words and repeated that honesty was the best policy so many times that randy handing his hipflask down to jerry the joker muttered that the old bugger must be getting a bloody good whack of free pension for his services glancing round apprehensively to see if george had overheard jerry was glad to see georges anger was entirely focused on flora who had unearthed foxie from under her chair and was sending clare and candy into fits by putting his paws over his furry ears to blot out the bishops jawing the drunk was snoring even louder dunno whether to put a pillow over his face or shoot him said randy passing his hipflask to davie buckle who was still recovering from his frenzied activity in the hallelujah chorus shoot him and the bishop said davie in fact the bishop rabbited on for so long that abby nodded to julian to start tuning up this was the moment the audience had been waiting for the rerun of the single that had topped the pop charts and sold over a million copies hermione sings redeemer off slithered the dark fur again as hermione rose to her feet what a trim waist beneath those wonderful knockers thought george his brain misting over aware that the bishop had made them even later abby kept the strings and the bassoons moving on in the opening bars but there was no way hermione was going to be hurried eyes widened hands clasped she smiled angelically at her swooning public i know that my redeemer leeveth rang out joyfully on the arctic uncentrally heated air and the audience burst into a round of applause as if they were listening to frank sinatra hermione put up a white hand to hush them thank you thank you good people of cotchester im so happy to be in your lovely city again from the beginning abigail abby gritted her teeth hermiones voice could crack glasses unfortunately this second time around it woke up the drunk in the gallery who taking a swig from his bottle of southern comfort decided to sing along i know that moy redeemer leeeeeveth he caterwauled wickedly mimicking hermione as he clasped his hands composed his slack mouth in a perfect o lengthened all his es and opened his bloodshot little eyes as far as they would go oh bliss there is a god muttered flora and though worms deestroy theese body sang hermione whod gone bright red from embarrassment and trying to drown him and though worms deestroy theeese bodee quavered the drunk to a crescendo of furious hissing from a thousand apoplectic colonels gentlemen should have been allowed to wear swords unfortunately hermione had many bars of rest in the aria for the drunk to fill in i know he began again missing top e with a mighty screech monica baddingham in the choir strained her eyes to see if horrors he was one of dame ediths musicians in disguise looking down abby saw that the rso had corpsed neither jerry the joker nor solemn steve could keep their lips round their reeds the strings even julian were hunched over their music to hide their frantically shaking shoulders randy carmine and davie were going even redder in the face trying not to laugh flora wasnt even trying foxie was conducting again with gracious sweeps and bows to candy and clare who were stuffing handkerchiefs into their mouths and to fat isobel who was clutching her massive sides ill kill that drunk and that minx after the concert raged george hemmed in by beards and adams apples he was in anguish in my flesh shall i see god screeched the drunk taking another swig up in the gallery the cco were in ecstasy throw him out shouted their first bassoon yesh throw him out agreed the second horn no yelled the first trumpet whod drunk even more whisky throw him down he might kill a fiddler a gale of laughter swept the gallery hugo however was watching abbys rigid shoulders and her clenched fist on her baton look at lappassionata he murmured to his first horn shes going to flip as hermione hit top g with an almighty squawk george left his seat punching fellow basses out of the way and abby stopped the orchestra and swung round the fury in her blazing yellow eyes was so palpable many of the audience felt they had been burnt by lightning and afterwards swore that all the candles round the cathedral dimmed before flickering back into life just pack it in right yelled abby and though worms deestroy theese body warbled the drunk waving his bottle at her abbys voice rose i said pack it in weve driven through snow and blizzard this evening to play to you and dame hermione and the other soloists have flown thousands of miles to sing if you dont get that asshole out of here we wont play another note there was a stunned appalled pause as a thousand deafaids were switched up to discover if they had heard right then the lurking press went beserk simultaneously trying to photograph abby and hermione and the drunk as he was noisily evicted dame hermione who knew how to milk a situation cast down her eyes abby reached across the pregnant alto and put a comforting hand on her white shaking shoulder im sorry lets do it again well skip the introduction five bars after eleven and one hermione rose to the occasion a woman of sorrows eyes brimming with tears moved for once by genuine grief at her own humiliation at the end the audience cheered her to the shadowy rafters as she lumbered off the stage down into the sideaisle one of her high heels fell down the soidisant centralheating grill depositing her into the waiting arms of george hungerford her breasts were so soft it was like catching a giant pillow dame hermione im bluddy proud of you said george offering her the remains of randys hipflask thirtynine the concert was followed by a splendid party at dame ediths house in the close normally the musicians would have been excluded from such a bash but dame edith whod always voted labour felt that after such a polar trek they deserved a treat the coaches would leave in half an hour which gave everyone time for a bite and several drinks a route avoiding snow had been charted theyd be home by two dame edith lived in a shabbily beautiful jacobean house on lots of floors using all her awards as doorstops the dark william morris walls were covered with sixty years of musical mementoes monica baddingham had added her stubbs her herrings her sporting prints her embroidered cushions to the household and three yellow labrador bitches who had greatly enhanced the life of tippett dame ediths pug tippett now sat snuffling beside dame edith who had changed into a burgundyred smokingjacket to welcome her guests with a slap on the back well done splendid concert great success coats upstairs booze to the left coq au vin and bombe surprise in the kitchen monica made them she smiled fondly at lady baddingham who was brandishing champagne bottles so they must be bloody good do you think they both sleep in here panted flora as she plonked her viola case and her new louis vuitton on ediths massive fourposter i guess so marcus blushed slightly the four dogbaskets are all in here golly giggled flora we are seeing life that augustus john must be of edith when she was a young boy dyou think abbys going to be in awful trouble over that drunk i thought she was wonderful said marcus christ knows where it would have ended if she hadnt gone ballistic downstairs dame edith was entirely in agreement cant think why everyones making such a fuss she was telling a tightlipped miles the bishop and a hovering gwynneth and gilbert who were already filling their faces from overloaded plates done just the same myself continued edith flicking cigar ash into the fire anyway whats wrong with the word asshole miles blanched in a house of god edith asked the bishop plaintively very appropriate said edith with a guffaw assholes seem to be the only thing you bishops are interested in these days judging by the papers the bishop turned as purple as the ring on his cherished white hand but being a very greedy man he was not prepared to storm out until hed dined so merely satisfied himself with you go too far edith it wasnt abbys church said flora joining the group to miless fury shes jewish and people use the word asshole all the time in america it just means idiot anyway she ploughed on ignoring the shocked faces abbys in excellent company handel used to swear in four languages at anyone even royalty who chatted in rehearsals and he used to throw tiresome singers out of the window although hed have been pushed to evict alphonso well said dame edith gave a shout of laughter then linking her arm through floras led her towards the kitchen come and have some grub like your flowered leggings just like the prima vera then lowering her voice whispered hows marcus monica and i are awfully worried about the rift with rupert and taggie poor boy feels things so deeply the best thing you could do said flora is to get him some work as soon as dame edith was out of earshot miles guzzling gwynneth and gilbert and the bishop drew together for an indignation meeting abigails got to be stopped she cant go on behaving like a yobbo the hallelujah chorus sounded like rock music said miles fastidiously and that young woman floras just as bad sniffed gwynneth oblivious of the furore she had triggered off abby was thrilled to have been sought out by monica baddingham and the great declan ohara who was just to die for to say how well she had done she was livid however when she overheard several cco players saying how tremendously the rso had been improved by julian its the great leader of course that makes a great orchestra said hugo smiling coldly at abby he was obviously still festering over his yellow cords then he turned to gwynneth who looked as though she had a couple of used cars hanging from her ears lovely earrings gwynneth can i get you some bombe surprise i know how you like desserts i thought id have seconds of the coq first simpered gwynneth nearest shell get to cock in this house murmured randy to candy im surprised theyre not serving vibrator au vin hugo who unlike most of the rso realized how crucial it was to suck up to the arts council took gwynneths plate youre so caring hugo gwynneth edged towards him what did you really think of rosens performance hugo shrugged not a lot the jazzing up of the hallelujah chorus was terribly vulgar george frederick would have loathed it and shes such a drama queen my sentiments entirely how far exactly is rutminster from cotchester two score miles and ten said hugo and the rso nearly didnt get there by candlelight one wonders mused gwynneth whether we really need two orchestras in the area my sentiments even more entirely said hugo there was only warmth and sincerity in hugos eyes as he forced himself to gaze into her lardlike face without flinching he accepted the pressure of her shapeless body ill get you some more coq gwynnie turning he tripped over a large labrador and nearly deposited gwynneths chicken bones into alphonsos capacious lap alphonso who was taking up seveneights of the windowseat didnt flinch either i hop he was telling nellie that you will come to my suite for a nighthat george whod been buttonholed for far too long grabbed abby as she passed have a word with gilbert i know he wants to discuss the concert shoving them together to their mutual distaste he belted off to find dame hermione in his car on the way over she had sung im a little lamb thats lost in the wood george had never looked forward to a nightcap more in his life the heroine of the evening was now holding court on a frayed chaiselongue to a circle of admirers many of them press i just thought poor fellow poor fellow he must be so terribly unhappy anyone that dependent on drink needs help youre so compassionate dame hermione gushed gwynneth have some fizz said monica baddingham waving a bottle everyone put their hands over their glasses to demonstrate their lack of dependency i just wanted to congratulate you on your fanny cycle went on gwynneth reverently and rannaldini has never conducted better how is rannaldini asked a man from the times idly flora on her way to the stopped in her tracks oh full of beans said hermione heartily her small hand creeping surreptitiously into georges big one hows his new marriage asked the guardian excellent said hermione her eyes suddenly twinkling i sometimes think he married her for her packing flora groaned and ran upstairs she was desperately tired and near to tears after admiring the famous musicians including rannaldini in arctic profile framed on the wall of ediths bathroom she unlocked the door and came out slap into carmine you played brilliantly tonight she stammered conscious of the lurking menace of the man i wish all the brass section had been at the concert to hear you edging along the wall towards the stairs she was stopped by the iron bar of his arm give us a kiss then avoiding a vile sour waft of vinous breath which must have corked inside him flora pecked him on the cheek the next moment carmine had grabbed her hair yanking her head back forcing his sneering mouth on hers with a clash of teeth scratching her with his horrible moustache as she writhed with the strength of utter revulsion his other hand dived under her dark blue jersey pinching her breasts till she screamed you bloody little braless pricktease lemme go flora was desperately trying to knee him in the balls when a voice said ahem i spy a strugglin musician fuck off snarled carmine but his grip eased wriggling away flora went slap into the scented medallionhung bulk of jack rodway the receiver oh thank god you ok flora nodded no fool like a bold fool she said shakily jack turned on carmine if you ever lay a finger on this young lidy again ill get georges boys on you before he fires you swearing snarling carmine lurched off upstairs flora was shaking uncontrollably poor liel fing jacks arms closed around her come and have a jar at the bar sinister out of the landing window flora could see musicians streaming out to the waiting coach i gotta go ill run you home later its no distance at night ive thought a lot about you flora my things are still on ediths bed flora shivered carmine was still up there somewhere theres my leather jacket and a viola case with my name on and a green louis vuitton bag ill get them said jackie and you might torch dim hermiones fur coat at the same time in the hall flora met a happierlooking marcus dame ediths just introduced me to george he was really nice this time flora looked oldfashioned must want something look im not coming on the coach can you or abby feed the cats if you get home before me i shouldnt be doing this grumbled flora as jack aimed the remote control to open huge electric gates what happens if your wife rolls up shes in italy said jack they seemed to get upstairs to the bedroom awfully quickly im glad you turned up at the party gabbled flora things were a little flat before carmine tried to rape me ill set you up in a little flat jack guided her into a bedroom out of a laura ashley catalogue i ought to clean my teeth said flora as she collapsed onto a daisystrewn counterpane i better fetch my smart new bag to match such a smart bedroom use my toothbrush said jack pulling her to her feet use anyfing in the bathroom most of all use me flora was woken by jack marching in with black coffee croissants and a large jug of bucks fizz youre a seriously nice man jack smirked and that is a really pretty view flora reared up in bed to admire a wood and white houses nesting in skewbald hills people were already tobogganing and a lovely little village shame the bloody bells wike us up at twenty to eleven every sunday morning help is that the time you were very tired i wish i could still crash out like that jack was wearing a white towelling dressinggown and was obviously poised for a replay he looked much older in daylight with his thatched hair pushed off his lined forehead coincidence you going to verona he went on have a crusoe croissants the one word that always trips them up flora was appalled to find herself thinking and said hastily ive never been to verona come on the labels on your smart oldall flora was downstairs in a flash in the louis vuitton bag with the verona label she found several toots of cocaine two very hardporn mags a years supply of condoms ten grand in cash some grey silk pyjamas voluminous enough to make a parachute alphonsos tails his passport and his tickets to verona on a plane that had left at eight oclock that morning flora went beserk hes got foxie she sobbed i cant move without foxie hes been with me since i was a baby she was on to woodbine cottage in even more of a flash dirty stopout were abbys first words ive lost foxie and my lovely new case it was several seconds before abby could make herself heard its ok nellies got them how on earth she went back to the cotchester hilton with alphonso omigod abby couldnt stop laughing nellie said alphonso burrowed in his case for a line and a condom and discovered foxie condomingo said flora who was reeling with relief poor foxie wheres he now alphonso gave him and your case to george oh deah said flora wearily hes not going to be very happy ive got alphonsos case here george had not been able to keep his rendezvous with dame hermione a man of sorrows acquainted with a whole load of grief he had instead spent the night with an increasingly hysterical alphonso who refused to let him call the police because of the contents of the case but insisted george ring every member of the orchestra which was difficult when the snow had brought down so many telephone lines to try and locate its whereabouts george really roared down the telephone at flora where the fuck have you been alphonsos threatening to sue the orchestra unless we get his case back and him on the evening plane hes got to fly to the states in the morning ill send the helicopter for the case at once where are you i cant tell you then youre fired flora put a sweating hand over the receiver can you lend me the money for a taxi back to rutminster grimfaced jack seized the telephone george its jack jack rodway floras wiv me then interrupting the torrent of abuse snapped i dont want the fuzz involved janiced do her nut and having seen the contents of alphonsos case i can see why he dont either ill shunt flora over to you as quick as possible all jacks bonhomie had evaporated he couldnt wait to get flora out of the house beside foxie george had found a black dress a pair of shoes a sponge bag and the selected poems of robert browning which he was flipping through when flora very pale but defiant arrived at his office how sad and bad and mad it was but then how it was sweet quoted george throwing the book across the huge polished table pretty sad bad and mad for a girl of your age to go to bed with a middleaged roué like jack rodway watching flora dive on foxie kissing him thankfully he reflected bitterly on his missed nightcap with hermione who was off round the world already who might have soothed his sad heart he didnt know if he would ever meet her again youll have to pay for alphonsos air ticket he said harshly flora was gathering up the rest of her belongings and chucking them into her case ill have to consult my lawyer she said haughtily george carmans a friend of my mothers ill dock it off your salary then i must have picked up alphonsos bag in the cathedral it was all your fault there was no band room for safe keeping everything was jumbled together im going to talk to steve appealed to the union decided management was in the wrong and flora didnt have to pay up but steve shook his head george hates anyone getting the better of him flora im afraid youre a marked woman from now on forty the rso were highly amused by the annexing both of jack rodway and alphonsos case and sang pack up your troubles in a new kit bag each time an increasingly irritated flora came into the hall although secretly delighted that flora had got off with someone other than viking abby was currently far more preoccupied with the recording of rachels requiem it was her first cd as a conductor and for the rso and she was determined to trounce the cco in next octobers gramophone awards if it killed her thank god boris was too immersed in king lear to come down and interfere i leave it in your capable fingers he told abby today i write vonderful aria blow vind and crack your chicks both however reckoned without the wrath of piggy porker she was not going to put one hundred thousand pounds into the rso centenary year starting on january and provide half the money for the requiem and sonnys interruption if a blasphemer was at the helm miles canon airlie and serena woodward now known as princess grace of megagram who was producing the record all backed her up and so did george when he saw the cash sum involved boris must conduct the requiem he had written he was also cheap because he liked to keep the adrenalin going by recording pieces straight through without any retakes as though they were live so there were never any overtime problems they had however all reckoned without julian who in a midnight meeting threatened to resign if abby were supplanted and without boris who flatly refused to cooperate fuck off parson from portlock he shouted when miles rang eef i break off now i will lose lear all the characters all the music vill slip away it is best theeng i ever write i try to forget rachel and requiem anyway i cant do this to abby who is a good friend nor did he want hassle from astrid who was wildly jealous of abby rachel and anything to do with rutminster are you prepared to pay back your advance if the record is pulled asked miles coldly boris who had just bought a little polo for astrid and had the cheque bounced on him said he was not youve got two days to mug up on the requiem ordered miles and please catch a train on sunday night so youll be on time on monday morning instead boris caught an early train on monday morning it was a tedious union rule that no more than twenty minutes of music could be recorded in a threehour session but if he could finish the requiem which lasted an hour in a day the rso would still get paid for a threehour session tomorrow morning and could go christmas shopping or have a liein instead and he could belt back to astrid on a fast train this evening passengers on the to rutminster were amazed to see the romanticlooking man with the upended beethoven hair singing along to his frantic scribbling covering an entire table for four with his papers with a hey ho the vind and the rain sang boris he hadnt bothered to look at the requiem and became so immersed in a possible baritone aria as flies to vanton boys are we to the gods that he forgot to get off at rutminster and only arrived at the recording studios situated in a basement in the high street at quarterpast eleven miles who had to pay for the taxi was hopping who produce requiem boris asked him sulkily serena westwood shes been waiting for you since halfpast nine miles might well have poured petrol all over a smouldering boris who loathed being bossed about by women serena was as smilingly serene as her name but boris was convinced a barracuda lurked beneath her steelgrey wool dress abby at least was on the side of music and she and boris could swear at each other in russian serena who was now sitting in the controlroom had been immersed in the score all weekend she had taken the precaution of providing paper cups in case boris started smashing things in front of her at a mixing desk like a vast switchboard and being paid a fortune by the hour sat sammy the recording engineer through a glass panel they could both see a forest of microphones like silverbirch saplings around these were grouped the rso swelled today by numerous extras who also had to be paid except for hilary who was ostentatiously reading villette they had all done the crossword and read the latest instalment in the royal soap in their own and each others papers to irritate flora the celtic mafia were now exchanging viola jokes whats the definition of a lady go on viking a woman who can play the viola but doesnt ha ha ha ha once upon a time princess diana met a frog went on viking the frog said if you give me a big kiss maam ill turn into a handsome viola player so princess diana put him in her pocket whaddja do that for protested the frog youll be more use to me as a talking frog said princess diana oh shut up snarled flora over the howls of mirth everything irritated her at the moment over her right shoulder she was constantly aware of vikings coldness since shed slept with jack and over her left she was equally conscious of carmines venomous animosity it was also such a long time since the rso had made a record that for many of the players candy clare lincoln vikings fifth horn jenny cherub flora and noriko this was a first experience and they were all terrified recordings were for ever every wrong note dropped mouthpiece or rustled page would be picked up the long wait was telling on everyones nerves particularly as julian good as his word had refused to participate without abby and had swept luisa and the children off to a pantomime in london bill thackery although thrilled to have this big chance to lead the orchestra couldnt as viking pointed out lead the winning dog up to get the obedience championship at crufts wandering into the studio boris apologized for being late paused to change a couple of bars of blow vind opened the score of the requiem then remembering he hadnt called astrid picked up the telephone on the rostrum and found himself connected to serena were all waiting mr levitsky she said icily vun moment boris shot out to the callbox in the passage hed fix the rso management for dragging him away in the middle of lear and there was his old enemy viking reading the racing post and ringing his bookmaker thank god hed given rachels lament to cathie jones although she wouldnt be needed until tomorrow the red light was on shining through the mist of cigarette smoke like a setting september sun the tapes started boris said serena on the talkback that could be heard by the whole studio she would only use the telephone on the rostrum for private abuse raising his stick boris noticed how many bows and instruments were trembling and smiled reassuringly you are nervous dont be forget the microphones we are making music eef we make few mistakes it doesnt matter noone will notice anyway muttered old henry who loathed contemporary music how lovely to have boris back after abbys relentless exactitude thought the rso fondly boris always kept them on their toes they never knew what he would do next unfortunately this time boris didnt know either he had totally underestimated the terrifying complexities of a work that suddenly seemed to have been written long ago by someone else the first tutti was completely haywire followed by two bars of silence when the orchestra didnt come in at all except for a great tummyrumble from candy whod been too nervous to have any breakfast and who went bright scarlet which sent all the rankandfile viola players into fits of giggles this was followed by a dreadful crunch when boris by mistake cued the horns into headon collision with the trombones totally drowning a flute duet i dont know what happened then said juno in a flustered voice i looked up at boris that was your first mistake said peter plumpton grimly serena glared down at the black tangle of notes like a front on the weather map and picked up the telephone lets start again but it was no better boris didnt know when to bring anyone in seemed unaware of colour dynamics or tempo and was constantly behind the beat as his gestures grew wilder and more panicky the level metres in the controlroom kept bouncing off the top leaving nothing in reserve for any big crescendo coming up without abby to hold it together or at least julian to bring in other section leaders with great nods the piece collapsed useless take followed utterly useless take despite what anyone says murmured simon painshaw to ninion there is a difference between intended and unintended cacophony the telephone rang constantly serenas trying to make a date with you boris shouted dixie very soft beds in the old bell boris growled back in russian and retreated to the old bell for succour he was very drunk when he returned after the break but because the rso had been taught the requiem painstakingly by abby they struggled on to the end of dies irae why isnt abby conducting this grumbled viking at this rate well be here till boxing day glumly the musicians watched the recording engineer dart in and shift a microphone towards bill thackery for the solo with which julian had reduced everyone to tears at the première it had been much too difficult for lionel and should have completely defeated bill thackery but smilingly aware of opportunity knocking he ploughed on sublimely unaware that he sounded as though he was chainsawing through his grandmothers wardrobe with granny shrieking inside boris however was too drunk to notice in the lunchhour francis the good loser who had moved up to coleader for the day and who had the sweetest nature in the orchestra for once lost his temper how dare that tonedeaf nerd butcher such a beautiful solo he stormed to eldred who cautiously agreed that bill could have done with a drop of oil alas the tonedeaf nerd overheard them retreated to the leaders room in high dudgeon and had to be coaxed out by miles and hilary take no notice bill dont listen to two such disgusting slobs theyve upset bill the nicest man in the orchestra said hilary as she flounced back to her seat and the worst bloody player said randy serena was going up the wall too she had spent the lunchhour in despair and on her mobile she had a hundred other projects to look after and a small daughter whom shed been hoping to take to toad of toad hall on wednesday serena was ambitious apart from the cost of paying the musicians for extra sessions she couldnt afford to make a lousy record theyd be lucky if they got five minutes in the can today boris drinking brandy out of a paper cup was now slumped on one of the sleepinducing squashy leather sofas at the back of the controlroom damp patches met across the back of his dark red shirt he was lear on the blasted heath being pussyvipped by the elements i think because of rachels death i block out requiem nonsense said serena crossly you havent bothered to learn it now get back and finish this session miles was shuddering with disapproval knickers was very very down it would totally knock his budget on the head if he had to call in all those extras for additional sessions how would they ever again be able to afford exciting projects like fidelio and mahlers symphony of a thousand to fire the publics imagination half an hour from the end of the afternoon the rso limped to the end of the benedictus and the section leaders crowded wearily into the controlroom to listen to the playback eldred already suicidal at the prospect of a wifeless christmas was white and shaking because he hated rows dimitri simon and peter plumpton sat listening with heads bowed because they hated bad playing dixie and carmine just hated each other jerry the joker looked at serenas legs davie buckle and barry the bass who had played jazz all night were asleep el creepo edged along the squashy sofa so his righthand fingers folded round his upper arm could rub against the more exciting squashiness of marys pretty right breast a totally oblivious mary was worrying what food shops would still be open and if she sold her pearls would she get enough to pay the telephone bill and buy a tricycle for justin for christmas bill thackery radiating decency and solidarity had quite recovered from his minitantrum blissful to be centre stage for once he thought nothing had ever sounded more lovely than his dreadful solo bills all right in the higher register where only bats can hear him muttered viking to tommy stainforth principal percussion slumped against the parquet wall reading a rave review in gramophone of his strauss concerto viking looked shattered his blond mane lank and separating he had to drive to bristol to play mozarts fourth horn concerto that evening through the glass panel he could see flora having boasted he would pick her off he had been enraged to be pipped by jack rodway look at her now flipping through clares copy of tatler yacking away to cherub noriko and candy making them all laugh always the focus of bloody attention serena was making notes at her desk ill buy that if you will boris she said more out of despair boris who was sobering up shook his head benedictus is too pretty too charming could have fooled me muttered dixie those crochets are too long agreed dimitri the melody seduce me i screw up this tape said boris grandiosely we vill do it again have this von on me well step on it said serena weve got fifteen minutes to go before were into overtime serena was passionately relieved when george stalked in just back from manchester having been briefed by miles he immediately asked for a score his face grew grimmer as once again boris and the benedictus drew to its utterly biteless conclusion not a chord or a scale was together good thing this glass is bulletproof said serena bleakly we should have stuck with lappassionata dont tell her shell be even more impossible at this rate well go into a second week if he doesnt get his act together tomorrow well have to reschedule or pull the whole thing for a second they gazed at each other they had planned a leisurely dinner leading to other things george sighed ill take him home and forcefeed him the score he put a rough hand on hers therell be oother occasions not if the rso go on playing like this see you all tomorrow at nine fortyfive she called over the talkback like prisoners in the dungeons of fidelio the musicians shambled out frustrated tired and blaming boris poor boris protested noriko he is very sad to be dragged away from king rear vikings king rear said nellie wistfully always forcing that gorgeous ass into the tightest jeans a swaying boris was hijacked on the way out after initial pleasantries george asked him where he was staying voodbine cottage abby and flora invite me uhuh george grabbed boriss arm youre cooming home with me youre going to sober oop and spend the night with the score instead of one of those two scroobers unfortunately he hadnt seen flora who was lurking in the shadows she was in total despair as she remembered the excitement with which they had all worked to finish the requiem in the summer im not a scrubber she said furiously if you hadnt junked abby none of this would have happened and fled into the icy night having been forced to drink four alkaseltzers before being put straight to bed boris slept for nine hours george woke him at five giving him black coffee and four hours on the requiem by this time boris was ready for a huge fryup including fried bread spread with oxford marmalade publicschool habit i peek up from flora my cross said george bleakly is excellent girl protested boris youve been seduced by a not particularly pretty face snapped george is cordelia in lear so young my lord and true my god boris clapped his hand to his forehead in horror vere is my lear manuscript three months vork i am ruined sit down george poured boris another cup of coffee i put it in the office safe boris slumped back in his chair you are horrible but very good guy you save vork of art george made sure boris arrived at the studios in good time they were greeted by a smirking shiftyeyed carmine cathie had flu and couldnt play rachels lament in the libera me knickers was tearing the remains of his red hair out where would he find a cor anglais player in christmas week at five minutes notice cathie could have bloody rung miss parrott leapt to cathies defence that bug going round knocks you for six so does that bugger said an anguished blue who hadnt slept for two nights with excitement at the prospect of seeing cathie and who had turned up in his best blue shirt i know hes blacked cathies eye or worse im going round there dont hissed viking the bastard will notice youre missing lindy cardew has just returned brown as a berry from the seychelles courtesy no doubt of george hungerford on friday she and the planning officer are off again to gstaad carmine doesnt want cathie around cramping his style nicholas miles george serena and boris were in a despairing huddle around the rostrum well have to record the libera me at a later date said boris the only solution said flora strolling up to them is for viking to play the solo the hell i will viking didnt look up from classical music boris didnt want me in the first place that is untrue said boris outraged i offer it to heem once oh for christs sake bury your pride both of you said flora you bloody well owe it to us boris for wasting all our times yesterday ahem george cleared his throat i would like to remind you he told flora tartly that until otherwise stated i am nominally in charge of this orchestra well tell them not to be so pigheaded i dont ave french orn version said boris sullenly i do said flora i kept it in my locker one never knows when these things might come in useless as youre obviously all opposed to the idea go and get it said george its only got a bass accompaniment said serena as they all pored over the sellotapedtogether page you and barry can practise it in the lunchhour viking im busy said viking haughtily ill sightread it floras pleasure in having secured him the solo evaporated at his lack of enthusiasm battling with an icy wind in the high street on her way to send flowers to cathie jones she felt even worse a bmw screamed to a halt and viking leapt out he had put on a tie and had brushed his hair for a blissful moment flora thought he was stopping to thank her instead he belted into the florists bought every freesia in the place and belted out again flora started to cry she ached all over noone ever said well done violas she was fed up and lonely she hated george for calling her a scrubber and viking for bombarding beauties with freesias even worse was the thought of christmas with all its jollity and loving kindness she would have to go home to warring parents and a place that reminded her only of rannaldini the rest of the rso had a much better day boris was back on form conducting with his old fire and inspiration they worked fast polishing off the agnus dei the lux aeterna and a vastly improved benedictus it was time for rachels lament arent you nervous said cherub admiringly viking shook his head he had the bigmatch temperament that needed adrenalin pumping through his veins to make him perform at his best throwing his paper cup of coffee at the wastepaper basket and missing he picked up his horn he had removed his tie and jacket his casket of earth glinted in the v of his dark blue shirt which had escaped from his jeans two days in an airless illlit studio had taken their toll the pale skin fell away from his high cheekbones the lines were deeply etched round the bruised mouth the slitty eyes had disappeared into black shadows too much sex at lunchtime thought flora sourly i must sign him up sighed serena hed just have to stand there and smoulder cathies version of rachels lament had been poignant haunting coming from the depth of her sadness the last cry of the dying swan viking curdled the blood the rising fourths and fifths singing out probing incessant insistent almost unbearably raw and primitive one great player saluting the departure of another miles nicholas george miss priddock holding john drummond even harry hopcraft the financial director crowded into the controlroom to listen all sat spellbound only viking and julian had that ability at five oclock on a mean grey afternoon to bring tears spurting out of the weariest eyes boris whose eyes were completely misted over pointed vaguely in carmines direction to bring in the fanfare of trumpets sounding for rachel on the other side before the final majestic tutti the instant the red light went out everyone burst out cheering boris had pinched bills redspotted handkerchief to wipe his eyes and was just about to congratulate viking when the telephone rang snatching it up boris listened for a second you tell him vy do i always do your dirty vurk he slammed down the receiver and took a deep breath viking that was fantastic absolutely vonderful perfect out of these vorld but we have technical fault could you possibly do exactly the same thing again the orchestra winced collectively waiting for the explosion i know women just like that drawled viking everyone in the studio and the controlroom collapsed in relieved and helpless laughter and viking did it again even better the next moment he and boris were hugging each other lets go and get vasted fortyone after getting plastered with boris viking was woken at noon by his cleaner mrs diggory banging noisily against the skirtingboards as she hoovered outside his room she was due to leave at one oclock she hadnt been paid for three weeks and was more hopeful of a christmas bonus if she woke up viking who when he was in funds was the most generous of the celtic mafia picking his way through piles of dropped clothes dog bowls and curry trays carrying his head gingerly downstairs as if he were trying not to spill it viking begged mrs diggory to make him a cup of coffee i cant do the bedrooms theyre all occupied she sniffed you can do mine said viking and change the sheets please expecting company mrs diggory had to slant the kettle to fill it above the mountain of soaking plates and mugs probably viking peered gloomily at his reflection in the dingy hall mirror his hair was so long on top hed soon have a middle parting like nugent as he let nugent out to see off any lurking duck he noticed the shadow of woodbine cottage across the lake through the bare trees above a fading red carpet of beech leaves picking up the telephone he called giuseppe parker and parkers most soughtafter hairdresser of course ill fit you in viking love but why must you always call at the last minute going to get your hair done said mrs diggory cosily as she put three spoonfuls of sugar into nightblack coffee i dont have my hair done i have it cot said viking haughtily then picking up mrs diggorys copy of the sun and turning to the back page exclaimed glory hallelujah seizing mrs diggory he waltzed her round the kitchen floras pride won by three lengths at ive just won two hundred quid most of that owed to me indeed it is viking retrieved a bettingslip before chucking his jeans into the washingmachine and gave it to mrs diggory hand it in to ladbrokes in the high street and keep the change for a christmas bonus you sure squawked mrs diggory in delight otterly you wont recognize your room when you get back leave the heating on lock it and leave the key in there viking tapped the willowpattern teapot on the dresser to stop the other basstards using it dont get too whistled and forget where ive left it viking glanced at his watch and reached for the last wine bottle in the rack weve got time for a quick glass then i mosst dash you better wrap up warm snows forecast searching for her cheque book in the chaos of the drawingroom flora discovered an advent calendar cherub had given abby for christmas and in an orgy of misery wolfed all the chocolates behind the doors still feeling sick she wandered listlessly through parkers mostly because it was the only warm place in the high street in the record department she noticed how little music had been written for the viola she must start singing again what the hell could she buy her parents a pair of boxing gloves on her salary she could hardly afford the wrapping paper in the bleak midwinter sang hermione over the loudspeaker flora had no difficulty recognizing the orchestra shed know that razorsharp precision anywhere looking up she saw a rannaldini poster glaring down at her an inch of white cuff showing off the only hands that had ever really given her pleasure she had been cold ever since his arms had left her oh bloody hell thought flora im not putting up with any more frozen nights at woodbine cottage running downstairs to the household emporium she was just paying for a very expensive electric blanket when the cheque was removed from her hands and torn into tiny pieces whipping round flora found herself looking at dark gold stubble surrounding the widest wickedest smile youre not going to need that tonight darling ive just made out the bill squawked the shop assistant furious to be robbed of the tiny commission and dogs are not allowed in here but flora was gazing up into vikings face the colour staining her pale cheeks suddenly they were interrupted by an old lady tapping on vikings shoulders that was a lovely concert victor we enjoyed it so much thanks darling viking had to bend right down to kiss her wrinkled cheek happy christmas see you in the spring and ill see you later he added to flora then he and nugent were gone haring off to catch the lift for giuseppe and the hairdressing salon such a nice young man quavered the old lady to flora and the assistant who clearly didnt think so at all he played at the centre yesterday scott joplin bye bye blackbird well meet again got us all on our feet dancing even mrs bilson and shes over ninety and he bought a big box of chocolates and everyone a little bunch of flowers viking played to you at lunchtime yesterday squeaked flora the old lady nodded he often plays to us and at the hospital other people come from the orchestra but victors our pinup i love his cheeky grin oh so do i said flora thank you for telling me and happy christmas im really sorry she added to the assistant but ill spend the money somewhere else in the store can you possibly direct me to party dresses back at woodbine cottage marcus had finally got rid of his last pupil of the day smothered in opium wearing the tightest bottlegreen cashmere jersey she had edged her stool up the keyboard until marcus was sitting on the windowsill then when he had showed her some fingering she had put her other hand over his imprisoning it and murmuring my mother used to know your father she said he was seriously wicked im just seriously boring said marcus apologetically turning his head so her kiss fell on his jawbone as she was leaving she gave him a biography of rachmaninov and a bottle of moët see you next term im going to get a terrific suntan skiing he hadnt the heart to tell her that her scent gave him asthma why hadnt he kissed her back shed been so pretty what would it have mattered yesterday he had given a chopin and liszt recital at an upmarket girls dayschool and afterwards signed two hundred autographs you wouldnt like a job teaching music mr black the headmistress had asked skittishly im sure youd cure our truancy problem overnight then she had given him a fee of seventyfive pounds there was no way he could pay the rent or for the stein way and buy presents for abby and flora the cottage bills were horrific flora left lights and fires on all the time and neither she nor abby thought anything of ringing long distance for hours marcuss studio was freezing but except when he had pupils he tried to put on four jerseys instead of the heating as if to save him electricity the falling snow was lighting the room thickening branch and twig filling up the winter jasmine curling inside the lank skeins of travellers joy he put the biography of rachmaninov in the bookshelf above the rows of cds tapes and scores the most charitable way you could describe the studio inside was minimalist as little clutter as possible to attract the dust mites that caused his asthma there were no carpets on the bare boards the only furniture was the steinway two pianostools and the bed on the walls apart from the bookshelf hung only the munnings of pylon peggoty his grandfathers grey given to him by rupert his asthma had been particularly bad since the messiah after spending the night with monica and edith his homesickness had been so great that he had driven out to penscombe and from the top road had watched rupert who used to bobsleigh hurtling down the fields on a toboggan in front of him sat xavier squealing with joy a pack of excited dogs followed them the yelling and barking echoing round the white valley as everything sparkled in the sunshine beneath a delphiniumblue sky then rupert had taken xavs hand and led him and the toboggan back up the hill to help taggie and bianca a dash of colour in a scarlet skiing suit make a snowman on the lawn in front of the house marcus had slumped against the steeringwheel ive failed him ive failed him and in utter despair had driven home now he was going to fail rupert again by selling the munnings he could imagine the letter arriving from sothebys weve just got in a painting that might interest you and his fathers lip curling when he saw the polaroid but the only thing in the pipeline was a concert at ilkley which would cost him as much in petrol as the fee oh god when would he get a break he was trying to learn one of liszts mephisto waltzes but as he sat down at the piano his fingers were too stiff and frozen to master the diabolical twists and turns which reminded him of rannaldini helen was pressuring him to join them both for christmas marcus would rather stay in bed without food or heating it was half a minute before he realized the telephone was ringing he only just got there this is miles brianknowles said a prim fastidious voice sorry i was miles away stammered marcus which wasnt a good start miles probably needed a babysitter instead he said the rso had been badly let down by benny basanovich says hes got flu diplomatic i imagine its a short piece only six minutes and quite honestly theres so much din going on the odd wrong note wont matter its sonny parkers interruption suite were recording it live i wondered if youd be interested ill do it marcus was desperate to accept before miles changed his mind or remembered marcus had once been so rude to peggy parker is a thousand pounds enough more than in passionate relief marcuss head dropped onto the top of the piano youve saved my life im afraid theres no time for an orchestral rehearsal but if you make your way over to the hall i can give you the score and a practice room oh thank you thank you father christmas has arrived a week early miles was touched its a pleasure i wish all transactions were as easy in her pigeon hole that evening flora found a bunch of white roses darling flora said the accompanying note just apologizing in advance for my appalling behaviour later on this evening love viking flora gave a whoop of ecstasy dancing down the passage singing boléro she went slap into george hungerford why the bloody hell dont you look where youre going dum dedede dede dede dede dum dedede sang flora weaving round him into the womens changingroom where to clare candy nellie mary hilary and junos irritation she fought for once just as fiercely as they did for a space in front of the communal mirror you dont normally wear makeup said juno accusingly you look really really pretty said clare in amazement flora broke open the cellophane with her teeth and handed her new eyeliner to nellie can you paint it on my hands are shaking too much why are you suddenly so nervous demanded hilary because my mate marcus is making his début that is one hell of a sassy dress said candy in wonder as flora slithered into a kneelength satin shift only held up by two ribbon straps you cant wear that or those spluttered hilary as flora tucked her hair into a black velvet toggle and slotted in two of vikings white roses mais bien sûr flora wrapped a black silky mantilla round her shoulders particularly as were playing boléro and clacking her fingers like castanets she danced out into the passage what has got into her asked a shocked juno sonnys interruption a grisly onenote job for orchestra piano burglaralarm fax telephone bleeper railway train backfiring car pneumatic drill coughing snoring rustling and lavatory chain was to be recorded after the interval and before boléro and the singing of carols sonny had diverted most of the brass section to the ladies lavatory to provide a flushing chorus cherub and the percussion section had gone beserk in rehearsal imitating the various sounds having plinkplonked his way through the piano part several times in his dressingroom marcus decided he couldnt be nervous about something quite so silly particularly when sonny strutted in to give lastminute advice wearing a collarless scarlet tunic white silk trousers red satin slippers and a whiteandred scarf round his ponytail hallo marcus black he said in his reedy voice you must not be daunted by the complexities mozart appeared complex too like my work the beauty richness and depth bewildered his first listeners he then suggested marcus ran through the solo paddling away with suggested fingering and shoving his bony pelvis so hard into marcuss back marcus nearly elbowed him in the groin fortunately flora barged in to wish marcus luck sonny was livid i told miles no interruptions but the work is all about interruptions shall i go out and come in and interrupt again to get you both in the mood marcus laughed sonny flounced off noone looks prettier in tails than you do said flora in delight or in black than you there was a sparkle in her eyes that marcus hadnt seen for years as he tugged the maidenhair fern from behind a white carnation graciously presented to him by peggy parker he added someone will have to turn the pages for me i shall be hidden among the violas thank god and if the audience pelts us with tomatoes i hope they put basil on them as sonny had written in no trombone parts dixie volunteered for the job as pageturner but having been boozing all day he couldnt take it seriously exciting having offstage cowbells murmured marcus as they hovered in the wings particularly when its conducted by an onstage cow said dixie as sonny minced out of the conductors room and swept him and marcus onto an exceedingly crowded platform there were overhead mikes for marcus and each section and bigger mikes dotted around the auditorium for general ambience sonny gave a little fluting speech reminding the audience they were taking part in an experience as creatively significant as the first performance of beethovens ninth symphony or schoenbergs gurrelieder remember your clap or cough will be recorded for posterity so make it loud and wait for the red light dixie proceeded to belch loudly into marcuss microphone thats the spirit cried sonny who loved big butch glaswegians but save it for the red light the audience looked frightfully excited delighted to have something as beautiful as marcus to gaze at if the music became too demanding on came the red light up started the atrocious din dixie couldnt stop laughing particularly when the lavatory chains wouldnt pull in time and the audience having been exhorted by sonny to cough as much as possible found they couldnt stop viking and barry the bass rang each other up on their mobiles and chatted throughout marcus was thumping away trying to be heard over the uproar when little cherub racing back from xylophone to cowbells took a flying leap and fell flat on his face dixie was in such hysterics he knocked marcuss score onto the floor and picking it up shoved it back upsidedown by mistake flora had also chosen that moment to wriggle out of her black mantilla viking was not the only musician to be distracted by the beauty of her shoulders dixie was so mesmerized there was no way marcus could attract his attention to put his music the right way up the only answer was to ad lib plinkplonking away to the end immediately the audience leapt to their feet applauding wildly so that their clap could be recorded for posterity only getting up to relieve their piles said dixie scornfully but marcus had slunk off the stage petrified the wrath of parker was going to descend on him for playing the wrong ending instead after taking three bows an ecstatic sonny rushed into marcuss dressingroom saying his work had never been so movingly interpreted i wept i could not understand how i could write such beautiful music mumsy mumsy cried sonny as peggy swept in in a mauve satin marquee i am going to write a concerto for marcus black marcus cringed behind the upright piano but peggy was prepared to let bygones be bygeowns and presented marcus with a large christmas hamper youve done my sonny proud we look forward to receiving you at rutminster towers cherub also received a smaller hamper for being wounded in action and the brass section were each given a bottle of champagne for pulling the chain so meaningfully gilbert and gwynneth were also in raptures they had never seen a rutminster audience enjoy themselves so much at last music was being brought to the people they made a point of seeking marcus out and commending his sensitive playing were staying in the close with canon airlie whispered gwynneth please drop in for carols and wassail later youre terribly kind marcus ducked to avoid a flying earring were going to hear a good deal more of black said gilbert as he drifted out that boys done well thought george he made a diabolical piece of music sound almost good could i have a word he asked marcus ravel had once confessed sadly that boléro was his only masterpiece and it contained no music but after sonnys selfindulgent mindless earmurdering junk boléro sounded glorious tommy stainforth principal percussion joined later by cherub his nose bleed staining his white shirt like a boy soldier in battle kept up the relentless hypnotic beat on their silver snaredrums while sections and soloists took it in turns to snake languorously in and out of the one disturbingly beautiful tune the viola players problem in boléro is keeping awake candy had warned flora but instead as the entire string section put down their bows and plucked their instruments like flamenco guitars the sound made flora burst with pride she suddenly felt part of the great heartbeat of the orchestra as the music slowly swelled to a stupendous climax with the last clashing discord from the brass thats definitely coitus noninterruptus shouted clare over the delirious torrent of applause i wish sex was as good as that it will be with viking thought flora but when she glanced round the first horns chair was empty faint with disappointment suddenly exhausted flora could hardly lift her bow during the carols and as the last notes of adeste fideles died away and the audience now in party mood called for encore viking was still missing buggered off on some date sighed candy meanwhile outside the conductors room miles was having a row with abby julian and a large blackandwhite pantomime cow we rehearsed the shepherds farewell as an encore miles was saying angrily the audience expect rodneys cow said abby firmly shes a christmas fixture the cow nodded in agreement and rubbed its furry head against abbys arm you cant lower the tone ordered miles not with the arts council present bugger the arts council said the back of the cow doing a high kick the front of the cow let out a highpitched giggle leaving no doubt as to its identity shut up hissed miles glancing round in terror gilbert and gwynneth were backstage earlier if you dont play the shepherds farewell abby heads will roll the shouts of encore and the stamp of feet were growing in volume come on you guys said abby defiantly waltzing off towards the stage miserable old bugger said the back legs as the cow lumbered after her ill have you know im still here said miles furiously such screams of joy greeted the arrival of the cow on stage that it was a few minutes before abby could make herself heard sir rodney is really disappointed not to be here to wish you all a merry christmas the audience gave a great cheer but hes a lot better right and he hopes to be back on the rostrum some time next year bravo shouted everyone meanwhile hes sent you a very special soloist the cow did a softshoe shuffle to more deafening cheers good evening mrs cow continued abby are you going to play us a tune slowly the cow nodded batting her long black eyelashes what about some mozart or perhaps some beethoven the cow shook her head or some schoenberg for a second the front of the cow deliberated wondering whether to drop the back legs in it then slowly she shook her head again i know said abby over the howls of laughter can you play us some tchaikovsky the cow nodded frantically and next moment the back half launched into the beautiful french horn solo from the second movement of the fifth symphony leaving absolutely no doubt as to his identity either and the audience went beserk but when flora finally escaped from the platform she couldnt find viking anywhere aching all over but most of all in her heart she trailed off to congratulate marcus she found him in a daze the last wellwisher had only just left the good news is he told her that george hungerford has decided to junk benny and book me for rachmaninovs third piano concerto at the end of february as flora whooped and hugged him an inner voice chided her that both abby and marcus were getting on with their careers and she was getting nowhere not even to first base with viking bitterly ashamed of being mean spirited she was doing a war dance round marcus when he continued and the bad news is that sonny is a serious bumbandit and wants me to have dinner with him omigod youll never cope with peggy as a motherinlaw lets rush off and have an indian said flora viking had obviously been playing games she thought despairingly fortytwo floras fears were confirmed as she and marcus ran towards the carpark and rounding a corner stumbled on viking and serena westwood in a huddle seeing flora mr nugent bounded forward joyfully viking had his back to her but catching sight of her red hair reflected in the window he reached behind him and grabbed her hand serena you havent met flora shes a dote a dote serena looked puzzled and not very pleased sliding his arm round floras shoulders viking drew her against his long hard body his hair was still wet from the shower he had shaved off this mornings stubble a little dote he added caressingly doteys the adjective its an irish word he curled a warm palm round floras neck means that everyone dotes on her how nice for flora said serena crisply shed heard differently from others hallo marcus she added with considerably more warmth you played beautifully and hatchet hungerfords just booked him to do rach three in feb beamed flora it was incredible that vikings hand on her neck could cure all her aches and tiredness in a second so we must celebrate we certainly mosst thats tremendous viking clapped marcus on the shoulder then turning to serena added have a good christmas darling let me know what you decide as he led flora and marcus towards the carpark he explained the playback of the requiem was so dire serena and george have decided to reschedule it with lappassionata conducting abbyll be knocked out said marcus in delight and with julian back as leader so he can play the big violin solo bill thackery will shoot himself said flora save everyone else doing the job outside six inches of snow had blanketed everything cars houses railings lampposts each blade of grass to this a heavy hoar frost had added a diamanté sparkle so the great horsechestnuts in the park seemed like glittering white clouds beneath a clear starry sky cyrils birdtable had become a weddingcake awaiting decoration and across the town the cathedral gleamed like a vast lurking iceberg nugent went beserk tunnelling his snapping snout through the snow leaping in ecstasy emerging with a whitepowdered wig on his furry black head having sent him hurtling across the park after a snowball viking scooped up more snow hardened it into another ball and closed floras hands round it josst feel it melting like my heart he whispered then turning to marcus said sorry mate i cant control myself any longer looking up flora was amazed to see the amused tenderness softening his thin face and narrowed eyes his hair gleamed as gold as mars in the moonlight as he took her hot flushed face in his long jack frost fingers she could smell the faint apple blossom of giuseppes shampoo taste toothpaste and feel the snowball clutched in her hands melting like her entrails then he kissed her first very slowly his tongue flickering over hers then harder and harder a mixture of deliberation and such passion that flora arching against him felt like a bonfire bursting into sudden spontaneous flame in the middle of the antarctic not having the superior breath control of a brass player she had to pull away first but kept her eyes shut is it really you really oh viking i am otterly otterly hooked he murmured into her hair flora jumped as like a rug suddenly laid over her knees she felt nugent leaning against her gazing up with shining eyes his tail sweeping out a black fan on the white path im enjoying watching gone with the wind called out marcus through blue lips but im about to freeze to death oh jesus im sorry said viking as his bmw slid round the close icicles were glittering from the red roofs of the queen anne houses magnolias and ceanothus in the front gardens buckled under their burdens of snow god knows how they got a licence for this place said viking as he pulled up beside a club called close encounters which was pounding out reggae music someone must have greased planning officer cardews palm again inside through the gloom the celtic mafia cherub noriko clare candy and nellie could be seen getting plastered drinking halfpints of wine out of little jugs coughing in unison and collapsing in laughter at their own jokes once viking and marcus had sat down beside them dixie started acting up he had taken a great shine to marcus and had them all in stitches offering to turn the pages of his menu for him then handing it to him upsidedown hes sonnys valentine sweet sonnys valentine sang randy everyone howled again we have got some catching up to do sighed viking looking sympathetically at marcus returning from the ladies flora took a slug of wine and nearly spat it out ugh its corked thats because youve just cleaned your teheeth said clare slyly even krug tastes vile after colgate we ought to invent a drink mixing them said marcus and call it buck teeth and gwynneth could do the ads said flora so everyone stuck out their teeth like gwynneth and giggled hysterically to stop arguments ive ordered lasagne for everyone said blue when the band took a break the rso to the other diners amazement took over randy seized a trumpet nellie and noriko picked up guitars cherub sat down at the drums marcus was persuaded to play the piano as they swung into boléro blue didnt want to dance so dixie got up with candy and clare viking and flora followed them viking was a wonderful dancer he had the endless legs and narrow rubber hips that slide into any rhythm dum dede dum dede dede dede dum dededum sang flora writhing like a charmed snake in front of him her hips occasionally grazing his body her black skirt and red hair flying marvellous beat to fock to viking drew her against him rotating his pelvis against hers ok marcus gasped flora as she emerged from his embrace two minutes later with buckling knees what would she have done if id said i wasnt wondered marcus as he idly picked out the first subject of rachmaninovs third piano concerto moody mysterious impossibly difficult music he wished he could go home and look at the score which he had only two months to learn it would be like taming a dragon hed prayed for a break like this for so long but looking across at viking and flora he felt hollow with loneliness and would have given every note of the concerto to be able to wipe abby out with the same whitehot passion marcus sighed viking had a terrible reputation he did hope flora wouldnt be hurt again and abby was going to be insane with jealousy when she found out what an awful lot of pieces to pick up the band and the lasagne arrived at the same time neither viking nor flora wanted theirs so nugent ate both its such years since anyone put me off my food said flora happily turning towards her on the benchseat blocking out the others view with his broad back viking removed her mantilla from her left shoulder examining a row of long scratches jack rodway do that no scriabin he thinks hes a witchs cat and takes flying leaps onto my bare shoulders locky scriabin viking kissed the longest scratch whyd dyou go to bed with jack i needed a practice fence i was so opset youre so glamorous flora ran a finger along his jutting lower lip one cant imagine you upset about anything except playing badly or not uniting ireland ive dreamt for a long time of being united with flora as insistent as the boléro beat his hand was stroking the inside of her arm her jawline her earlobes then she told him about carmine trying to rape her jack was the escape route he had a green exit sign on his forehead and a push bar at his waist viking laughed only by his hand tightening on her shoulder did he show his fury the basstard he said slowly and he keeps his wife in a veal crate cathie didnt have flu he broke her jaw omigod is that why blues so down they ought to elope shes so good she could easily support herself carmines ripped away every thread of her selfesteem the waiters were back with menus offering puddings viking shook his head im having a pause youre going through the male menupause said flora falling about at her own joke im sorry viking pulled her to her feet i have to fock you outside it had snowed and frozen again dyou think im too dronk to drive frankly yes said flora swinging round a lamppost if you even looked at a breathalyser it would play the drinking song why dont we try one of these bikes hearing a loud bang outside the others whod started trashing the place rushed out swinging lavatory chains to find nugent barking flora giggling in the snow viking sitting beside her rubbing her laddered knees and an ancient blue bike on its side with its wheels going round and round after that everyone had a go on it drink insulating them against the cold their shouts of laughter sending windows shooting up all round the close any grizzled head foolish enough to emerge was pelted with snowballs cherub was so drunk he kept climbing into the engine of dixies car clare kept patting a black litterbin mistaking it for mr nugent as flora had another go the seat shot upwards nearly depositing her on the ground its a fanny cycle she shrieked narrowly avoiding a pillarbox oh gilbert gilbert oh fa la la la stop that noise said a ringing voice from above oh fuck off said randy its my turn now flora vaguely marcus remembered he had been invited to a wassail party in the close clambering on board randy set off guiding the bike with one hand swinging a close encounter lavatory chain with the other shooting across the grass in the centre of the square straight through a bed of sleeping wallflowers he hit the fountain where charles i had refreshed himself during the civil war with an almighty bang the bicycle was a crumpled heap the fountain in intensive care the imprint of randys huge body lay etched in the snow but remounting the intrepid trumpeter shot off down the path falling off again so the bike carried on up a ramp and disappeared through the door of some ecclesiastical building this was followed by another loud bang to the accompaniment of police sirens quick viking seized floras hand they segregate the sexes in police cells very slowly viking drove back down the middle of the road snow on top of hoar frost had fluffed up the trees on either side like cherry orchards in bloom huge flakes drifted down soft as butterflies your place or mine asked viking oh yours said flora remembering the compost heap of her bedroom and that abby would be home viking kissed one of her hands so young and soft he said mockingly hands that dont do dishes im afraid im an awful slut but the nails are bitten i noticed that at your audition you smiled pretty as a daffodil you played in the south to tear the heartstrings but i knew you were sad im ok squeaked flora jumping as the top of the car scraped against some boweddown branches who hurt you oh christ a guy called rannaldini i was terribly young i cant talk about it ill kill anyone who hurts you somehow viking manoeuvred the car into the lane down to the lake skidding most of the way ill exorcize carmine ill exorcize rannaldini he added dismissively better buy me an exorcize bicycle said flora between towering beeches like ice cliffs the lake glittered in the moonlight arctic white along the frozen edges but with a dark badger stripe of flowing water down the centre ive always wondered what this house looks like inside said flora getting out of the car the ground floor of the bordello trebled up as a kitchen diningroom and drawingroom shabby different coloured armchairs and a dark blue sofa were grouped around an open fireplace with a huge television set on the right chucked into a corner were golf clubs tennis rackets cricket bats an old saddle football and cricket boots a notoftenscrubbed table by the oven was weighed down with old newspapers racing posts sporting lifes clares tatlers scores books shoulder pads unopened bills floras eyes however were drawn up to an oldfashioned clotheshorse from which hung white evening shirts and a rainbow riot of clothes no doubt belonging to the women in vikings life why are you so bloody promiscuous she was appalled to hear the petulance in her voice viking who was getting a key out of a blue teapot smiled sweetly like marlon brando i have to have at least three women a day to prove im not gay ive only had two this evening come here but overwhelmed with shyness and longing flora had fled upstairs to the bathroom to find more dripping tights and exotic underwear she had seen those french knickers on candy and the camisole top trimmed with blue ribbon on clare but whose was the black lacey d cup bra and the black suspender belt and the fishnet stockings oh hell hell hell furiously she cleaned her teeth again then ripped off her laddered tights and knickers washing between her legs then splashing herself over and over again with cold water in case as rannaldini had once grumbled she tasted of soap she was just nicking clares body lotion when nugent barged in rounded her up and led her back to vikings bedroom curling up on his bean bag with a long sigh flora looked at the huge brass fourposter hiding in its dark red rosepatterned curtains and shivered the curtains on either side of the window overlooking the lake were drawn but viking had opened the ones overlooking the white wilderness of garden so the moonlight flooded the room oh please nugent begged flora give me a few tips so i can be more exciting than the others whipping off her dress she was about to dive under the dark green duvet when she was distracted by the squares of moonlight on the bare floorboards unzipping his jeans as he came through the door viking found flora silverwhite as a unicorn hair and small breasts flying as she hopscotched back and forth on the moonlit squares her skin was as cool and satiny as new beech leaves she tasted so sweet and fresh as he kissed her before gathering her up and laying her out on the clean white sheets without any hurry he began to stroke her flora tried to be cool as the leisurely caresses crept down her increasingly excited body but couldnt help gasping with pleasure as his fingers slid inside her viking gasped too jesus sweetheart you really want me he was still wearing boxer shorts covered in golden retrievers carrying the irish times as he peeled them off his cock shot upwards oh wow cubed flora stretched out a hand and you truly want me now i know why yeats kept banging on about irish towers shot op vikings big grinning mouth stopped hers and his infinitely delicate caresses continued until flora was squirming with ecstasy she was dying to come yet some tension some passionate desire not to bore him prevented her so she wriggled out of his grasp down the bed to go down on him instantly he pulled her back burying his head between her legs a blond haystack at the end of her white sweep of belly his fingers stroking her nipples go on angel he mumbled go for it weve got for ever ive never tasted anything so delicious his tongue rotated languorously flora took several quick breaths and came god you sweet little girl viking bounded up the bed pressing his mouth on hers that was bliss sighed flora let me give you pleasure please you are viking slid his cock inside her and began to move aaaaaah moaned flora god thats wonderful clare was quite wrong about boléro being better than the real thing they made love all night wallowing in pleasure constantly changing position around quarter to five flora discovered why viking had been nervous of her going down on him as she parted his legs and bent her head to kiss her way up the inside of one of his wonderfully hard muscular thighs she discovered in the moonlight a tattoo saying i love juno and burst out laughing thats a bit arbitrary i was pissed said viking sheepishly what on earth did juno think she was terrified id start flashing it around like an engagement ring shes amazingly pretty but what made you fall in love with her viking shrugged shes small minded suburban and terribly cross but when i held that tiny waist between my hands and watched her ride me i guess a standing cock has no taste yours tastes lovely flora crouched over him her tongue was snaking round the rim searching out pleasure points probing the top groaning with pleasure viking let her continue until he was about to explode then he wriggled out from under her pointing a long finger at the clock beside the bed whose red numbers said it was five oclock that was one of rodneys great sayings what no sea too rough no muff too tough we dive at five she could feel his shoulders shaking with laughter please come back and fuck me viking slid back inside her gently stroking her face with the back of his fingers you are so lovely and you sighed flora are a midwinter nights dream come true at eight flora staggered out of bed i ought to go home ive got to change and have a bath have one here im not letting you out of my sight as she opened the curtains overlooking the lake a faint band of orange lay along the horizon above out of a pearly grey sky shone venus like a huge glittering snowflake oh look the planet of love is smiling at us oh christ at the crunch of passing car wheels flora shut the curtains with a snap its abby going to work shes not going to be very pleased with us fortythree three hours later george barged into the middle of a rehearsal and bawled his musicians out for behaving like hooligans his fury was fuelled by the sight of flora still in last nights black dress cowering behind fat isobel youre a bluddy disgrace he thundered and i want everyone who was in close encounters last night to write a personal letter of apology to gilbert greenford from the arts council whose pushbike you totalled last night gilbert has had that bike clara since he was at university back in the fifteenth century piped up cherub shut ooop roared george as various musicians started to laugh couldnt the stupid fuckers realize the influence the arts council had on their future and how near the edge they were the cost of a new bike and seven toilet chains will be docked off your salaries flora will have to consult her lawyer shouted randy whoops sorry he added as he received a deathray scowl from george abby was also furious any delight that shed been vindicated by the rescheduling of rachels requiem was wiped out by her misery and excruciating jealousy that flora had finally got off with viking refusing to admit this publicly she later worked off her rage bellyaching about the state of the cottage and floras tip of a room in particular until even marcus told her to shut up bloody judgemental home grumbled flora and promptly moved in with viking for the weekend neither emerging from the bedroom except to let nugent out every time abby drove into rutminster she was sent flying by delivery vans from oddbins the pizza house or the star of india belting the other way george just managed to forgive the rest of the rso in time for the staff christmas party which also ushered in centenary year miss priddock supervised the food including a chocolate birthday cake with a hundred candles the brass players blew up the balloons hilary was furious because randy had taken a photograph of her surreptitiously reading the scorpion and pinned it on the noticeboard life had been very hard since lionel left but with a martyred air she joined forces with juno in decorating the band room romance watchers also were aware that every time juno put up pale blue paperchains george hungerford seemed to materialize from the fifth floor to hold the ladder and admire her delicate ankles flora nervous her job might be in jeopardy as a peace offering bought george a pair of musical socks decorated with santas and reindeers which played jingle bells whenever you pulled them up as george made no comment he obviously thought flora was sending him up hilary tartly refused her offer of help with the decorations so flora retreated to the park to make a snowwoman waving a stick with cherub she didnt know why she was feeling depressed tiredness and posttoomanycoituses probably underneath she was miserable about hurting abby and persuaded dixie to ask abby to take part in the christmas party cabaret abby was touchingly grateful what would you like me to do what you do best play your violin and get young marcus to accompany you well put you on late in the evening give him time to get a bit oiled the cabaret kicked off with randy in a dark curly wig with two melons stuck into the front of clares black dress coming on as dame hermione and screeching i know that my redeemer liveth francis the good loser who didnt have to dress up at all came on as the drunken tramp who tried to outsing her both were caterwauling away and the audience were holding their sides when in stumped blue in one of miss priddocks tweed suits wearing thick tights brogues a monocle and a porkpie hat as dame edith having driven the tramp off with a huntingwhip she started chatting up hermione youre a lovely little filly what does your dbe stand for dame of the bottom enormous simpered hermione i know that my redeemer oh cut that crap boomed edith i hear the shits hit the fanny cycle over the rso theyll never get their arts council grant now id rather have hugh grant sighed hermione i know that my shut up repeated edith goodo here come gilbert and sillyone to give us the lowdown bellows of laughter screams of joy and even tighter lips from miles and hilary who was taking a lot of photographs greeted the entrance of viking he was wearing a mauveandorange caftan a grey wig with a lopsided bun an even more lopsided bosom stickingout teeth from the joke shop and earrings made from school band cymbals which he crashed whenever he was making a point he also kept greedily taking bites out of an enormous christmas pudding i must have desserts he announced exactly capturing gwynneths refined north london whine a bombe surprise a day keeps hungerford away viking was followed by dixie in an identical caftan as goaty gilbert he was carrying an urn with the words clara on the side and wiping his eyes with a long ginger beard hallo sillyone demanded edith whats in that urn dont upset gilbert whispered gwynneth his cycle clara passed away last wednesday were off to scatter her ashes on vinifred trapps grave i know that my redeemer squawked hermione actually not quite all claras ashes confided gwynneth as gilbert gave a great sob gilbert has donated her handlebars to a cooperative for battered pushbikes so she can be recycled as intristing earrings to enable me to black a few more peoples eyes viking put down his pudding stuck out his teeth and gave his cymbal earrings a great crash peering from the wings flora saw that george was crying with laughter he is human after all she hissed to abby what happened to clara enquired dame edith battered to death by the celtic mafia sobbed gilbert they must be punished surely the celtic mafia are an ethnic minority and therefore exonerated from all blame asked hermione certainly not gwynneth crashed her cymbals they are white male and heterosexual so it doesnt count gimme their address squealed hermione ah here comes our favourite patron of the arts piggy porker good evening to you piggy this has gone too far hissed miles to a crescendo of cheering and hysterical laughter as a heavily padded grotesquely over madeup flora teetered on in blue stilettos and a sickgreen spangled dress snorting loudly and waving a parkers carrier bag i quite agree george wiped his eyes but it is bluddy funny somehow flora achieved a wobbly curtsy good evening your dameships she snorted ay would so laike to create new looks for you both any face is improved by subtle makeup and reaching into her parkers bag she slammed custard pies in ediths and hermiones faces i know that my redeemer screeched hermione spitting out cream and pastry have you got a mirror i dont carry one said dame edith you both look much younger went on piggy parker ive come to invite you all to a brown treouser event at parkers next week my sonny is oh heres sonny to tell you himself despite the yells of approval and laughter noone at first recognized the concave fop who minced in in a red tunic and floppy white trousers because the face was almost entirely concealed by curtains of straggly hair i am the rsos composerinundesirable residence fluted sonny crashing vikings earrings but its getting me nowhere because ive fallen madly in love with marcus black and he wont return my calls marcus gave a gasp of horror and delight abby you bitch he said its abby screamed nellie thats brilliant i want him to play on my portable organ abby tried to make herself heard over the whistling stamping and yells of approval but george was on his feet sprinting out through the exit round onto the stage stopping the performance before jerry could video anything more or hilary take any more photographs im sorry thats enoof he shouted from the rostrum to equal boos and cheers mrs parker sonny gilbert and gwynneth all said they might look in later and i for one dont want the rso committing pooblic suicide joost yet i joost wish all you boogers would put as much creative energy into your musicmaking but i have to admit it was bluddy foony packing the cast off to seats in the auditorium he then congratulated the orchestra on some good concerts but said it was high time they stopped behaving like hooligans we moost capitalize on centenary year to put the rso in the black again as was customary he then asked them to drink to their musical director abby had pulled off her wig and her beard and ruffled her dark curls a week of sleepless nights over viking and flora made her look pale and vulnerable you are a great orchestra she said in a choked voice when the drunken cheers had died down and weve always programmed great composers so if weve managed to make great music i have only been the catalyst thank you for putting up with me god i feel a cow said flora as viking slid an arm round her shoulders abbys so lovely she may not be so lovely when we go back to the cottage together later murmured viking randys wife and his motherinlaw had descended unexpectedly to christmas shop and intended to spend the night in the bordello great armfuls of female underwear had been hastily chucked in the cellar viking had agreed to vacate his bedroom for randys motherinlaw and planned an away fixture flora was extremely twitchy about abby on rolled miss priddocks cake on its trolley the hundred candles were lit which set off the smoke alarm so five butch firemen suddenly appeared everyone was convinced they were a stripagram so they stayed on for the party to nellies delight rodney had sent six crates of moët over as a christmas present so everyone had plenty to drink very generously under the circumstances peggy parker had given each member of the orchestra a turkey blue didnt get a chance to speak to cathie because carmine was watching her but he did manage to slip a little sapphire ring into the pocket of her coat hanging up in the ladies and prayed shed find it by eleven oclock marcus slightly drunk and happy because hed felt hed comforted abby a little in the last week had lost his nerves enough to play the piano not realizing how many people had stopped to listen and started to dance he meandered through gershwin and cole porter then launched into a seventies hit called madly in love with abby accompanying him swooningly on the violin what he didnt realize was that abby had persuaded charlton handsome to slip a recording mike in front of him which also picked up the ecstatic cheering and shouts for more at the end that recordingll be worth a fortune one day murmured julian boy plays like an angel george said proudly to miles im right glad we booked him abby and marcus left soon afterwards because she was flying back to philadelphia first thing the following morning as flora and viking tottered out arm in arm several hours later they found eldred on the h p hall steps weeping at the prospect of a wifeless christmas im coming back to woodbine cottage on boxing day flora comforted him ill ring you you must come and try our erratic cooking and marcus you and i can play chamber music we could start off with the mozart trio flora only stopped crying over eldred as viking drove over rutminster bridge and pointed out a very drunk davie buckle hurling his turkey into the river fleet yelling go on you bastard fly trying to creep in without turning on any lights flora and viking knocked over an umbrella stand and fell over abbys cases already out on the landing abby pulled a pillow over her head in anguish would she ever sleep again it seemed only seconds later that she was woken up by horrifying screams wrapping her naked body in a towel tiptoeing onto the landing she could hear viking saying its ok sweetheart im here its ok he sounded so tender and loving almost deranged with misery abby could hardly read her watch fivethirty she had to leave for heathrow in an hour she might as well get up tottering wearily downstairs she found it was still dark rain was rattling against the windows pounding away the last patches of snow on the lawn as she filled up the kettle she heard piteous mewing frightened away earlier by nugent but seeing a light on sibelius had jumped onto the ledge and was squashing his drenched fur against the windowpane oh poor baby abby opened the window and whipping off her towel began to dry him crooning how much she was going to miss him patting his piebald face squeezing water out of his furry tail only when he was purring and almost dry did she hear a wolfwhistle and whipped round to her horror lounging in the doorway wearing only jeans and a highly amused smirk on his evil debauched face was viking she had no idea how long hed been there what in hell are you doing she howled ouch she screamed as a terrified sibelius dug his claws into her breasts ive just come down to make a cup of tea flora had a nightmare said viking called viking oneill sobbed abby seizing her towel crashing against the door to avoid touching him she fled upstairs poor sibelius was mewing again hoping for an early breakfast switching on the kettle viking picked him up his face was expressionless as burying it in the cats fur he breathed in abbys scent depressed that abby seemed almost suicidal when he got up to wave her off marcus was cheered when the post brought a christmas card from taggie containing three hundred pounds smuggled out of her private account but it didnt make up for not hearing from rupert and marcus was so cast down by an enchanting photograph in the daily express of rupert taggie xav and bianca arriving in monhaut for a skiing christmas that flora persuaded him to come home to paradise and stay with her parents i shall be playing the referees whistle so you can accompany me we must drop off a bottle of whisky on the way for poor eldred despite viking ringing every day from dublin flora was ashamed how thrilled she was to hear that helens christmas with rannaldinis exwives and bratpack had been a disaster she had never been gregarious and rannaldinis endless sexual games had absolutely horrified her i could have told you helen of troilism wasnt a viable proposition quipped flora marcus was demented i should have gone out there to protect her what helen hadnt told him was that for christmas rannaldini had given her a blank cheque to have her face breasts and bottom lifted but you said in prague you loved me as i am sobbed helen i did and i know it will hurt dreadfully purred rannaldini but i want you to be even more beautiful also if helen was confined to barracks recovering from surgery it would give him more free time fortyfour after their fortnight off the rso sank into deep gloom life seemed to be summed up by franciss turkey which he had forgotten to take home and which was found in the band room under nellies camisole top belching forth maggots francis had other things on his mind his house had been repossessed and he had moved into a council flat my children are on free dinners he said wearily my milkman earns more than i do marythemotherofjustin was horrified to find she was pregnant her husband had lost his smart job in television and was at home looking after justin and giving mary a lot of grief everyone except carmine hilary and juno had overspent at christmas couldnt pay their bills and were chasing after fewer teaching jobs as the education departments slashed the music grants to colleges and schools flora was delighted to have a letter from eldred thanking her for the christmas bottle of whisky but worried that she got no answer when she kept ringing to invite him to supper finally police broke in on january and found eldred had been dead for a week from an overdose the empty bottle of whisky was at his feet he was clutching his clarinet and the mozart trio which he had obviously been planning to play with flora and marcus was on the musicstand the gramophone was still on he had been listening to one of his old records if he hadnt had his coffee black people would have known from the milk bottles sobbed flora if id rung earlier i might have saved him everyone was too stunned and ashamed to oppose hilary when she immediately applied for eldreds job of first clarinet she was soon busy auditioning candidates for second clarinet one should intercept them at the hp hall gate said viking hissing escape while you can dont work with that bitch with her stepup to section leader hilarys bossiness increased a thousandfold she was singing madrigals regularly with miles gwynneth and gilbert jogging round the close with miles kept her in good shape for running to him if there was any trouble the only good thing about eldreds death was that abby and flora made it up united in their distress abby had already brought flora some rosin mixed with meteor dust back from america as a christmas present flora more generous and much more guilty had given abby a scarlet cashmere poloneck she also tried to play down her raging and continuing affaire with viking viking as part of his exorcize campaign had given flora a toy black sheep for christmas called rannaldini youve got to meet it head on darling abby pretended she was no longer interested in viking but as a postchristmas fitness regime took to jogging round the lake on her first thursday back her progress was impeded by the dustcart outside the bordello she nearly fell down a rabbit hole as viking hurtled out barefoot and just in jeans his eyes swollen and practically closed with sleep waving a twentypound note to persuade the dustmen to remove the battalions of empties as she jogged home abby could see viking mr nugent and all the dustmen across the lake still standing outside the bordello clutching beer cans and laughing uproariously as a result woodbine cottages dustbins werent emptied until midday vikings teaching my lad the orn boasted one of the dustmen he finks the world of viking his hobby seems to be ornithology said abby sourly the orchestras black gloom was not improved by increasingly sinister rumours of an intended merger between the cco and the rso flying around like seagulls above a plough cotchester ballet company accompanied by the cco had been staging popular classics during the schoolholidays and had pinched a large chunk of the rsos audience one tuesday in the middle of january george summoned abby to his office he was in a bad mood anyway an ancient sitting tenant was frustrating his attempts to convert four adjacent freeholds in park lane into a splendid office block which would retain the early nineteenthcentury façade when the old biddy rejected a cash offer george moved the heavies in to frighten her whereupon she had called up the daily mirror who had chewed george out in a doublepage spread that morning george pulled no punches therefore when he told abby the orchestras deficit was the largest ever to win the audiences back they must cross over which meant programming gershwin rodgers and hammerstein and other nonclassical music in the second half abby was appalled were a symphony orchestra for chrissake not for much longer its the only way we might survive and im planning a huge gala centenary concert in may ive already got feelers out for dancer maitland and georgie maguire theyll break the bank for starters you know georgies floras mother if george didnt he wasnt going to admit it cant hold that against the poor woman he said nastily come in miles looking sanctimonious and disapproving miles sat down on a highbacked chair with his knees rammed together and handed george some faxes the first was a blank page from the arts council is this supposed to be our next years grant demanded george miles smiled thinly the first page didnt print out the second page did and turned out to be a furious letter from gilbert plus a photostat of a newspaper photograph of himself gwynneth peggy parker and sonny as portrayed by dixie viking flora and abby in the christmas cabaret someone had obviously leaked it to the rutminster echo the urn viking was brandishing with clara written clearly on the side had particularly offended gilbert just for a second georges lips twitched then he read on now we know what your musicians think both of the arts council and their most generous patron and when am i going to receive compensation for my cycle it was a bit of harmless fun protested abby not harmless with next years grant about to be handed out snapped george that bitch hilary must have leaked it she was taking photographs the whole time hilly wouldnt do a thing like that spluttered miles hilly only thinks of the good of the rso unlike some hilly now thought abby they are getting thick fortunately john drummond chose that moment to seriously endanger a fiftythousandpound perspex model of a neotudor shopping precinct as he weaved round it landing with a thud on georges knee he started shredding gilberts fax with his paws abby burst out laughing but was brought sharply back to earth by miles accusing her of taking no interest in the orchestras educational projects we must make musical excellence available to the widest possible audience he added pompously as the last major educational project the rso got involved in snapped abby was a search for respighis birds in the forest of dean and randy and dixie and four schoolgirls vanished for over a week i dont figure this is feasible in january theyd all die of hypothermia dont be silly said george wincing as druramonds claws punctured his pinstriped thighs anyway i havent got the time countered abby ive got far too much repertoire to learn if we switched to more popular fare miles cracked his fingers youd know it already and you could start george added curtly by wasting less time with flora seymour shes a pernicious influence george had not forgiven flora for alphonsos case gilberts bike or the musical socks which had played jingle bells when hed absentmindedly tugged them up during a crucial meeting with the department of the environment shes not your greatest fan either said abby disloyally well she better watch her back rather hard said miles bitchily when she spends so much time on it nor did she help matters by suggesting in her letter of apology to gilbert greenford that he should replace clara with a harley davidson abby laughed it is not funny said miles primly and as musical director you ought to be seen to do more for charity abby lost her temper all my spare cash ok goes to the cats protection league and i dont mean old tabby cats either abby glared pointedly at miles get off my back both of you all the perspex models trembled and john drummond shot up the brushed suede wall as she walked out slamming the door cooling down she wandered into the general office and learnt from the noticeboard that the rso were currently doing a project at st clements primary school as there was no rehearsal that morning she decided to pop in on the way home she was not cheered switching on the car radio to hear hugo playing the violin solo in mozarts sinjonia concertante that was the cco one of our great little orchestras said henry kelly oh shut up said abby it had been raining for days the river fleet had flooded its banks st clements playingfields were under water inhibiting outdoor activity which probably explained the unholy din issuing from the building when the secretary directed her to a faroff classroom however abby was flabbergasted to find viking perched on the edge of a desk telling a group of enraptured eight year olds about the french horn they were engaged in a project on rutminster in the seventeenth century charles the king of england spent a lot of time fighting viking was saying and in the end he had his head chopped off probably because his hair was longer than mine the children laughed but on his day off he often enjoyed a days hunting in the blackmere woods and used a horn to sommon his hounds picking up his horn viking blew pa pa pa pa on it this was a sound that the dogs could hear all over the forest nugent who was sitting beside a little boy in a wheelchair put his head on one side seeing abby viking gave a brief nod you can play the horn on anything he went on producing a piece of hose pipe from a gap carrier bag coiling it up he handed one end to the little boy in the wheelchair and then played god save the queen on the other finally he made the children shriek with laughter by opening the teachers big handbag which shed left on top of the piano and magicking out a red suspender belt a pair of black lace knickers a banana a fluffy toy monkey who pretended to eat the banana and finally a huge bag of toffees which he handed round the class the teacher who had a lot of freckles and a sweet open face was clearly bats about him too vikings a natural with kids she told abby joey in the wheelchairs really come out of himself since hes been visiting us these are the pictures theyve been drawing proudly she pointed to a mural of cavaliers horses jolly hounds trees wild flowers and a deer miles away with no chance of getting caught when that bully carmine jones came to teach an older class about the trumpet the teacher lowered her voice they gave him such a rough ride he came out nearly in tears could they give me their secret sighed abby as the bell went viking told the children theyd all got to make a valentine for their teacher bye sweetheart he added kissing her ill call you outside it was still raining and viking tipped a black wool cap over his nose it was a christmas present from rodney who knew how viking hated getting his hair wet because it kinked so unbecomingly there had been rows in the past because viking kept pinching miss priddocks flowered souwester to go to the pub lets go and have a drink he said putting his arm through abbys the pub garden was filled with aconites and snowdrops a hazel tree draping its sulphuryellow catkins over the gate like zeus in a shower of gold waiting for danaë reminded abby of viking the pub was warm and dark as she took refuge on a corner seat she was glad she was wearing her new red cashmere poloneck but she was determined not in any way to betray to viking how desperately she fancied him thanks she accepted a large glass of white wine deliberately not allowing their fingers to touch having downed a third of a pint of beer and wiped the froth off his lips with the back of his hand viking sat down at right angles to her long legs so wide apart his knee nearly grazed hers staring her out in amusement well that was kinda impressive stammered abby i never saw you as a pied piper musics being left to die on its feet in schools said viking suddenly angry theres no band any more no singing no hymns at compulsory assembly kids cant learn an instrument any longer unless their parents can afford the extra fees for lessons gradually the orchestras will die because therell no longer be a pool of bright young musicians to draw from he shook his head sorry im getting heavy no its great abby was thrilled to glimpse a more serious viking no thanks she shook her head as he offered her a packet of crisps im also glad of a chance to talk i wanted to discuss your section you do i just adore cyril went on abby he was obviously a great musician once but his lips have gone and hes always drunk thats an exaggeration said viking coldly well he reeks of booze he retires in four years time why cant he teach too shy those kids today would make dogmeat out of him abby took a gulp of wine to strengthen her resolve hes pulling back the orchestra the orchestrall have to pull a bit harder then i dont want to discoss it the most delectable smells were wafting in from the kitchen abby proceeded to lecture him and viking to disagree with her until a barmaid in a tight gentianblue sweater and an emeraldgreen mini skirt came over with the menu dyou want to order viking im not sure thats a fantastic sweater then turning to abby asked do you want some lunch abby shook her head irritably ive got far too much work viking smiled up at the waitress can i have my bill irish stews delicious i could do you a takeaway viking eyed her up there are things id rather take away the waitress giggled ill get you your bill cant you pass anything up snapped abby she was still lecturing him about his profligate lifestyle as they reached the carpark viking took her car keys and opened her door im sorry to get heavy muttered abby but i dont want you to hurt flora she was absolutely blown away by rannaldini viking looked at abby in that amused wicked testing way until she had turned as red as her jersey i wont hurt flora he said softly i adore her shes a soul mate stonningly gorgeous and amazingly loyal to you he added sharply then why do you do a number on every woman you meet dont you think my numbers add up to the sum of human happiness turning viking waved to two of the barmaids who were still gazing at him out of the pub window i dont know said abby crossly i guess youre just a womanizer im not a womanizer said viking im a charmer grabbing her he kissed her on the mouth sticking his tongue down her throat putting up absolutely no resistance abby kissed him back until her pulses were thundering like the nearby millstream and she could hardly stand up but as she pulled away to draw breath viking let her go only way to shot you up darling laughing he sauntered off towards his car back at the cottage marcus was listening to pablo gonzales playing rachmaninovs third piano concerto how perfect how effortless how beautiful oh christ he was saying he was slowly getting to grips with the concerto and only occasionally allowed himself to listen to recordings terrified of being overinfluenced its a bit quick said flora who was combing tangles out of a protesting scriabin i prefer kissin more languorous and tender i like kissins applause at the end sighed marcus what can we do this afternoon to stop me eating pleaded flora who was on a diet whichever way shed put her knickers on that morning they had felt back to front she suspected she was stuffing her face because rannaldini had just won the coveted conductor of the year award under his direction the new world had won orchestra of the year and winifred trapps harp concertos newly released were receiving ecstatic reviews flora couldnt open a paper without rannaldinis face glaring out at her she didnt feel any better when abby floated in just been having a drink with viking where did you meet him asked flora he was teaching at st clements good to see him occupying his time profitably for a change i cannot understand people who are supertalented and lazy i can said flora taking a tub of icecream out of the freezer and dont you get mad at the way he chats up every woman he meets nooh said flora seizing a spoon vikings attractive ill grant you that george chewed me out earlier this morning but i guess underneath his animosity hes kinda attracted to me like viking is or he wouldnt bully me so much thats a false argument said flora with her mouth full carmine bullies cathie i figure george would be a better bet than viking reflected abby georgie porgie black pudding and pie flora took another large spoonful if it was a choice between mr wrong but romantic oneill and mr right but repulsive hungerford i know who id choose its weird george doesnt like you either said the evertactful abby marcus winced he wished abbys almost pathological jealousy of flora didnt make her so bitchy he knew that shed regret this conversation later oh hell said flora miserably looking down at the empty icecream tub and chucking it into the sink the telephone rang its mr wrong but romantic a returning marcus gave a faint smirk for flora ive just kissed abby were vikings first words i guessed said flora she was listing my shortcomings your comings are never short flora was happy to hear vikings relieved laughter i love you and need you he begged come over at once id come and collect you but i dont want any more lectures abby couldnt hide her exasperation tell viking to keep that damn dog under control hes always round here upending dustbins just like his master appassionata fourth movement fortyfive cash crisis followed cash crisis throughout the winter bad weather kept audiences away in droves george told the orchestra they might even have to take cuts in salaries two more players had their houses repossessed and moved into awful rented rooms where people banged on the wall if they practised a bass player a cellist and one of the second violins left and were not replaced even julian was downcast well be a string quartet at this rate he said gloomily floras answer to her bank manager was to tell miles she had an appointment with the dentist in harley street and to go busking on the south bank one of vikings mates at the london philharmonic orchestra had arranged for her to have a slot she chose a horribly cold grey morning and had great difficulty in getting out of bed returning to earth after making love slumped on her back fingers resting on her forehead she glanced sideways at the watch on her wrist worried about missing the train and saw that instead of figures and hands the dial was filled with roses reflected from the curtains of vikings fourposter time ceases to exist when im with you she said in a choked voice its turned to roses youve made me terribly happy she added kissing him im so grateful viking drove her to rutminster station then casually as the train was moving out he said how about you and me getting our own place together dyou think nugent could learn to love scriabin will you ever be serious id like it love it stammered flora its just such a surprise as long as i can pay my way i dont want to be a kept woman you can be a capped woman then removing rodneys cap viking plonked it on her head be careful if anyone asks you for a drink say no i love you said flora and despite the cold stayed watching him until he was out of sight london was much colder than rutminster flora felt so sorry for the shivering sweeps of purplyblue crocuses in the parks and the almond trees whose pink blossom forced out by a mild january was already being scattered by a vicious wind the newsagents windows scarlet with valentine day displays provided the only cheerful note she must buy a really gorgeous card for viking and a big jokey one for mr nugent from scriabin she couldnt believe hed asked her to move in with him but allowed her thoughts to wander happily he was so good with kids hed make a brilliant father and flora oneill sounded so much more romantic than flora seymour oh god let her not be too presumptuous she took up her position in concert hall approach under hungerford bridge in a little paved garden with boxes full of trailing ivy and laurel bushes at first she tried to put up a stand but the wind blew her music all over the place so she played by ear soon concertgoers on their way to the festival hall and office workers setting off to lunch were enjoying her exquisite sound feeling sorry for her playing on such a cold day and chucking coins and even notes into her tin it was hard to say thank you when you were playing the viola so flora made do with smiles and massive nods after in the south an old man asked her if shed made any records and between the pink panther and panis angelicus a blushing couple asked if shed play at their wedding flora said shed adore to and gave them her telephone number then she nearly dropped her viola in the middle of where eer you walk as she saw george hungerford perhaps hed come to admire his bridge jump out of a taxi and dive into the archduke wine bar opposite he was probably in london for a meeting of the association of british orchestras shed be sacked if he saw her flora pulled vikings cap over her nose the next moment her bow really did skid all over the strings as a sleek dark blue mercedes drew up a blackleatherclad chauffeur jumped out and opened the door for rannaldini hearing such discords rannaldini immediately swung round but flora had dived behind a concrete pillar rannaldini was wearing his black overcoat with the astrakhan collar and looked as fatally glamorous as ever flora wanted to race through the traffic fall at his feet and plead with him to take her back she wasnt cured in the slightest in horror she watched him walk quickly towards the archduke and the manager fling open the door to welcome him congratulating him no doubt on being the greatest conductor of the year and of all time for a second a bus blotted out her view a minute later through a jungle of glossy dark green plants flora could see him and george sitting down at a table on the first floor rannaldini was unfolding his napkin and laying it across those ironhard thighs that had gripped her once with such lust now he was picking up the wine list god he was wearing a weddingring helen must have far more influence on him than poor kitty please make him look at me please make him not prayed flora launching into didos lament and what the hell was he doing with george frozen but oblivious to the cold because the pain in her heart was so terrible she watched george and rannaldini coming out forty minutes later both looking much more cheerful they stood talking for half a minute until rannaldinis merc glided up and whisked them both away flora walked off in deep shock forgetting to take her tin of money what could they be up to no good if rannaldini had anything to do with it but the rso was far too smallfry for him it was only when she got back to rutminster and passed the newsagent on the platform that she realized there was no point getting a valentine card for viking then she started to cry viking was utterly angelic so youre not over rannaldini no no not at all im so sorry viking its like thinking youve zapped cancer then discovering youre only in remission youve been so lovely to me let me go on being lovely josst give it time sweetheart it was the nearest he got to begging we cant not if im still in love with rannaldini youre too well decent to put up with halfmeasures so young and so untender said viking bitterly so young my lord and true just to test floras total immunity viking tried another tack why didnt he mix business with pleasure by making a play for jessica georges thick but stunning secretary then i can lure her back to the bordello for long lunches when george is away and you can raid the files and see what the dirty duo are really op to viking winced when flora agreed listlessly but without any display of jealousy that this would be a very good idea but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you he said sadly taking floras hand he then went out and got drunk he was far too proud to show it but he was desperately unhappy for the first time in his life valentines day temporarily distracted the rso from their gloom suddenly red envelopes were nesting like robins in pigeon holes still shellshocked by her sighting of rannaldini flora hardly noticed how many she received blue reeled round the band room in ecstasy because he recognized cathies writing on the envelope sending him a chocolate heart militant moll ordered ninion to put a valentine message in the independent and left it lying around poor fat isobel sent three cards to herself to avoid humiliation all cyrils weeks wages went on two dozen red roses for miss priddock miles smirked to get an unsigned jokey card from brittlecombe the village in which hilary lived noriko was thrilled to have a valentine teddy bear holding a single red rose from cherub dixie and clare randy and candy dimitri and miss parrott all went out to individual valentine dinners george hungerford was distracted for ten minutes from the deficit while he opened his cards all the managements secretaries including miss priddock who had to think of john drummonds future and most of the women musicians still harboured hopes of becoming the second mrs hungerford viking who got twice as many cards didnt bother to open them jessica georges lovely secretary however was overwhelmed at lunchtime to receive a balloon in the shape of a pink heart bearing the words hiya sexy rising out of two dozen pale pink roses accompanied by a card saying love from viking earlier in the day jessica had been feeling a bit low george had called her a blithering idiot for booking a pianist to play bartóks second piano concerto rather than his first which had been rehearsed by the orchestra a mistake only discovered on the afternoon of the concert viking reassured her it was the easiest of mistakes he was so comforting the following day after jessica had another bollocking from george for passing drunks pm on an invitation when it should have been drinks that she accepted a dinner invitation during the evening viking learnt that the confidential files were stored on microfilm in georges office and handled by georges london secretary who usually came down one day a week acting dumb viking told jessica he was only bog irish and had never seen a really sophisticated computer system before over a bottle of moët in jessicas office on the second date he managed to persuade her since she was so brilliant to initiate him into its mysteries jessica was feeling low that day because george had bawled her out for typing piggy porker on a place card immensely flattered by vikings admiration jessica showed him how to find the index which was called the file menu how to locate the individual file one wanted and then how to print it out of course ive never looked at any of these files she said they are far too secret george would sack me at a fleeting glance at the file menu viking couldnt see any reference to rannaldini but during a steamy session after jessica had drunk seveneighths of the moët he managed to elicit the password georgetown needed to enter the system but you must promish promish not to tell anyone whispered the delectable jessica georgetown cried viking in elation as he entered her system having stopped himself coming too soon by studying the photographs of mel gibson and kittens and a poster calling for the banning of veal crates viking lay back afterwards playing she loves me she loves me not with the chewinggum parked under jessicas desk it came out she loves me not jessica was far prettier and had a far more beautiful body but viking was missing flora so much it killed him somehow she had to be freed from rannaldinis evil spell in late february george went skiing no doubt to put another million in his swiss bank account said flora sourly by coincidence it was noticed juno meadows had taken the same week off george was due back late wednesday afternoon in anticipation miss priddock took herself off to the hairdresser in her lunchhour and viking lured jessica back to the bordello for a long lunch leaving flora free to raid the files shaking with terror that she would trigger off an alarm or someone would come in flora locked herself into georges office it was rather like a sweet little village with all those perspex models with their balconies loofah bay trees and dinky cars outside the front door somehow their cosiness blinded one to the tragedies behind their realization the terrified old ladies the threats of kneecapping the flooded basements the doors knocked out in the middle of the night the only jolly note was john drummond fatly asleep in georges outtray and a bunch of cyrils yellow crocuses like a little gold sun on the big desk realizing what an ugly customer she was dealing with flora quailed but after all vikings hard work she must be brave turning on the computer she was confronted with a screen as blank as rannaldinis face until the words enter password came up her hands were trembling so much she had three goes before she managed to type in georgetown eureka there was the main menu running hastily down through the files office accounts foreign tours salaries she came to the word private locating the private file menu she found far more exciting fare she was tempted to stop and read the private detectives report on georges wifes adultery or the details of various property fiddles the cotchester bypass for example was scheduled to go slap through ruperts estate serve him right for being such a sod to marcus even more interesting would be the assessments on members of the rso bloody hell she couldnt go through every file she jumped nervously as john drummond gave a great snore in his outtray looking back at the list of files she noted the innocuous words orchestra south scrolled the cursor down the page and double clicked to get into the file got it in one with increasing moans of horror she realized she had unearthed a fiendish plot to merge the cotchester chamber orchestra with the rso and form a new southern super orchestra rannaldini had always been wildly jealous of simon rattle and longed for the same sort of setup as the vienna philharmonic and the vienna state opera where the musical director had control of a pool of crack musicans who could be called on to play for either company as soon as edith spink retired later in the year rannaldini would take over as musical director of the cco abbys contract wouldnt be renewed after march nor would those of most of the rso this is the only way we can hack out the dead wood rannaldini had written to george the date was january had hermione introduced george to rannaldini after messiah julian would be fired because he had defied rannaldini in new york viking blue simon dimitri and peter were among the few players who would join the new super orchestra between them george and rannaldini would build it back to double strength with virtuoso players in every department running her eye down the list flora saw that surprisingly george had put a question mark beside her name then she gave a wail of misery discovering rannaldinis next email definitely not he had written crushingly flora is unstable vindictive and a pernicious influence the crumbling hp hall and its surrounding twenty acres were the rsos only assets this was where george came in he would buy the property for a pittance in a whiteknight gesture to get the orchestra out of debt then lease it back to them as soon as the orchestra folded he would build a supermarket the plot was horribly ingenious instead of putting horrid little houses all over cowslip hill which noone wanted he would build a festival centre a megaplex with twentyfour drivein cinemas golfcourses food halls virtualreality centres and bouncy castles which would bring employment tourists fun and prosperity to rutminster in return all he asked was planning permission to knock down the highly dangerous collapsing victorian monstrosity the herbert parker hall and build a supermarket with a new roundabout to hive off traffic no wonder george had been so reluctant to repair the roof cotchester already had a beautiful hall no distance from valhalla by helicopter in which the new super orchestra would be housed the only sticking point seemed to be rannaldinis insistence on absolute hiring and firing rights flora was about to print out the whole file when she nearly died of heart failure because there was a great hammering on the door anyone at home come oot come oot called dixies voice priddock must be having a ziz said randy or jessica a bonk but after a bit more hammering they got bored and wandered off sweat was trickling down floras body shed never make a burglar her hand was shaking so violently she was petrified of pressing the wrong button and wiping all the evidence but somehow she managed to switch back to the file menu and type in print beside orchestra south slowly but miraculously fifteen pages rolled out she had just managed to shove them up her jersey and unlock the door when jessica staggered in it would have been hard to decide who looked the more guilty jessicas hair was sopping from the shower flora felt sick with misery viking had obviously screwed her hearing a thud behind her she jumped out of her skin but it was only john drummond crash landing on the carpet weaving round jessicas buckling legs flora hoped to god he didnt speak english hes asking for his dinner said jessica george is having a blacktie do at home this evening and he wants everything perfect ill have to go out shopping again later i wasted my entire lunchhour trying to find scallops if only there was a waitrose in rutminster there may be one sooner than you think said flora grimly as she sidled out what the hell was she to do viking would have left for london by now to record the brahms horn trio the only answer if she were to save abby and the rest of the orchestra was to tackle george at once driving down the high street she saw a newspaper hoarding megaplex for cowslip hill screeching to a halt she picked up a paper but it only reported the delighted reaction of councillors and residents alan cardew the planning officer was quoted as saying this really puts rutminster on the map it was a bitterly cold evening after a boiling bath to remove the sweat and a couple of stiff vodkas flora slid all over the road as she drove round to georges splendid house which was situated on the other side of rutminster as far as possible from both cowslip hill and hp hall george wouldnt want to spoil his own green hills with megaplexes and supermarkets thought flora savagely as her wheel tracks ruined his perfect lawn the whole place she could see was speedily being wrecked by georges fearful taste a man on his own who had no truck with interior designers bet he knocked her arms off she muttered as she passed a huge replica of the venus de milo glittering with frost the butler told her to hop it so flora asked him to tell mr hungerford that it was flora seymour and he better get rid of his dinner party because she wanted to talk about orchestra south after two minutes by which time flora had practically frozen to the doorstep she was shown into georges study the room was lit by a large chandelier which the butler promptly dimmed the autumnalleafpatterned carpet was so new he had great difficulty tugging the door shut over it brown leather sofas and armchairs hung about awkwardly like buffaloes reprogeorgian bookshelves on either side of the gas log fire were filled with bookclub editions videos and reference books including encyclopaedia britannica by the yard one wall was covered by a vast television screen and a stereo a second by thousands of lps tapes and cds the third which faced georges imposing incredibly tidy desk was dominated by a green park railing portrait of a beautiful woman with short pale yellow hair and cold harebellblue eyes whose brilliance was accentuated by the huge sapphires round her neck she had the disdainful perfection of women behind the beauty counters of big department stores who want to shame you into spending a fortune on makeup and skin care this must be ruth whom george refused to divorce she didnt look a bundle of laughs you could see why george had the hots for juno she and ruth were the same type ice rather than nice maidens floras teeth were rattling like cherubs castanets a glance in the ornate white gold framed mirror over the fire showed her nose bright red as a clowns ruth would no doubt have recommended green foundation flora jumped as she heard voices obviously guests were being hastily ejected opening the heavy rust dralon curtains a fraction she could see alan and lindy cardew very done up in diamonds and a new fulllength mink two other men she recognized as highprofile local councillors two bankers from the rso board and their wives and goodness the steel elf wrapping herself in a long blue velvet cloak all going towards their cars then she heard george apologizing for some cockup in the kitchen see you in the hoogry hoonter in ten minutes youll be lucky snarled flora enticing smells of wine herbs and scallops wafting from the kitchen belying any cockup reminded her she hadnt eaten all day feeling dizzy she leant against the marble mantelpiece a weeks skiing even if the mobile had gone up the mountain with him had almost ironed out the bags under georges eyes his dark brown shiny face matched his leather sofas and armchairs the black and white of his dinner jacket softened the rough rocky features white teeth chewing a cigar big suntanned hand clamped round a glass of whisky obviously trying to bluff it out he looked almost genial as he shoved open the door well whats all this about i havent got much time you better make it snapped flora except for her red nose her face was whiter than the marble fireplace with the collar of her long black overcoat turned up she looked like a victorian waif in the last stages of consumption george was about to offer her a drink when she said i know exactly what youre up to you bastard i was busking outside the archduke in concert hall approach two weeks ago i saw you and rannaldini going in and coming out you must both have needed really long spoons to sup with one another george took a slug of brandy i was in london for a meeting of the association of british orchestras he said flatly rannaldini and i were discoosing him guest conducting the orchestra on the occasional date he does happen to live in the area bollocks shouted flora you were discussing his taking over the rso and firing per cent of the orchestra then at georges look of amused incredulity she added and if you dont renew abbys contract for starters im going straight to the press my mother has contacts with every newspaper editor in fleet street and new york this is blackmail said george bleakly and reached for the telephone the blackest possible said flora its the only way to cope with shits like you buying the hall cheaply in a whiteknight gesture then building supermarkets on the site the moment the orchestra folds you bloody waitrosencavalier jolted at last george dropped the telephone back on the hook how dyou know about that you shouldnt give your stupid secretary who gets paid twice as much as a rankandfile viola player such longlunch hours i raided your computer today and printed out the entire orchestra south file george gave a long sigh its the only way to save the orchestra at least the good people get to keep their jobs abby doesnt and she flaming well deserves to have you any idea how hard she works poring over the wretched scores day in day out till two or three in the morning shes an hysteric so shes an artist the orchestras getting better and better i wish the houses were were haemorrhaging to death cant you understand that give her time look how long it took simon rattle to turn the cbso around and now theyve got a bluddy great deficit said george brutally anyway flora briskly disregarded a point against herself the rso doesnt want to live in cotchester and play in some horrible opera pit under a little hitler its like sending ponies down the mine you overdramatize everything theyd be well paid and theyd make great music no they wouldnt super orchestras dont work there are too many chiefs and not enough indians for them to boss around the mix is too rich anyway theyd get sacked if they split a note rannaldinis evil floras voice was rising he lives near my parents and poisons the air like pesticide and i bet you told him we were about to record winifred trapp and fanny mendelssohn dont be fatuous roared george losing his temper if you think i want to be landed with the bills for soloists you must be joking somehow he managed to control himself and sitting down at his desk got out a cheque book ok how much will it take i dont want money said flora in outrage i want everyones contracts renewed except hilarys carmine and the steel elf she added as an afterthought who juno meadows i saw her poncing out of here with her gstaad tan how you have the gall to tell abby shes losing caste living with me yes you did when youve been guzzling glühwein off piste with juno dont by bluddy childish juno was making oop the noombers and doing a number of you soixanteneuf i suppose although shed be a bit refined for that im surprised you havent built a horrid little chalet on her flora was beginning to feel faint somehow she reached the door halfexpecting to slip on those autumn leaves she must keep talking to shut him up ill only tear up that printout when ive got proof everyones contracts have been renewed rannaldinis a fiend remember hell doublecross you the moment he gets the chance and she was out of the door running towards her car fortunately the roads were empty she felt so lonely she longed to drop off at the bordello curl up in vikings bed with nugent and wait for him to come home since they split up however the rest of the celtic mafia not knowing the reason and sensing vikings unhappiness had become wildly antagonistic after a sleepless night and a long unrewarding day of rehearsal with a stupid guest conductor whose beat was impossible to follow flora returned to woodbine cottage and an equally shattered marcus she had refrained from telling him about georges and rannaldinis skulduggery he didnt need upsetting tomorrow evening he was playing the rachmaninov flora was terrified hed peaked he had practically worn out the keys of the steinway he had lived the piece crawled inside it knew every note not only his own part but also the orchestras by heart but would he have enough heart to do it justice he and flora were just commiserating over a cup of tea and slices of cherry cake when abby floated in brandishing a magnum of champagne we have got to celebrate right george has just summoned me and said the board are going to renew my contract for another year im not sure how pleased howie will be he figures i oughta move on but i expect george will be able to persuade him and ive persuaded george not to cut salaries at the moment to zap all those rumours about a merger between us and the cco he and i are going to assess the merits of everyone in the orchestra over the next few weeks and renew as many contracts as possible and george thinks thatll keep me quiet fumed flora abby looked wonderful the cold weather always whipped up colour in her sallow cheeks and she went on scrabbling at the gold paper round the top of the bottle at last i can get rid of el squeeko and cyril you cant said flora appalled vikingll never let you and juno you may have lucked out there but abby was on a roll she had totally misjudged george hes not the philistine i figured he was its kinda gratifying when all ones hard grind pays off now we can build the orchestra together i guess he is attracted to me she announced happily flora was upset to see the hurt in marcuss eyes she herself was enraged after all shed done to save abby particularly when abby smugly announced that floras was one of the contracts george was iffy about renewing he didnt know you were only on six months trial he figures youre not pulling your weight says youve got an attitude problem and hes got a platitude problem snarled flora that is monstrously unfair protested marcus tell him to go and jump in the cement mixer im just reporting what he said the flying champagne cork sent the cats racing from the kitchen but i figure ive managed to persuade him youre a worthwhile member of the orchestra flora suddenly realized shed eaten the rest of the cherry cake and had to undo her jeans bloody abby if only she knew flora was tempted to tell her the truth but again didnt want a scene before marcuss concert abby should have spent the evening studying the rachmaninov but convinced she knew it because shed heard marcus playing it so often she got tight instead fortysix on the wall of marcuss dressingroom was a photograph of clifton suspension bridge he wished he could jump off it how could he possibly play the most difficult piano concerto ever written when his violently trembling hands wouldnt tie his white tie or slot in the gold cufflinks bearing the campbellblack crest the rehearsal had been disastrous abby had faffed around telling the orchestra rachmaninov was born on april fools day and had lived on lake lucerne like rodney and that mahler had conducted the second performance of the concerto in the states until dixie had yelled come back gustav all is forgiven marcus had never dreamt the orchestral sound would be so dense loud and so distracting or that desperately trying to keep up with abbys beat he would play so many wrong notes and at one point stop altogether the orchestra totally indifferent to such calamities only raised the odd eyebrow and carried on reading their newspapers filling in tax forms and applying for other jobs abby wouldnt even give him time to rehearse the cadenza thats your baby you know it backwards and instead of going back over the places where hed screwed up so he could correct his mistakes she then moved on to hilarys and simons solos and one or two of the more complicated tuttis she then spent the rest of the rehearsal perfecting the timing of carmine joness offstage trumpet solo in the third leonora overture its exactly eight minutes before you come in carmine so dont fall asleep not bloody likely carmine in a new butch lumberjack shirt winked at lindy cardew who in a tight shockingpink sweater was jabbing huge scented pink lilies no doubt paid for by her husbands massive backhanders from george into vases along the front of the stage any flowers or blossom played havoc with marcuss asthma flora in a rare act of domesticity had brushed and washed down his tails to save fumes from dry cleaning but even worse chemicals were now wafting from the walls of his dressingroom newly painted a restful green gloss to calm soloists glancing in the mirror he noticed his face had a sinister blue tinge in case of any emergency attack he had brought a preloaded syringe but he was terrified of letting down abby the orchestra and george whod engaged him and been so particularly kind worried that marcus was too thin and probably hadnt eaten all day george had arranged for lentil soup grilled plaice and fruit salad to be sent in from the old bell and marcus had just thrown up the lot panicking all the while that he might choke the more he fretted the harder it was to breathe it was as though someone had held a pillow to his face but the greatest terror was the rachmaninov lurking ahead dark fierce explosive mysterious as the russian continent a huge monster waiting to be captured and tamed by his bare hands passionate relief battled with bitter disappointment that neither rupert nor taggie had bothered to come or even send him a goodluck card helen on the other hand had rolled up an hour before the off and hung around reading his cards and moaning about rannaldini who was taking a masterclass in rome until george barged in and bluntly told her to pack it in because the lad needs to distance himself george then whisked helen off to wow the sponsors in the vip lounge lady rannaldini was looking particularly fetching in a lindka cierach suit of ivory silk with a short fitted jacket emphasizing her tiny waist and her newly lifted and remodelled breasts and bottom was helen in on georges and rannaldinis plan for a super orchestra and market wondered flora she couldnt see helen frolicking on a bouncy castle at least helen and george can have a good bitch about me she thought wryly still hubristic over yesterdays renewal of her contract and her rapprochement with george abby had also nipped into bath that morning and bought a wildly fashionable very ostentatious orange satin bomber jacket which she teamed with matching orange satin drainpipes and a black bra with her wild shaggy dark curls drug pallid face and snake hips she looked like a rock star ladies and gentlemen please take your places on the platform knickers was shouting along the passage at the musicians christ here comes sunset boulevard said dixie as abby came out of the conductors room and popped next door to show herself off to marcus who was frantically flipping through his score he could hardly see it for pencil marks dont look any more right youll confuse yourself im going to throw up again no youre not ill take care of you youve got a good twenty minutes leonora takes about fourteen then theyve got to get the piano on dont take it too fast pleaded marcus it says allegro but ma non tanto trust me dyou think georgell like this pant suit fantastic hell pant with lust you reckon abby fluffed her hair in the mirror and sauntered off towards the stage marcus felt that his hammering heart would soon leave internal bruising on his ribs the only benefit of panic attacks was that they dulled the pain of abby lusting after other men he picked up his mascot the copy of the tempest she had given him which he took everywhere merrily merrily shall i live now he read under the blossom that hangs on the bough ariel couldnt have been an asthmatic viking and flora should have already been on stage but viking had only just got back from recording the brahms horn trio and flora was giving him a whispered update on her raiding of the files her confrontation of george and georges new alliance with abby the bastard said viking outraged we must tell the orchestra pleaded flora if they were prepared to strike to get rid of abby theyd certainly come out against a merger viking shook his head noone loses strikes except musicians theyd just close us down without any redundancy lets see what george does next he wont want you shopping him to the press or he might not get planning permission to pull down the hall at least this gives us room to manoeuvre i dont trust him i quite like the guy admitted viking only because hes offering you a job in the new orchestra hes just swanned off with lady rannaldini is sir roberto here hes in rome said flora bitterly taking a mistressclass unable to stop himself viking pulled her into his arms i know how this hurts you sweetheart what the fuck are you two doing screamed abby jealousy surging up as uncontrollable as vomit at finding them together when she was convinced the affaire was over flora nearly dropped her viola you both should have been on stage five minutes ago yelled abby julian is waiting to go on knickers is going ballistic looking for you great outfit maestro totally unabashed viking wandered towards the stage onotterably chic to match it to your soloists hair have you got some sort of deathwish abby turned her fury on flora i told you last night ok your jobs on the line once again not wanting to rattle abby with the merger plot in case she flipped and unnerved marcus flora blurted out that viking was boasting that hed just pulled jessica its called liaising with the management she muttered and fled abby who still went weak at the knees every time she remembered viking kissing her outside st clements was totally thrown somehow she got through the overture because the orchestra could play it in their sleep she didnt even notice that carmine was late on his offstage entrance because hed been kissing lindy cardew in the instrument room but arrogantly thinking she knew the rachmaninov well enough and opting to conduct without a score she got hopelessly lost in the first movement flora was bowing away furiously among the violas worrying about marcuss set white face and his faltering sound looking up for reference she found abbys beat wasnt there lost confidence and started to panic and make mistakes soon the rest of the orchestra who had also been hopelessly underrehearsed were all over the place half of them coming in half of them not unravelling and about to stop dead fucking browntrouser job muttered dixie to randy ironically this was marcuss salvation he had nearly fainted with terrror when he first saw the size of the audience fighting for breath his smile sellotaped to his face his fingers when he began playing had been impossibly stiff and wouldnt do anything he told them but realizing his darling abby was in desperate trouble he forgot himself concentrating on saving her steady as a welsh cob he kept going hammering away repeatedly at the first subject dum didi dum didi dum dum nodding until the orchestra found their place abby with no score for reference however was still floundering her gaudy orange suit making her all the more conspicuous towards the end of the movement she got completely lost again so marcus with amazing assurance skipped a page plunging straight in to the cadenza so everyone knew where they were and could have some breathing space he had chosen rachmaninovs second cadenza which was far more demanding gradually as he relaxed and the music he adored took over he forgot everything else his pale tortured face grew happy and peaceful listening to the melancholy torrents of sound glittering like a waterfall in the moonlight flora ached at the beauty of it glancing round she caught viking looking straight at her although he smiled his eyes were as wet as her own marcus held his breath as the cadenza drew to a close not having rehearsed it at all would abby know when to cue in the orchestra he had to accompany brief beautiful echoes from peter plumpton on the flute then simon then hilary and finally viking and quinton but they all came in on the dot and the movement finished more or less together in the intermezzo where marcus interpreted the word pianissimo in a multitude of different ways and in the heroic splendid finale he grew and grew in stature beneath his racing fingers the great dark russian monster had become suddenly biddable and was carrying him home as joyfully as arions dolphin but it was a closerun thing marcus got an ecstatic reception in part because hed looked so vulnerable and terrified at the beginning and so handsome and touchingly amazed at the applause at the end most of the audience hadnt a clue anything had gone wrong but the orchestra had and they cheered him to the leaking rooftops rattling their bows beating out a tantivy of approval on the shoulders of their cellos and basses utterly distraught abby fled to her dressingroom refusing to return so none of the soloists within the orchestra were raised to their feet for a special clap which enraged hilary abby should have brought the wind up she kept saying marcus took five curtain calls and was just collapsing thankfully in his dressingroom when noriko banged on the door quick quick quick mr brack she cried enthusiastically come and pray again the pubric are still crapping marcus was still laughing when he reached the middle of the stage and shook hands with a beaming julian yet again youll have to give them an encore but i havent practised anything it would have seemed so presumptuous just busk it shouted bill thackery for a second marcus gazed at the ecstatic pink faces their clapping hands growing pinker by the minute luxuriating in the sound like waves rolling down the shingle then he sat down and played schumanns dreaming which had everyone in floods and elicited even louder roars of applause meanwhile george had had a wearying two days justifying his volteface over abbys contract to various enraged members of the board including miles mrs parker canon airlie not to mention gwynneth and gilbert aware he would receive even more flak after tonights near débâcle he went grimly into the conductors room to find flora yelling at a sobbing abby youre just jealous because hes got more talent than you thats what and you cant bear anyone to get ahead after all marcus has done for you all that transcribing and simplifying and explaining those bloody great scores think of the times hes lugged your clothes to the cleaners and cooked and cleaned up after you and fed your cats and polished your shoes and let you pinch his jerseys you pinch his jerseys wailed abby ive known him longer im allowed to you wouldnt have got a second foot on the rostrum without him you stupid bitch and youre so fucking vain you had to jeopardize his big break conducting without a score i know i know alarmed he might not have a second half george told flora to pack it in and abby to wash her face and pull herself together he then dragged flora outside nice to see someone else getting it in the neck he said drily and thats the stupid bitch youre so determined to save flora blushed then hastily changed the subject didnt marcus play brilliantly he had absolutely no choice said george bleakly somehow abby managed to limp through schuberts fourth symphony then speaking to noone cutting the sponsors reception again she hurtled home to a deserted woodbine cottage flora had gone out boozing with cherub noriko and davie buckle marcus had been swept out to dinner by george miles and a manic helen fortyseven sitting next to marcus at dinner george fired off endless questions about abbys floras and marcuss plans for the future then insisted that his chauffeur known as harve the heavy took him back to woodbine cottage youre not driving with all that drink inside you its not as if weve had to fork out for your room at the old bell then affectionately ruffling marcuss hair said you did bluddy well lad wed have been right in it if you hadnt come to abbys rescue marcus fought an insane drunken urge to collapse into georges arms he was so strong and solid and he had the same brusque gentleness the almost patriarchal kindness that marcus missed so much since malises death he couldnt imagine why flora and until recently abby kept slagging him off perhaps george was in love with helen marcus thought wistfully from jake lovell onwards men had been particularly kind to him for just that reason marcus hoped not george had promised to look at the rso calendar and try and find him another date slumped happily in the front of the rolls marcus gabbled most uncharacteristically to harve that piggy parker had booked him for a soirée in june playing tunes like after henry and lady be good marcus beat them out on the dashboard until harve started singing along and gwendolyn chisledon wanted to know where mr hungerford was going to build his ghastly multiplex went on marcus when she heard it was on cowslip hill she heaved a sigh of relief oh thats all right i thought it was our side of rutminster harve grinned and howie denston rang me on georges mobile in the middle of dinner and wants me to get into bed with him marcus giggled i do hope he means financially not sexually either way if i may say so said harve in his gravediggers drawl youre going to be screwed it was a beautiful clear night although the great beeches along the lake glittered with frost the moonlight was bright enough to pick out the first pale primroses nestling in their roots singing and laughter was coming from the bordello marcus wished he could have dropped in one of his best moments of the concerto had been vikings little horn solo in the middle movement hed just liked to have talked the concerto through with someone as he stumbled out of the car orion his favourite constellation was free falling into the poplar copse at the top of the wildflower meadow mars a gold butterfly was being chased by leo the lion the outside lamp was still on transforming the leafless clematis over the front door into a scrunchdried blond but the cottage was in darkness thank you so much said marcus pleasure sir i am not a great lover of classical music but may i trouble you for your autograph one day it will be something to show my grandchildren dum didi dum didi dum dum sang marcus his shadow was squat and black at his heels reminiscent of one of malises labradors had his stepfather from beyond the grave sent the dog to guard him on such a special evening only after several fumbling attempts did he realize the door wasnt locked i did it i fucking did it as he punched the air he nearly fell over abbys music case in the hall then he heard the sound of desperate sobbing and stumbled upstairs where watched by two worried cats abby lay slumped on her fourposter she was dressed in jeans and marcuss old black sweater with two holes in the elbows she was utterly distraught to have let him down floras right i have always taken you for granted i havent cleaned a pair of shoes since i moved in but i llike looking after you collapsing on the patchwork counterpane he found himself stroking her hair drenched with tears rather than sweat now as thick and coarse as a ponys mane outside he could see the lake gleaming silver and mysterious trailing his hand downwards he patted her shuddering shoulders which were hard and muscular from so many hours conducting her long legs reached to the bottom of the bed she hadnt bothered to shower after the concert and smelled disturbingly of dried sweat and amarige from their moonlit reflection in the long mirror opposite they could have been two boys marcus took her in his arms oh christ abby ive always loved you from the moment you came loping up to the stage at the academy her mouth tasted acid from fear but as he kissed her he thought she would suck the tongue out of his mouth and was amazed by the leaping wolflike passion of her response apart from an illfated scuffle on the lawn with boris she had been celibate since the trauma of christopher three years ago she had marcuss clothes off him in a trice ripping off several shirt buttons nearly garrotting him with his tie and jamming his zip in the process like quick silver she was all over him blowing in his ears running her fingers through his hair nuzzling his neck then she moved downwards slowly kissing each bumpy rib burying her face in his taut belly exclaiming in wonder at the greyhound grace of his body there was only one drawback marcus couldnt get it up even when his cock was sucked into the warm dark wet cavern of abbys throat it remained as soft and as innocent as a lambs tail marcus was even more contrite than abby had been about the rachmaninov abby however was surprisingly understanding it doesnt matter youve had a skinful ok and youre pooped you know what luisa pellafacini says before a concert julian wont after the concert he cant i feel such a wimp you can still make me come abby put his hand between her legs im seriously sorry marcus muttered into her shoulder but i dont know which doorbell to press raising his head prising his face round towards hers abby could see him blushing the same bloodred in the moonlight as his hair but i thought you and flora surely at school the way she wanders into the studio halfnaked marcus shook his head we snogged once or twice but we know each other too well and always started to laugh oh abby darling i dont know how to tell you this but im a virgin you gotta be joking with a father like rupert thats the trouble marcus rolled over and buried his face in the pillow everyone expects me to be a great macho superstud like dad and i just bottle out then stammering frantically almost crying he told her about the night of basil baddinghams stagparty edith was there she drunk everyone under the table and his disastrous encounter with the tart and the nearfatal asthma attack every time i try and make it with a girl i see contempt in dads face holding his shuddering rigid body in her arms abby was overwhelmed with tenderness thats enough to put anyone off sex she said indignantly and on top of that its a kneejerk reaction to think youll choke again what a son of a bitch what a damn fool insensitive preppy asshole he wants an heir said marcus wearily now listen to me right abby pulled the duvet up tucking it round his shivering body for starters youre the prettiest guy i ever saw sure you are and tonight you were the most shitscared i never saw stagefright like that i know what guts it took even to get onto the platform ok but in the end you showed everyone youre made of steel you were the superman you saved us i love you marcus her voice broke its just hit me like one of georges bulldozers and if we love each other we only need time ill get you going there are so many tricks marcuss shivering became a quiver of pleasure as she ran her fingers lingeringly along the cleft between his buttocks all women she went on halfmockingly want to marry a virgin so they can mould him exactly the way they want perhaps barbara cartland will make me the hero of one of her novels youre my hero anyway george never stops nagging me to get involved in educational projects teaching you about sex is far more rewarding than relating respighis birds to the blackmere woods as marcus started to laugh abby took his hand first moving it over her acornhard nipples then burying it in her wiry dark pubic hair under the fold you can feel a little nipple thats the clit now lick your middle finger and stroke it very gently a mild pizzicato right now slide a finger down and inside me in and out deeper and deeper testing for wetness thats lovely now back to the clit again it was rather like being taught fingering by his old music mistress thought marcus hazily any minute he expected abby to tell him to use the long fingers for the black notes and not to turn his whole hand when he moved the thumb under oh wow murmured abby happily long fingers arent just good for tenths im nearly there he expected her to scream shout and thrash about and was alarmed hed done something wrong when her body suddenly arched stiffened trembled violently all over and seemed to stop breathing abby are you ok heavenly her body slumped but inside he could feel her melting and throbbing youre a genius you made me come truly i thought it would be so noisy when its real its the quietest thing on earth i love you she fell asleep at once marcus lay awake stunned by the evenings developments reliving all the mistakes hed made particularly at the beginning of the rachmaninov luxuriating in the memory of the applause and the kind things people had said he hardly dared think how miraculously it would sort out his problems if he got it together with abby im straight im straight he made a thumbsup sign to his reflection in the mirror all the same like some lovely little restaurant you stumble on in the dordogne when youre pissed he wondered if hed ever be able to find the clitoris again perhaps abby would let him bring a magnifying glass into lessons the next day he had great difficulty keeping his newly straight face when he went back to hp hall to collect his car and was greeted by an overjoyed noriko waving a newspaper mr black mr black at last shed got her ls right have you seen your wonderful clit in lutminster echo the rutshire butcher had reviewed the encore not the concerto and written of marcus blacks exquisite control and beauty of tone unhindered by orchestra or conductor fortyeight the next day flora felt very flat after her sighting of rannaldini her rows with george and an inexplicable feeling of something going on between abby and marcus she needed a male in her life having bought an electric blanket she went off to the nearest ncdl kennels the desperate barking the pleading faces the scrabbling paws saddened her immeasurably like the anouilh heroine how could she ever be happy while there was a single stray dog in the world but in the end she chose the smallest ugliest blackandtan mongrel and called him trevor trevor had been so bored in the kennels hed spent all day playing with his own shadow realizing his luck he settled in immediately abby was livid when he treed both scriabin and sibelius two chattering magpies up in the chestnut tree again and then wolfed all their food hell be a partner in crime for that bloody nugent hell be a terrific guard dog beamed flora lady chisleden had a breakin while she was at the concert last night trevor was all of nine inches high and sulked dreadfully when flora forgot to put on the electric blanket although he immediately found his way out through the cat door and went hunting he howled if flora left him behind so she smuggled him into rehearsals and he guarded her coat and her viola case in the womens changingroom george was not amused by the arrival of trevor particularly when he noisily chased john drummond between two perspex models on his first morning fortunately for flora george had been instantly distracted by devastating news the cotchester chamber orchestra blithely announcing they would be staging their own opera gala in the grounds of cotchester cathedral starring rannaldini and harefield the main problem was they had picked the same sunday in early may that the rso were mounting their allstar centenary gala this would wipe out the rsos audience georgie maguire and an increasingly doubtful dancer maitland singing rodgers and hammerstein could hardly compete with the rerun of the most successful classical record of all time george made out he was furious flora who still had the printouts under her mattress suspected he had tipped rannaldini off about the date of the gala in order to run the rso into the ground the arts council increasingly dismayed by the popularizing of the rso repertoire were muttering openly about closing down one orchestra at the beginning of march el creepo and simon painshaw came to the end of their twoyear term as orchestral members of the board few players were interested in replacing them as hatred of the management had reached an alltime high in the end hilary and bill thackery put themselves forward hilary the orchestra decided wanted the chance to exchange meaningful glances with miles she was a dangerous bitch but bill would balance her out bill was such a nice guy and hed behaved so well over the rerecording in january of rachels requiem and julian repossessing his violin solo that everyone felt he deserved to be on the board bill would see them right meanwhile as a thank you and twentysecond birthday present abby took marcus to covent garden where the cossakrusse the most dazzling ballet company in the world were dancing le corsair tickets had sold out months ago and more touts were hanging round the opera house than pigeons but the principal soloist the great alexei nemerovsky known in the press as the treat from moscow was both an old friend of boriss and a longtime collector of abbys records and had sent her two tickets it was heaven to escape from the rso and all its problems for an evening thought abby as she and marcus wandered hand in hand through the packed foyer marcus had retrieved her orange satin trouser suit from the wastepaper basket and persuaded her to wear it she was gratified how many people recognized her and nudged their companions but she noticed the eyes of both sexes then swivelled to marcus and stayed there in admiration he was wearing a dark suit that had been made for him two years ago by ruperts tailor and a lilacandwhite striped shirt and a purple tie which flora had given him for his birthday success in the rachmaninov had given him new confidence he seemed to walk taller he is a beauty thought abby proudly they had made love constantly since that first night and although marcus still hadnt got it up he had given her a lot of pleasure and was about to graduate bclit in the geography of female sexual anatomy itll happen abby kept telling him you mustnt have a hangup more of a hang down grumbled marcus at least they could laugh about it and after a couple of glasses of champagne in the bar they sat very close together in the dark warmth of the theatre opening their scarlet programmes watching the litup bald head and waving arms of the conductor aware that the vast audience could hardly wait for the overture to be over so they could catch a first glimse of their god nemerovsky was also known as the third n because with nijinsky and nureyev he made up the triumvirate of greatest male dancers of all time his leonine dark head with the sliding black eyes the cheekbones at fortyfive degrees and the huge pouting mouth glared haughtily out from poster and programme back swept the dark red velvet curtains like labia minor thought marcus in his new knowledge in delight the audience clapped the brilliant set in which a heaving sailing ship filled with longlegged wildhaired pirates was wrecked on a rocky shore the tallest of the pirates who was wearing a floppy white shirt black knickerbockers and a red scarf round his forehead was clearly hurt and was carried ashore by two of his comrades as the ship broke up in a mass of spray and crashing waves thats nemerovsky whispered abby as the pirates took refuge behind a rock and a lot of scantily dressed maidens swarmed on and jumped about im not sure i like ballet thought marcus then nemerovsky recovered from his concussion and suddenly erupted on to the centre of the stage as glitteringly dominant and beautiful as orion in the winter sky nemerovskys leaps were legendary gasp followed collective gasp as the corsair seemed to fly through the air to whirl like a dervish to rise and fizzle like a fire cracker yet his stillness seemed to freeze audience and orchestra as long as he wanted so that any spontaneous applause that could have interrupted the action also froze on peoples hands and watching him marcus was lost totally shipwrecked he even felt himself groan with despair as the cold poisoned steel of cupids arrow plunged deep into his heart routing out any hope of heterosexuality he realized he was only in love with abby emotionally and had never really desired a human being before he looked at nemerovsky remembering that browning poem flora was always quoting as one who awakes the past was a sleep and his life began abby was in raptures half in wonder for the conductor who must be having a coronary controlling the orchestra in the face of such unpredictability halfidentifying with nemerovskys star quality she had once held audiences captive had been the only one on stage they had looked at she must must go back to the violin hes got a butt almost as beautiful as vikings she whispered to marcus boris who was still wrestling with king lear only made the last act it seemed sacrilegious to leave a seat empty for so long afterwards abby marcus and boris went on to dinner at the ivy where they were later joined by alexei and evgenia his stunningly pretty principal ballerina the whole restaurant rose and cheered them as they came in and it was immediately champagne on the dacha boris and alexei fell on each others necks when demanded alexei was boris going to write a ballet for him marcus was in a complete daze which went unnoticed as the other four gabbled away in russian alexei seemed far more taken with abby than evgenia occasionally his black eyes slid speculatively over marcus and when marcus couldnt eat a thing alexei calmly forked up his potatoes announcing he was starving i cannot eat before dancing i am much too exciting he reminded marcus terrifyingly of rupert he had the same cool arrogance the same predatory ability to pick off anything he chose he was now having a terrrific russian row with evgenia because shed ordered him a dover sole rather than tournedos rossini and when boris tried to defuse things turned on him as well then alexei emptied a glass of red wine over boris boris emptied one over alexei and they both smashed their glasses against the wall the management were just moving in to break the whole thing up when they saw the two dripping men were laughing uproariously and left them to it then as instantly they stopped laughing because boris asked alexei about russia there is no money alexeis voice was deeper than the corsairs ocean a thrilling husky basso profundo we are crippled by bureaucracy the mafia and chaos there is no hope internally eet must come from outside i am ok i come and go as i please because i am beeg star everyone else is starving democracy does not feed people so i owe eet to geeve my country spiritual uplift you must come back boris at least make visit boris mopping his eyes with his table napkin was so moved he drained both his own and evgenias glass as chekhov say he sighed freedom is destiny we may never reach but we must squeeze slavery out of ourselves drop by drop which reminded him his glass was empty so he waved at the waiter to bring more bottles trying to include marcus abby told the others that hed just played the rachmaninov and howie was trying to wangle him a date with the royal scottish national orchestra playing prokofievs third piano concerto my father was friend of prokofiev said alexei his glittering eyes trailing round the table just then a beeg grey wolf did come out of the forest he said softly and threw back his head and laughed showing off long flaring nostrils and the stubble darkening his beautiful strong neck which had left makeup on the collar of his white shirt oh christ thought marcus what the hells going to become of me he felt dizzy with longing misinterpreting his distress evgenia said sympathetically that it was very difficult to make it as a pianist marcus is very shy too abby told her in russian is he drawled alexei in english raising a jetblack eyebrow and staring at marcus until he went scarlet then he must make record in prague until you have record you are nuzzing to managers engagers musical directors record is all serena at megagram liked you a lot marcus said boris encouragingly she vill pick up production cost of record i vill conduct for free you will only need a few grand to pay the orchestra great ill help out said abby eagerly sensing marcus would like to get off the subject evgenia asked abby about her orchestra in no time abby was telling her about the rsos financial plight and rannaldinis latest act of vandalism programming an opera gala on the same day as their centenary celebrations rannaldini is very bad man said alexei he conduct in moscow never again eet was so fast swan lake become swan rapids abby took a deep breath oh alexei youre not possibly free on sunday may to dance at our gala only for ten minutes or so it would honestly save us from going bellyup in order to maintain his glitzy lifestyle alexei had been known to dance on a pin if the money was good enough but suddenly he agreed to appear at the gala for next to nothing he and evgenia would be in paris at the time as the gala was on a sunday they could just nip over for the evening i would like that smiled evgenia i love vest country you always need vest in eengland mocked alexei a manic abby hugged them both oh thank you thatll zap rannaldini and harefield at cotchester peoplell fly in from all over the world to watch you two what would you like to dance prokofiev said alexei shooting a mocking glance at marcus romeo and juliet stony leemits cannot keep love out the waiters trying not to yawn were laying tables for the morrow as they were leaving boris gave alexei a score of rachels requiem which had just been published who did you dedicate it to flora or me or marcus asked abby turning the pages to astrid she read in outrage boris shrugged someone as to babyseet the bridges along the embankment glittered like necklaces on the night buds thickened against a duncoloured sky the park was full of daffodils an orse guard an orse guard my keengdom for an orse guard yelled alexei as the taxi swung into st jamess street dropping off him and evgenia at the stafford abby and marcus were staying at the ritz in the lift up abby put an idle hand on marcuss cock oh my god she gave a whoop of joy perhaps marcus was suddenly relaxed because howie was getting him work and she and boris were going to make a record with him potency was so allied to success they were hardly inside the door when abby turned to him putting her hands on his shoulders drawing him towards her not daring to breathe as she felt him rising against her there was no time to wash she unzipped both their flies and left him to wriggle out of his trousers and boxer shorts as she ripped off the orange trousers of her suit the next moment they were on the floor and he was inside her aaah moaned abby that feels so good the sex after that was fantastic marcus was so turned on by the thought of alexei that with eyes shut and in desperate hunger he made love to abby all night i knew it would come right if we gave it time sobbed a joyful abby marcus was so exhausted he forgot to take his asthma pills and had a bad attack in the morning driving back in the afternoon they agreed not to tell anyone for the moment abby however couldnt resist confiding in flora who was surprisingly unenthusiastic abby construed this as jealousy because flora hadnt got a man at the moment but flora whod always suspected marcus was gay thought the whole thing would end in tears and in turn couldnt resist confiding in viking who was equally unenthusiastic and drove abby crackers referring to the centenary concert as the gayla because dancer maitland and alexei were taking part alexei is not gay yelled abby he has a beautiful partner called evgenia privately abby was convinced alexei had only agreed to dance because he fancied her at any rate she had scored colossal brownie points with the board for providing alexei particularly when declan ohara declared himself horrified by rannaldinis and the ccos attempts to sabotage rutminsters centenary celebration im afraid ediths lost any real interest in the orchestra since she shacked up with monica he told george over the telephone and then offered to read peter and the wolf at the gala marcus was still reeling from meeting alexei he longed to talk to flora but felt it would be disloyal to abby if only he could have confided in taggie as an olive branch he sent her a mothers day card but heard nothing back fortynine once it became known that nemerovsky and ilanova would be dancing the gala became a total sellout miles was panicking how to pack a tenth of the audience into the hp hall when a gilt fig leaf obligingly fell off one of the cherubs adorning the front of the dress circle just missing the lady mayoress restoring the cherubs modesty the following morning one of georges sharp builders noticed a huge crack in the ceiling over the stalls repairs would be lengthy and cost millions gala in jeopardy trumpeted the rutminster echo overnight george came neatly to the rescue offering as an alternative his beautiful park the previous owner had been a polo fanatic and had levelled a field behind the house here the multitudes could stretch out and be charged a hundred pounds a car georges builders were soon at work knocking up a splendid stage and a pit for the orchestra venturer television were covering the gala because their own chief executive was reading peter and the wolf and classic fm would record it stands on either side of the stage would seat a thousand people and in front of the stage foldup chairs stretched back for forty rows to join the masses on the polo field with tickets ranging from five hundred to fifty pounds and freebies for anyone george wanted to woo he and the rso stood to make a killing georges whiteknight gesture was much applauded by the nationals and the rutminster echo readers letters no doubt penned by the recipients of georges backhanders poured in condemning the hp hall as a potential deathtrap urging that another smaller venue be found for the rso preferably in cotchester raged flora to viking george has turned the whole thing to his advantage i bet his builders made that crack so he can pick up h p hall even cheaper i hope it pisses with rain on the day but the luck of the devil held after a beastly cold grey dry blustery april a heatwave hit england in the week running up to the gala the only thing that cheered flora up was georges memo on the noticeboard typed by jessica as the gala takes place on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of ve day please note god save the queer will be played on the great day rutminster hall was patriotically decked with red white and blue bunting in deference to the soloists irish and russian flags also hung motionless in the burning air alongside the union jack as a sweating grumbling rso settled down to an afternoon rehearsal under a white hot sun caterers in red white and blue striped marquees tried to keep flies off the food venturer television checked camera angles and georges minions touched up the balcony already on stage for romeo and juliet trust george to use overwrought iron said flora sourly that balconys more suited to a weybridge hacienda where are the carriage lamps and the windowboxes of petunias at least georges taste hadnt ruined the park which was lit by white hawthorn exploding like grenades clumps of white lilac foaming cow parsley and the candles of the towering horse chestnuts whose round curves were echoed by plump sheep and their lambs grazing among the buttercups and big white clouds massing on the horizon through a gap in the trees on the banks of the river fleet stood a temple of flora just think he owns all this like mr darcy sighed candy mr nazi snapped flora im surprised he hasnt introduced peacocks yet why bother with our first horn around said clare viking already bronzed and wearing only fraying denim shorts was squeezing a lemon onto his hair to lighten it in the sun marcus slumped in the stalls a huge field of yellow rape on the horizon was wafting noxious pollen like chloroform towards him willow birch and oak in the park as well as all the blossom were making it almost impossible to breathe only the desire to see alexei had induced him to brave the rehearsal he was bitterly ashamed that he had been so distracted yesterday hed forgotten to play at a wedding and the poor bride had come down the aisle to no music he had brought floras collected byron with him and found the original poem of the corsair there was a laughing devil in his sneer read marcus he should have been at home working on prokofievs third but abby had slid into her old trick of enlisting his help with the repertoire the running order today was the roman carnival overture which had a beautiful solo for cathie jones georgie maguire singing everything from gluck to gershwin declan reading peter and the wolf the slow movement of tchaikovskys fifth because it had a beautiful solo for viking more songs from georgie because dancer maitland had tonsilitis and finally romeo and juliet abby was in a panic about conducting ballet rodney had been pragmatic when she called him theyre never in time darling nemerovskys a frightful showoff hell spin everything out as long as possible give him a fright occasionally by speeding things up but on the whole its best to wait till they land men were always showing off thought abby furiously look at viking sitting halfnaked on the edge of the stage making slitty eyes at every passing pretty caterer or waitress noone could work out whether he was acting up because he was going to be hidden in the pit all evening or whether it was the creeping closeness of george and juno yesterday abby had bawled him out for cracking three notes in the tchaikovsky viking had proceeded to wake her up at the cottage at four oclock in the morning to tell her hed just finished practising which was belied by howls of drunken laughter in the background then to top it bloody trevor the mongrel had chewed up her new black tstrap sandals bought to wear at the aprèsgala party and flora had hardly apologized she didnt know what had got into flora either she was so ratty thank god for marcus who was always so sweet declan hadnt arrived and as marcus only had his nose in a book abby dragged him unwillingly onto the stage to act as the narrator in peter and the wolf what kind of bird are you if you cant fly said the little bird read marcus sulkily activating a joyous flurry on the flute from peter plumpton what kind of bird are you if you cant swim said the duck and dived into the pond and in came simon with a ripple of notes on the oboe youre flat simon said abby its the bloody reed said simon shrilly very appropriate giggled cherub who was wearing a christopher robin sunhat ducks live in reeds as abby moved on to another tricky bit marcus felt his bluedenim shirt clinging wetly to his body he wished he could take it off but the sun would torch his fair skin in seconds no matter how hard the duck tried to run read marcus the wolf was getting nearer and nearer and nearer and then he caught er said an unmistakable bitchy deep husky foreign voice an weeth one gulp swallow er marcus dropped the score for there piratically grinning up at him a laughing devil in his sneer stood alexei smothered in a great wolfcoat despite the punishing heat with him were evgenia ravishing in a green sleeveless mini dress with a white shawl slung round her hips and george looking big and suntanned after a week outside organizing things and as proud as hell the orchestra put down their instruments and gave them a clap abby jumped down falling on their necks somewhat ostentatiously gabbling away in russian introducing julian and dimitri who would translate if they needed him hi marcus hows prokofiev three going shouted evgenia holding up a little white hand marcus blushed furiously to be singled out particularly when dixie shouted go for it marcus you might get lucky and even more so when alexei reached up squeezed the back of his leg and with a sly smile handed him back the score murmuring hi baby boy saying he and evgenia would rehearse when theyd warmed up george was about to whisk them off to their dressingrooms which had been built under the beech trees when miles bustled up ive got your schedule here mr nemerovsky then he added unctuously after the rehearsal we know youd like a steak and french fries and then a rest but at six ive arranged for the the times the independent the guardian and the telegraph to have half an hour each with you niet said alexi firmly thees is private visit but youve got loads of time you wont be on before halfpast ten i have to lose fifteen year at least to become romeo i need till tenthirty to prepare myself its taken weeks to arrange spluttered miles unarrange eet then they may write very uncomplimentary things ees any different shrugged alexei and stalked off to his dressingroom disgusting yob said hilary furiously what a star sighed flora hes brought a portable barre said tommy stainforth knowledgeably i didnt know he was a boozer said cherub no to practise ballet on dickhead leaving poorjessica to cancel the press miles turned his officiousness on the musicians mounting the stage with a large cardboard box he handed over brilliant crimson silk jackets to the women in the orchestra they were to wear them with black midi skirts to standardize their appearance to match the rso lorry which had been newly painted crimson and to curb such excesses as nellies plunges and floras ribbon straps that colour will clash with my sunburn said candy in outrage silks so hot moaned poor mary who was not enjoying pregnancy in such stifling heat and its got a polyester lining said clare in horror i cant wear manmade fibres im not wearing it at all said flora ill look like a blood orange not the most becomin shade for overheated orchestral complexions observed miss parrott retrieving a dropped stitch well i think theyre lovely protested juno who never flushed pinker than a wild rose so do i thank you miles said hilary who was pale with dark hair and had also chosen the colour theyll give the orchestra an identity fluted miles and look most dramatic beside the whitedinner jackets and while ive got you i want a word about protocol tonights as good a time to start as any when were anticipating a huge crowd of firsttime concert goers i want you all to come onto the stage together five mintues before the off and not all straggle on in your own time and more important i want you to look cheerful on our salary scoffed randy despite the heat the musicians laughed and to smile miles glared at randy both at the audience and each other you are performers not just musicians and at the end of a piece or in a lull it would be rather nice if you exchanged little smiling conversations like newsreaders cuckoo cuckoo the angelic third floated out from the saffron depths of an oak tree youre right birdie he is cuckoo shouted dixie in disgust whats the point of smiling if youre hidden in the pit can we get on with romeo and juliet miles demanded abby who was getting increasingly jumpy at the prospect of conducting alexei what dyou want us to be today too fast or too loud drawled viking sarcastically abbys lips tightened as you know she began juliet on the night of the ball from being an underaged schoolgirl who wants to stay home and play with her dolls changes into a young woman swept by deepest passion this is the greatest love scene ever written in literature or music and tonight it is to be danced by the greatest dancer as someone said of nureyev he only had to walk onto the stage raise his arm and the lake would be filled with swans with nemerovsky he has only to raise a stand and the polo field will be swarming with underaged schoolboys shouted viking god save the queer will you shut up screamed abby to more guffaws youre just jealous because alexeis a big star and youre nothing but a big fish in a very small polluted pool in this country they pronounce it plyooted said viking the row was only postponed because george returned with evgenia pretty as a lily in a white unitard and alexei flaunting everything in clinging black lycra shorts most dancers are well past their prime at thirtyseven but alexeis golden body oiled and rippling with muscle seemed to glow like old ivory in the white hot sun look at that huge bulge said cherub in awe hes got two pairs of legwarmers shoved down there said viking dismissively the russians like their romeo and juliet majestic and imposing alexei was soon jackbooting around changing tempi and criticizing the set thats wrong said viking disapprovingly as the music grew more and more funereal romeo and juliet arent dead yet and who wrote this music anyway prokofiev or nemerovksy now alexei was complaining about the pillar behind which he had to await juliet and the height of the balcony the balcony is fine alexei said evgenia running down the steps last time i dance juliet it nearly collapse beneath me up two three four down two three four called out alexei hoisting her into the air as if she was no heavier than a kitten eets still too quick abby eef we could have pas de chat a bit slower too abby begged evgenia knowing every man in the place was lusting after evgenia alexei seemed to take a perverse pleasure in playing the scene for real but such was his presence that the bright burning afternoon became as filled with passion and dark lurking menace as nighttime verona marcus was bitterly disappointed to miss alexeis rehearsal but quite relieved to be dragged inside because georgie maguire with whom hed spent christmas wanted a piano rehearsal like flora she had rolled up weighed down with presents a copy of her latest album for abby a huge bottle of joy for flora chewstiks for trevor the mongrel a biography of pablo gonzales for marcus and a huge box of belgian chocolates for george miss priddock said you had a sweet tooth georgell have to ration them to one a day muttered juno juno was not the only one enraged how could her mother treat with the enemy thought flora furiously when georges only aim was to build supermarkets and sack per cent of the rso georgie had also brought several crates of iced beer for the orchestra and was so warm and friendly that marcus longed to pour all his troubles out to her singing halfvoice because she didnt want to tire her vocal cords georgie whizzed through mozart puccini gershwin rodgers and hammerstein some ve day songs and finally two of strausss four last songs because she wanted to raise two fingers to dame hermione who regarded them as her speciality georgie then decided she and marcus needed a drink but they found there wasnt a maid in the house nor a waiter in the hospitality tent because theyd all sloped off to gaze at nemerovsky over the hawthorn and lilacscented air drifted the sweet doomed notes of the balcony scene too slow said marcus with a frown abbyll have to divide lovely sighed georgie lets raid the fridge im starving the fridge however under junos influence was disappointingly full of plain yoghurt undressed lettuce bean sprouts carrots cut into strips to fend off georges hunger pangs and plates of cold chicken and beef covered with cling film and marked lunch and dinner worse still there was absolutely no drink so they had to do with perrier georgie lit a cigarette and wanted to gossip are you ok marcus you look dreadfully pale i suppose the pollen counts gone through the ozone layer in this heat you ought to get some concealer for those dark rings ought to get concealer for my feelings thought marcus wearily i saw nemerovsky in new york it was as though georgie had read his thoughts hes so cool you burn yourself like ice trays out of the freezer is flora ok shes been so offhand and she wasnt a bit pleased with the bottle of joy i hoped it might prove symbolic and shes put on weight thats because shes given up smoking very nobly because it gives me asthma god i wish i could what happened to that nice irish man who kept ringing her over christmas it petered out hes a seriously good bloke hes playing your horn solo in the strauss i guess shes still hooked on rannaldini sighed georgie hes such a shit oh sorry i forgot he was your stepfather opening the fridge again georgie removed a clingfilmed plate of cold beef shall we take that for trevor hes such a duck my elder daughter melanies having a baby in november i do hope i like it as much as trevor as the temperature rose so did tempers abby got even angrier with viking not only had he stood on his chair when he was playing so he could watch evgenia and later georgie who being irish of course took to him immediately but now shed caught him coming out of evgenias dressingroom ostentatiously wiping off lipstick why must you always rock boats stormed abby alexeis antsy enough without you jumping on his girlfriend grow up sweetheart alexei is about as straight as shirley temples curls youre just jealous dont you dare upset him not nearly as much as gwynneth and gilbert have that two broomstick family barged in onannounced as alexei was slapping on his tenth layer of max factor to bring him greetings from the arts council of great britain alexei threw a queenie fit and started stoning them with pots of cold cream you have to applaud the guys style they have no understanding of the artistic temperament raged abby and i hope you and flora are going to keep your dogs under control this evening of course heres one of them now said viking as fat isobel waddled up with a pile of eveningshirts and a white dj on a coathanger i managed to get the mark out she said adoringly thats a darling girl ill buy you a beer later viking pecked isobels big blushing cheek you are so arrogant and lazy said abby furiously why dont you get someone to pull your toilet paper for you fifty not a blade of grass could be seen on georges polo field as loud speakers and huge screens waited to relay the concert to an audience any rock star would have killed for many of them waved union jacks in anticipation of the ve day celebrations starting at midnight in the distance rutminster cathedral its spire rising out of the billowing green woods like a wizards hat struck eight oclock over the stage and pit hung a huge canopy like a nuns headdress dark blue inside and dotted with stars to create romeo and juliets nighttime verona into the pit through a sidedoor trouped the rso in their white djs and new crimson jackets which were already uniformly darkened by damp patches under the armpits the younger girls had rolled back their sleeves nellie had undone her top three buttons aware that her lower half was totally hidden in the pit flora had undone all but the top button everyones toothpaste smiles on miless instructions were totally obscured by peggy parkers massive flower arrangements huddled in the front of the stalls marcus wished abby had given him a less public seat he was terrified declan his fathers great friend would notice him and seek him out later even worse on his right in a white shirt already covered with chocolate a bowtie and shorts of bottlegreen velvet wriggled twoandhalfyearold justin propped up by three cushions so he could see mary his mother at the front desk of the second violins marcus liked children but reduced to jelly at the prospect of meeting alexei at the party later he was driven demented by justins incessant and often incomprehensible prattle johnno his father demoralized by four months out of work wearing a crumpled lightweight suit which mary hadnt had time to iron didnt seem much of a disciplinarian so good to see little ones brought early to the sacred fountain said gwynneth who clearly didnt believe in deodorants and who to marcuss horror was sitting on his left she was wearing vast silver earrings in the shape of ballet shoes in deference to alexei but was now furious because hed hit her on the nipple with ajar of moisturizer and a large pot of cleansing cream had landed on gilberts sandalled toe gilberts bound to lose the nail and half a ton of rutminster dirt beneath it will be homeless thought marcus with a shudder id sue nemerovsky can afford it said peggy parker who was massive in maroon on gilberts left she was livid because sonny hadnt been given a slot in the gala and her flowers on the platform hadnt got a large enough plug in the programme to tumultuous applause abby swept on looking dramatic but definitely ott in a purple tunic and floppy trousers influenced by byron in the old bell she had added a white turban secured with an amethyst pin abby just wash her hair piped up justin wheres jemima imran shouted the husband of one of rutminsters new labour councillors whod never been to a concert before and who was already plastered on georges champagne the audience tittered abby gritted her teeth shed have had no problem carrying off the turban if viking hadnt called her ghandi pandy in the wings checking that venturer television and classic fm were rolling she brought down her stick cathie jones still ashen with fear despite the punishing heat of the pit played the solo quite exquisitely in roman carnival in fact everything was fizzing along splendidly until abby discovered floras goddamned dog had chewed up the last pages of the score so she had to pretend to be turning earlier pages not to unnerve the orchestra not that she could see anything anyway because of the sweat cascading down from under her turban she couldnt even yell at flora for trevors misdemeanour because floras mother was on next ravishing in plunging coffee coloured lace her red curls half piled up half trailing down her freckled suntanned back georgie was soon belting out mozart and puccini as effortlessly as gershwin after years of smoking and far from light drinking her voice was not perfect but it had exuberance and enormous charm some day hell come along the man i love sang georgie he already has thought marcus helplessly you have to admit my mother is a total star muttered flora to fat isobel it was time for peter and the wolf and declan ohara shaggy noble and streaming with sweat like a newfoundland dog just emerged from the sea being a true pro he had spent hours perfecting the timing and being declan he cried in all the sad bits and milked every dramatic effect for the television cameras entranced hypnotized marcus listened to the dark reverberating irish voice brave boys like he are not afraid of wolves oh but i am sighed marcus just then a big grey wolf did come out of the forest went on declan narrowing his eyes and dramatically echoing alexei in the ivy who else but viking could play the wicked wolf thought abby furiously as she cued in the three horns finally after the catching of the wolf and the triumphant procession declan came to the dreadful ending and if you were to listen carefully you could hear the duck quacking in the wolfs belly because the wolf in his hurry had swallowed her alive even when the orchestra had pelted up the scale in the final tutti the audience were totally silent for a few shocked seconds before they erupted into a storm of applause justin whod been listening enraptured broke into noisy sobs what happened to the duck what happened to the poor duck of course the whole things political said gilbert sententiously the duck is meant to represent the dissident russian artists imprisoned by stalin if they all behaved as badly as boris and nemerovsky said peggy parker with a sniff ay think stalin had a point hurriedly marcus wiped away the tears couldnt everyone detect his longing for alexei quacking like the duck inside him even though he was nightly enveloped by abbys passion he was glad when the birds started singing in the pale green trees during the interval restoring normality from the sloping woods on either side rose tier on tier of starry wild garlic its pungent smell mingling with lilac and soapy hawthorn making it increasingly difficult for him to breathe glancing into the audience as she and declan took a final call abby was touched to see marcuss face still wet with tears he loved her so much and felt things so deeply after the gala they would have more time in fact the only blot on a perfect evening for abby continued to be viking incensed to be confined to a pit where he couldnt be gazed at or ogle every girl in the stalls he had rigged up a driving mirror on the front of his musicstand so he could watch georgie and declan and no doubt later gaze up evgenias skirt worse was to come after tchaikovskys fifth georgie returned to sing two of strausss four last songs before starting the ve day numbers locked in georgies dressingroom trevor stopped howling and decided if he took a nemerovsky leap he could land on a chair and then take another leap onto the table underneath the open window mr nugent on the other hand had been allowed to wait in the wings front paws together gazing lovingly down at his master in the pit trying not to interrupt his beautiful horn solo by panting suddenly nugent stiffened and gave a muffled growl his enemy trevor was jauntily approaching from the other side of the stage only pausing to lift his leg on one of peggy parkers flower arrangements foxbrown eyes searching everywhere for flora the audience nudged each other in ecstasy recognizing floras mother whod given him chewstiks and cold beef trevor bounded forward wagging his curly tail long by the roses sang georgie with clasped hands she lingers yearning for peace noone was going to get any peace with trevor around suddenly he clocked another enemy abby waving a stick at eyelevel and proceeded to yap noisily increasing in volume when abby refused to throw the stick and even hissed at him to eff off all this was too much for nugent shuffling out onto the stage on his belly he attempted to round trevor up and off the stage affronted trevor flew at nugents throat catching mostly shaggy black fur nugent was normally the most pacific of dogs but dignity offended he weighed in and furious growling was relayed by speakers all over the ground as though every hound in hell had been unleashed in fits of laughter and with great presence of mind georgie grabbed peggy parkers nearest flower vase and emptied three hundred pounds worth of lilies over trevor and nugent who took absolutely no notice there was no alternative but for a cringing viking to clamber onto the stage and separate them the crowd already in stitches were then treated to the edifying sight of the hero of the rso in a beautifully pressed cream dinnerjacket and snowwhite eveningshirt and because he hadnt expected his lower half to be seen in the pit torn espadrilles and boxer shorts covered in fornicating frogs what really upset viking was that he hadnt had time to brown his white legs to a chorus of jeers and wolfwhistles he grabbed both dogs come off it ye basstards and then because trevor was appropriately hanging on like a pit bull viking kicked him sharply in the ribs dont you hurt my dog you fucking bully the next moment flora who also hadnt expected anyone to see her lower half wearing only her crimson jacket flapping loose from its top button and a patriotic pair of union jack knickers had joined him on stage to more screams of laughter and roars of applause talk about the black hole of oh calcutta yelled dixie drop trevor drop screamed flora kicking nugent as hard as she could with her bare feet whos the great fucking bully now shouted viking only when georgie who was now even more hysterical with laughter than the audience emptied the contents of another flower vase over both dogs and their owners did trevor release his grip whereupon flora clutching her dog like a furiously yapping handbag and viking frantically examining nugents face and shoulders for gashes continued to hurl abuse at each other until george hungerford marched on hissing get those fooking dogs off stage at once and seized the microphone to deafening cheers he tried to diffuse the situation quickly by apologizing both to georgie and the crowd im afraid everyone including pooches gets overwrought in this heat in agreement trevor peered round floras arm and growled furiously at nugent another great cheer went up what a dreadful dreadful circus said gilbert appalled thank goodness sonnys out of it peggy said gwynneth patting peggy parkers hand georgie seized the microphone its all my fault she told the audience trevor belongs to flora my daughter who plays in the orchestra oh mum departing flora clutched her head with the hand that wasnt clutching trevor hes a rescued dog and clearly felt insecure locked up in my dressingroom went on georgie but he rescued me i was having hellish problems with that strauss song so lets get on with ve day trevor and nugent were soon forgotten the sun set in a ball of flame the polo field became a mass of waving union jacks as georgie started belting out roll out the barrel well meet again and therell be blue birds over the white cliffs of dover until declan joined her on stage taking it in turns to dry each others eyes we really ought to be singing the rising of the moon to strike a balance murmured declan finally they brought the house down with the lambeth walk after a dressing down from george that neither of them would ever forget viking and flora slunk back into the pit trevor and nugent were now in the care of harve the heavy and if i get any more trouble out of you george roared at flora hell feed that bloody little dog of yours to my rottweilers great jubilation resulted when it was relayed over the loud speakers that rannaldini and hermione had netted only half the rsos audience that night the moment the opera gala was over members of the audience had raced over from cotchester and were already climbing trees or crushing the wild garlic as they crept down through the woods to catch a glimpse of the great nemerovsky george however had a huge problem on his hands evgenia made up and ravishing in old rose chiffon her dark hair embroidered with pearls and gold ribbon had been ready for an hour but alexei was refusing to come out of his dressingroom not only had he insulted gilbert and gwynneth and blacked the eye of a scorpion reporter whod tried through his dressingroom window to do a trevor in reverse but hed taken a passionate dislike to miles are you ready to dance mr nemerovsky no i am not ready to dance fuck off of course hes not ready said viking scornfully fake tan takes at least eight hours to work you should know hissed abby convinced she was the only person who could coax alexei out she had been bitterly humiliated when hed dispatched her as summarily as everyone else the concert was already running an hour late which so far had only increased the bar takings and the anticipation but abbys head would be on the block if alexei didnt deliver outside alexeis dressingroom georges resolve was stiffened by the sight of evgenia next door slumped on the floor in her beautiful dress stretching and leaning forward to keep herself supple smoking too many cigarettes then cleaning her teeth till her gums bled because alexei hated the smell of smoke attacking increasing beads of sweat with a huge powder puff she had been driven ragged by the delay and by alexeis monumental selfishness the longer the wait the greater the entrance knocking on alexeis door ignoring the snarl to fuck off george went in we need to start alexei alexeis belongings tracksuit bottoms towels books tapes shoes spilled out of suitcases all over the floor fully made up wearing his wolfcoat over his romeo costume of white tights and floppy green transparent shirt alexei shivered convulsively as he listened to brittens war requiem on his walkman for the fifth time that day and george was suddenly reminded of a ram whod strayed off the moors into his nans parlour during a bitterly cold winter who had knocked over all the furniture and the knickknacks reducing the room to a shambles before leaping straight out through the big sashwindow george had never forgotten the combined terror and ferocity of that ram and looking at alexei he realized he wasnt bloody minded just shitscared always eet is same why do i put ass on the line noone who doesnt dance understand the cold sweat the fear you havent faced the rso in a bad mood or rutminster council when youre trying to pull a fast one george tried to lighten the conversation is not comparable haughtily alexei glared at george as if he was the village idiot will i remember the steps will i bore the audience am i too old to play romeo in the still face the black eyes rolled like marbles youre the best in the world alexei shrugged is millstone eef you are best you must always be bettair plonking himself in the second armchair george lit a cigar please dont smoke george hastily put it out when i was first married he said we had no money we saved and saved either to hear harefield sing alexei looked outraged that screeching beech or to see you dance we saw you in giselle at covent garden we couldnt afford a meal out afterwards didnt matter we couldnt have eaten anything we were so excited we could hardly speak on the way home it was truly the best evening of my marriage that was fifteen years ago i am old now sulkily alexei turned to the mirror picking up a cotton bud to tidy up a smudged eyeline george admired the long eyelashes sweeping the slanting cheekbones youve got a body any twenty year old would die for he said humbly patting his gut which junos diet didnt seem to be having much effect on he must stop sending jessica out for toblerone in the middle of the afternoon what appen to your marriage asked alexei my wife left me silly cow getting to his feet alexei put a hand on the portable barre raised his leg till his calf brushed his ear stretching and turning then he wandered over to the window floating down from georges silverpillared beech trees was the first pale green foliage alexei broke off a twig caressing the shiny satin leaves tender as young flesh he sighed tomorrow perhaps the day after the leaves darken and harden and coarsen and they will never be that young again did you know prokofiev was lousy ballroom dancer he write these great ballets but when he ask pretty young girls to dance with him they ran away dropping the twig in his glass of perrier stealing a last glance in the mirror alexei touched georges square blushing face with the back of a careless finger you are good guy i will dance for you evgenia was waiting outside bent over arms flopping loosely as graceful as one of georges willows hes on his way a rumble of excitement went round the vast crowd who were really squashed now as more and more people flowed in from cotchester floodlighting added splendour to the towering trees and the battlements of the house dropping his wolfcoat in the wings as if he were shedding the years alexei strutted on nostrils flaring dark head thrown back to show off the wondrous slav bonestructure halfsmile playing over the jutting lips thrustout chest beneath the floating shirt descending to the flattest belly above long strong white legs rippling with muscle alexei had no need of the older dancers disguise of black tights there was strength and arrogance in every inch of his lithe youthful body oh christ help me murmured marcus never had the rso strings played with such swooning lyricism alexei crept behind the pillar the lurking lover quivering with anticipation justin woken by the applause however had other ideas dad dad why isnt that man wearing any trousers there was a horrified pause that mans got no trousers on dad expect hes been playing in the pit said the labour councillors husband with a guffaw shut up hissed an anguished marcus dad dad whys that man got a big willy its called a codpiece justin said gilbert who believed in reason shut up you little fucker hissed marcus who didnt more like an ole cod in there said the labour councillors husband they cover that bulge in foam padding so you cant see the meat and two veg a rumble of embarrassed laughter was already sweeping the stalls marcus wanted to die alexei swung round glaring directly in his direction the laughter died alas gwynneth had been far too busy chuntering over the dog fight and alexeis bad behaviour in the interval to eat anything in her greed she had emptied a plate of canapés into her red riding hood basket to eat during romeo and juliet choking on a scotch egg she couldnt stop coughing alexei waited then when gwynneth puce as an aubergine carried on raised a regal hand and halted both orchestra and evgenia who by this time was floating down the staircase skirts swirling weel the old lady who ees bent on destroying thees concert alexeis acid drawl echoed round the whole park please either cough everytheeng up now or get out the dreadful pause seemed to last for ever as gwynneth stumbled out then alexei turned to abby we are ready to dance maestro briefly he looked drained and middleaged under the spotlight then as the doomladen swooningly romantic music swept through the park the years disappeared again evgenia danced angelically but it was alexeis passion that took the breath away he didnt just dance he became the young lover awkward shy bewildered reverent deliriously happy by turns holding evgenia so tenderly then releasing her to dance as if hed opened a window for a trapped butterfly then he would leap into the air showing off with wild grace look what i can do watch me touch the stars for love wait till he lands abby told herself grimly but time and again as alexei hovered over the stage it seemed he would never come down and the poor strings would run out of bow and the woodwind and brass out of puff but as they danced on through the darkening night until the moon rose huge and pink over rutminster cathedral everyone forgave him the delay and the tantrums oh god sighed marcus if only i were juliet the applause went on for twenty minutes stepping over the flowers carpeting the stage alexei and evgenia returned again and again pale and drawn but with eyes glittering with elation alexei took up his position on juliets balcony and with princely wave after princely wave raised each section of the orchestra to their feet giving the longest standup to the strings which was much appreciated as they were so often taken for granted look at the old queen on the balcony scoffed viking hes not a queen protested blue he was really french kissing evgenia i think hes wonderful bravo bravo alexei cried cherub excitedly indignantly abby noticed viking was back on his chair squeezing evgenias little hand every time she passed but all her indignation was forgotten because of the deafening cheers when abby joined the others on the platform and declan kissed one hand and alexei the other im with my peers thought abby joyfully as they bowed again and again to the sea of happy ecstatic faces stamp stamp stamp thundered the feet choking from the dust marcus thought how boyish abby looked she had thrown away her turban and slicked back her hair like valentino to show off the amazing yellow eyes alexei was burying his big mouth in the palm of her hand again christ things were complicated encore encore the great rumble grew louder i ave idea whispered alexei sending abby back to the rostrum once again he only lifted a hand for a hush to fall it ees nearly meednight we must all celebrate the most beautiful words in the twentieth century his voice thrillingly deepened and broke slightly veectory in europe the next moment he and evgenia had broken into the lambeth walk up and down the stage they danced so merrily and charmingly followed like two baby elephants by georgie and declan and the crowd bellowed their approval and all over the polo field and in the aisles between the seats people jumped to their feet singing and joining in even marcus found himself clamped to peggy parkers maroon bustier we must finalize a date for my soirée sonnys hard at work on your concerto she shouted over the din completely disproving the myth that fat women are light on their feet at midnight the fireworks went off red white and blue soaring into the sooty sky writing ve day across the stars seeing flora crying viking leant across and put a hand on her shoulder cheer up darling you know what ve stands for wwwwhat viola extinction day of course fiftyone it was a measure of georges heavies that they dispersed the multitudes at amazing speed and soon only three hundred guests were left to enjoy dom perignon asparagus lobster nemerovsky cold roast beef loganberry icecream and meringue evgenia under the stars everyone was desperate to meet alexei but as if to protect himself from boring conversation he had retreated with a vodka bottle through the cow parsley to a pale green semicircular bench under a big clump of white lilac and proceeded to flirt outrageously in russian with abby also in the same rowdy overexcited group were georgie declan and viking who were all getting plastered and arguing about the peace process and evgenia who seemed content to sit quietly retracing her steps in her head sipping orange juice and relishing the taut warmth of vikings body and his hand on the seat behind her occasionally stroking her hair nugent sat beside them pink tongue hanging out from the great heat and to pull in the pieces of roast beef everyone was giving him watching them from the shadow of a weeping ash marcus was once more reminded of peter and the wolf the cat viking was sitting on one branch the bird abby on another not too close to the cat and the wicked wolf alexei walked round and round the tree looking up at them with greedy eyes god hed shoot himself if abby got off with alexei and if she didnt how could alexei not fancy viking thought marcus in additional anguish viking was wearingjust his denim shorts and his white evening shirt with all the buttons undone gold hair ruffled lazy smile showing the chipped very white teeth his eyes however were cool and calculating a beachbum on the hunt for a sugar mummy to bankroll him through a long hot summer the lads are coming out all over europe he was telling declan as he glared at nemerovsky im so sick of being propositioned by gays in the music business im getting an i love pussy tshirt printed then he put abbys turban on mr nugent which nugent adored hes going to open an indian restaurant the celtic mafia wont get thrown out of viking told everyone abby tried to be a good sport about the turban and join in the roars of laughter but underneath marcus could see she felt hurt and foolish which was no doubt vikings intention he darent go over and protect her in case declan collared him the ash pollen was tightening the band round his chest he longed to slope off home but couldnt tear himself away if anyone was unhappier than marcus that evening it was flora from the safety of a little summerhouse she could see her mother getting plastered with declan im just not trying any more georgie was yelling im on a permanent faultfinding mission which doesnt help my poor husband declan would make a nice stepfather decided flora but georgie looking so good at the moment made her feel fatter and frumpier than ever she also knew that she would have been fired if her mother hadnt diffused the dog fight all around her people were crowing about the gala pulling in a bigger crowd than rannaldini and harefield if only people would stop talking about him a lamb was bleating persistently for its mother in a nearby field which made her eyes fill with tears god the smell of wild garlic was strong to stop a bristling trevor wriggling out of her arms and attacking nugent who was still getting too much attention in his turban flora retreated to the shelter of a great oak tree and watched george relentlessly working the room she also noticed the steel elf had piled up her golden hair and changed into a ravishing seagreen dress grecian in style and leaving one shoulder bare whenever george came across a restless pocket of bored men hed feed her in to bat her long blonde eyelashes and charm them watching them drool flora realized what an asset juno was to him what a little cracker said one of new labour councillors as she moved away from them wouldnt mind giving her one trust george theres no doubt said his liberal democrat friend if george can mount a do like tonight he can produce a megaplex with one hand tied behind his back i think we should back him on that supermarket seeing flora they paused lovely show well done going through the french windows in search of more beef for trevor flora surprised george eating illicit potato salad he made some attempt at geniality how dyou enjoy playing in the pit good training for when were a super orchestra georges face hardened hallo george great party god its hot it was lord leatherhead mopping his very low brow and in search of strawberries moost be nearly in the eighties said george look at that butter its completely melted makes it easier for you to grease the palms of all those incoming socialist councillors spat flora that is no way to talk to your boss said lord leatherhead with unusual sharpness one wonders how such a lovely warm beautiful woman as georgie maguire can have such a bitch for a daughter said george curtly and stalked out into the garden shaken flora went in the opposite direction into the hall where she found miles hilary juno gwynneth and gilbert in a huddle with mrs parker she spoilt our concert hilary was saying wearing those dreadful union jack panties and letting that horrid little dog loose marcus trailed miserably through the park the white hawthorn bushes were so like fluffy white sheep and their lambs that marcus halfexpected the smaller bushes to run bleating up to the larger ones as he approached declan cornered him in the summerhouse darling boy im onotterably sorry about the rift with your father are you ok the boy didnt look it he was wheezing terribly and was far whiter than the cherry trees which were steadily snowing down their petals i hear you had a great triumph with rachmaninov it was ok taggie sent special if surreptitious love marcus looked up she did dyou think dad will ever forgive me declan shrugged his massive shoulders he blames you for tabithas defection shes still in the rannaldini camp riding wonderful horses in america he also thinks rannaldini masterminded your rachmaninov concert but that was georges doing stammered marcus really agitated fighting desperately for breath i havent spoken to rannaldini since he married my mother hes destroying her let me talk to rupert no no marcus shook his head frantically it wouldnt do any good what would rupert do with a gay son marcus thought despairingly cathie jones leant against a wall empty glass hidden in the folds of her skirt blue stood beside her close enough for the hairs on their arms to touch neither able to speak for once she didnt mind that carmine was in the bushes with lindy cardew half a dozen people had drifted over in the last halfhour and praised her solo giving blue the perfect opportunity to escape but he was still there as the last person moved on he said i ought to get you another drink but im terrified youll vanish im going to make sure the programme needs a cor anglais when we go on tour in october then you can come too a limousine had arrived to take georgie home thank you for a heavenly evening can i come back soon she asked george and miles as swaying on her high heels she fell back into the car of course you can and were going to lunch she waved at declan indeed we are then seeing marcus she called out wistfully will you say goodbye to flora for me i havent seen her all night for a second her face crumpled im afraid i embarrass her then pulling herself together said well thanks everyone but as the chauffeur moved forward to close the door he was knocked sideways by flora hurtling across the gravel oh mum she sobbed im sorry ive been such a bitch grabbing trevor plonking him down on the seat beside her georgie pulled flora into the car and took her in her arms its ok baby its all right ive got noone to run to thought marcus despairingly as the limo bore them away to cap it howie having paid court to hermione in cotchester had beetled over to rutminster to cash in on abbys great triumph seeing his newest client he took marcuss arm hows prokofiev five its three actually ive got to go howie abby asked me to find you abby was still on the semicircular seat alexei was stretched out his dark head in her lap smoking a joint while evgenia massaged his bony calloused feet howie rushed forward hi there alexei im your greatest fan wonderful concert vonderful said alexei sarcastically the public they clap even when its good then peering round howie at marcus murmured hallo little peasant hardly a peasant laughed abby marcuss father owns most of gloucestershire marcus stared at them unable to move his eyes huge and shadowed his dinnerjacket slung over his shoulders hes the one who should play romeo mocked alexei theese love is too rash too unadvised too sudden too like the lightning which does cease to be ere one can say it lightens howie who wasnt interested in shakespeare broke the silence i want marcus to enter the appleton alexei he said help me persuade him piano competitions are sheet alexei took a drag on his joint rachmaninov greatest pianist ever clara schumann liszt schnabel horowitz gilels pablo gonzales none of them went een for competitions john ogdon did and john lill and murray perahia protested marcus ees media circus said alexei if someone ees good he come through anyway competition is queek passport your priority should be longterm aspect of music marcus has to pay the rent protested abby eef you lose competition alexei took a slug of vodka from the bottle you are finished not true said howie and if you win ok youre made heres my card alexei lets lunch anywhere in the world you name it whats your favourite restaurant alexei glanced up at howies waxy sweating face one een which you are not tearing howies card into little pieces he dropped it on the grass dont be so bloody rude said marcus furiously and stumbled off into the night abby caught up with him by the carpark whats gotten into you youre not mad because alexeis doing a number i do believe youre jealous oh markie you must know youre the one i love fiftytwo in the weeks that followed as alexei kept ringing up woodbine cottage from all over the world abby grew more uppity and convinced he had fallen in love with her horrified by the conflict inside him marcus lavished even more attention on abby but suffered fearful guilt he could still only get it up when he made love by thinking about alexei by day he concentrated on work having dispatched prokifievs third with credit in glasgow he now had another concert playing bartóks second concerto with the rutminster youth orchestra in the pipeline persuaded by abby helen and howie deliberately ignoring alexeis advice at the gala he had also entered for the appleton piano competition in october as competitors came from all over the world seeking the twentythousandpound prize marcus didnt even expect to qualify but if he did it would be good experience of playing under pressure in a rutminster jeweller abby pointed out a ruby ring in the shape of a heart knowing marcus couldnt afford it she suggested she bought it instead but marcus was adamant any engagement ring would be paid for by him on the morning after the gala flora found a note from julian in her pigeon hole summoning her to the leaders room at fivefifteen which meant she had to sweat her way through six hours of rehearsals and a lunchbreak before she knew her fate has julian said anything to you she asked abby nothing i guess hes going to carpet you for the dog fight flashing those union jack panties and generally having a bad attitude rubbishing george and so on george is a bastard just because he lent his house to us and saved the rso yet again i dont understand you flora flora didnt understand herself at the moment i just hate playing for this bloody orchestra she said crossly perhaps i should switch to singing she had promised her mother last night that she would start taking lessons again when she went quaking into the leaders room however and was faced not just with julian but old henry dimitri and peter his grizzled desk partner the firing squad the rso suddenly seemed very very dear to her im sorry she bleated i didnt mean to act up sit down said julian pouring her a glass of red wine we wanted to talk to you we dont feel youre very happy its the sack thought flora in panic being held open for me to jump into then theyll tie it up and drop me at the bottom of the river fleet sally briggs is getting married next month old henry was saying so she wants her evenings free sally briggs sat on the front desk of the violas beside el creepo she was a beautiful player who over the years had somehow withstood his wandering hands whys old henry beating about the bush thought flora miserably megagram vant us to record schuberts c major quintet said dimitri so we wondered if youd like to join our chambermusic group said julian diffidently flora choked on her wine might seem a bit fuddyduddy said old henry apologetically probably got better things to do with your evenings flora gazed at them in bewilderment fighting back the tears colour flooding her grey cheeks youre asking me i could try she mumbled oh my god its the nicest thing ill have to make time to fit in my singing lessons as well of course said julian just think about it i dont have to i cant think of anything id like better but youre all such wonderful players im not nearly good enough were the best judges of that said barry and we need some muffin for the record sleeve smiled dimitri he means crumpet said julian if you can get to my place tomorrow evening around six luisa will provide some kind of supper around halfeight flora reeled out of the leaders room slap into viking whod been hovering outside also terrified she was going to get the sack he now bore her off to the old bell for a drink they travelled in convoy nugent glaring furiously out of the back window of vikings car and trevor with his front paws on the dash board hysterically yapping on the front seat beside flora we are divided by our dogs like montague and capulet sighed viking as abandoning both animals in their respective vehicles they went into the pub viking was touchingly pleased at her news its no more than you deserve darling think how its going to put the toffeenoses of all those bitches hilary moll and even juno he added as an afterthought out of joint i dont think abbys going to be very pleased either flora said nervously might get her off her ass and make her start playing the fiddle again said viking viking was right abby tried to be generous but raging inwardly with jealousy she did start practising again constantly dragging in poor marcus to accompany her in june however she received the splendid accolade of being asked to conduct the london met in a sundayafternoon concert because their principal guest conductor had been rushed to hospital with appendicitis abby was in raptures rannaldinis old orchestra was still regarded as one of the greatest in europe and this invitation would certainly keep george and the rso board on their toes she was slightly miffed that marcus refused to come up to london to witness her triumph because he wanted to work on the bartók but at least he could look after the cats marcus was exceedingly twitchy the night before abbys concert he had had a terrible dream about alexei and his beautiful oiled naked body dancing away from him he woke pouring with sweat sobbing his heart out i dreamt i lost my car keys he lied that means frustration reproached abby marcus hadnt made love to her for three days being uptight about bartóks second concerto wasnt a sufficient excuse as she was leaving the telephone rang smirking buckling the aerial on the top of the back door abby waltzed the cordless into the garden then returned three minutes later still chattering i guess ive broken through the gender gap right people no longer see me as the first woman to do this or that but want to know what kind of artist i am no poor markies battling with bartók two i cant entice him away well if i see you ok i see you come backstage afterwards that was alexei smugly abby switched off the telephone and then scooped up scriabin covering him with kisses then spitting out his fur hes stopping at the ritz he wanted to know what i i mean we were up to oh theres the car a large black bmw had skilfully made its way up to the splashing stream scattering elderflower petals to right and left i must go kissing marcus lightly abby climbed into the back of the limo so she could spread out the afternoons scores a week ago she would have blown kisses and waved until she was out of sight it was such a beautiful day although the trees had lost the bright shiny green of early summer the field sloping upwards from the gate was streaked silver and gold with oxeye daisies and buttercups the limes were in flower luring the bees with their sweet lemony scent in a frenzy of jealousy and despair marcus washed up abbys breakfast and last nights dinner hoovered the drawingroom choking on the dust watered the pink geraniums falling out of the front windows loaded the washingup machine changed the sheets on his and abbys bed he then made a cup of coffee and wondering why it tasted so disgusting realized in his disarray he had added a teabag as well but anything was better than the loneliness of wrestling with bartók two hed played the concerto his first year at the academy but halfforgotten it was like dragging up an ancient wreck from the bottom of the sea he must find his own voice but he had to master the notes first oh god like scrubbing off a tattoo he tried to wipe out the indelible horror of abby in alexeis arms the aprèsconcert euphoria leading on to something more he loved abby and she seemed his only hope of keeping out of the quicksand as he wandered distracted into the garden he noticed the little stream shaking the ferns hanging over its bank as it hurtled towards the lake harts tongues the ferns were called like the tongues that would frantically wag if he were outed ruperts son a poofter he could imagine the headlines the papers would have a fieldday sweating he imagined his mothers horror ruperts lip curling in scorn what else could any father have expected from such a wimp he wished flora were here he had so wanted to tell her about alexei but each time hed bottled out she was so busy playing chamber music with julian and old henry and taking singing lessons that he never saw her by the front gate he noticed a white scented branch of philadelphus had been bashed down by last nights downpour as he broke it off to give it a few more days of life he heard the telephone ring frantic with excitement slipping on the mossy flagstones he raced into the house but it was only helen pumping him about abby wasnt it fascinating that she was conducting rannaldinis old orchestra rannaldini was kinda put out said helen laughing without amusement but she thought shed go along anyway rannaldini was in rome she went on expected back tomorrow how was marcuss asthma she rattled out the questions was he practising too little too much had he heard whether hed qualified for the appleton she didnt listen to any of his answers she sounded uptight when marcus said flora was away then relieved when he added that she and trevor were staying with her parents was helen frightened of all rannaldinis exes wondered marcus as he studied the bartók pencilling in reminders as he listened to her outside he could see scriabin stalking a mouse teetering along the fence plumy tail aloft like the sail of the corsairs pirate ship stealthily she crept towards him on her velvet paws thought marcus he could bear it no longer the moment helen rang off he dialled the ritz only to be told that mr nemerovsky had checked out gone straight to abby no doubt marcus banged his burning forehead against the windowpane work was the only salvation always practise as though you were playing in front of an audience even if its only the cat marcus remembered his old teachers words so now he played for scriabin nearly breaking the keys in the fireworks of the last movement working off his anguish until he was wringing wet the sun had also appeared round the brow of the hill blazing into his studio as he flung open the window he could hear shouting and a time bomb tick he must be hallucinating for there getting out of a taxi smothered in the same grey wolfcoat that he had been wearing at the gala was alexei as he tore across the lawn into the darkness of the cottage marcus realized he had forgotten to put the branch of philadelphus in water brandishing it like a white hot scented sword to defend himself he opened the door i ave no money said alexei simply can you pay the taxi he will take cheque ive got the cash marcus tried to curb his elation its only a fiver from the station i come from the reeetz by the time marcus had settled the bill with a cheque which would probably bounce alexei had made himself at home dipping chunks of brown bread into taramasalata and pouring abbys vodka neat into two icefilled glasses for you alexei chucked a little grey bag at marcus which clinked as he caught it roubles for when you come to moscow alexei tossed back one entire glass of vodka and handed the other to marcus who shook his head ive got to work ive got a concert on saturday i dont know the piece yet anyway he stammered his blushing crimson cheeks clashing with his dark red hair abby isnt here of course zat is vy i am here marcuss heart was beating so fast only alexeis flying feet could have kept up with it grabbing a rollingpin he bashed the stem of the philadelphus ferociously before ramming it into a pale green wedgwood jug the heady sweet scent was overpowering i ought to work he said obstinately i ought to walk mocked alexei i need country air in my lungs he refused to remove his wolfcoat in eengland i am always cold outside the sun highlighted his nightowl pallor the flecks of grey in the thick straight black hair last evenings eyeliner still ringed eyes that were just slits of amused malice beneath the heavy lids a halfsmile played over the rubbertyre mouth a cocksuckers mouth his father would call it thought marcus oh god help me alexei walked as he danced with a springy step leaning backwards chin raised head thrown back proudly idly whistling tunes from romeo and juliet as he went as they reached the wider path along the edge of the lake he took marcuss arm it was like walking with a bear marcus prayed they didnt bump into any of the celtic mafia he was having great difficulty breathing and longed to collapse on the bank amid the meadowsweet and watch the dark blue dragonflies divebombing the water lilies but alexei was gazing at the mayflies endlessly dancing above the still dark water making the most of their one day of life they are like me observed alexei bitterly you ave sixty perhaps seventy more years to play the piano i have ten to dance eef im lucky im not going to drag myself on like a wounded eagle like rudi you could always direct or teach alexei shrugged no more bravos no more centre of attention reaching the end of the lake they turned back up a rough track into the wood going deeper and deeper until only the occasional sunbeam pierced the darkness throwing ingots of gold light on the carpet of dark moss it was wonderfully cool after the blazing heat the birds were silent beneath their greenbaize cloth of leaves marcus kept his distance what dyou call this ere alexei was shaking a great acid green shawl slung over the branch of a towering sycamore tree old mans beard muttered marcus some people call it travellers joy a nicer name i am a traveller who will bring you joy announced alexei then when marcus didnt respond asked how ees anyone as beautiful as you so frightened leetle marcus you should be enjoying your beauty brave boys like you should not be afraid of wolves he added mockingly marcus started opened his mouth and shut it again they had been joined by mr nugent and mrs diggorys spaniel who often escaped together on illicit hunting sprees now the two dogs were crashing round trampling the last green seedheads and yellow leaves of the wild garlic the smell reminded marcus of taggies cooking and the gentle intimacy of long chats with her in the kitchen until these had been ruined by the return of disdainful disruptive rupert who was even jealous of a son he despised once again marcus thought how alike were rupert and alexei did all gays fall for men like their father alexei walked very fast splashing through the puddles while the dogs tiptoed round the edge marcus was getting breathless he wished hed remembered his inhaler you should take more exercise said alexei reprovingly i have asthma its hard to breathe the pollen and things foo to the pollen ees difficult to breathe because i am ere and you know it as alexei raised his hand to touch marcuss cheek the boy jumped away in panic his eyes enormous alexei laughed just then a beeg grey wolf did come out of the forest i cant alexei gabbled marcus i cant do it to abby the last time a man cheated on her she slashed her wrists hopefully she do eet proper theese time shut up i love her anyway ive got to marry and have kids my fathers got to have an heir ive let him down so much already being a wimp being shitscared of horses being terrified of him not even succeeding as a pianist it would feenish him off altogether eef he knew you were in love with a ballet dancer hey in terror marcus gazed into the still but curiously speculative face am i he muttered im supposed to be marrying abby you will make her terribly unhappy oh christ are you sure this time when marcus tried to jump away alexei held onto his hand with a boaconstrictor grip drawing him close no matter how ard the wolf try to escape he only pulled the rope round his tail tightair he whispered in marcuss ear the path ahead was really churned up like walking on turkey fat brambles clawed marcuss legs as if trying to hold him back twice he slipped twice alexei caught him then alexei halted idly pulling aside the curtains of ivy hanging from the roots of a massive beech tree to reveal a little cave marcus had to duck his head as alexei pulled him inside down onto a bed of mossy yellow stone strewn with ancient beech leaves youre so beautiful alexei took the boys flushed freckled face between his hands gently smoothing his cheekbones to wipe out the dark brown circles beneath the haunted apprehensive eyes ees stupid to fight it is so strong the hard haughty face was suddenly miraculously gentle and kindly first time i see you i want you you are the only reason i dance at rutminster for pittance you make me believe it would be possible to geeve the eart marcus could hear the manic rustling of the dogs after a rabbit the gruff drone of a helicopter through the ivy curtain he could see the brilliant blue sky thrusting between soaring grey limbs of a beech tree then alexeis big mouth came down on his and alexeis body on top of him was as hard and elemental as the mossy cotswold stone beneath a minute later unable to breathe marcus wriggled away but alexei was too strong for him look at me silly boy you ave pretty eyelashes but it would be nice to see your eyes doesnt this make your eart pound like nothing before nothing gasped marcus you know i love you it was the same for me i was utterly lost from the moment you bounded onto the stage like nimrod neemrod demanded alexei in outraged jealousy my fathers lurcher hes got killer eyes marcus gave a half laugh that became a sob youre a cross between nimrod and my father i love you but i cant do this to abby ush ush look into my eyes i am real you are home where you belong no more pretending let eet happen he was mumbling endearments in russian now which sounded so marvellous in his husky basso profundo voice you will always remember thees because it ees the first time anyway he added wickedly i must get out of these boots i bought them to eempress you and they kill me back at the cottage dizzy with exhaustion and happiness marcus cooked burnt sausages and lumpy mash for alexei which was mostly polished off by mr nugent and mrs diggorys spaniel the dogs didnt stay however to hear marcus play schumanns dreaming in the fading light he wasnt nervous any more alexei had ironed all the tension out of his body at the end alexei got up and put his arms round him you cannot marry abby i must it would destroy her not so much as eet would destroy her eef you do break it off now she would be devastated but only for a month or two far better an end with horror than horror without end you cannot afford to be tied you and i are artists like stars een the sky we seem close in the night but we are light year apart we are pellegrino eet means orphan and wanderer we belong to the world not each other we are married to art art is far more important than love not any more thought marcus as alexei slid two hands deep down inside his shirt he wanted to drive alexei to birmingham airport to catch a late flight to berlin but alexei insisted on taking a taxi eef you are feet to drive you should not be my agent weel pay the other end alexei wouldnt leave until marcus had promised to join him wherever he was in the world the moment hed dispatched the bartók he also insisted they swapped watches strapping his rolex which reeked of givenchy for men round marcuss wrist he proudly carried off marcuss schoolboy swatch as though it were made of diamonds marcus was only too happy to be left alone in the dusk stunned by the enormity of the afternoons events a thrush was singing in the garden repeating each exquisite phrase as he wandered down to the lake it started to pour huge raindrops divebombing unwary moths clattering on the leaves thrashing the lake creating rings which spread and ran into each other marcus thought watching them how everyones actions affected everyone elses in life nemerovsky loves me he shouted over and over again to the blueblack sky his belly churning and caving in to meet his backbone as he shivered at the memory waltzing home in the deluge he was running a scalding bath about to dream of alexei before crashing out when the front door flew open and in burst abby and helen in a state of euphoria abby had had a wonderful success with the london met its extraordinary she told marcus earnestly after four years they still retain rannaldinis precision and special timbre i dont give a shit thought marcus as they rabbited on why are they telling me this now helen was explaining how she had gone backstage after the concert and while she and abby had supper together abby had confided that she and marcus were getting married helen had been delirious with joy not only was abby a great and respected artist but an american like herself shell help you in your career and rupert is bound to come round when he hears youre getting married and then you and he and rannaldini can all be reconciled at the wedding helen like rupert had always suppressed a deeprooted dread that marcus might be gay marcus listened incredulously watching their mouths moving like rapacious baby birds as they planned his future he must give up all the horrible pupils with their awful mothers that drained him so dreadfully and rupert must give him a decent allowance but they agreed that rupert would only rate marcus when he won a big piano competition so all his sights must be set on the appleton im on the wrong train hurtling towards a cliff and i cant find the communication cord thought marcus in panic and what is more crowed abby i saw lady appleton who runs the appleton this evening and she said youve qualified but were not to tell anyone you walked it we must have a drink to celebrate neither she nor helen realized that marcus hadnt moved still on the bottom step of the stairs slumped against the wall watching them rootling around in the cupboard abby swore she had had some vodka flora must have drunk it theyd have to make do with brandy and best of all she said happily filling up three glasses lady appleton is so fed up with the orchestra who normally play at the finals overcharging that shes chucked them and she wants me and the rso to accompany the finalists instead which means two days of primetime tv wow what a day marcuss mind was racing like a cornered rat i cant go in for the appleton if youre conducting the orchestra he stammered only in the finals said abby soothingly there are two preliminary rounds before that lets cross that bridge when we come to it then suddenly she had a feeling of déjà vu as water started dripping on her head reminiscent of the hp hall only this time it was hot christ marcus youve left the bath running racing upstairs marcus found it a relief to plunge his hand into the scalding water to find the plug anything to offset the agony of not seeing alexei again when he came down noticing how shivering and pale he was except for one bright red arm helen and abby decided hed been overworking and packed him off to bed well have to get your morningcoat out of mothballs teased helen as she kissed him good night im so happy for you darling a mourningcoat thought marcus as he tossed and turned all night in agony the next day as a gesture of defiance he sold ruperts munnings and bought abby the ruby heart as an engagement ring abby however decided to wear it on her right hand until after the appleton in case she was accused of favouring marcus later in the day while she was out shopping marcus wrote a brief letter of renunciation to alexei quoting coventry patmore love wakes men once in a lifetime each they lift their heavy lids and look and lo what one sweet page can teach they read with joy then shut the book then he thanked alexei for the most wonderful few hours of his life past present and future but insisted that they must never see each other again alexeis only reply was a white feather in an airmail envelope the leaves of the rescued branch of philadelphus were now shrivelled its petals fallen ramming the branch in the dustbin marcus reflected bitterly that at least he had given it the same brief chance to blossom as alexei had given him freedom was clearly a destiny he was not going to reach flora was horrified but didnt show it when abby confided over lunch that she and marcus were getting married fiftythree the long summer ground on with all the inhabitants of woodbine cottage working flat out as well as playing for the rso flora was studying the creation with her singing teacher because the academy had invited her to sing the soprano part in a student production in september she had most fun playing chamber music as part of julians quintet it taught her to listen to herself and she soon lost her shyness joining in the furious arguments about tempo and merrily added to the wrong notes which increased dramatically as the red wine flowed until canon airlie who lived next door banged plaintively on the walls flora grew so fond of luisa and the pellafacini children that she could not bear the thought of such a happy family being ousted by a putsch late one hot night when she and julian were polishing off a bottle together in the garden she told him about georges and rannaldinis merger plot julians bony face was impassive but as he drained his glass his trembling hand spilled red wine dark as blood in the moonlight on his white shirt george is a great guy he said slowly hes done a helluva lot for the orchestra and he speaks his mind about a quarter of his mind snapped flora the rest is working out dirty deals hes utterly machiavellian beneath that bluff northern exterior i somehow trust the guy persisted julian rannaldinis different inflicting pain is the only other way he gets his rocks off if he takes over were both for the high jump said flora julian however agreed with viking that the whole truth would only panic a dreadfully demoralized orchestra let me do some digging ill have a word with bill thackery hes so discreet and now hes on the board he may have inside information flora was also worried about marcus trapped at woodbine cottage slogging away at pieces for the appleton and endlessly accompanying abby on the violin flora having been invited to join the pellafacini quintet had indeed been the spur to make abby practise seriously again the sound was amazing there was no doubt she would be up to concert standard by the autumn marcus however was listless and losing weight helen encouraged by rannaldini had struck up a terrific friendship with abby and had taken to dropping in getting on marcuss nerves constantly harping on her delight at his secret engagement meanwhile george and miles were busy finalizing details for the tour of spain at the beginning of october the orchestra would be playing rachels requiem with tchaikovskys romeo and juliet overture and rachmaninovs paganini rhapsody to pull in the punters and on alternate nights beethovens ninth symphony with a spanish chorus the highlight of the tour however would be barcelona where a sufficiently recovered rodney would fly in to conduct his old orchestra in an eightiethbirthday concert megagram were chipping in because the tour was a splendid opportunity to launch rachels requiem in europe but the rso were still desperately short of cash london orchestras charged large fees on tour but payments to regional orchestras didnt ever cover their costs additional funding therefore had to be found during the summer break george had taken to dropping in on woodbine cottage to discuss the orchestra with abby who automatically assumed he was after her she hoped he would act as a spur to marcus who seemed increasingly detached she also continually harped on about floras antagonism marcus and i want to have you and juno over to dinner but well have to choose an evening when floras playing chamber music as i know juno you and she dont get along this was borne out by flora vanishing like smoke whenever george rolled up then on the first saturday in august trevor went missing flora abby and marcus had been watching the cco at the proms on television dame edith was due to retire in the autumn and as this would probably be her last prom had camped it up like mad in white tie and tails in the middle the cameras had panned to gilbert and gwynneth looking odiously enthusiastic in the stalls this had produced so much barracking that trevor who only liked noise if he made it himself bolted out of the cat door absolutely demented flora combed the woods for twentyfour hours trying to find him i know hes trapped down a rabbit hole or been kidnapped by vivisectionists she sobbed as a final straw having been stung scratched and pricked to bits by nettles thistles and brambles her mobile had run out early on sunday evening returning home filthy tearful exhausted and hoarse from shouting to check if anyone had rung the cottage with news she was greeted at the back gate by trevor trying to pretend he had been searching for her with equal fervour all day he scrabbled at her so ecstatically that he pulled her boob tube down to her waist he had in fact been languishing after one of georges rotweillers who was on heat arriving home from zurich george had returned the lovelorn suitor and was now downing a large pimms with abby in the garden flora out of relief and gratitude was forced to join them blushing because george must have had a good look at her breasts she adjusted her boob tube pulled down the green baseball cap covering her dirty hair and prayed there were enough cuts and nettle stings on her legs to hide the fact that they had not been shaved for a fortnight what a ghastly contrast she must be to beautifully groomed juno or abby sleek and replete in a scarlet sarong ill just see if trevs hungry flora sidled towards the kitchen he isnt george and i tried to tempt him he must be love sick abby handed flora a glass of pimms try it george and i made it with kiwi fruit and mangoes she couldnt help feeling glad that flora was being seen at such a disadvantage conversation was very stilted hows the chamber music going asked george fine floras also learning the creation said abby convolvulus trumpets weaving in and out of the blackthorn hedge blushed pink in the setting sun george also blushed as he announced that there was a coincidence having given the cco a boost earlier this year dame hermione feels she would like to redress the balance and award a similar favour to the rso on her birthday on august hermiones a virgo gasped abby not for many years giggled flora im not having that bitch over the rso threshold snapped abby flatly stop being a drama queen said george crushingly we need the cash so were planning a huge spectacular of the creation and because its a religious work the bishop is allowing us to use the grounds of rutminster cathedral well bill it his voice thickened slightly as dame hermione in birthday concert if shes singing eve pointed out flora it ought to be dame hermione in birthday suit dont be fatuous flora lifted trevor onto her knee im so pleased to see you she said covering his little face with kisses goaty gilbert has such a crush on hermione she went on unrepentantly knowing george had one too perhaps hell deliver her on the pillion of his new bike she arrived by land rover at cotchester said abby were aiming for a helicopter more impact said george briskly ah so shes got a choice of your chopper or rannaldinis murmured flora into trevors rough fur i tort a taw a coup détat acreeping up on me shut up hissed george shooting a wary glance at abby who was far too upset to notice i am not going to work with that bitch after the way she and rannaldini tried to scupper the gala pink pink pink pink cried an agitated blackbird unnerved by the proximity of scriabin and sibelius who were chasing each other and big moths through the soft blue dusk with any luck itll rain said flora even if it chucks it down it wont shrink hermiones monstrous ego stormed abby the coup de grâce for abby was when hermione announced a week before the concert that she would need an extra ticket for her agent christopher shepherd who would be jetting in from new york abby downed sticks and refused to conduct that man screwed my career she screamed at george not from what marcus was telling me he says youre back playing chumpion i dont care right i am not conducting in front of christopher best revenge to show him how good youve got but abby was adamant at such short notice she expected george would bring in the fat controller or one of the rso regular guest conductors but to her horror and hermiones delight within an hour rannaldini who was after all a local boy living in nearby paradise had found a rare window in his diary and agreed to take over flora went ballistic the whole thing was a setup a plot to infiltrate rannaldini into the rso george had invited christopher over deliberately knowing abby would back down im not going to be conducted by rannaldini either she told viking im going off sick the rehearsals for dim hermiones creating as it became known were incredibly acrimonious the lecherous tenor alphonso last seen adding a profane note to the messiah when he swapped louis vuitton cases with flora was back singing the archangel uriel and jumping on everyone he had got so much fatter that miles who met him at the station couldnt change gear and when they arrived at the cathedral and george leapt forward to open the door alphonso tumbled out later when he fell over lurching forward to pinch nellies bottom he couldnt get up but lay like a turtle and george had to rustle up the entire chorus to right him adam and raphael were both played by walter a charming bearlike bearded german who detested hermione last time i sing vith her and take a bow she step in front and kick me in the shin he told flora walter was very taken by marcus who accompanied him in a piano rehearsal the boy he said was a natural accompanist and should take it up as a career as there was such a shortage of good ones and why was marcus so unhappy when flora mumbled about marcus wanting to marry a beautiful girl and worrying about not being able to support her walter gave her an oldfashioned look you are sad too my child flora confessed she couldnt face rannaldini and the moment his big black helicopter blotted out the sun when he flew in to take a full choral rehearsal on the afternoon of the performance she pushed off claiming shed got the flu abby traumatized at the thought of christophers arrival had dragged marcus off to paris for the weekend flora would have joined them if she hadnt promised to cat and dog sit in his pretty house in the close julian had also seen the helicopter land knowing that rannaldini would spend at least ten minutes primping in his dressingroom he picked up the score of the creation he loved the joyful tunes the celebration of nature the exuberant orchestration full of ravishing woodwind solos which enhanced but never overwhelmed the singing every day during its composition haydn had knelt down and prayed to god to strengthen me for my work god had answered his prayers the last time rannaldini and julian had met julian had been sitting in the leaders chair in drag aware that his job and the house in which he and his family had been so blissfully happy might at any moment be taken away from him julian fell to his knees praying that he might keep his cool and have the courage to protect his orchestra out of the window as he rose to his feet he could see the rso warming up nervous yet thrilled at the prospect of playing under such a great conductor the stage had been set up on the yellow droughtdried water meadows in the shadow of the cathedral and sheltered by two huge limes whose gold leaves trailed on the ground as if they were already in long dresses for tonights performance twenty minutes later the wilting musicians still waiting for rannaldini were running through the recitative in which god created the animal kingdom loudly and briskly julian led his first violins up the scale followed by a fortissimo bellow from the bassoons and trombones with cheerful roaring there stands the lion sang a smiling walter the strings then scampered up another scale followed by loud staccato pounces the tiger comes bouncing in leaps from his lair sang walter exactly on cue more feline and explosively unpredictable than any tiger rannaldini bounded on to the rostrum he looked magnificent lean fit and dark brown as though hed spent a month in linseed oil rather than sardinia both his tan and his sweptback thick pewtergrey hair were enhanced by a polo shirt the clear scarlet of a runnerbean flower which was tucked into pale grey trousers despite his outward sophistication all the primaeval darkness that had once covered the earth seemed concentrated in his malevolent black eyes but as they swept disdainfully over choir and orchestra every woman except militant moll was glad shed spent all morning frantically pulling on different clothes scenting bathing shaving legs washing hair and putting on waterproof mascara because rannaldini always made women cry rannaldini didnt miss a beat when he saw julian they told me you had come here mr pellafacini he said softly seeing their revered leader white and shaking fear ran through the rso cyril put away his bulb catalogue davie buckle his pack of cards rannaldini knew every note of the score and demanded fanatical precision his personality was so strong that musicians responded to the slightest move of a suntanned finger the lift of a thick ebony eyebrow a flared nostril had been known to bring entire flute sections out in a rash not by a flicker of a muscle did he now show how jolted he was by how much the rso had improved when it came to attack emotion and beauty of tone they were streets ahead of the cco so as was his wont rannaldini tore them apart instantly identifying the weakest musicians ordering them to play on their own making his beat so small and his instructions so piano that it was also impossible at the back to interpret them could you possibly beat a little more distinctly maestro and speak up a little quavered old henry i speak quietly hissed rannaldini so you will concentrate more get a hearingaid old man eef you cant interpret my beat how will you ever read that telegram from the queen when eet arrives seeing militant molls pursed lips he rounded on her and you can stop faking he screamed youre not lying underneath your weemp of a boyfriend now the orchestra gave a nervous guffaw say something nin hissed moll ninion gazed fixedly at his oboe rannaldinis cruellest jibes were reserved for old cyril who had got plastered at lunchtime in one aria in which god created the flowers and fruits the horns had beautiful drifting bars of triplets realizing cyrils trembling lip couldnt produce a pure note rannaldini made him play over and over again on his own finally suggesting cyril replaced his french horn part with his p cyril burst into tears mortified the orchestra gazed at the floor julian clenched his fists willing himself to speak out viking was already in a bad temper he hated the chorus resting their scores on his head and ramming their big knees into his back seeing him lean over and pat cyrils heaving shoulders rannaldini realized there was a member of the orchestra still to torture seven bars after ten on your own first horn flawlessly the notes floated round the water meadows again yelled rannaldini i want no hint of brassiness you are not weeth the black dykes band now viking played it again perfectly you no understand rannaldini jumped down from the rostrum and picked up julians fiddle theese is how i want it and he proceeded to play the phrase beautifully but with a slightly different emphasis viking put down his horn and strolling towards the rostrum picked up marys violin and repeated the phrase even more beautifully now you play it on the horn maestro he said insolently the orchestra grinned rannaldini lost his temper your section sound like donkey gelded with sceesors he screamed on cue the sun had crept round the cathedral spire gilding vikings blond mane with cheerful roaring there stands the lion muttered clare to candy oh go on viking are you speaking to me drawled viking what does eet look like tigerish rannaldini was poised to lash out eeet looks awfully rude please dont slag off my section like that we are quite prepared to do anything you want but only if you ask us nicely secondly the orchestra have now played for an hour and a half i suggest you thank them and give them a break finally cyril used to play in a horn section that was known as gods own quartet frankly youre not fit to lick his boots with rannaldinis screams ringing in his ears viking strolled off to close encounters which by special licence was open all day on his return rannaldini was still yelling in his dressingroom how dare you insult maestro rannaldini spluttered miles he says he never been spoken to like that in his life what a good thing i was here to teach the little shit some manners i didnt know you played the violin said knickers reproachfully thinking of the times he had been short of a fiddler indeed i do knickers im irish by this time hermione had arrived and was savaging her poor dresser she had just been the subject of this is your life whod had an awful time finding people to be nice about her and was also artist of the week on radio three so you couldnt escape the old bat particularly if you were george he had been excited and wildly flattered when dame hermione had asked if she could deal with him directly he had never dreamt it would involve endless reversedcharged calls at four oclock in the morning ive just remembered something else you can put in the programme about me george ive sung susannah fortyeight times not fortyseven and george had had to go back to the printers again because after god save the queer he didnt trust jessica but hermione still had numerous admirers all the occupants of the close had their binoculars trained on her heaving bosom as they pretended to do the times crossword a besotted gilbert had even shipped gwynneth off to a crumhorn workshop in bath for the afternoon and rolled up with her red riding hood basket filled with aubergine rissoles and a bottle of parsnip wine hermione accepted a glass graciously but unfortunately gilbert had been preemptied always on the prowl for likely lads hermione had taken a shine to viking the shine was not reciprocated for a start viking didnt like her dismissive remarks about abby look how happy these musicians are to be playing once more under a great conductor hermione told him as the entire rso whod all felt the need for several strong drinks filed grinning back from close encounters after the break hermione then started bitching about her fellow soloists i dont know why im working with such people to make money presumably said viking emptying the last of gilberts parsnip wine into her glass seeing his mistress coffeehousing with viking as he returned to the rostrum the great conductor decided not to appreciate her next aria why you make a pausa on top e i always make a pausa there rannaldini eef haydn had wanted a pausa he would have written he didnt write so we do not make the screaming match that ensued shocked even moony gilbert you seeng like a strangulated parrot i wont sing at all if you speak to me like that squawked hermione certainly sounding like one and stormed off the set menopausa grinned viking and as rannaldini was yelling at the cellos carried on an argument he and blue were having about who had bonked the oldest women ive had lots in their seventies said viking airly and their daughters at the same time bet you cant bonk dim hermione on her birthday indeed i can how will you prove it you can watch from the wardrobe just bring some rope after the rehearsal viking sidled up to hermione who was still foaming over the pausa and suggested a drink at her hotel before the concert orchestras and managements all over the world had discovered if you gave hermione a less than perfect hotel on which to vent her spleen she was less likely to be histrionic before a performance the rutminster royale was a new and fearfully expensive highrise barracks half a mile outside rutminster when asked by hermione to collect her key viking with great aplomb asked the dopey receptionist for the key to the room above which even better turned out to be unoccupied having kissed hermione with celtic fervour in the lift up during which time she had to clench her buttocks because gilberts parsnip wine was making her fart like a drayhorse viking thrust her into the empty bedroom enraptured by such youthful vigour hermione murmured she must freshen up telling viking to open a bottle of bubbly she disappeared into the bathroom giving him time to smuggle blue and an old bell rope hed found in the vestry into the wardrobe when hermione emerged grumbling she couldnt find her sponge bag viking threw her on the bed and produced blues rope i thought you might like a spot of bondage hermiones brown eyes glittered with excitement as he tied her to the bed post blue was laughing so much he fell out of the wardrobe a threesome cried hermione in excitement to blues regret viking then stuffed a handkerchief into hermiones mouth noone was allowed to slag off abby except himself and hanging a do not disturb sign on the door he locked it handing in the key as he and blue left the building fiftyfour noone could find hermione there was no answer from her hotel room christopher shepherd her agent supposedly on his way down from london wasnt answering his mobile fears grew that the great diva had actually carried out her threat and walked out perhaps shes playing haydnseek giggled clare perhaps shes been kidnapped said miles in alarm chance would be a fine thing muttered george he was fed up with both hermione and rannaldini neither of whom had stopped complaining in the inside pocket of his blueandwhite striped seersucker jacket bulky as a hidden gun was one hundred thousand pounds in cash to be handed over to them before they emerged from their dressingrooms tonight all the same he was faced with a mega crisis fans in their thousands waving banners and wearing i love hermione tshirts were pouring into the water meadows unpacking lavish picnics close encounters was doing a roaring trade in bottles of chilled champagne every seat in the stands was sold everyone living in the close had turned their chairs round to watch from the windows starlings making a din overhead scattered as the cathedral clock tolled seven it was an hour to blast off floras been studying the part with her singing teacher said julian she knows it backwards and shes got a beautiful voice said viking whod just rolled up looking innocent flora has flu said miles beadily came on very fast said hilary bitchily she was in the pub at lunchtime getting no answer on his mobile george drove over to the cottage the drought was in its fourth week he had got the baking hot evening hed prayed for the tractors raised clouds of dust as they chugged back and forth over the bleached fields collapsed goosegrass lay like brown dust sheets over bramble and nettles as he turned the mercedes up the rough track to woodbine cottage georges view was obscured by giant hogweed disappearing into the thick cloak of travellers joy next moment hed gone slap into flora and trevor driving the other way flora was tearstained and eating a mars bar neither car was damaged badly grabbing trevor flora tore back to the cottage she was locking george out when he put his foot in the door expecting a bollocking she was amazed when he asked her to go on in hermiones place dont be fatuous viking says you have a beautiful voice viking lied before he could talk george shouted then pleaded she couldnt let the rso down dont pull that boyscout number on me anyway i cant go on i look ghastly flora glared at herself in the hall mirror the makeup girlsll patch you up george was inside the cottage now and ive got nothing to wear although as i keep saying nothings very appropriate for eve why not provide fig leaves for me and walter alphonso would need a rhubarb leaf flora was edging across the kitchen no prizes for guessing whos going to play satan and with that she disappeared out through the back door george who had once played wing forward for the west riding caught up with her bringing her down with a fine tackle on the parched yellow lawn for a second as they struggled he realized how thin she had become and she discovered he was far less fat now than solid muscle stop playing jeremy guscott she hissed up into his battered rotweiller face youre not pretty enough ouch yelled george as trevor bit his ankle well done trev flora was temporarily ecstatic looking down george could see her eyes were the same smoky green as ash leaves on the turn please flora please he rubbed his ankle for a second flora pressed her head against his shoulder then the tears spilled over rannaldini wont let me onto the platform hes got no option come on luv well all be behind you youre on top of me grumbled flora her last defence was that shed lost foxie ill find him go and get dressed abbys cream silk shirt was miles too big and fell to just above floras knees she looked like a shepherd boy what about a skirt ive only got minis ok forget it why dont you ramraid parkers and get me a little spangled number you look chumpion george thrust foxie into her arms only the child lock stopped flora jumping ship first into the lake whose surface was suddenly darkened as a black cloud moved over the sun then onto the burnt verges particularly when she saw the huge crowds overhead drifted a lilacandshockingpink striped air balloon ive always longed to go up in one of them moaned flora particularly now but the waiting makeup girls had fallen on her like vultures drawing her into the cathedral chapter what kind of base would you like preferably one that sings in tune said flora she couldnt study the score because they were putting blue drops in her reddened eyes and then making them up she couldnt reply to walters and alphonsos rather hearty assurances of support because her lips were being painted passionately relieved they didnt have to compete with hermione they were clearly apprehensive about being landed with an absolute lemon sweat was flowing in rivulets down floras ribs she was shaking violently she knew rannaldini would screw her up not giving her time to breathe there you look lovely good luck theres so much goodwill for an understudy chorused the makeup girls outside georges fingers closed on her wrist like a handcuff you look beautiful he said in surprise i look like a tart in all this slap eve would have no need of an apple how are zee buttieflowers asked alphonso whose girth was winning the battle against his white waistcoat leaving her in the warder care of miles and walter george steeled himself to make an announcement christ the crowd was enormous all those excited faces suddenly becoming an ugly black sea of hostility i have to apologize for the ubsence of dame hermione who im afraid is indisposed george shouted over a rising surge of disapproval but i am happy to announce that a local lass has gallantly taken her place miss flora seymour who is the daughter oh no poor mum groaned flora appalled is the daughter of rutshires very own georgie maguire the crowd wasnt remotely mollified there was a lot of booing and shouts of give us our money back miles knocked cautiously on rannaldinis door he didnt want a repeat of alexei and the gala im going to faint thought flora her heart was pounding her ribs the inside of her knees were black and blue from knocking her throat as dry as miless drinks cupboard shed never be able to sing out swept rannaldini his musky cloying scent nearly anaesthetizing her she noticed his teeth were whiter than the gardenia in his buttonhole as he smiled and clapped friendly hands on the shoulders of alphonso and walter good luck my friends not that either of you need it followed by little jokey asides in italian and in german this is flora seymour george propelled her forward like a reluctant dog towards the vet who is very courageously standing in i know youll give her every assistance maestro we know each other said rannaldini flatly only flora could read the implacable hatred in the midnightblack eyes rannaldini was once with me in paradise she said sadly the orchestra gave her a great cheer when she came on but a rictus animal grin was frozen on her face as his chief executive collapsed into the seat beside him lord leatherhead noticed that george hadnt changed and his seersucker jacket was covered in grass stains hope you know what youre doing george only then did george pause and realize what he had done in his desperation for the concert to go ahead there was the poor child looking frightened out of her wits and absolutely tiny beside walter how could he have bullied her into it suddenly despite the nowstifling heat of the evening he too was drenched in icy sweat as he opened his programme hermiones serene and lovely face smiled up at him getting out a biro george drew a moustache on it along the front of the stage huge regale lilies were scenting the hot evening air i would never have wasted my best blooms if id known that trollop was going to sing hissed peggy parker rannaldini had deliberately chosen to wear black tails braided with satin so he would stand out more dramatically against the white djs and shocking pink jackets of the rso down whisked his stick introducing chaos which was portrayed by deafening discordant crashes interspersed with sweet pianissimo murmurs on the strings followed by woodwind calling to each other across the dark void flora was dimly aware behind her of rannaldinis beautifully manicured hands controlling the orchestra hands that had once explored every inch of her body and brought her to the ultimate corrupt pleasure perched on a gold chair glared at by a vast crowd she had a fifteen minutes wait before her first aria and what terrible words to start with astonished heavens happy host gazes upon the wondrous work words and notes were a jumble of black alphonso and walter had already sung the audience were looking slightly less hostile here we go flora stood up noone could miss her frantically trembling legs that must be why singers wore long dresses rannaldini gave her a curt nod astonished havens hippy host sang flora her voice coming out breathy and squeaky gazes on the wondrous wok someone laughed someone booed and from their throats rings out praise croaked flora as the booing grew to a crescendo she dropped her red score with a clatter and put her hands over her face im sorry i cant go on she sobbed the ground fell silent a police horse neighed george leapt to his feet trying to climb along the row siddown yelled the rows behind who didnt want to miss a thing anyway george had been forestalled rannaldini had jumped down from the rostrum putting his arms round flora whipping the arcticwhite handkerchief from his breast pocket gently tugging down her hands so he could dry her eyes of course she can do eet he shouted to the crowd she ees verra brave girl then turning to flora smiling at her with such encouragement we know you ave most beautiful voice in the world carissima he murmured do you want to go off for a moment he added as charlton handsome belted on with a glass of water flora shook her head it was all over in a minute rannaldini gave her another hug ruffled her hair causing a collective wince among the makeup girls and climbed back onto the rostrum then on second thoughts he leapt down handing her back his handkerchief sending a benign rumble of amusement through the crowd back on the rostrum he raised his stick turning smiling dazzlingly okkay flora flora nodded and the crowd gave a great roar of applause until rannaldini silenced them how charming hissed peggy parker to gwynneth abigail could never have handled that even gilbert came out of mourning for hermione flora seymour had rather interesting breasts in that silk thingy he must send her a bottle of parsnip wine floras voice was a little choked and ragged to begin with but grew in strength and sweetness by the minute throughout her first aria walter held her small hand as alphonso got up to sing he smiled across lovingly the vast audience felt they were part of some family drama floras next recitative began and god said let the earth bring forth grass and legalize it too thought flora which made her smile and the aria that followed about the gentle jewelled charm of the wild flowers and golden fruit was so beautiful that she suddenly realized the audience were smiling as well rannaldini still wants me she thought in rapture im being given another chance her next entry was the trio with alphonso and walter both of them unselfishly held back so that her clear piercing voice could soar larklike above theirs there was a deafening applause at the end of part two and once the audience had accepted the fact that there was no interval and theyd have to cross their legs for another hour they relaxed and enjoyed themselves watching the stars come out and the houses in the close light up like halloween pumpkins pictures were now coming up on the huge television screens on either side of the platform first the glitter of a trumpet the gold of vikings mane the hair on julians bow drawn out like chewinggum rannaldinis left hand dancing like a blown leaf to the music but mostly the cameras concentrated on flora watching her face growing more distinct as the light faded george wanted to put her under his arm and warm her into clarity like a polaroid by comparison the ladies of the chorus looked like the witches in macbeth he was increasingly uneasy about the undeniable chemistry between her and rannaldini like one of draculas bats he could see the shadow of the television microphone on her freckled breast bone nor was viking happy the last thing he wanted either was for rannaldini to get off with flora again he was extremely curious to see the man for whom abby had cut her wrist but noticed in extreme indignation that the seat beside miles was still empty christopher shepherd hadnt even bothered to show bloody hell so abby neednt have pushed off after all and rannaldini neednt have taken over and viking had to admit that the bastard gave off such electricity that the orchestra were playing out of their boots and abby couldnt fail to show up unfavourably by comparison he also had to confess that without abbys histrionics the rso seemed very dull god was now creating eve adams lovely gracious wife in happy innocence she smiles sang alphonso such was his swelling emotion that his waistcoat button gave up the unequal struggle and flew through the air nearly blacking goaty gilberts eye flora fought the giggles and only sobered up when she caught a glimpse of helen looking blasted with misery in the fourth row the orchestra had played miraculously for nearly two hours the strings bowties were under their ears but at last they reached the final chorus with soloists to the glory of god let song with song compete sang flora joyfully the glory of the lord shall last forever amen there was total silence a dog barked a car backfired followed by hysterical screaming applause the orchestra were all cheering for flora well done darling she could hear viking yelling at first very shy not knowing how to accept such applause she gradually began to smile and even blow kisses to the rapturous stamping clapping shouting throng and how could she not with rannaldini beside her lifting her hand to his lips covering it with kisses pouring sweet everythings into her ear my little star my angel child i knew you could do it i distance myself i know suffering produce great art flora had wanted to make him crawl but she couldnt help herself i love you she whispered clutching a huge bunch of copper roses to her breast helen was distraught that bloody girl shed always been after rannaldini george who had read paradise lost at school suddenly remembered satan like a toad squatting beside eve whispering words of temptation into her ear hed got to rescue flora he was convinced now that something had gone on between her and rannaldini but when he fought his way to her dressingroom she had already been spirited away by miles and lord leatherhead to the big celebration dinner for sponsors soloists and the management at the rutminster royale who were giving the rso a discount he wasnt even cheered that hed saved forty thousand pounds on hermiones fee christopher shepherd whod been delayed at the barbican signing up a very pretty thirteenyearold chinese cellist was not pleased to find a strange redhead singing the final chorus in hermiones place and shepherd denston ten thousand pounds the lighter he proceeded to jackboot about wheres dame hermione never showed up said george dame hermione has never been late in her life thundered christopher quite untruthfully what in hells happened to her she may have been kidnapped right why didnt you provide a body guard shepherd denston will expect full compensation arriving at the royale however christopher and the other guests were relieved but somewhat startled to see dame hermione swinging like guy the gorilla from a rope of knotted sheets and duvet covers trying to find a foothold on the floodlit balcony of the bridal suite unwilling to admit shed been tied up and left by viking and blue she had to fabricate a tale about being so upset about the pausa row that she had locked herself into the wrong room without a telephone i couldnt make anyone hear she sobbed into christophers manly chest dont worry well sue the hotel and rannaldini and the orchestra christopher glared at george for booking you into such a crumby joint bollocks exploded george theres absolutely no way were responsible every attempt was made to trace dame hermione what a pompous prat he decided although dame hermione was hastily reassured by christopher that she was insured against accident her squawks increased when she discovered that flora had stood in for her so triumphantly and even more so when she learnt rannaldini and the little tramp had vanished even more upset than either hermione helen or christopher who was furious not to be able to sign flora up or alphonso who wanted to jump on her or walter who wanted marcuss telephone number was george totally abandoning his duties as host to an everwilling miles in increasing despair he commuted between rannaldinis house in paradise and woodbine cottage but both remained in darkness on a third visit to the cottage which flora in her haste had left unlocked george collected a hysterical trevor and took him back home at two oclock the storm broke the first clap of thunder sending the little dog shuddering into georges arms george was still drinking whisky stubbing out the umpteenth cigarette listening to the thunder grumbling in the distance as though it had been evicted from the pub when the doorbell jangled frantically and flora staggered in there was an ugly bruise on her cheek she was soaked to the skin abbys shirt ripped down the front was almost transparent she was clutching foxie and shaking convulsively i cant go back to the cottage in case rannaldini follows me oh thank god youve got trev you are kind she gathered up the screaming excited little dog whose scrabbling claws ripped abbys shirt even further oh angel how could i have left you in this storm rannaldini has this horrible effect on me then she glanced up at george please please dont be cross with me can i have a bath she must have slept with rannaldini thought george the pain was horrifying but he said of course and poured her a large brandy when she came down wrapped in his huge greenandblue striped dressinggown he gave her another brandy and put her in a leather armchair and turned on the gas logs im sorry she sobbed i cant talk about it and then proceeded to do so for nearly two hours without stopping telling him how rannaldini had destroyed her he pursued me and pursued me and when i was sixteen i didnt fancy him at all i was much keener on his son wolfie but finally i gave in and got totally hooked then he binned me like a mailorder shot because i said boris was a brilliant conductor and he promptly seduced boriss wife rachel to punish boris and me ive behaved dreadfully badly she went on in a whisper but i wanted to sleep with him one more time tonight just so he could see how id improved like the rso tears were streaming down her blanched cheeks and i was so cross with you and viking for forcing me to go on im sorry george shook his head but you were funtastic ubsolutely woonderful you saved the orchestra none of us will ever be able to thank you enoof i was lucky rannaldini was on my side for most of the evening anyway i thought you getting him in to conduct was all part of your plot to oust abby and infiltrate rannaldini into the rso happen it was george looked faintly sheepish but not any more working with him at close range ive realized what a shit he is bed wasnt any good tonight dolefully flora wiped her nose on the sleeve of georges dressinggown now i feel empty ive wanted him back for so long but when he made love to me i just felt dirty we were in his tower george touched the bruise on her cheek he do this flora nodded because i didnt want to make a night of it but the scratches on my legs those are brambles i ran out on him through the wood when i reached the road i hitched a lift christ in that dress i know it was crazy i just felt if i got to you id be safe a pale grey triangle between the curtains showed dawn was breaking so george put her and trevor to bed in a spare room with a hotwater bottle and a nightlight looking up at his tired turneddown eyes and squashed face flora decided he was more like a mastiff than a rottweiler why dont you wear your glasses any more they were only plain glass to intimidate people flora laughed drowsily sorry i screwed up your evening i misjudged you youre a sweet guy closing the biggest deal had never given george such a lurch of happiness he left her to fall asleep counting glow stars but when he went in with a cup of tea at ninethirty she had fled again the net curtains were flapping in the open window like a dracula film perhaps rannaldini had spirited her away george was shocked at the wave of desolation that overwhelmed him fiftyfive flora didnt become a star overnight because she didnt want to she had seen what stardom had done to her parents marriage instead she told the journalists who clamoured for a story that she preferred to build her singing career slowly and stay with her friends in the orchestra what orchestra snarled dixie brandishing the telegraph appointment page well be lucky if were still in business at christmas the arts council meanwhile with predictable pusillanimity had set up an independent review body to study the two orchestras the rutshire butcher had not helped by giving the creation a rave review saying it showed what a lazy lacklustre orchestra could do under a great conductor the sooner the cco and the rso are closed down and merged into a super orchestra he had added presided over by rannaldini the better the review was picked up by all the nationals rodney was outraged and weighed in from lucerne in a letter to the times independent review bodies he wrote consisted of a lot of old tabby cats and failed politicians guzzling digestive biscuits and exhausting entire rain forests to produce reports that noone read for a sum of money that would keep both orchestras going for the next ten years the arts council he went on ought to have their legs and hands tied together and be merged with the biggest tidal wave in history a fuming miles rang rodney and bollocked him for muddying the waters gilbert and gwynneth had to be kept sweet nothing could keep those guzzling pigs sweet except bombe surprise replied rodney sharply and dont you speak to me like that you little twerp im nearly eighty and i can do exactly what i like feelings therefore ran high at the annual cricket match between the two orchestras which this year was held at cotchester everyone remembered why rodney had employed bill thackery in the first place when he made an opening partnership of one hundred and fifty with davie buckle the rso were all out for two hundred and twentyfive and justifiably certain of victory got stuck into the beer in the teainterval only pausing to cross themselves as a shadow moved over a watery sun and rannaldinis helicopter landed on the pitch to everyones horror gwynneth and gilbert were with him as gwynneth jumped down the wind from the helicopter blades blew her naturaldyed skirt above her head to reveal hairy legs and a hugh black bush as though john drommond had hitched a lift said viking gwynneth promptly charged up to miles and hilary just had luncheon in paradise sir roberto was so caring and remembered my weakness for caviar and bombe surprise he picked us up in the heli but i said hed have to let gilbert and i come home with you on the coach because we want to sing madrigals how wonderful hilary clapped her hands i sang the silver swan to sir roberto on the way here he says my voice is remarkable said gwynneth complacently rannaldini had had to do a lot of leg work with gwynneth to make up for disappearing with flora after the creation but had now completely won her over rso spirits rose even higher when hugo very pleased with himself after a dazzling lark ascending at the proms was bowled for a duck followed by the rest of the cco losing eight wickets for one hundred and ten thatll teach you to programme vegetarian crap sneered barry the bass rubbing the ball on his long hard thigh as dame edith strode in swinging her bat like botham having captained cheltenham ladies before the war she proceeded to play like botham making a hundred and twenty and breaking two cotchester town hall windows good thing those werent hp hall windows barracked the cco from the pavilion you couldnt afford to get them mended rannaldini whod been pressing the flesh of local councillors then presented the cup to a puce and dripping dame edith but left kissing her on both cheeks to a very uptight lady rannaldini feelings ran so high that after the shortest aprèsmatch drinks in the history of the fixture a punchup broke out in which hugos eye was blacked and viking lost his front tooth again which had most of the rso on their knees in the dusk looking for it miles was relieved to get gilbert gwynneth and hilary safely onto the pond life coach leaving poor harassed knickers to get the others and vikings tooth into moulin rouge before further mishap occurred or so he thought five miles from rutminster as the madrigal group were soulfully carolling suddenly moulin rouge overtook pond life and the silver swan died on gwynneths lips as the entire celtic mafia plus cherub davie and barry the bass flashed by doing a moonie what the fuck were you playing at roared george when he summoned viking dixie and barry as section and ring leaders into his office next day giving gwynneth a bum surprise said viking for a second george fought laughter then he shouted its not funny have you guys got some kind of death wish i am trying to save this orchestra are you snapped viking who had not forgotten orchestra south i bloody well am snapped back george who had just paid marythemotherofjustins telephone bill even your pretty face isnt enough to pull in the punters these days an audience of twentyeight in stroud last week is not going to get us out of the wood the one cheery note was that as a result of the creation there was just enough money to go on tour the hotels the chartered flights the coaches and train fares had all been paid for in advance enough money had been set aside for the pianist in rachmaninovs paganini rhapsody and the four soloists in beethovens ninth symphony when the soprano pulled out with shingles flora was consequently persuaded by miles and julian to take her place which would save the orchestra a further ten thousand the highlight of the tour however was still rodneys birthday concert knowing she would feel upstaged by his return rodney had telephoned abby the birthday treat that would make me most happy darling would be our double comeback and for you to play one of the mozart concertos to his amazement abby had agreed shed have to take the plunge some time and she couldnt bear flora to be the only one saving the orchestra money she was annoyed that even when she promised to provide pianos in every city marcus had refused to accompany her to spain all anyone can think about around here is money said abby crossly but at least all the horrors of bills repossessions overdrafts and looming redundancy were forgotten as the tour approached eightysix musicians make up a sexually volatile mix tours abroad were regarded as bonking bonanzas davie buckle for example was terrified by and totally faithful to his hefty wife brünnhilde at home but went berserk on tour players started stepping round each other setting up liaisons weeks before dimitri brushed his wild hair for the first time in years in the hope of advancing beyond tea and cakes with miss parrott dirty harry an ancient bass player who never washed was actually seen cleaning his teeth in the gents even stingy carmine bought a round in the pub among the women there was much highlighting of hair bad temper over crash diets and waxing of legs despite miless strictures that noone might bring more than twenty kilos of luggage everyone spent money they hadnt got on new clothes it would be warm in spain announced miles shorts and a cardigan for the evening aware that she would be the prettiest girl on tour juno saw no point in buying anything but a chastity belt she wished george were coming to protect her from lecherous latins but the poor darling was working too hard to get away hilary had bought a copy of don quixote and several guidebooks but felt mantillas would be cheaper when she got out there she and miles were looking forward to praying in several cathedrals on a management level parsimony wrestled with morality to save money miles wanted as many musicians to share rooms as possible but he wanted blokes to share with blokes everyone refused to share with dirty harry or el creepo there was consequently an unofficial list and an official one randy officially shared with dixie candy with clare once on tour candy would move in with randy clare with dixie everyone intended to play musical beds nellie had philanthropically promised herself to a different brass player each night except for blue and lincoln vikings fifth horn a handsome willowy youth who was in love with little jenny cherub was dying to make a pass at noriko and had bought some black silk pyjamas which miss parrott had turned up for him the main push of the tour however was who was going to finally bed abby all interested parties had chipped in fifty pounds the winner getting two thousand proof of the bonking had to be a picture of the winner and abby in bed as a result polaroid cameras sold out in rutminster high street as an alternative the event could be witnessed by telephoning dixie who since his success as gwynneth in the christmas concert had taken to occasional cross dressing dixie would then barge into the room disguised as a waitress pretending to be delivering room service to the happy couple randy had taken a book on the winner viking was favourite blue himself and handsome barry the bass right up to cherub peter plumpton and simon painshaw who were both gay and el creepo carmine jones and dirty harry this had all to be kept secret from the women of the orchestra who might sneak to abby and particularly from flora and julian who would both violently disapprove most of the men would have liked to have a crack at flora they had originally backed off because they felt viking had claimed droit de seigneur but since the creation flora seemed to be putting out fewer signals than ever flora didnt want to go on tour one bit she loathed the idea of leaving trevor whom she kept finding shuddering under the clothes in her suitcase and although she scuttled away like an embarrassed daddylonglegs every time george appeared in the building she hated the thought of not seeing him for ten days either blue had made no progress with cathie jones but he knew she was in a bad way because hed seen her grey as the fluffing willow herb sitting down by the railway line which she always did when she was feeling suicidal but good as his word at the gala he had persuaded knickers to take cathie on tour as an extra at first cathie refused because her only black dress stank under the armpits and carmine refused her the money for a new one blue got round this by buying her a crushed velvet midi from next he then tore out the label and persuaded a friend who worked for the oxfam shop in rutminster to make out a fiftypence bill to show carmine carmine was furious but he didnt intend cathies presence to cramp his style he and el creepo intended changing bedrooms several times viking liked going on tour being blond like juno he was always mobbed in latin countries not trusting the barbers of seville he had his hair cut and streaked by giuseppe of parkers the week before dropping in at the solarium afterwards he found the entire brass section stretched out on sun beds returning in disgosst to hp hall he was summoned to the top floor where george miles digby quinton his third horn and an unhappy julian awaited him a very overexcited miss priddock was hovering in the doorway george then told viking that old cyril must go he was drinking far too heavily he couldnt centre the notes any more and last week during shostakovichs fifth symphony he had fallen off the stage and carried on playing a different tune and on saturday cyril passed water on stage said miles with a shudder he did not snapped viking ay saw the steam raysing chipped in miss priddock viking looked at cyrils scarlet dahlias on georges desk that steam was coming out of blues ears because abby was wearing a silver flying suit he said but he knew he was fighting a losing battle hes got to go george said gently you cant protect him for ever best before the tour said miles ill speak to him at once were leaving on monday said viking in outrage well hes certainly not up to the fourth horn solo in beethovens ninth it goes on for pages protested quinton its really too high for fourth horn said julian reasonably quinton had better play it ill tell cyril said viking icily and he can go at christmas give him time to adjosst then looking round at their several dubious and disapproving faces threatened if he goes before then i go too viking found cyril at home downing his second bottle of red of the day and looking at the delphinium catalogue they had such beautiful names faustus pericles othello which was dark crimson and cassius a rich dark blue he could order some cassius and watch them merging into the deepening blue dusk next summer as he sat out in the garden listening to his old records and getting through the odd bottle before tottering off to bed he was delighted to see viking but surprised he wouldnt have a drink viking did it so kindly im sorry cyril we all adore you but youre not cutting it any more youre the best guy ive ever played with ill still need your advice so stay to the end of the year and after that you must come and see us cyril would have preferred to have gone straight away but he needed the money what will you do asked viking i expect ill go and live with my sister after viking had left cyril tore up the catalogue he couldnt afford delphiniums now and there wouldnt be room for them in his sisters windowboxes mrs rawlings who lived next door could have sworn she heard pitiful sobbing later in the evening but cyril was such a cheery soul it must have been the wireless viking had gone out and got absolutely plastered on the eve of the tour over in the close a disconsolate julian watched luisa pack for him he loathed touring he couldnt bear being parted from his dear wife for even a night poor old cyril he sighed im not sure it isnt kinder to put musicians down than to retire them the rso is all the family hes got julian looked at the save the rso sticker in the window somehow he had to save his orchestra appassionata fifth movement fiftysix finally on a cold grey morning at the beginning of october the orchestra were waved off by a disconsolate troop of wives girlfriends a few martyredlooking husbands weighed down by baby slings brünnhilde buckle towering over everyone and marcus waving the paw of a swallowing trevor but just like cosi fan tutte the moment the buses were out of eyeshot everyone swapped places particularly on moulin rouge and out came the drink and the fags ive got some freshly squeezed orange juice for you said hilary as she sat down beside miles who had just rolled up in an uncharacteristically smart offwhite linen suit and an opennecked navyblue shirt doesnt miles look nice in stone said clare as she collapsed beside dixie nicer still if he were turned to it at least that colour wont show up the scurf were all going on a workaholiday sang flora to viking as they sailed past parkers displaying frightful autumn fashions in burgundy rust and snuffbrown out in the country autumn was busy daubing the woods in orange and yellow rooks and gulls argued over newly ploughed fields behind veils of little cobwebs the hedgerows blushed with berries an ironic cheer went up as the buses approached heathrow and were overtaken by a sleek black limo with abby immersed in beethovens ninth in the back maestros usually travelled separately going first class on plane and train and sometimes staying with the soloists in more expensive hotels than the orchestra which would tax the ingenuity of abbys wouldbe seducers even further our fright will last two hours said noriko consulting the schedule as they queued to check in totally ignoring miless twentykilo limit clare rocked up with four suitcases and three tennis rackets weighing one hundred and twenty kilos confidently expecting brawny dixie to hump it all around for her being her first tour she hadnt appreciated that musicians never carry anyone elses stuff or that dixie would be far too busy competing with the other men to carry abbys six suitcases of scores beethovens ninth was larger than the chinese telephone book and clothes for each concert plus a second change for dinner with the ambassador later did you pack your suitcase yourself the checkin girl asked randy of course he did not said candy indignantly militant moll went puce in the face when a customs man insisted she carried her vibrator in her hand luggage whats wrong with ninion chorused the celtic mafia miss parrott scuttled through the passport check she didnt want dimitri or anyone else to discover her real age abby was touched when every man in the orchestra converged to lift her hand luggage into the lockers and sit next to her on the flight francis bought her a copy of the independent old henry some glacier mints randy who was intending to spend the two thousand on a new set of golf clubs to clares irritation upstaged everyone by buying abby some amarige body lotion in duty free and murmuring that he hoped he might have the privilege to rub it in during the next week poor cathie jones always airsick and green before takeoff was cringing at the back of the plane putting as much distance between her and himself as possible carmine shot up the front to ask abbys view on his solo in the trumpet fanfare in rachels requiem watching him blue slid in beside cathie with a bag of barley sugars talk to me and you wont have time to throw op hilary and juno were infuriated having bought hello and tatler they found endless pictures of clare and her father on august ive always made shooting lunches for daddy explained clare apologetically if id objected hed have shot me as well isnt that dixie peering out of the bracken hissed juno no its a herd of daddys highland cattle said clare airily in all senses of the word because theyd taken off even before the first drinks trolley started rumbling down the aisle miles was on his feet this is an important tour please remember you are an english loud boos i mean british more boos orchestra and behave like ambassadors for your country and exercise decorum on all occasions exactly on cue randy and candy emerged from the lavatory straightening their clothes and miless exhortation that they must rout out hooliganism was drowned in howls and catcalls an important tour ploughed on miles particularly as were going to witness the return of lappassionata as a soloist quavered old henry who wanted the two thousand for a new bow to loud cheers all round what the hells going on wondered flora as different players queued up to ask abby if after the concert shed like a personally guided tour of the lovely old city of seville which after all had been the setting for don giovannis illfated scrap with the commandatore meanwhile beside julian mary eight months pregnant was embroidering a sampler for the new baby dyou think shes going to explode whispered cherub nervously to noriko i have just seen a pig fly past the window viking muttered to blue as they waited for their luggage in seville carmine has just forked out a hundred pesetas for a trolley for abbys cases this is going to be a fight to the death the seville sky was the palest blue as though it had been through the washingmachine a thousand times as they chugged past ancient tawny houses and streets lined with glossy green trees viking leant out of the bus and picked an orange it was much hotter than rutminster this time everyone was housed in the same hotel before the rehearsal abby had a quick swim in the hotel pool every man in the rso seemed to have the same idea showing off with high dives and flashy crawls old henry dreaming of his new bow dogpaddled eagerly around abby carmine kept vanishing under the water only deterred from groping her by viking who wouldnt have dreamt of crinkling his hair by swimming before a concert but who prowled round the edge of the pool keeping an eye on his quarry at six oclock there was a panic instead of a rehearsal because the cherryred rso van hadnt arrived with the instruments and all the music the real heroes of the tour charlton handsome and his humpers and roadies had been driving from rutminster since saturday morning they had been held up at the border where customs assuming they were a rock band upended the entire van for drugs as the van finally drew up outside the seville concert hall frenzied musicians fell on it terrified their precious instruments might have gone astray charlton was rolling the big bass drum down the ramp when he was pushed aside by dimitri frantic to find his guarnieri vowing theyd never be parted again just fuck off knickers charlton was now saying to an hysterical nicholas or ill drive the ole lot into the river fanks love he added to flora whod brought out a sixpack of iced beer i will not have drinking during working hours spluttered miles rolling up in a dinnerjacket ill ave you remember mister brianknowles snapped back charlton that while you was shacked up all cosy last night wiv lady ilary me and the boys he pointed to an ice pick and shovel attached to the inside of the lorry was digging our way outa the pyrenees miles went purple particularly when flora burst out laughing whats in that box she asked as charlton relieved her of another can of beer viola players you get more in if you slice them thinly the concert was a massive success john lill the soloist played the rachmaninov so beautifully he had the very formal straightbacked audience yelling their dark sleek heads off abby was nervous how theyd react to rachels requiem but they listened enraptured and when viking launched into rachels lament they all started to clap as though he were pavarotti singing nessun dorma so viking played it again and the applause at the end went on for ten minutes as the roadies loaded up again for the drive to granada charlton told julian hed heard that triffic tune twice on the bar radio during the concert francis the good loser climbing up a lamppost in the main square to get a better reception on the world service nearly got arrested later in the evening listen he thrust out his radio ah rachels lament very good tune chorused the ring of policemen giving him a round of applause when he played it on his fiddle as abby came into the hotel around one oclock after an official dinner with john lill and the mayor of seville the foyer was suddenly full of male musicians jerry and quinton both wanted words about their solos in beethovens ninth and individually wondered if they could run through them in abbys suite no you fucking cant viking was at abbys elbow waving her key you pinched that solo from cyril quinton you bloody sort it out what about a drink he murmured to abby two minutes later as he opened her door abby havered then said wistfully i ought to get an early night and ive gotta practise the mozart its more difficult than i figured im terrified of letting rodney down or yourself thought viking he wasnt going to push it instead he gave her the orange hed picked from the bus and made her promise to have dinner with him later in the week on tours as on away fixtures the orchestra tended to split into two groups pond life was epitomized by peter plumpton simon hilary militant moll and a reluctant ninion along with others who were either desperately broke or tight with money this group because breakfast was the only meal provided came down stuffed themselves then loaded rolls cheese ham yoghurt apples even cartons of decanted prunes into carrier bags and lived off that for the rest of the day this meant they could go home with enough tottedup lunch and dinner allowance to pay the gas bill or buy a microwave they never went out boozing in utter contrast moulin rouge led by the celtic mafia were hell bent on whooping it up if you make breakfast as dixie was fond of saying youre not regarded as one of the lads it would be hard to decide which group disapproved more strongly of the other with the making of abby on the agenda however the two groups became blurred with ninion realizing he could buy an inferno of microwaves with the two thousand and francis appreciating hed be able to pay for a hip operation for his wife instead of waiting a year for one on the nhs peter plumpton had already earmarked a buttonbacked sofa in an antique shop in eldercombe to add to the tension as the days passed the schedule was absolutely punishing seville granada santiago corunna in four days with madrid barcelona and toledo to come which meant rising at dawn to catch the coach to get to the airport or station followed by a long journey no time to unpack before a rehearsal in a strange hall with hardly any more time to change tart up or snatch something to eat before the concert after which it was natural to have a few drinks and let off steam staggering into bed around three oclock in the morning they all had to be up at crack of dawn to get on the coach to the next town the following day the tour was an even worse nightmare for miles and nicholas who not only had to keep moulin rouge in order but also had to hand out and retrieve all the hotelroom keys at every stop get suitcases into the right rooms and drag musicians out of their beds into the coaches as alarm calls were increasingly ignored no matter how many signs knickers put up at each concert hall the buggers still wandered round bleating wheres the stage wheres the changingroom wheres the bog which was odd when they never had any difficulty finding a pub or restaurant the instant the concert was over there was a frightful row in corunna because breakfast consisted only of croissants coffee and orange juice pond life with nothing to live on for the rest of the day nearly refused to get on the coach taking them to the station abbys suitors got very excited in santiago when viking started a rumour that shed gone up the cathedral spire with blue having panted to the top with old henry and el creepo nearly dying of heart attacks in the process they found only militant moll bawling out ninion because shed caught him peering into the womens changingroom with the coast clear meanwhile viking had belted round to abbys hotel only to find shed gone out shopping her seducers had principally drawn a blank in the past few days because after the first night abbyd been staying in different hotels tonight however theyd all be together in the picasso grand in madrid so many people were trying to bed her in fact that abbybaiting had been suspended as the chief orchestra pastime and mobbingup miles had taken its place in corunna a pedal had fallen off the piano and miles had managed to put it back first time youve lain between a pair of legs and been able to find the right aperture shouted dixie to cheers all round on the express to madrid which looked like a long grey electric shaver cherub charmed the guard into letting him use the tannoy im afraid he announced in his shrill voice that this train has run out of bog paper anyone in need particularly anyone who had squid corunna in the sir john moore wine bar last night is advised to apply to miles brianknowles for rso contracts which are probably worth considerably less roused by guffaws miles stopped telling hilly how much he was looking forward to showing her guernica and the other picassos in the prado julian halfway through war and peace was sitting next to mary who had nearly finished her sampler dear little one read flora over marys shoulder i wish to give you two things roots and wings oh thats lovely floras eyes filled with tears roots and wings should be the basis for any happy relationship she suddenly wondered how george was getting on in england and hoped trevor was ok her reverie was interrupted by cherubs shrill voice over the tannoy again interspersed with fits of giggles this is a special message for all members of the rso tonights rehearsal has been cancelled an enraged miles then had to hurtle up and down the train denying this and thrusting aside garlicreeking peasants sleek businessmen and randy and candy once again straightening their clothes as they emerged from the loo as the train stopped at a station miles saw cherub belting down the platform in the other direction this is your last life wilson he yelled out of the window look at thrilary mouth vanished altogether murmured viking to blue she is being screwed by miles as reddybrown fields and orange pink and green rock like vegetable pâté flashed by steve was waving the rule book at poor knickers an orchestra marches on its stomach he was shouting that breakfast was a diabolical travesty foxie is so hungry piped up flora making her puppet fox clutch his furry tummy that hes going to eat miles in a minute gimme that fox dixie still plastered from the night before snatched and threw foxie to randy who threw him down the open compartment to davie who threw him to barry who threw him to carmine who threw him out of the window whereupon a screaming flora pulled the communication cord and the orchestra never made the madrid rehearsal at all hilary was absolutely hopping because she was not going to see guernica why bother said viking its all around you the result was a duff beethovens ninth symphony the only thing which excited the furcoated madrid audience was davie buckle his fluffy white drum heads frenziedly dancing on the surface of his kettle drums going beserk in the scherzo apart from beethoven nine and the rite of spring all music is piffle davie told anyone who would listen as he got legless afterwards in the bar of the picasso grand it looked as though abbys suitors thronging the foyer just after midnight were going to be disappointed again returning from dinner with king carlos she had escaped to her suite up the back stairs noone is going to get lappassionata into bed this evening either announced viking firmly shes got to practise the mozart concerto for tomorrow night well see about that muttered davie as the week progressed abby in fact had hardly noticed her suitors even viking because she was increasingly terrified about playing again in public she was now so engrossed in perfecting the langorous trills of the adagio she didnt even notice the bulky figure on the balcony outside davie having downed twelve pints of beer and dropped his mobile down the lavatory trying to ring brünnhilde in england had intrepidly climbed across from the nextdoor balcony and settled down to wait for abby to finish practising three hours later she wandered next door into her bedroom finding old henry sitting up in her bed wearing only pyjama bottoms and reading murder on the nile she was so bombed that she thought shed strayed into the wrong room oh henry just the person i wanted to see im so sorry to barge in but could you possibly help me with the dynamics in the rondo mozart puts in so few marks its the same with his later piano concertos henry put a book mark in murder on the nile he leaves it up to you even when theyd sorted out the problem and abby asked henry to rub tiger balm into her aching neck and shoulders he made no pass shes playing better than ever he sighed to a lurking band of suitors when he finally left her room that two thousand could have bought you a bow and paid your gas bill said barry reprovingly some things are more important than gas bills said old henry abby took a long time to go to sleep she was worried that every time she called the cottage to ask after the cats she got her own voice on the answeringmachine where the hell was marcus and although she doted on rodney she was depressed that the rso were so longing to see him in barcelona tomorrow all the old anecdotes and catch phrases were coming out why are we so happy boys and girls because uncle rodneys in charge wheres dixie when he arrives tell him hes much too loud programmes of rodneys concerts before the war photographs of him looking dashing in the navy or with great musicians solomon kreisler rubinstein callas and gigli had been collected and framed messages of love were pouring in from the living domingo pavarotti kiri alfred brendel simon rattle pablo gonzales and menuhin they all loved rodney he had brought enormous fun to music forget the bennies the maria kusaks the bill thackeries and the junos thought abby bitterly rodney in all his life never worked as hard as i do restlessly she picked up a fax from george that had just been shoved under the door rachels requiem was number twenty in the classical charts people were playing it on pop channels as well and even more amazing sonny parkers interruption suite for lavatory chain coughing etc had been nominated for a gramophone award the observer had also got wind of her comeback and done a big piece headed our own abby rosen abby felt happier and she fell into such a deep sleep she didnt even wake when dozing davie fell off the balcony and sprained his ankle fiftyseven noone was more on the ball than george hungerford he understood balance sheets had an instant grasp of any financial problem never missed a crooked picture nor an appointment he also drove the hardest bargains the deal had been all his first marriage had collapsed because he was a workaholic to survive the pain he had worked even harder but now the rso had gone like bonnie lesley to spread their conquests further it was time for him to take stock of their future could they possibly survive even until christmas the latest estimate for the repairs and revamp of hp hall was five million pounds it was also essential that he devoted some time to his other companies which after all brought in the dosh ten acres in central manchester couldnt run themselves but george who had never had a daydream in his life found himself hopelessly inattentive only this morning he had found a file he had accused jessica of losing in the office fridge and his boxer shorts in the pedal dustbin at home instead of in the washingmachine he had even started reading horoscopes and poetry and gazing at the clump of beeches in the park whose leaves were turning the same redgold as floras hair he ought to be looking for companies to buy and properties to snap up but his mind like scarlattis adonis had turned from hunting to love frequently he was cast into an abyss of selfdoubt how could such a bright beautiful young lady possibly fancy an uncouth workingclass middleaged northcountry lout all that he had to go on was that she had once called him a really sweet guy but since then shed scuttled away from him and hed been far too shy to ring her up he should at least have been working out how they could cut costs on the orchestras trip up north for the appleton piano competition instead he sent for the holiday lists and chose the weeks his principal viola el creepo was away to programme harold in italy and elgars in the south overture both of which had wonderful solos for flora oh she does teach the torches to burn bright murmured george then miss priddock had barged in and announced that the soprano who was singing in the messiah next month had decided to cry off because she was expecting triplets thats a shame said george i was just brooshing oop on my obstetrical skills still she might have suspended belief when she sang a virgin shall conceive oh well flora can take her place well have to pay her extra though judgin by the way shes been behavin on tour ay would have thought flora would find it even more difficult to portray a virgin said miss priddock with a sniff that was quite uncalled for snapped george get out miss priddock flounced off squawking like a wet hen george picked up the times venus is a morning object he read in the monthly astronomy roundup of the stars how could the goddess of love be so prosaically straitjacketed in georges heaven she was on twentyfourhour duty back came miss priddock ten minutes later exuding smugness and reproach in equal proportions as she ushered in gilbert and gwynneth whom george had clearly forgotten were coming by this time he was drinking a large scotch with his feet on the table feeding strips of smoked salmon to a purring john drummond and watching a video of flora singing the creation gwynneth and gilbert promptly went into raptures over the way rannaldini had held the orchestra together after hermiones disappearance surely the mark of a great conductor the orchestra played great said george icily they saved the performance because they luv flora and their pride is sooch they wouldnt allow themselves to produce anything less than a rare defiant performance gilbert and gwynneth whod come to discuss the merger or even dropping one orchestra altogether which would save them even more money were very disappointed rannaldini had given them to understand that george would cooperate in every way mans only interested in money he had told them listening to gilbert droning on and gwynneth smacking her pale fat lips over miss priddocks ginger bread george started fidgetting with his right hand drawer which opened to show a photograph of ruth george gazed at her perfect face for a long time underneath was his passport gilbert and gwynneth were even more put out when george announced hed have to break up the meeting because he was off to barcelona to give the orchestra moral support theyre playing chumpion he went on rachels requiems in the top twenty in its first week thats because abbys photographs on the sleeve and i want to wish rodney a happy birthday oh i wish id sent him a card said gwynneth looking caring and deciding to forgive rodney for his disparaging remarks about the arts council i draw them myself she went on people often frame my cards who will hold the fort while youre away chuntered gilbert ill be sending miles back said george grabbing his briefcase and car keys after all its the fort what counts good god he was even making jokes like flora now if its urgent he handed a piece of paper to miss priddock youll find me on this number gilbert and gwynneth exchanged glances they found miles much easier to deal with dont forget the board meeting on friday miss priddock called after him id no idea he was going said jessica when she returned from the dentist then she whistled as far as her frozen jaws would allow golly thats ruths number hes left id forgotten she has a house near marbella perhaps theyre getting back together again hes been ever so distracted recently he didnt even shout at me when i forgot to buy his lottery tickets eyes were getting smaller with tiredness as the rso landed at barcelona airport waists growing bigger the musicians were sleepwalking nodding off on any available sofa armchair or bench i had warbling singers on either side of me last night grumbled simon wonder if they sell sleepingpills off prescription wish i could buy some homesick pills sighed julian i cut myself shaving this morning said randy who was still drunk from last night my red eyes have nearly gone white again baa baa baa bleated dixie as the entire orchestra like zombies followed him blindly into the airport gents despite knickers racing round like a collie nipping everyones ankles it was half an hour before they all meandered out to the waiting coaches eating chocolate reading newspapers putting new film in their cameras miles was absolutely fed up with them half of them had overslept and nearly missed the plane that morning if anyone loses their boarding passes or their hotel keys or forgets to pay their bar bills once more their pay will be docked he yelled to each coachload in turn and tomorrow morning i want you all to line up outside the hotel at sixthirty so we can take a rollcall what about a rollinthehay call shouted randy from the back of moulin rouge as they drove past battlements and palm trees along the seafront dixie yelled dont forget to declare hilly sneaks and lechers come away come away come come come away sang cherub going into fits of giggles which set the whole coach off hilary stopped writing postcards about the cathedral in madrid why dyou all reduce everything to your own disgusting level she hissed youll pay for this thought miles furiously every single one of you he was even crosser threequarters of an hour later as flora was struggling up the steep narrow cobbled street to the hotel weighed down by a heavy suitcase her viola and a large bottle of fundador presented to her by a waiter last night she felt a hand taking her suitcase and turned in amazement no musician ever carried anyone elses stuff then she dropped the fundador with an almighty crash for there stood george sweating in a pinstriped suit and blushing as much as she was i thought you were in rutminster i was i thought id come and wish rodney many happy returns for a moment they gazed at each other as brandy streamed down the street sorry about the bottle said george clicking his fingers at the hotel porter to come and sweep it up oh its just good clean fundador said flora belting into the hotel fucking hell said viking dixie blue and randy whod been following flora up the hill thats going to cut down our fun and games said blue dropping to his knees and pretending to lick up the fundador why the hell isnt he at home running the orchestra said dixie into the ground said randy disloyally they forgot that if it hadnt been for georges indefatigable fundraising efforts they would never have been able to go on tour perhaps hes after abby said dixie well hes not going to win the two grand snapped viking no hes after the steel elf said randy as hilary handed her postcards to the hotel receptionist viking noticed the top one was to rannaldini in czechoslovakia our shit has reached bohemia he muttered to blue i reckon gilbert gwynneth rannaldini and miles are all in cahoots i better have a serious word with rodney miles was absolutely livid to be dispatched home by george telling hilary to keep an eye on things and chronicle every misdemeanour he flew northwards to rutminster freezing like an iceberg as he went tiredness was forgotten as the orchestra dumped their bags and surged off in great expectations to meet rodney the beautiful little palace of music could have been designed especially for rodneys birthday stucco horses with rolling eyes romped high above the stage seats rose in tiers fantastically decorated with different coloured sugar tulips from a ceiling embossed with scarletandwhite roses hung a vast tiffany lamp glittering with amber emerald and kingfisherblue glass on the faded terracotta mural curving round behind the stage garlanded nymphs in long flowery dresses played flutes and harps violins and triangles their eyes closed in deepest trance bewitched by their music what maidens loth what mad pursuit what pipes and timbrels what wild ecstasy murmured flora trying to tighten her strings with a trembling hand what the hell was george doing here rodneys dressingroom was already piled high with coloured envelopes and brightly wrapped presents the rso had clubbed together and given him a victorian stationmasters cap and a new midnightblue velvet cloak with a cherryred lining a huge iced cake in the shape of a train carrying eighty candles would be wheeled on after the concert a florist was busy weaving dark red roses and white jasmine in and out of the rostrum its unlucky to use redandwhite flowers said miss parrott in alarm but her concern was drowned in a deafening cheer as rodney shuffled on beatle cap over one eye leaning heavily on georges arm the musicians whod worked with him in the past were shocked how hed aged particularly when they saw what an effort it was for him to climb onto the rostrum and collapse into his chair but as they launched into happy birthday specially orchestrated by peter plumpton rodney struggled up from his chair stretched out his arms putting his head on one side and smiling with such sweetness and roguish delight they were all reassured oh my dear children wafting english fern he mopped his eyes with a lemonyellow silk handkerchief you have no idea how excited i am to see you all again and some too i havent met before great artists he beamed down at julian and dimitri learning the cello myself has taught me how clever all you string players are then glancing at the back of the first violins continued and you pretty child must be noriko and that lovely little redhead must be flora aware of george watching from the stalls flora cringed into the violas with a weak smile then to even louder cheers rodney whipped out a save the rso banner waving it above his head well have no more talk of mergers i have written to my friend john merger the orchestra giggled in delight telling him its simply not on what are they going to call this merged orchestra the rscco stands for royal society for the continued cruelty to orchestras sums up that gruesome twosome gilbert and gwynneth i hope their ears are burning because im flying back to rutminster to box them next week you are a symphony orchestra he went on fierce for a second and will remain so as an encore tonight we will play the beginning of the second movement of tchaik five one of the greatest symphonies ever written with a great horn solo from a great player he blew a kiss at viking but as you all know that and the other pieces romeo and juliet and don quixote backwards lets play the mozart not a day goes by he added in a stagewhisper as abby strolled in with her fiddle under her arm to a chorus of wolfwhistles that i dont envy you having such a gorgeous popsy as musical director isnt she lovely she certainly is bellowed abbys suitors as if she were shrugging off her role as conductor abby had abandoned her severe often deliberately desexing gear for a clinging orange vest and the shortest tightest brown suede skirt just acquired in a barcelona boutique her newly washed black gypsy curls danced loose down her shoulders terror and excitement simultaneously lit her glowing face the heaven and hell of performance my dear sighed rodney what a time to bring those legs out of hiding ill never concentrate that was a wonderful century you made against the cco last week bill he went on keeping up the patter tiddle om pom pom did you know carthorse was an anagram of orchestra tiddle om pom pom ready darling abby nodded surreptitiously mysteriously always when a great star is playing the hall fills up stage hands doormen cleaners with mops admin staff were already gathering in the red velvet boxes and creeping into the stalls rodney raised his baton a couple of inches and brought it down there was an explosion of sound playing the lovely but comparatively undemanding horn accompaniment viking listened in wonder no composer but mozart no musician except abby could express such sweetness such caressing tenderness such extremes of sadness and joy he watched her breasts and golden arms quivering as her bow darted across the strings the voluptuous swing of her suede hips her tossing shining hair and the rapacious absorption on her proud hawklike face and was filled with lust as well as admiration abby was a good conductor but her heart constantly fought her head like a swan struggling across land to some destination but when she played she flew all heart totally committed as bewitched as the nymphs on the wall well be looking for a new musical director sighed old henry tapping his bow against franciss chairback cant deprive the world of a sound like that as he joined in the rapturous applause george was shocked to see how rodney was sweating and how much brown makeup came off on the lemonyellow silk handkerchief when he mopped his brow he was a ghastly colour but outwardly full of pride and joy for his protégée i can die happy now he told abby the sorrow of that middle movement was almost unbearable and if i hadnt known you were the rso boys and girls i could have sworn you were the berlin phil its because youre back sir rod shouted dixie then remembering he was trying to pull abby and because weve got a great soloist george stepped forward you must rest maestro think id better journey took it out of me got a lovely chambermaid as siestafodder back at the hotel got to be as fresh as a daisy for the party later lots of champagne lovely grub i can open all my presents and well all behave as badly as possible toodleoo everyone waving his flag he adjusted his beatle cap at a more rakish angle as he was helped down from the rostrum the musicians surged forward to shake his hand and show how happy they were he was back clutching the door leading to the stage he patted the head of his pantomime cow whose furry blackandwhite body was slumped over the rail waiting to take part in the encore nice to see my old girl again got her a swiss bell to wear tonight connaissezvous schoenberg madame vache no thats french must remember to speak spanish must stop this merger dear boy rannaldinis such a shit he added clapping a hand on georges shoulder but using it more as a support abby ran after them i love you rodney she stammered and i you darling was i really ok better than ever utterly breathtaking oh theres charlton how are you great and great to see you sir rod fanks for the scotch biggest fucking bottle ive ever seen you deserve it dear boy after flogging all those miles oh damn you sighed abby as a departing rodney wriggled like an old badger into the back of the waiting limo why dyou always have to show me up by being so nice to everyone she never saw him again in the mens changingroom musicians were combing hair over bald patches running electric razors over their faces spraying deodorant on earlier layers cleaning teeth fighting for the mirror to tie their ties those with good bodies wandered round in their underpants those already dressed were warming up in the passage outside the conductors room viking was playing the teddy bears picnic when george arrived looking grim and very shaken and dragged him into an emptydressing room just as he was leaving the hotel rodney had died of a massive heart attack he was so excited georges voice cracked his last words were i moosnt be late for my dear children the colour drained from vikings face for a second he clung onto a chair his eyes closed fighting back the tears oh jesus i dont believe it thank god we saw him one last time this is terrible then he pulled himself together poor little abby i better go and tell her ill tell her you tell the orchestra ought we to cancel the concert certainly not rodneys worst thing was disappointing people the orchestra were devastated most of them in tears steve abandoned his noisy row with knickers about the musicians not having had long enough between rehearsal and concert abby had just emerged from the shower and was wrapped in a very inadequate olivegreen towel when viking walked in at first she didnt believe him its just another of your obnoxious jokes then she went into such raving screaming hysterics that viking was very reluctantly forced to slap her face before she collapsed sobbing wildly in his arms i know how you loved him sweetheart i know i know ill look after you gradually he calmed her down pouring her a large brandy from rodneys cupboard then saying he hoped he wouldnt get sacked for hitting the conductor cut it out sobbed abby trust you to make jokes i loved him too sweetheart what are you doing he demanded as abby reached for her new suede skirt going to lucerne to take care of gisela shes worked for him for forty years for chrissake you cant not yet youve got to go on tonight dont be insane george must cancel rodney would expect it what about my solo mozart played it and conducted at the same time if you prefer julian could play your solo like hell he will oh viking i cant believe it she broke down again hearing weeping coming from the conductors room hilary turned to juno she must have been rodneys mistress to be so upset whos in there asked carmine viking said hilary trust viking to cash in on some poor guys death to win his bloody bet the next moment blue had carmine against the wall you dirty basstard he hissed deathly pale in her short pink chiffon dress abby looked like a lost masquerader she left the roseandjasminewoven rostrum empty and conducted from the soloists position from which she could see the shock and deep distress on the faces in the audience many of whom had flown in from all over the world cathie jones brought all her sadness to the solo in romeo and juliet abby didnt play the mozart that followed with as much dash as she had in rehearsal but even though she had to conduct it at the same time there was an added depth and sorrow shes playing a requiem thought viking it was so private so other worldly that for a second he was so moved he felt he was going to lose it everyone was so distraught about rodney that few people appreciated that this was abbys first time playing in public again mozart was followed by don quixote tears streamed unashamedly down dimitris face as he played the part of the don abby nearly broke down too as she introduced the piece in the words of your greatest novel she told the audience in spanish i have battled i have made mistakes but i have lived my life the best i can according to the world as i see it that sums up the rodney we all knew and loved neither viking nor cherub had the heart to get inside the pantomime cow so the orchestra played nimrod rodneys favourite tune he had always chided the rso for playing it too slowly its an ode to a mighty hunter hes not dead yet for goodness sake finally as a mark of respect the vast audience filed out in silence the usual crowd of wellwishers and ghouls were queuing outside abbys dressingroom the press were massing outside nicholas was having great difficulty keeping them at bay viking caused chuntering and a lot of raised eyebrows when he barged to the front of the queue inside he found abby in tears again oh viking i cant believe it she wailed as he put his arms round her dyou think the orchestrall ever love me as much as him this made viking laugh not till you leave them sweetheart lets go and get wasted then when abby hesitated we were his favourites hed have wanted it give me five minutes to have a shower said abby asking as he went towards the door was my solo ok brilliant and the conducting i guess i was just the catalyst in that case viking smiled slightly im a member of the catalysts protection league abby was shocked she looked so beautiful and as she smothered herself in amarige turning herself on by her caresses she could already feel rodneys ghost egging her on go on darling its worth a try i love you rodney she pleaded and i love viking please forgive me you always said as long as we played well you didnt mind what we got up to below the waist tiredness hit flora in the form of the blackest depression having bolted in embarrassment when george arrived she hadnt seen him to talk to since because hed been so busy looking after rodney and then sorting out the ramifications of his death all she had to listen to was pesky members of the orchestra speculating as to why hed come out in the first place on the coach home from the concert she found out slumped in a seat clutching foxie and her black dress she overheard hilary and miss parrott whispering behind her about rodneys death being a merciful release ay will miss him sighed miss parrott even george seemed upset and he hardly knew him is he stayin at our hotel no riveting news hilary paused aware of flora who pointedly lolled her head on one side and pretended to snore youll never guess hilary went on hes staying with his wife ruth shes got a hacienda hilary prided herself on her pronunciation near marbella i thought they were divorced no only separated and only by her choice hes mad about her miles says got pictures of her all over his home how romantic if theyve got together again sighed miss parrott bit of a smack in the eye for juno said hilary with satisfaction she was so certain george was about to pop the question jumping at the sound of tearing flora looked down at the rippedopen bodice of her only black dress shed need it if she was going to spend the rest of her life in mourning of course juno was much too young for him observed miss parrott in his position hed want someone older and more sophisticated like that nice serena who works at megagram as the coach doors clanged open flora leapt up out of the coach up the steps of the hotel reprieve awaited her as she collected her key the receptionist handed her a telephone number and a message to ring george she couldnt bear to wait for the lift and could have won the one thousand guineas at the speed she belted up five flights she then misdialled the number three times only to get through to her mother georgie who was also on tour in america darling how are you fine absolutely fine fighting back the tears flora slumped on the bed did you ring earlier about twenty minutes ago im amazed you got the message i had to repeat the number about four times i just wanted to know how its all going flora couldnt inject a flicker of animation into her voice im ok mum you know tours up and down were all a bit tired she couldnt face her mothers torrent of sympathy if she told her about rodney but its going well how are you enjoying spain havent seen much of it really theres so much going on within the orchestra how was the concert oh terrific packed out but her mother didnt want to talk about that like abby shed rung home several times in the middle of the night in the last week but only got herself on the answeringmachine flora felt a great weariness dads probably asleep mum or pulled out the telephone you know what hes like i cant face it she thought in panic when her mother finally rang off there must be someone good true safe and constant in the world im a basket case she thought as she gazed at her wan white face in the mirror ive just transferred the agony of being in love with rannaldini to the even worse pain of being in love with george but a man in his position was not likely to be interested in a twentyoneyearold slut when the telephone rang again she pounced on it in hope but it was only nellie saying there was one helluva party going on in abigails suite the don juan and why didnt flora come up ive got a migraine said flora and hung up fiftyeight it was one helluva party in death we are in life the rso had played their hearts out knowing that rodney would have wanted it they now felt an hysterical need to hellraise back and forth back and forth went the waiters with room service carmine orgasmic at the prospect of drink paid for by someone else kept ordering his own bottles of krug a splendid subparty was going on inside abbys wardrobe at least three people including simon painshaw ninion and fat isobel had been seen going in every so often a hand holding an empty glass would shoot out of the wardrobe once it was filled the door would snap shut again in different rooms of the don juan suite different wirelesses were blaring every time rachels lament was played everyone stopped drinking or dancing and cheered cherub kept turning the lights out davie whose sprained ankle was as puffy as a sumo wrestlers was using abbys telephone he was desperately trying to clock in with brünnhilde to explain hed fallen off the platform when sober rather than abbys balcony when drunk before any of the orchestra wives at home told her otherwise but he was so plastered he kept dialling wrong numbers and was now through to australia whatsh the wevver like out there cries of admiration greeted the arrival of viking in a beautiful skyblue shirt enough to make a sailors trousers sighed miss parrott id settle for a sailor said candy sourly were not going to get any joy out of this lot tonight thats my shirt hissed blue cathie saved up months to buy it for me my need is greater than yours murmured viking youre not even trying to pull abby to egg on abbys suitors a mural showed don juan plucking guitars under moonlit windows being admonished by large ladies and chasing peasant girls round double beds getting into the spirit chloë the comely alto soloist in beethovens ninth was trying to pull julian kneeling at his feet pressing her pretty bosom against his locked knees as my wife luisa is always complaining apologetically julian lifted chloës hand from his groin after a concert i simply cant no such word as cant said miss parrott delicately picking bits of onion out of a spanish omelette then dropping her fork with a clatter she started to cry rodney always loved the harp well hes gone to the right place said viking filling up her glass by now hell be knocking back holy spirit and goosing his first angel don quixote was magic dimitri would your guarneri like a top up in the centre of the livingroom rapidly colouring the green carpet with spilt drink a raucous game of strip poker was in progress abbys suitors realizing they had only two more nights to win the two thousand had decided this would be as good a way as any to get her clothes off but abby had turned out to be an ace player who was still fully clad in her orange vest suede mini and highheeled black sandals among the ring of musicians who surrounded her on the other hand dixie was down to bugs bunny boxer shorts randy to one sock barry to his gold medallions el squeako to grey longjohns and el creepo to a corn plaster nellie had somehow retained her cutout bra and mauve crotchless knickers cherub was wearing just abbys sunhat and giggling nonstop a fully dressed noriko crouched behind trying to cheat for him abbys got a furr house and dixie a straight frush she whispered theres the straight frush cried cherub who was far too drunk to make use of any information sings his song twice over without a repeat mark everyone shouted with laughter and refilled their glasses just like dejeuner sur lherbe mused henry putting on his glasses to examine the poker groups on the green carpet candy and clare whod eaten too much paella over the past few days to have any desire to strip off were absolutely hopping randy and dixie totally ignored them by day then expected to move into their beds at night having drunk a bottle apiece they had retired to a distant sofa im going for brains in future said candy if theres a body thrown in thats a bonus im going for breeding said clare they never ran after abby until she took up the violin again bloody gold diggers i fancy julian only decent bloke in the orchestra lets go and rescue him from alto sex who were you talking to added clare disapprovingly as davie came off the telephone to texas wrong number she shounded very nicesh got two liel girls and you told her you were six foot two and twentysix said candy in outrage thatsh my inside leg musht get old of brunilde despite continuous whoops howls and blaring music chloë had finally fallen asleep across julians thighs gently like a violin case he laid her on the floor on the sofa beside him sat francis and bill thackery both very drunk weve gotta zap this merger the moment we get home urged julian we lost a great ally in rodney i loved the man bill thackerys eyes were very red only conductor ive ever met who brought the word you into his conversation sighed francis hows your wifes hip francis called out abby whod been eavesdropping while shuffling the cards francis flushed oh much the same i do hope youll get her into the hospital soon sooner than you think if francis gets his leg over murmured a now naked dixie as he lobbed shiny black olives at nellies nipples abby who still hadnt shed a garment dealt again the men in the orchestra had all been so complimentary about her solo and her handling of the concert but she was utterly unmoved that most of them were now stripped for action because of a certainty that she and viking were finally going to make it drink had anaesthetized the pain of rodneys death she could only remember the heaven of vikings arms around her even the very reluctant slap had been oddly comforting in a matter of seconds she had exchanged one father figure for another even now viking was detached from the party leaning against the wall in that heavenly blue shirt sweating out a weak scotch swapping rodney stories with a stunned tearful cyril but all the time his eyes never left abbys face a little smile flickering over his beautiful stubborn mouth totally forgetting marcus liberated from a disapproving floras chaperonage abby felt a pulse as insistent as a snare drum throbbing between her legs it was going to happen a drunken shout greeted another extract from rachels requiem this time on the violin that was a glorious solo julian shouted cherub then seeing the uncontrollable jealousy on bill thackerys face added but your century against the cco was even better bill always the good sport bill joined in the roars of laughter julian was glad he had confided to bill his worries about rannaldini and the closingdown of the rso bill would fight their corner with the board a hand was sticking out of the wardrobe again so julian gave it a bottle this time tarzan howls greeted the removal of nellies crotchless knickers carmine whod been discussing an expedition to a bullfight tomorrow with quinton glanced over at nellie and winked must have a tinkle said nellie ten seconds later and tottered after carmine into abbys spare bathroom a hovering blue hearing the lock snap looked round for cathie who was wearily listening to little jenny droning on about the celtic mafia they are all pigs cathie everyone was too far gone to begin behaving when hilary marched in demanded a perrier and started photographing the more advanced forms of debauchery which included dimitri drinking famous grouse whisky out of an ashtray didnt you see the no moles sign on the door shouted randy ignoring him hilary announced she must go and spend a penny viking watched her go towards abbys spare bathroom which contained nellie and carmine then surreptitiously turn left into abbys bedroom equally surreptitiously viking stole after her he found her trying on a diamond necklace before regretfully turning to abbys briefcase systematically opening envelopes reading letters flicking through abbys diary and her address book padding up behind her viking closed his hands round her neck what the hell do you think youre doing hilary shrieked and dropped the briefcase with a clatter under his fingers viking watched an ugly red blush rise out of her piefrill collar i was looking for a copy of tomorrows schedule stammered hilary to er see what time were leaving for toledo bollocks as if you didnt know since your poxy lover called a special inspection at sixthirty outside the hotel he let his hands fall you were snooping darling just how much is rannaldini paying you to shop abby it was a complete shot in the dark but hilarys jump of horror like a suddenly buggered maiden aunt said it all get out you meddling bitch or ill call the police said viking alone in the room still shaking with fury he picked up a periwinkleblue silk scarf breathing in amarige how trusting abby was with most of her orchestra in the next room leaving the unlocked briefcase the rubies sapphires diamonds the platinum amex card all spilling wantonly out of her jewel case amidst them like a golden egg with its leaves shrivelling was the orange hed picked her from the coach viking had never been in any doubt that he would win the two thousand pounds he had already earmarked the money and told his wexford grandmother that he would be sending her to america for her seventieth birthday she hadnt seen her elder sons and their families who lived in new york and philadelphia for twenty years viking knew that abby adored him he had not forgotten how she had trembled in his arms outside the pub at christmas it had been the same this evening it would require less effort than picking that orange she would fall into his hands like a sleek ripe yellow pear flora had told him about the secret engagement to marcus and her grave doubts about the whole thing viking felt it was almost his duty to break it up sorry mate he turned marcuss photograph to the wall youve lucked out on this one as he wandered back into the livingroom he was pleased to see the silhouettes of his second horn and cathie jones become one under the stars on the balcony it would make up for nicking blues shirt peter plumpton totally naked was now mincing around with an upended bread basket on his head dyou thenk its suitable for escot he was asking to howls of drunken laughter abbys other suitors having failed to beat her at poker were getting desperate el creepo who wanted the two thousand for a big screen for his porn videos was clumsily trying to chat her up what brassière size dyou take abby dont insollt my woman howled viking grabbing el creepo by his foodstained lapels dont viking your tooth screamed abby as el creepo raised a nervous fist diversion was provided by a mighty splash from next door as the brass section threw a fully dressed dirty harry into the jacuzzi because they thought he needed a bath all the other revellers surged into the bathroom with el creepo sidling hastily after them leaving viking and abby gazing at each other am i she whispered what your woman sure you are unnerved by his nearness abby reached for her champagne but viking caught her wrist and emptied the glass into a vase of chrysanthemums no more he said softly it dolls the senses you dont need dottch courage with me abby was always banging on about the importance of bonding next door it was more a case of james bonding as the rest of the party stripped off with squeals of glee to see how many of them could jump into the jacuzzi so the water spilled over turning the blue shagpile into a soggy pond ive always longed to go skinnydipping yelled ninion and ive always wanted to go fattydipping screamed isobel erupting from the wardrobe breasts flying like dufflebags landing amid the heaving flesh dispatching the last of the water quite extraordinary pure rubens said old henry putting on his spectacles to walk round the jacuzzi who killed cock rubens shouted dixie active at the back of the scrum to more cackles of laughter davie buckle sat beside them on the loo with the seat down swigging from a bottle of dubonnet and telephoning japan everyone jumped as militant moll stomped in dressed for bed in mens wool striped pyjamas and leather slippers anyone seen ninion no chorused the heaving flesh burying his face gratefully in isobels massive breasts ninion prayed moll wouldnt recognize his skinny flanks he said he was going to mass in one of the cathedrals called out miss parrott plenty of steeples round here giggled clare youre despicable thundered moll marching out to rousing cheers cant you see how this degrades women get us some more hooch davie love asked randy who was busy degrading candy just give room service a bell got to cock in with brünilde mumbled davie redialling tum ta ta tum tum tum ta ta tum tum yelled the rso to the ride of the valkyries you get the booze lincoln youre the youngest dixie ordered the fifth horn who was sitting on the edge of the jacuzzi in his yfronts sadly gazing into space opening the wardrobe and finding simon painshaw and peter plumpton passed out in each others arms lincoln hastily shut the door and staggered into abbys bedroom where he found little jenny in tears on the bed i thought you loved me i do i do lincoln collapsed on the bed beside her viking would throttle him but he couldnt keep the secret any longer two thousand pounds would have paid off my overdraft he admitted finally paid a deposit on a flat and bought you an engagement ring because oh jenny i want to marry you did you say engagement ring yelped jenny blowing her nose on abbys scarf oh please oh yes please having kissed her at length lincoln staggered to his feet lets go to my room cherub wont be back for hours ill go and find the key looking for stray bottles of drink in abbys bedroom candy found jenny gargling with abbys mouthwash and spraying amarige on her bush youll never guess why theyve all been chasing abby she whispered promise you wont tell anyone candy promised randy wanted some new golf clubs jenny was still explaining two minutes later ill club him screeched candy storming back to the jacuzzi found it cried lincoln waving his room key why are you carrying cherubs clothes asked jenny itll take him longer to get back to our room said lincoln as none of the sorties for more booze had been successful francis was dispatched on yet another recce lady in buff lady in buff said the rso swaying to the tune of lady in red going into the sittingroom to round up any spare drink francis discovered abby and viking kissing the life out of each other they looked so beautiful viking was stroking abbys cheek as though he was rubbing the earth away from some longburied grecian urn the blaze of triumph on his face made francis reach for his dark glasses oh fuck groaned francis bang went poor darling janeys hip operation never had he found it harder to be a good loser when he returned the revellers fell on his armful of bottles vikings won the two grand he murmured sadly to old henry for a second isobel stopped french kissing ninion vikings always been too grand she said dismissively it was catch situation sighed dimitri emptying a whole bottle of amarige into the steadily overflowing jacuzzi i vanted to take you to petersburg but i love you too much to vin sweepstake you can take me to paradise instead cried miss parrott oh my wonderful wonderful whayte russian fiftynine viking was not happy about the contrast between abbys sevenroom suite and the cupboard he was sharing with blue which was stuffy airless shaken with stamping music from the flamenco nightclub opposite and already littered with his discarded possessions he felt as though he was shoving a beautiful bird of paradise into a bantam coop but he had no time to fret the pack in their lastditch scramble for their prize money would be soon on his trail you have the choice of two ironing boards he said unbuttoning his heavenly blue shirt abby shoved the beds together we can make love across them a woman of experience only of hotel bedrooms i toured for four years they provided french champagne and baskets of fruit but nothing as appealing as the words died on her lips the fastest undresser in the world viking kicked off his shorts with one foot and caught them on his upright cock thats awful neat said abby in admiration it was a trick of rodneys oh shit what a time to remind her abby collapsed on the bed her face crumpling perhaps we shouldnt with rodney just she gazed up her eyes huge enflamed anguished rodneys ondyng wish viking crossed his fingers behind his back was for us to end op together i expect the old dotes already installed a twoway mirror in the floor of heaven so he can watch us he wanted us to be together are you sure quite ducking joves thunderbolts viking peeled off abbys orange vest jesus youre lovely darling tipping back the yellow bedside lamp he lifted one warm gold breast wonderingly then let it drop but as he unzipped her suede skirt abby hung her head uncharacteristically shy and terrified the giraffe finally cornered by poachers you need a tranquillizing dart my darling viking stroked her quivering shoulders talking to her softly you have no idea how stonning you look or how beautiful its going to be thank christ hed beaten the others to it the thought of them groping and fumbling her was unbearable he reckoned that abby was far too tall often to have been carried by a man and probably never in a bedroom so to make her feel precious and fragile viking gathered her up telling her her mouth was like a dark red rose before he buried his lips in it kissing her so passionately and for so long that it was abby who pulled away gasping for breath then with the ecstasy of an art dealer unrolling a previously undiscovered modigliani he laid her across the two beds sliding his hands in wonder over the sleek satiny scented contours oh my beauty am i ok fazed by the intensity of his gaze abbys hands fluttered to shield her breasts and her pubic hair oh my american my newfound land murmured viking normally he would have progressed with infinite slowness talking her through it making her so relaxed she glided into her first orgasm almost without realizing it but he had no time he could feel her long eyelashes fluttering against his cheek and then her gasp as his finger tested her slipperiness oh please say you love me ive never lossted after anyone so much said viking diplomatically as he guided his cock deep inside her letting it rest for a moment isnt that great he whispered lie still my darling josst feel whats happening inside you now go for it my angel viking had had many women but none had ever wanted him so much nor made love with such utter conviction and desire to please with most girls you made them come then they made you come abby with a conductors ability to do many things at once could give and take at the same time lappassionata viking glanced down at her reddening cheeks her eyes cloudy and drugged with desire who would have thought it but who wouldnt having heard you play abby didnt even miss a beat when she noticed the i love juno tattoo lasersll zap that if you carry on sucking me groaned viking in ecstasy itll soon be covered in correcting fluid anyway no no dont bite my dick i wont take the piss any more arching himself out of her like a great golden cat he slid downwards until his mouth was level with hers the first time i come he listened to her breathing getting faster and faster its going to be inside you afterwards abby buried her face in the smooth ivory curve of his sweating shoulder definitely guinness book of records she mumbled good tell all your friends about it youre a rat youre a revelation how come youve got lava in your veins not lava love i lova you down below in the nightclub a lone guitar was playing rodrigos concierto de aranjuez reaching for the bottle of evian by the bed abby hazily noticed how right vikings blue shirt looked entangled with her suede skirt on the sidetable his casket and st christopher lay in a glittering heap with her gold bracelet and marcuss ruby ring omigod she sat bolt upright what about marcus hes a darling boy viking kissed the soft flesh above abbys hipbones then working up her ribs reached her breast but hes too young and too onforceful you need a man i figure ive just had one then as viking slowly licked her nipple she pushed his thick yellow hair out of his eyes and said i love you viking when he didnt answer straightaway she asked hastily how come when youve pulled everyone else in the rso i have not interrupted viking with some hauteur i have not pulled cathie jones nor miss parrott nor isobel nor moll thank the lord nor hilary nor marythemotherofjosstin that you never tried it with me did you mind sure i did it was like being frantic for a taxi and one with its for hire sign blazing driving round and round and round me refusing to stop viking laughed didnt you want to asked abby indignantly indeed i did then halfjoking im shitscared of being emasculated by powerful women but youre the most powerful person in the orchestra josst a minute listen gently viking tugged at her earlobe it was also respect and not wanting to rossh things as my granny wexfords always saying theres a time for loving longing for viking to introduce her to his family abby said shed just adore to meet granny wexford had she ever visited the states not yet like francis earlier viking had the grace to blush to distract abby he slid his thumb in and out of her the knuckle gently grazing her clitoris his long fingers caressing the tender underside of her bottom oh wow abby drew in her breath oh please can we make love again dont be greedy as bruno walter said in every truly great work there is only one climax cant you ever be serious not when im this jolted thought viking there was a long pause was i better than juno asked abby in a small voice onotterably she used to slide table mats onder my elbows in case i burnt the sheets as abby burst out laughing viking reached under his bed heres a present for you he handed her his latest cd of the brahms horn trio oh wow said abby in excitement will you sign it for me please write something lovely as she ran a hand down his cheek she could have grated parmesan on the hard emerging stubble i cant help it i just love you he was about to kiss her when there was a terrific hammering on the door go away shouted abby shot op hissed viking putting fingers reeking of sex and amarige over her mouth dont answer it the hammering increased must be blue trying to get in it is his room protested abby who is it she shouted room shervish said a voice we didnt order anything leave it snarled viking tense as a roused dobermann i could do with some more dottch courage teased abby since you watered those flowers with my last lot and wriggling out of his grasp she wrapped herself in the blue shirt and fumbled with the door handle dont for chrissake begged viking but it was too late at first she thought it was the press as the flashes of a dozen cameras blinded her then in horror she took in the muscular hairy legs below the straining black skirt of the waitress who was carrying the sliding magnum of moët aloft behind her leering and cheering in varying degrees of drunkenness were most of the male members of her orchestra whos a clever viking then shouted randy hooray for the lucky winner cried peter plumpton who was still wearing his upended bread basket too much molestarhic too much molesta ar cried a dripping dirty harry ive won more than you viking an exuberant dixie smugly patted his strawberryblond wig i had a grand on you at three to one fock off the lot of you howled viking yanking abby back inside and leave os alone a moment later the crowd dispersed as a yelling regiment of policemen and soldiers brandishing guns stormed the landing another moment later there was a crack like a pistol shot as abby drove her high heel through brahmss horn trio davie buckle having passed out behind the jacuzzi had missed the arrival of the forces of law and order but waking had dragged a pair of underpants on over his trousers and was now progressing noisily along the third floor julian caught up with him outside number hallo there he was saying to an enraged spanish bureaucrat in a hairnet come on davie as julian took his arm davie started walking away from him in little circles youve got to stop disturbing people got to find abby not at four oclock in the morning julian decided his own room was the nearest once hed thrown davie on the bed however davie started to fight got to find abby i shall telephone brünnhilde said julian sternly davie looked owlish he was terrified of brünnhilde shes in rutminshter he said sulkily then brightening added then ill telephone luisa luisa doesnt mind she trusts me said julian dropping five redoxins into a tooth mug and handing them to davie youve got beethoven nine again tomorrow no its tonight now drink it this isnt scotch davie looked into the tooth mug in outrage someones pissed in this glass limping towards the window he was about to chuck it into the street drink it ordered julian a shattered george fell into bed at four oclock in the morning after trying to unravel the endless red tape of flying rodneys body back to lucerne having switched off his mobile he was roused a few minutes later by his wife its nicholas someone he sounds put out she added as george took the house telephone from her knickers was apoplectic the orchestra were completely out of control orgying and rioting in abbys jacuzzi which had overflowed and flooded the bridal suite below where the president of some african state was having an illicit unbridal bonk his bodyguards had gone beserk and called the troops out twenty members of the orchestra had been arrested and were now cooling their heels in barcelona gaol which members of the orchestra asked george icily dixie randy blue nellie ninion dimitri candy and clare cherub escaped i think flora i cant remember exactly the arrested players had never seen anything equal to the rage george had worked up by the time hed driven the forty miles to barcelona gaol he found most of his orchestra still plastered dimitri was crying because he couldnt remember where hed left his cello miss parrott was hiccupping with her rhubarbpink beehive askew and singing land of hope and glory dixie still in his blackandwhite maids outfit was being leered at by the guard and ninion still necking ferociously looked as though he was going to be sucked inside fat isobel like a minnow at any second only by handing over hoards and hoards and hoards of greenbacks did george manage to spring them the one saving grace was that none of them had got round yet to taking drugs wheres flora snarled george as the motley bunch swayed in front of him oh flora wasnt with us said nellie who was wearing a spanish policemans hat the poor thing had a migraine she was crying with pain when i popped in around midnight only blue who had his hand in cathies and was soberer than most noticed that george suddenly cheered up and the great thundercloud threatening to drench them all suddenly rolled away you better go back to the hotel and pack he told them unsympathetically and get your baggage outside your doors the coach leaves in an hour ignoring two wakeup calls barry the bass was finally roused by a call from the leader of the orchestra whod spent the rest of the night in an armchair its about davie said julian apologetically where did he end up my room eventually hes snoring so loudly brünnhilde will hear him in rutminster and i cant wake him hes going to miss this goddamn rollcall give me five minutes barry the bass who was highly experienced in these matters from his days in a rock band kicked davie in the ribs get up you drunken bastard davie groaned but didnt stir deodorant sprayed into his face had no effect it was only when barry seized the foot with the sprained ankle and twisted it round and round that davie finally woke up the three made it outside just in time in the absence of miles knickers begged george to inspect the troops and please please chew them out i simply cant control them any more dawn was making flamingopink inroads on the east as george walked slowly down the row the spaniards he decided could not have seen so many wrecks since the armada flora looked frightful her face chalkwhite her eyes through crying as red as a white rats slumped against the coach slitty eyes gazing into space viking looked even whiter than she did of the whole lot only the steel elf who didnt drink looked beautiful the violet shadows under her eyes increasing her look of fragility wheres cherub intoned knickers checking his list its not his fort piped up noriko poor cherubs lost all his crows on cue cherub shot through the swing doors holding a tambourine over his cock and totally naked except for his shoes scuttling down the steps he slid into the lineup just as george reached him the players despite hangovers were in total hysterics waiting for a blistering undressing down but georges eyes merely ran over cherub for a second shoes need cleaning wilson he said coldly and moved on the next moment noriko had hurtled down therow and wrapped cherub in her long pink cardigan george returned to the middle of the row climbing back up three of the hotel steps so he could talk to his orchestra in his haste to reach the gaol he had put his dark blue poloshirt on inside out lucky for him thought flora wistfully youre all an absolute disgrace he roared then like the turnedup corner of a page a faint smile lifted his square face well be in toledo by ten oclock beethoven nine is appropriately scheduled to start at nine as you can play it in your sleep i suggest a short rehearsal at eight after your mealbreak but only on condition that you spend the afternoon in bed alone and you play out of your boots this evening and he strode off towards the carpark hes in a jovial mood said miss parrott in surprise out of masochistic yearning flora stationed herself in front of hilary and the steel elf but they both slept all the way to toledo a rowdy party carried on at the back of the coach but they couldnt persuade flora to join them milesie loves me yes i know cos my pay cheque tells me so sang cherub to the tune of jesus loves me viking sat by himself the sky clouded over as they drove into toledo viking could see a red trafficlight reflected in the bus window like a setting sun if only he could have turned back the clock twelve hours he was in the kind of eruptive junglecat mood where everyone avoided him but as they surged into the hotel reception which was appropriately filled with glossy dark jungle plants to collect their new keys from knickers randy shouted lunch on viking everyone im crashing out viking shot a warning glance in floras direction dom perignon all round went on randy evilly a mocking dixie put his arm round floras shoulders you missed all the fun last night shot your face howled viking what are you talking about flora didnt believe dixie at first then he waved a polaroid under her nose and she flipped all her pentup misery over george going back to his wife and the thieving bloody randiness and fecklessness of men in general poured out of her as she screamed at all of them how could you do that to abby you bastards bastards you swore youd break her and now you bloody well have locking herself in her room she threw herself down on the bed sobbing her heart out ignoring the bombardment on the door until they all got bored and wandered off then the telephone went it was viking it wasnt like you think he begged please put in a good word to abby oh fuck off i am just writing a stinking letter to st patrick telling him there was one utterly poisonous snake he didnt drive out of ireland havent you any idea either how this will hurt marcus the moment she slammed the telephone down it rang again fuck off fuck off shrieked flora is thut room how do i know its george whadja want she mustnt start crying again you once said you wanted to go oop in an air balloon ive got a headache fresh airll do you good a carll pick you up at two oclock sixty remembering the coiffured manicured ruth flora decided two could play at that game systematically she worked her way through the little bottles in her bathroom washing her hair then lying in a bubble bath in a shower cap as transparent as her motives as she scrubbed her body with a tiny oblong of soap then she rubbed in all the available moisturizer and gargled away all the pink mouthwash she would have scrubbed her entrails if she could have got at them she put on a dovegrey sundress thrown out by her mother as being too young and left her hair loose so it shone and swung like a copper bell with a desperately trembling hand she just managed to draw two thick lines round her eyes until they dominated her face like a bush babys and painted her lips the glowing coral of japonica in spring the gentle dovegrey was wonderfully becoming jumping with nerves she went downstairs to find various members of the orchestra passed out on chairs and sofas in the foyer the bar was propping up a greenfaced davie others were setting out on jaunts with guide books ive got to see something of spain other than concert halls and ceilings announced nellie in a nearby booth randys big checked shoulders were hunched over the telephone as he called home for the first time in six days the next moment he was crying so much he could hardly tell his wife hed see her tomorrow what on earths the matter asked flora kirsty put each of the children on to speak to me sobbed randy i miss them all so much then why play around so much when youve got such a lovely family i dont know randy blew his nose then caught sight of flora god you look sexy come ere but flora had bounded away calm down she kept telling herself its daft to get so excited you cars here mees seymour announced a hoteyed chauffeur sweating in black uniform how dyou know its me squeaked flora i was told you was gorgeous with red air oh goodness flora bolted down the steps but all her happiness drained away as inside the car she found juno looking so bloody beautiful in a pale pink shirt and shorts showing off tiny suntanned thighs half the width of floras it was no comfort that juno was as cross to see her or that they were soon joined by simon perhaps george was after him too and hilary flora slumped in the back she might as well have got drunk on vikings illgotten champagne with all those other bastards they drove past ploughed fields and rocks the colour of lobster bisque through beautiful white villages up an avenue of yellowing peeling plane trees to a ravishing castle about five miles out of town a crowd of people in light trousers and rather wellpressed shirts dressed up with nattily tied silk scarves were making a din on the terrace on the unblemished and blatantly sprinkled lawn below a panting spaniard in blue dungarees was wrestling with a purpleandemeraldgreen dragons skin spewing out of a vast basket what a lovely spot said the steel elf george came straight up the rings under his eyes were heavier than his eyebrows he had turned his navyblue polo shirt the right way round but tucked into his white trousers it showed he had completely lost his spare tyre his feet looked vulnerably pale in loafers flora suppressed an insane urge to drop to her feet and kiss them she must get a grip on herself what does anyone want to drink perrier please said juno and me too simpered hilary ill have an orange pressé if its feasible said simon ill have a quadruple vodka and tonic said flora you wont be able to play reproved hilary ive got to sing said flora its so hard ill never get onto the platform if im sober having taken flora at her word and persuaded the others to accept a glass of champagne each george introduced ruth who was much too doneup in a frilly white shirt and shockingpink trousers with gold high heels for lunchtime in the campa having given flora a notaltogether friendly look she introduced her partner trevor flora giggled ive got a partner called trevor too she said only in my trevors case he has black eyes and a tight skin and a very curly tail and a squeaky bark and i rescued him she rattled on you dont look as though you need rescuing trevor ii smirked gave flora slightly too hot a glance for ruths liking and asked her if shed ever been up in an air balloon before flora shook her head suddenly she was too shy to say anything in georges presence were coming along to the concert this evening to look at georges latest toy said ruth with a slight edge i love beethovens choral symphony to think the wonderful old man wrote the whole thing when he was deaf she beckoned the maid to bring over the bottle have some more shampoo i shouldnt giggled juno it makes my nose tickle she smiled roguishly at george who had also fallen oddly silent just a half said hilary i expect well be in the balloon soon oh no pedromaria takes at least half an hour to get it up said ruth poor mrs pedromaria murmured flora just for a second her eyes met georges and to stop herself laughing she sloped off and gazed at a hideous bed of red gladioli and purple asters ruth was hell george was the one who needed rescuing only george and the four musicians from the rso and pedromaria to steer the thing went up in the balloon extraordinary reflected flora as they took off into the blue that a slain dragon could swell up into something so huge and beautiful with the orange flame belching up into the purpleandemeraldgreen dome turning she saw georges waving wife getting smaller and smaller it was literally heavenly this is how god must feel thought flora as she gazed down on the turning tawny woods and the gold and green fields as the darkness of the balloons shadow fell over the face of the earth below them flocks of sheep and herds of cows scattered in temporary terror flora had deliberately positioned herself at the front of the basket as far away from george as possible giving him the chance if he wanted to stand behind the steel elf everyone was oohing and aahing as they floated over a little village driving dogs to hysterical barking and bringing children screaming with excitement into the streets then a sudden gust tipped the basket forward and she felt a body solid as a rottweiler thrown against hers and knew instantly with a thumping heart that it was georges sorry she gasped ramming herself even harder against the front of the basket putting half an inch between them but a second later the wind tossed the basket backwards throwing her against him as she leapt away his big hands closed on her hip bones steadying her and he was right behind her giving her absolutely no room for manoeuvre with st george and the dragon pitted against one poor damsel what chance of escape did she have i must be dreaming thought flora in bewilderment but she could have sworn george dropped a kiss on her bare shoulder and now his thumbs were softly stroking her ribcage as the flames surged upwards with another dragon roar for a second he took his right hand away resting a muscular arm on her shoulder the soft dark down tickling her cheek as he pointed out hares racing up and down the rows of stubble what a wonderful view gushed hilary mines much better murmured george into floras hair his right hand was back but higher up her ribs this time and oh my god his thumb was slowly caressing her right breast outside her dress and now oh heavens it had crept inside there was no mistaking it her nipples were pushing out the dovegrey sundress as proof and it was the most blissfully erotic thing that had ever happened to her it knocked any of rannaldinis caresses into a cocked cock she was so faint with desire her insides were churning and disintegrating like peaches in a liquidizer she couldnt bear it gradually they were losing height drifting down over a sagegreen poplar copse the lovely balloon of her happiness was going to subside thats very good timing george said simon in despair flora noticed two chauffeurs leaning against two hearselike limos waiting at the edge of the big yellow field below them she glanced sideways and realized that hilary was gazing at georges stillwandering right hand in absolute horror then another greater gust of wind caught the balloon the next moment hilary and juno were screaming as they crashed and bumped to the ground like cats in a basket chucked out of a car with everyone falling higgledypiggledy on top of each other get me out of here shrieked hilary outraged to find herself trapped beneath an excited pedromaria who was in turn beneath an even more excited simon you ok flora luv georges accent was even broader with anxiety gone to heaven sighed flora squirming blissfully under the weight of his body a second later george had pulled her to her feet lifted her out of the basket and dragged her across the stubble into the first limo jumping into the driving seat he screeched off in a cloud of dust leaving behind the two drivers and the rest of the party waving and shouting impotently plenty of room for the rest of them he said nearly removing a gatepost as he swung into the road do oop your seat belt then after a long pause i luv you i luv you i bluddy luv you to distraction what squeaked flora i thought you still loved ruth i came here last night to ask her for a divorce i thought it was you who refused to give her one you know a lot about my life dont you said george murdering unfamiliar gears as he swung onto the main road and rammed his foot on the accelerator i hated trevor he said he was one of my competitors and he took my wife off me now i know hes done me a good deed i didnt hate him any more today anyway i want to be free to marry someone else flora was speechless and reached for the strap above her window as the needle hit mph but i dont understand i mean then as the car only just missed a bank jesus yes you better shoot up and let me concentrate on driving reaching ruths hacienda he grabbed floras hand again and ignoring the party that was still roaring on the terrace dragged her up three flights of stairs into his bedroom and locking the door took her in his arms for a second he gazed into her face so sweet and apprehensive and striped by the sunlight streaming through the shutters and then he kissed her flora had never experienced such tenderness nor passionate enthusiasm nor clumsiness all at once then he ripped off her sundress and kissed her breasts before tearing off her knickers and throwing her on the bed im not on the pppill flora hated herself for stammering doesnt matter i want to fook you more than anything in the world george stammered even more as he fumbled with his belt but i want you to know i luv you and want to marry you as well flora helped him with his zip and boxer shorts oh my she said in a choked voice you are well hungerford dont take the piss pleaded george i cant andle it lets take things very slowly andels largo began flora until george stopped her nervous prattle by kissing her having exhausted the bed they moved into the bathroom lying on the shagpile flora admired the gleaming undersides of the lavatory bowl and thought she must remember to clean under the loo at the cottage then she thought of nothing else except george finally ending up on a pile of duvets on the bedroom floor she staggered to her feet i have to sing ode to joy in a few hours she sighed but im so happy itll probably sing itself this evening i luv you repeated george who was running water into a round cyclamenpink bath next door i mean it about marrying you and i mean it too said flora bending over to kiss him itsjust a bit new and all the bliss of having a bathroom en suite she went on is that you dont have to scuttle across the landing trapping a towel between your legs a shadow flickered across georges face have you done that lots of times a few how many blokes have you been to bed with ive lost count said flora as countess dracula was always complaining dyou want a bowdlerized version no i want the truth right well flora took a deep breath i had several schoolboys at bagley hall then i had rannaldini i wonder if women whove slept with rannaldini make love in a certain way like string players whove been to the juillard go on george almost snapped as floras body disappeared under the surface then emerged like a seal the bubbles coating her freckled back rannaldini obliterated everyone else then i tried a few students at the academy to exorcize him but it didnt work then noone till jack but i only went to bed with him because he rescued me from carmine rather like accepting a large brandy from a st bernard when youre stuck halfway up the matterhorn unable to suppress a smile george started to rub pears soap the colour of floras wet hair down her arm thats all except viking she said dropping the soap georges hand did a chinese burn on her wrist he really minds thought flora gazing at the red mark in wonder wwwas it foontastic asked george wistfully yes and no we were both a bit too expert like torvill and dean anyway i honestly think viking went to bed with me to get at abby he cant leave her alone hes always bitching at her thats about it truly im at my journeys end putting both arms up feeling george as warm wide and solid as an aga against her flora pulled him into the bath with a huge splash you are the loveliest hunk but george was still fretting will i be exciting enough for you exciting floras eyes flooded with tears i cant begin to tell you like that great balloon soaring into the sky out of that limp rubber what its like suddenly to be happy again wildly ecstatically happy with the most adorable man in the world thats exciting i have to joke i have to im just so terrified its going to end in my end is my beginning said george kissing her soapy hand im going to marry you the second my divorce is through oh goodness and i want to say floora she loved the way he pronounced it with a long first syllable ive had a change of heart because of you i know ive been greedy in the past ive ridden roofshod over folk been a bastard knocking down houses infilling leaning on old ladies ive thought about it a lot ive totally given oop the idea of buying hp hall and turning it into a supermarket i know someone who could do with a bit of infilling at the moment said flora slyly rising up in the bath she started to kiss her way down his body plunging into the water until his cock came up to meet her then she looked up quickly gasping for breath eyelashes like star fish abbys always telling me to play with every inch of my beau george ruffled her hair youre utterly deranged lets have a deranged marriage then when can i start telling everyone not until i tell abby said flora im not sure how pleased shell be sixtyone abby was in a murderous mood and shouted at flora as she slid in late to the rehearsal and took her place beside the other three soloists shes in a terrific paddy whispered clare in awe correction whispered candy a terrific paddys been inside her poor abby in fact had just had a hideous session with hilary oozing spurious concern like a lanced boil hilary had come into the conductors room and begged abby not to take vikings seduction too seriously the sweepstake was just a bit of fun abby and you must remember the musicians arent wealthy like you that two thousand would have got most of them out of debt saved the repossession of barrys barn paid for janeys hip cushioned cyrils retirement bought randy some new clubs and a new prayermat for miles oh miles would never involve himself with anything so tacky unlike fucking viking hilary sighed deeply im afraid vikings too lazy to get anywhere in life hed never have scraped together enough money to send granny wexford to america if he hadnt won it theyll think hes such a hero in dublin and of course he has to keep up his reputation as the orchestra stud the sonofabitch hissed abby ill get him for sexual harassment im afraid the orchestra will say the boot was on the other foot theyll swear blacks white for viking ive been made a complete fool of right wheres your sense of humour abby hilary was loving this get things in proportion if you need some counselling when you get back to england miles will arrange it can he arrange for viking to be bobbitted as well hilary sighed miles and i are praying for you certainly during the rehearsal abbys wrath was reserved for viking they were only running through the last movement from where the chorus and soloists come in but she wasted everyones time singling out any intervening horn passages and pulling them to pieces particularly vikings contribution more pianissimo first horn she screamed until viking wasnt making any sound at all play it again why it was perfect dont smartass me leave your brains in your trousers where they belong the minute she said that abby could have kicked herself you should know chorused the celtic mafia i said on your own first horn and viking whod never been called first horn in his life except by rannaldini retaliated by playing the solo from ein heldenleben which had so bewitched her on her first day at the rso abby promptly burst into tears and stormed out julian ran after her but she wouldnt talk to him after last night she didnt know who to trust not even flora whod been grinning like a jackass throughout the rehearsal somehow by the evening fortified by a couple of betablockers abby had pulled herself together and the applause as always even for a runofthemill beethovens ninth was tumultuous because it was such a happy piece and because so many of the choruss relations were swelling the audience george sat in a box high above the orchestra it was hard to tell who looked more frozen with misery viking or cyril for whom it was his last concert abroad and who had been denied the great horn solo in the third movement but george couldnt be bothered with other peoples problems tonight and the moment flora filed on with the other soloists he never took his eyes off her rejoicing in every note as her piercing exquisite voice soared above everyone elses even when she joined in the chorus several times she smiled up at him and even made foxie give him a wave she has brought radiance to my life thought george thank you god for giving me a second chance having given her all to the ecstatic toledo audience abby was on her knees there had been too much going on to take in rodneys death now the shock was wearing off and the pain beginning to hurt only to rodney could she have confessed the agony and utter humiliation of having offered herself to viking so totally and so trustingly when all he was after was the macho gratification of winning some bet she could imagine the guffaws the sniggering the slaps on the back what was the snooty cow like viking what was she really like and it had been so beautiful so perfect that was the pity of it she wanted to creep into bed and die but george had to fly back for tomorrows rso board meeting so she had to take his place at dinner with the toledo organizers viking probably for the first time in his career didnt go out on an endoftour razzle he was utterly bewildered how depressed and ashamed of himself he felt abby had got under his skin and irritated him more than any woman hed ever met he had dreamt for so long of wiping the haughty expression off her face and reducing her to grovelling pleading adoring submission and now he had he loathed himself as leader of the pack his street cred would have been utterly destroyed if he hadnt won the bet he also owed it to his backers as the favourite there had been a lot of money on him now he desperately wanted to explain to abby that winning the bet had only been part of the incentive and the actuality had been miraculous he was certain if he and abby had spent a week or so together unwatched by the lascivious or disapproving eyes of the orchestra he could have fucked her out of his system and remained friends guilt was not a familiar emotion to viking and he didnt think this time hed be able to rid himself of it with a few hail maries he was also miserably aware that the three other people he loved and trusted flora julian and blue were absolutely furious with him you behaved abominably viking julian had shouted rodney was just saying yesterday how youd swung the rso behind abby now youve let him down youre as repulsive as anatole in war and peace rake magdalene he loved much so much will be forgiven him youre nothing but a fucking havocmaker blue was even more upset cathie having learnt about the bet was refusing to have anything to do with him how could you men all hurt that lovely warm girl wandering wearily down the hotel landing viking could hear the sound of hairdryers orchestra wives washing their hair to be pretty for their husbands tomorrow leaving doors open so they could chat to one another mary her hair in rollers was finishing her sampler one thing viking hadnt given abby was roots and wings god he felt awful davie was asleep on a chaiselongue a plastered cyril was declaiming ulysses to a large yucca plant old age has yet his honour and his toil death closes all but something ere the end some work of noble note may yet be done viking had only just collapsed into bed wondering whether to ward off suicide or encourage sleep with a large whisky from the minibar when blue arrived and whispered that hed finally persuaded cathie to come back to the room with him i trapped her in the revolving doors so she couldnt escape wheres carmine enjoying a bonk with nellie since you bottled out he left cathie fast asleep in bed having taken a mogadon or so he thinks bloody risky sure it is we wont have long just bogger off and leave the coast clear i wont watch i promise pleaded viking i josst want to crash out i dont believe you hissed blue its my only chance please viking or cathiell do a runner shes furious with you as it is wearily viking staggered upstairs wrapped only in a towel and dragging his duvet and a pillow he was just banging on the steel elfs door when the lift opened and out stepped lord and lady leatherhead knickers and hilary all jolly from the official dinner trailing after them was a haunted ghostlypale abby abby sweetheart we mosst talk viking bounded forward his only thought to comfort her abby whod been on the fundador on an utterly empty stomach went beserk get out of my life you fucking sonofabitch she screamed and slapped him really hard across the face with fatal timing the door behind viking opened to show the steel elf with her hair tied up in a pink bow and wearing a pretty rosepatterned nightgown go back to your little prickteaser right yelled abby let her put some more beer mats under your elbows two grandll keep up her mortgage for at least six months and with that she lashed her other hand back across vikings cheek cutting it open with marcuss ruby lord and lady leatherhead and knickers looked on in horror hilary in delight as abby ran off down the landing to her suite slamming the door behind her during the sex which took place between blue and cathie which cathie was far too frightened and ashamed of her body to enjoy her makeup rubbed off to reveal a dark bruise below her left cheekbone she tried to cover up two more on her ribs blue struggled to control his fury for poorer and poorer for battered and even more battered youve got to leave him cath i cant i dont believe in divorce i wouldnt believe in it either if you were married to me blue tried to kiss her but she jerked her head away only that morning carmine had untruthfully told her her breath smelt her bottom had dropped and her breasts were like drooping poached eggs i must go she whispered but as she dived for her clothes so he shouldnt see her ugly body blue caught her wrist pulling her back i want to tell you a story for a second cathie thought he was joking but his clear blue eyes the kindest in the world were completely serious once upon a time there was a beautiful woman married to a wicked philanderer who constantly diminished her and beat her op but because she was a good catholic who wanted to go to heaven she stayed with him for fifty dreadful years cathie gave a sob in the end the philanderer died a week before his wife did and free of him at last she arrived on the other side here for all eternity said god welcoming her with open arms theres someone here you know already and there on the first fluffy white cloud was her husband shafting an angel there was a long pause glancing sideways blue saw the bruise getting darker and darker as tears washed away the last vestiges of makeup cathie darling i didnt mean to hurt you but youve got to leave him noone will punish you ill look after you i promise i cant hed come after me and hed kill us both ill never turn my mobile off blue was in tears too if ever you want me just ring and ill come and get you imagining the rest of the orchestra and especially flora trailing home the following morning with noone to carry her case george found it impossible to concentrate on his board meeting he hoped none of the bitches in the orchestra nor those brutes in the brass section nor any section for that matter were pricking floras bubble or wising her up about his thousand and one deficiencies god he missed her the board meeting had begun with regrets and a minutes silence for rodneys death miss priddock had sobbed all over her shorthand notebook which made it difficult for her to use her biro but she had been cheered up by yet another miniature from one of the brewers everyone expressed delight that sonnys interruption had been nominated peggy parker bowed graciously then followed the usual moans about poor houses insufficient sponsors and the rocketing cost of the latest marketing operations which george had introduced at least the catnip matador hed brought back from toledo had been a huge success thought george as if to avenge generations of brave bulls john drummond was now tossing it up in the air and pouncing on it how did the tour go demanded peggy parker noticing georges total inattention you better ask miles he was there longer than me george was incensed when miles after pouring a glass of lord leatherheads spring water from the silver carafe hilly had given him for his birthday rose to his feet and deplored the hooliganism that had poisoned the tour although there are still players who know how to act as worthy ambassadors for rutminster a crackdown is imperative before the appleton piano competition in ten days time emphasized miles when the rso will be scrutinized under the microscope not only by the music world but by the international media and the general public in a word miles cracked his knuckles i feel abigail has lost control of the orchestra that was a great many more than one word said george furiously and your description of the tour is joost as inaccurate the orchestra played brilliant made many friends all over spain and really put rootminster on the map they only screwed up on saturday night because they were choked about rodney and that was only after theyd cobbled together the best memorial concert ive ever heard there wasnt a dry eye in the house when they played nimrod georges voice shook slightly abby did chumpion it was the first time shed played in pooblic and she had to conduct as well she and rodney were very close how close one wonders said mrs parker sourly i gather sir rodney left her his home on lake lucerne thats out of order snapped george mrs parker went puce and whos going to foot the bill for the jacuzzi flooding the don hooan suite she spluttered i am said george and what about flora seymour pulling the communication cord on the train to madrid chuntered lady chisleden over the defenestration of some cuddly toy said canon airlie george started to laugh perhaps some latterday zola will leap to our defence in the rootminster echo he suggested and start his letter jacuzzi everyone looked at him as though hed gone off his head oh forget it said george then added grimly youve been sneaking miles the reviews were bloody good abbys emerging as a first class conductor rachels requiems number ten in the charts weve got a big hit on our hands what news of the merger asked canon airlie earnestly what was the outcome of your discussions with the arts council on wednesday did they provide any guidance that lot are about as capable of guidance as a droonken guidedog canon airlie pursed his lips lousy for morale said a banker with so many conflicting rumours flying around the rso need a strong leader who can set a good example mrs parker glared at george why did the jacuzzi flood asked lady chisleden not really a matter for ladies said lord leatherhead hastily casting an eye at miss priddock who was stolidly taking the minutes abandoning his catnip matador john drummond jumped onto the windowledge to chatter angrily at two pigeons copulating on the roof cats television was much better in the summer when the house martins and swallows flew in and out of the eaves theyve all gone to warmer climes in the south thought george that was the tune flora had played so beautifully at her audition he looked at his watch her plane would be taking off any minute if he hurried he could meet her at heathrow it had been the longest twelve hours of his life i agree that leadership must come from the top miles was saying if there were a merger i think rannaldini is the only man who could pull the orchestra together and save us from financial disaster where is rannaldini enquired peggy parker reverently recording in prague with some brilliant young czech pianist he always noses out the talent george stubbed out his cigar and rose to his feet flora must have told abby by now im afraid the only merger im remotely interested in at the moment is my own he announced id like the boards permission to take a threemonth sabbatical but you never take holidays said miss priddock aghast even durin that weeks skiing you worked in the evenings not this time said george proudly im going to take miss flora seymour the most wonderful young lady round the world and as soon as i get a divorce shes going to marry me there was an absolutely appalled silence but shes a member of the orchestra and about half your age exploded mrs parker and a baggage chuntered miles well i certainly didnt put her outside my door at six oclock said george with a broad grin i hope you didnt abuse your position hungerford snorted canon airlie ooterly said george happily so would you if youd been me you old goat but who is going to do your job protested lord leatherhead have left us in rather a hole yer know as miles is so frantic to run the orchestra let him have a go now if youll excuse me ive got a plane to meet after hed left and the uproar had subsided miles moved into georges chair at the head of the table it was hard to talk when george was here but i think its important that you all hear exactly how bad things were on tour and why we ought to replace abigail as soon as possible floras happiness faded like a conker out of its husk as she struggled off the plane weighed down with presents for george trevor and marcus having been briefed about the afternoon in the hot air balloon by hilary and juno the orchestra had been mobbing her up about george all the way home some of the remarks had been very bitchy until flora had lost her temper and snapped that george loved her and was taking her round the world guffaws greeted this as they all shuffled through customs nellie turned to carmine who had been behaving in a very smug proprietorial way after two nights on the trot and said dyou mind if we dont walk out into the airport together carmine because my husbands meeting me which caused even louder guffaws carmine was incensed as the orchestra mothers charged the barrier to hug their children and julian fell into luisas arms floras eyes filled with tears i see your grand friend hasnt come to meet you said carmine nastily as they made their way out to the coaches the only reason hed want to take you round the world would be to have a bit of free crumpet while he was avoiding tax i must not cry said flora through gritted teeth but her eyes had misted over so much that when the airport doors opened automatically for viking and dixie who were walking out in front of her and she caught a glimpse of trevor the mongrel outside she knew she was imagining things all the same she ran forward then the doors opened again and stayed open like her mouth for there holding an ecstatically wriggling trevor blushing like an autumn sunset stood george dropping her luggage and her presents flora rushed towards them and george took his rankandfile viola player in his arms and kissed her on and on in front of his entire orchestra oh george gasped flora im not taking you round the world ive got a better idea said george that evening a delirious flora telephoned her mother from georges double bed mum mum im getting married youre far too young wailed georgie who is he where did you meet him has he got a job he works for the rso im not having you throwing yourself away on some penniless musician i know too many of them muum its george hungerford there was a long pause the george hungerford none other giggling flora handed the receiver to george so he could hear her mothers screech of amazement down the telephone oh darling hell be able to keep us all in our old age how lovely such a sweet man too when will you bring him to see us i suppose he ought to ask daddy for your hand not until ive stopped biting my nails actually we thought wed push off for a holiday first george wanted to take me round the world but i said we couldnt leave trevor trevor who was lying across georges feet wiggled his tail oh mum youll never guess what george has done what you know they dont allow dogs on beaches any more because of fouling well george has bought trevor a beach all of his own with a sweet little cottage for us thrown in oh how wonderful said georgie anyone that nice to dogs will make a wonderful husband sixtytwo the pellafacini quintet were very sad to lose their young viola player but the person totally unhinged by floras whirlwind romance was abby not only was she terribly jealous of floras and georges almost incandescent happiness but also how dare flora land a real man and such a rich attractive one how could her singing career not soar with such a backup on the other hand how lucky she was to be able to settle down and play house and have babies worst of all with rodney dying and georges departure abby felt utterly defenceless you cant quit now theres the appleton coming up she railed at george and ive had an enquiry today about taking the orchestra to the states george found he couldnt give a stuff miles will cope hes very capable hes no good at zapping mergers cant you wait till after the appleton floras my noomber one priority now said george firmly im not going to let that slip through my fingers work ruined my last marriage its only for three months abby felt the peacekeeping forces had left the orchestra even worse with flora gone she and marcus were thrown into each others company abby felt increasingly bad about betraying him with viking how long would it be before one of those rogues in the orchestra tipped him off probably in the middle of the appleton when she finally got home having made a detour via lucerne for rodneys funeral she couldnt meet marcuss eyes and became even more aggressive through guilt where the hell have you been ive been calling for days oh there you are baby as a mewing scriabin came running down the stairs i was so worried about you mrs diggorys been looking after them stammered marcus and george came and collected trevor isnt it amazing about him and flora dont change the subject how could you push off and leave them abby looked lovingly down at scriabin who was now purring in her arms sucking at her jersey like a baby my asthma got so bad mumbled marcus and the cats missed you and kept coming into the studio and howie isnt getting me any work so i flew over to prague and tried to set up a cheap record deal he didnt add that boriss and abbys promises back in march of conducting and bankrolling him had never materialized any luck asked abby im waiting to hear even abby in her state of preoccupation noticed he looked awful dreadfully thin and pale but with an unnatural hectic flush on his cheeks and the rash of too many steroids speckling his mouth by the time hed carried her cases upstairs he could hardly breathe and collapsed wheezing onto the bed how was the tour so so great houses great performances but rodney died abby was angrily crashing coathangers along rails to make more room i know im desperately sorry whatever for you only met him once i knew what he meant to you i dont want to talk about it im exhausted then knowing she was being vile added you look wiped out too ive been working on stuff for the appleton what have you chosen a bach prelude liszts b minor sonata a little suite of boriss great that hes gone to number ten in the charts great that the orchestras gone to number ten corrected abby sharply crashing pots and bottles down on her dressingtable what are you doing in the second round chopin etudes the grande polonaise a couple of debussy preludes and the waldstein not the appassionata marcus blushed i made such a cockup at cotchester that was what hed decided to play today but such was his panic and indecision nothing sounded any good and he kept changing his mind there was music all over the floor of his normally tidy studio helen who hadnt recovered from rannaldini disappearing with flora after the creation hadnt helped by ringing at all hours i thought shed cheer up when she heard about flora and george but she seems curiously pissed off that floras landed such an ace bloke shes already channelled her suspicions in another direction some czech pianist called natalia whos entered for the appleton and evidently rannaldinis seeing a lot of hermione helen shouldnt hassle you fumed abby finding a genuine excuse for fury how can you concentrate when shes on your back all the time its ok shes got to dump somewhere abby was frantic for marcus to make love to her but when he almost shrank away she manufactured a row seized the nearest barbour and stormed out for a walk there were lights on in the bordello but finding herself helplessly drawn towards them she realized it was only the setting sun shining across the lake turning both water and windowpanes to gold she had never physically ached for someone so much in her life as viking by the time she had reached the end of the lake the sun had deepened to blazing vermilion its reflection now cooling its burning body in the lake oh god if only it were as easy to extinguish desire delving in the barbour pocket for a tissue to wipe her eyes she found amid the debris of leaves and wild flowers a tornup letter in marcuss handwriting piecing it together with trembling hands she read my darling darling darling a i am dying for you i cant go on i never believed it was possible to miss anyone so much or so impossible to suppress my desperate desperate longing then there was a quote from pushkin ending what can my heart do but burn it has no choice how darling of marcus to leave the poem in russian knowing she understood the language abby felt ashamed but happier two loves have i of comfort and despair and she must concentrate on the love that comforted her going into hp hall after a sleepless night worrying how many of the musicians would know by now about her and viking she was cheered by a wonderfully funny piece of news on the noticeboard next to details for the appleton where tails and black dresses would be worn was an announcement that sonny parkers interruption had won a gramophone award for the best cd of contemporary music that would mean another hundred thousand pounds from mother parker forgetting george was on sabbatical abby barged into his office for a giggle to find miles heavily ensconced georges squashy leather sofas his hightech toys his models of tower blocks and regency façades the fridge full of drink the edward burra and the keith vaughan all had been replaced by a functional oatmeal hessian sofa a totally empty desk and some very uncomfortable chairs the decorators had obviously been at work slapping beige emulsion over the shredded ginger suede walls i thought george had only gone for three months said abby aghast everythings very much in the air at the moment said miles coolly please dont let that cat in and id prefer it if you knocked very minimalist abby looked round the room then attempting a joke because she suddenly felt so nervous to match jessicas minis miles ignored john drummonds piteous mewings jessicas left he said curtly whatever for she really cheered us up with those typing errors important for morale miles smiled thinly for the orchestra to realize were prepared to make cuts on the admin side as well but the sponsors just adored her actually she left of her own accord she realized she would be expected now george isnt around to do a little more than pour champagne and forget to hand in lottery tickets far more interestingly miles cracked his knuckles joyfully rannaldini has just been appointed musical director of the cco then at abbys look of horror continued hell still retain his directorships in new york berlin and tokyo of course then he wont have time to look after the cco snapped abby theyll be shortchanged like everyone else course they wont dont be so needlessly spiteful the arts council are delighted said miles looking equally pleased and having someone of sir robertos calibre near by should put you all on your mettle miles certainly hadnt purchased any kid gloves in spain so rannaldinis now in a prime position to merge us and the cco blurted out abby oh why couldnt she keep her trap shut rannaldinis a wonderful musician for a second miless eyes contained a flicker of genuine warmth and a natural disciplinarian viking wouldnt stand for that vikings left us too said miles silkily wwwhat whispered abby bruising her spine as she collapsed onto one of the uncomfortable chairs where when how he resigned this morning but why to be quite honest i think hes bored hes been here eight years nothing to keep him should have gone to london years ago but hes the best player weve got and hes under contract we thought he was too and that we could hold him at least until after the appleton but when we checked it ran out last month there was nothing we could do but all the contracts have been renewed it seems they havent george has been a shade lax but this is awful viking lifted the orchestra with every note as if in agreement john drummonds black paw appeared supplicatingly under the door viking is a dangerous influence said miles briskly quinton is far less erratic more responsible and cant wait to sort out the section rannaldini agrees whats he got to do with it hissed abby when he did the creation he thought viking was very overrated big fish in a small polluted pond to quote yourself and didnt he know it miles rose to his feet im disappointed in you abby after your little tantrum in toledo in front of the chairman and his wife not to mention nicholas and hilly his voice thickened lasciviously as he mentioned her name i thought you would be delighted hes left us now if youll excuse me he said chillingly as he moved forward to open the door for her abby thought for a second he was going to stamp on drummonds twitching paw prufrock had become robespierre overnight outside she found miss priddock in tears mr hungerford loved cats hes left some money so i can go on buying drummond a lottery ticket every week utterly stunned abby sought out the celtic mafia who looked bleak and said viking had flown back to ireland none of them would elaborate didnt he leave me any message pleaded abby he left you this said blue it was a cheque for two thousand pounds for the cats protection league poor abby had to go straight into rehearsal they were playing the fairys kiss which had a fiendishly difficult horn solo quinton played it well enough but there was no halo round the interpretation the rest of the horn section looked suicidal even the prospect of his marriage to jenny couldnt raise lincolns spirits cyril was wearing a black armband i reckon viking was greater than dennis brain he kept saying and now that george and viking have gone miles will have you out by the end of the week thought abby suddenly noriko started crying and rushed off the stage cherub dropped his drumsticks and rushed off to comfort her abby felt the implicit blame of the entire orchestra it was monstrously unfair viking had been in the wrong hed made the bet in the afternoon they rehearsed mahlers first symphony which had three trumpets playing off stage believing carmine and randy were deliberately bitching her up coming in at the wrong moment and much too loud abby screamed at them to put socks in it the next time the passage was so quiet noone could hear it abby was left flailing in space knickers discovered the trumpeters playing darts in the band room she insisted we play pianissimo she cant have heard us protested randy innocently so abby made them do it again and randy played it from his car everyone could hear him revving up and started to laugh storming out to the carpark abby noticed vikings empty parking place had been taken by quintons very clean rover and burst into tears desolate she drove home to find marcus had lit a fire and left her some melon chicken kiev and a note saying he loved her marcus is the one true thing in my life abby told herself numbly i must cling on to him she was roused by the doorbell standing outside was a raddled but very sexylooking blonde her name was beatrice she said and she was a freelance who fed copy to most of the papers particularly the music magazines i only talk to the media if its authorized by the rso press office abby was about to slam the door i only wanted to give you this beatrice smiled winningly i was in megagrams press office and asked what was hot and guess what they produced a gust of wind seemed to blow her and a shower of leaves into the house abby gave a crow of delight as beatrice handed her a galley of madly in love the pop tune she and marcus had recorded without marcus knowing at the christmas party on the sleeve was a picture of marcus looking wildly romantic at the piano abby had her arm round him her cheek against his her fiddle in her left hand i didnt think megagram were going to release it till january squeaked abby in excitment theyve brought it forward and theyre very high on it they want to cash in on the success of rachels requiem how does it sound great said beatrice all the clapping and cheering in the background adds to the fun hes a fantastic pianist you sound wonderful too even better than you did in the old days then very carefully she added is it true hes rupert campbellblacks son oh christ abby glanced at the sleeve have they put in the campbell marcus will go ballistic hes crazy to get to the top on his own sell more records said beatrice cosily better publicity for the orchestra and for him after they had played the single which had colossal charm beatrice produced a bottle of champagne we must toast the new richard clayderman i ought to give you a drink said abby i can put it on expenses oh why not thought abby marcus always shied away from publicity but he wouldnt be back for hours and she would at last have a chance to push his career and the record unbeknownst to howie she had made her share of the royalties over to the orchestra nor did beatrice know that the rso had been chosen to accompany the finalists in the appleton and was so thrilled for abby she really was a delightful woman despite her rather tarty looks decided abby and it was such a relief to meet someone enthusiastic about success the brits were generally so carping dyou mind if i switch on my taperecorder i hate not getting the facts right asked beatrice after threequarters of a bottle and no food all day abby forgot to emphasize what was off the record and what on this is the record that matters said beatrice picking up the sleeve of madly in love i must say marcus is almost as devasting as his famous father more so said abby clumsily trying to tug open a drawer in a nearby desk which had expanded because of the damp then it gave and she pulled it out altogether scattering photographs all over the floor my god beatrice dropped to her knees leafing through everything pretty girl whos that flora seymour she shared the cottage with marcus and me until last week and my goodness look at that it was a topless abby stretched out on the grass marcus stripped to the waist lay beside her his head on her shoulder his hand trailing across her ribs what a beautiful picture pure calvin klein beatrice examined it in rapture flora took it one afternoon great isnt it certainly is and he is gorgeous what a profile and that gentle passionate mouth no wonder he wows them on the platform no wonder megagram are thrilled to bits she emptied the rest of the champagne into abbys glass how does he get on with rupert when are you hoping to get married beatrice asked finally she was now kneeling on the floor with her scarlet dress rucked up and her thighs wide apart so you could see her black lace panties her blond bob fell over her hot brown eyes and she displayed a rift of cleavage where the three top buttons were undone viking would have had her upstairs in five seconds flat thought abby in sudden anguish he only has to say hi sweetheart in that peatsoft voice and hes got them horizontal in the carpark she could hear hugos envious disgruntled voice as though it were only yesterday you ok said beatrice fine mumbled abby must go to the john fine she repeated cannoning off the doorway out in the garden she collapsed against an old apple tree sobbing her heart out when would she even see viking again by the time shed splashed her face and wiped away the streaked mascara and pulled herself together beatrice had her coat on mustnt take up any more of your time im such a fan youre so much prettier in the flesh and look so much younger i hope to get up to the appleton perhaps you and marcus would have dinner with me at least can i have your autograph on my notebook abby didnt tell marcus about beatrices visit he had inherited ruperts pathological loathing of the press and she couldnt remember which papers beatrice had said she worked for but the piece was bound to be friendly shed been so excited for abby anyway abby wanted to surprise marcus with a lovely boost to his career sixtythree beatrices story broke in the scorpion two days before the appleton chip off the old black said the headline the photograph taken by flora had been blown up and cropped just above the waist so abby and marcus looked naked in each others arms lappassionatas madly in love said the caption abby was quoted as saying that she and marcus were secretly engaged and planning to make the announcement after the appleton so people wouldnt accuse abby of favouring marcus if her orchestra had to accompany him in the finals i sure hope hes going to win but naturally well treat all the contestants the same the copy then switched to the record itself which abby had had secretly made at christmas as a surprise present for marcus everyone thinks marcus is wealthy but he hasnt spoken to his snooty dad in two years rupert cut him off after a family tiff and he is too proud to take any money from his multimillionaire stepdad sir roberto rannaldini family motto i will dump from a great height i admire marcus more than any boy i know enthuses abby he sold the twentythousandpound painting by horse artist alf munnings his dad gave him for his twentyfirst to buy me a ruby engagement ring and he is a wonderful caring and tender lover but i hope one day that he rupert and sir roberto will be reconciled perhaps at our wedding there was a lot of guff about abby having slashed her wrist four years ago when she caught her agent and married lover cheating on her with his secretary but abbys certainly turned her career around just back from a wildly successful tour of spain next week its the appleton and she still dreams of taking her orchestra on tour to the us but marcus comes first sighs lappassionata his career is more important because were madly in love abby had never seen marcus really angry before how could you abby how fucking could you he yelled you know i never wanted to get anywhere on dads back and how could you say i flogged the munnings how dyou think dads going to feel and mum and youve totally buggered any chance i might have had in the appleton even if i get through the first round theyll say you pulled strings or rannaldini has and finally that fucking record you know how i feel about pop music he was blue in the face gasping for breath clinging onto the kitchen table dont you remember me warning you beattie johnson was dads mistress between marriages and his nemesis he went on furiously shes been trying to bring him down ever since she stitched me up too right screamed abby she never let on she was from the scorpion it was all off the record i thought she was a legit music critic or megagram wouldnt have given her an advance copy its their fault for telling her where i live its your bloody fault why dyou always blame everyone else i wanted people to know how good you are someones got to blow your own trumpet you wont by putting out some fucking pop record why the hell didnt you ask me because you knew id say no because i knew you needed the money abby was now hurling insults as if they were crockery im sick of having to pay for everything im sick of you wasting your energy on stupid pupils id quite like to be taken somewhere nice occasionally get a few flowers and chocolates the odd pin if it becomes a hit youll make a bomb bombs bloody maim and destroy people anyway why the hell did you give them that photograph she stole it without asking i only wanted to show her how beautiful you were there must be some reason im throwing myself away on a penniless wimp the telephone rang abby ran out of the room marcus picked it up so short of breath he could only croak hallo it was helen marcus steeled himself but his mother was surprisingly chipper abby had given her a very good press and had been quoted as saying marcus gets his looks from his beautiful mother shes very supportive of him and is the only member of his family he can relate to after all protested helen abby hasnt said anything that isnt true you and she are madly in love rupert has been fiendish to you all his life and given you no encouragement at all and everyone will buy the record now abby only meant it as a surprise everyone will understand it was just a bit of fun at the office christmas party and its wonderful publicity for both you and the rso i dont want to be a fucking pop star kiri and placido cross over didnt do them any harm youre overreacting dont excite yourself before the competition at least you and abby really love each other helens voice broke im sure rannaldinis got someone else he was checking his interflora bill but when i came into the room yesterday his hand shot down over it like a guillotine you shouldnt bloody well have married him howled marcus slamming down the telephone what was happening to him immediately it rang again it was the sun and then the mail then the express and then the whole of fleet street and soon the cars were crunching over the conker husks splashing up the path to woodbine cottage the only time i escape fucking tension is when i walk out onto the platform marcus yelled at a flabbergasted abby the rso the next day were almost as hostile management ie miles rewed up by hilly were horrified by the picture in the scorpion ghastly vulgar publicity he told abby furiously musical directors should not emulate page three girls any sense of gravitas is totally destroyed and miss priddocks been fielding calls from the tabloids all day then buy her some gloves and a baseball cap snarled abby the arts council were also appalled gwynneth was particularly disapproving because gilbert having bought his own copy of the scorpion seemed to spend an unconscionable time reading the headline the caption and the few lines of text flanking abbys naked boobs peggy parker and canon airlie had collective coronaries the rehearsals that day were even more acrimonious when abby came in to conduct tchaikovskys sixth every single player except hilary was hidden behind a copy of the scorpion and all started singing madly in love abby started yelling at them and things went from bad to worse if you dont get your act together after the break im walking out shouted abby good said old henry to everyones amazement whaddid you say he said good shouted nellie cant you get it into your thick head abby that without viking the pathétique is absolutely pathetic nor did abby get any help at home for a few days the press hung around like starlings settling noisily on a tree then just as suddenly they all flew off leaving the tree bare and bereft marcus retreated into his studio practising for ten or eleven hours a day until the pieces held no surprises for him he found it impossible to relax and kept a score beside him at mealtimes as a wall between him and abby unable to sleep since shed returned he had retreated at nights to the studio but was also getting up at first light to intercept the post in case a letter arrived from alexei the morning after the press took their departure he had heard dixies springer spaniel barking down at the bordello and knew the postman would reach woodbine cottage in a couple of minutes leaping out of bed he had hurtled across the lawn round the corner of the cottage slap into abby wrapped in a towel hoping for the miracle of a letter from viking both jumped guiltily i was hoping to hear from philadelphia mumbled abby i was hhhoping to hhhear from the record company in prague stammered marcus but all the postman produced was an ecstatic postcard from flora and the telephone bill which marcus pocketed instantly ill pay that youve picked up far too many bills recently anything to stop abby seeing the itemized calls to moscow come back to bed markie pleaded abby marcus shook his head ought to have a bath first i just fell into bed like a polecat last night oh ok if you feel like that abby retreated upstairs banging her bedroom door as marcus soaked in the last of floras bath oil he noticed a pale sun looking at him from the marble tiles on the right of the bath the tiles were picking up the suns reflection in the mirror opposite it gave marcus the creeps that the sun hovering unseen and in apparent innocence outside could watch him naked in the bath just like the press thought marcus with a shiver he kept hearing the collective rattle of himself and skeletons coming out of the closet he had made heroic attempts to be faithful to abby but five weeks ago alexei had sent him a pair of emerald cufflinks with just one sentence here are two green eyes of the monster who is jealous of anyone you even talk to and marcus had weakened and written back and alexei and he had been ringing up and writing to each other ever since finally when the rso was in spain marcus had flown out to prague for four days on the pretext of looking for a record deal but instead spending every second with alexei growing more and more hopelessly in love it was as though he had found a part of himself that had always been missing there had been a performance of the ballet don quixote on the second night and although marcus almost expired with desire and pride as he watched alexei bringing the prague audience over and over again cheering to their feet in stupified wonder he realized he loved the man not just the great star in a few years time alexei would have to give up dancing probably to become a wonderfully autocratic director but marcus wanted to be there to take care of him while he made the adjustment alexei on the one hand was still playing word games insisting art was more important than love and that he and marcus were owned by the world ballet devour your whole life but it didnt stop him trying to persuade marcus to leave abby it will be perfectly better for you to live in moscow weeth me but marcus wiped out once more by ecstasy and guilt had returned to england insisting they must never see each other again and alexei had stormed off in a fury accusing marcus of cowardice and hypocrisy it was this guilt that had made marcus react so strongly to the scorpion piece abby trumpeting fortissimo to the world of their passion for one another when he was totally fogged with love for alexei as he lay in the cooling water marcus noticed a bottle on the side for detangling hair if only it could detangle his life when he settled down to practise he was so tired that he kept making stupid mistakes much later as the light faded he went for a walk sibelius and scriabin followed him pouncing on gold leaves which were tumbling out of the wood the sun which had spied on him earlier was now huge orange and warming the slim bare limbs of the trees so beautiful freed of their clothing of leaves they reminded him of alexei he hadnt heard a word from rupert or taggie since the scorpion they were probably too outraged and saddened to get in touch how dare abby say helen was the only person he related to when taggie had always given him so much love and understanding ahead marcus could see the lights of the cottage abby must have come home early he found her still in her overcoat gazing hopelessly at a burntout kettle sobbing hysterically she collapsed against him im desperately sorry markie my foots like a colander ive shot myself in it so often ive just turned your eveningshirt blue putting it in the same wash as my scarf the fat controller was guesting at the rso for the next week she continued so she was pushing off to philadelphia to clinch the american tour i lied to miles that i was going to see mom hed be so fucking smug if the tour didnt come off and if it does i guess its the only way the orchestrall forgive me youd think it was me sacked viking anyway itll get me out of your hair and theirs you all need a break i need you to tell me what to do in the first round protested marcus but only to comfort her abby gulped youre the sweetest liar youll be far better on your own ill fly back on thursday morning and come straight up to appleton for the finals the next day arent you cutting it a bit fine said marcus in alarm abby was going to have to conduct six concertos its a hell of a marathon it wont give me time to be scared imagine five million viewers she was so tired it took her ages to pack dragging out her power suits with shoulder pads to impress the conservative and sometimes stuffy american cultural committees the cats kept getting into her cases she loathed the idea of them going to a cattery but at least theyd be together when at last she wandered across the moonlit lawn to marcuss studio the crowded stars were listening enraptured to the last joyful tumultuous bars of the schumann concerto you and i are going to play that together in the finals said abby massaging his shoulders some hope its tempting fate to work on it when i know i wont get that far did you know bennys entered and a mass of other seriously good people youll zap the lot of them you know rodney always sang to the life boats to the life boats during that bit in the last movement when every pianist wants to jump ship because its so difficult to cope with the crossrhythms play it again ill be the orchestra promise to sing it slowly marcus flipped back the pages i promise to the life boats to the life boats to the life boats sang abby faster and faster with marcus frantically scurrying to keep up until they collapsed in hysterical laughter for the first time in days until abbys laughter turned once more to tears make love to me marcus its been so long i need it so badly falling on each other they tried to eradicate the memories of viking and alexei for marcus it was as if he were attempting to quench a frantic thirst with great gulps of sea water at least he hoped he had satisfied abby she fell asleep in his arms immediately the studio was flooded with moonlight on her right hand clutching the pillow marcuss ruby glowed like a drop of blood burning through the floorboards under the bed were alexeis hidden love letters his rolex and the emerald cufflinks white in the moon the long road lies that leads me from my love thought marcus despairingly as abby slept he stole out of the studio and across the dewy lawn his heart pounding he didnt even have to memorize the code for moscow but there was no answer alexei must have found other arms appassionata sixth movement sixtyfour appleton a dark satanic mill town lay just west of the pennines with its grimy houses and factories spilling over the steep hillside as though someone had hurled a pot of black ink against a green wall the surrounding countryside was dotted with imposing victorian houses built by the old cotton manufacturers who found patronizing the arts in the nineteenth century a gratifying way up the social ladder the most imposing of these houses had belonged to the late lord appleton a great charmer and music lover who each year had invited a group of friends to play together over a long weekend on the last day the musician who by popular vote had pleased his companions the most was awarded five hundred pounds the comely welsh pianist blodwyn jones who won the prize at the end of the fifties became lord appletons much younger wife and when he died she joined forces with his inconsolable friends to found the appleton piano competition in his memory the appleton had become as prestigious as the leeds piano competition which took place every four years in august indeed fanny waterman the founder of the great leeds competition was a friend of blodwyn appleton and had advised her in the early stages lady appleton was well named she had a face as round rosy and sweet as a worcester pearmain and a nature to match although well into her sixties she was able to charm distinguished musicians to give their services for almost nothing this year the very international jury contained several piano teachers old trouts of both sexes including a romanian a latvian a vast ukrainian and a chinese who spent his time writing a biography of schumann from right to left on a laptop computer among the judges who still played in public was marcuss ancient admirer pablo gonzales who had arrived without his blond boyfriend others included bruce kennedy a cool laconic american and sergei rostrov a hotheaded voluble russian both great and famous pianists who felt they should put something back into music by sitting on the odd jury but who detested one another ernesto an italian who spoke little english and lili a greeneyed german were less good pianists both in their fifties they preferred to judge rather than be judged and were making a nice living thank you sitting on juries all over the world and bonking each other among the nonpianoplaying judges were a svelte french feminist who played the harpsichord and an irish contralto called deirdre oneill who had a winning cosy exterior which mostly disguised a pathological loathing of the brits no doubt exacerbated by a recent divorce from a weybridge stockbroker completing the pack were boris hermione and dame edith who because monica was in kenya awaiting her first grandchild had rolled up with monicas yellow labrador jennifer and surprise surprise rannaldini all the judges were staying at the prince of wales hotel in appleton high street the candidates on the other hand were housed at st theresas a local girls boardingschool situated about three miles out of town on the edge of the moors as the pupils had gone home for halfterm each contestant was allotted a tiny studybedroom marcus collapsed in hysterical laughter when he found the walls of his room covered in halfnaked posters of james dean and mel gibson outside in the park almost obscuring the view from his window was a magnificent chestnut tree which still held on to its reddy gold leaves across khaki fields crisscrossed with stone walls and bobbled with sheep marcus could see the lights of appleton in case by some miracle he reached the final he had brought his tails and the dressshirt which abby had turned pale blue in the washingmachine during a rather strained and stilted drinks party when the contestants stared at each other like cats marcus noticed benny basanovich black hair curly as a jacobs sheep surrounded by girls but paying particular attention to a voluptuous slav beauty with long sloeblack eyes soft drooping scarlet lips and large breasts that must be rannaldinis protegee natalia philipova marcus felt a surge of pity for his mother how could all the silicone implants in the world compete with that he thought savagely over an excellent dinner of steak and kidney pudding and a huge pie made from dark blue bilberries picked off the moor served with big jugs of cream the level of chat and laughter started to rise everyone then drew for position in the competition with fortyeight contestants to play the first round would take four days midmorning or midafternoon were best people who played first thing had to warm up the jury and the audience immediately after lunch was dodgy because half the jury would be sleeping it off by the end of the day everyone was irritable and tired marcus drew the very last number then had a nailbiting fourday wait on the first morning of the competition however all the contestants were expected to turn up at the small concert hall belonging to appleton university where the first two rounds were taking place to be officially welcomed by lady appleton the jury were already in position in the gallery including jennifer the labrador who was leaving blond hairs all over the shiny dark suit of the ukrainian judge marcus nearly fainted when he saw boris rannaldini and oh god pablo gonzales who was raising binoculars with a shaky hand to spy out the betterlooking male contestants only after the last winner had accepted her little silver piano had it been discovered that before the competition she had deliberately taken private lessons with most of the jury then further sucked up by writing them sycophantic thankyou letters this year lady appleton was taking no chances and kept the names of the judges under wraps to prevent them being got at before the competition after welcoming everyone and thanking the sponsors mr bumpus of bumpys scrumpy she stressed the importance of the jury not having any contact with the contestants i know many of you know each other but try and restrict yourselves to a little wave until after the final monocled and massive in prince of wales check dame edith promptly raised jennifers fat yellow paw and waved it at marcus finally went on lady appleton charmingly dont be frightened or discouraged if you go no further remember that every member of the jury was once knocked out in the first round of a competition i was not said a deep voice in outrage sorry except dame hermione laughed lady appleton now let us welcome our first candidate miss han chai from korea on went the jurors spectacles as the prettiest little ravenhaired teenager came dancing onto the stage with her pink skirts swirling and played debussy liszt and mozart with such proficiency and delight that she plunged every other candidate into despair bruce kennedy the great american pianist who always voted against the eastern bloc only gave her five out of ten technically perfect he muttered to dame edith but i dont figure shes experienced life if you want to see raw emotion whispered back edith whod given her six look at her teacher in the front row dont you agree boris boris who was sitting behind them gave a sulky grunt and added another semiquaver to the clarinets part in act two of king lear there was manuscript paper all over the floor and the seats on either side of him he supposed it would be construed as collusion if he enlisted marcuss help to put in the bar lines boris had only fallen under lady appletons spell and agreed to judge when he was plastered at some reception last year and was livid to be dragged away from work he wasnt remotely gratified that rachels requiem had now gone to number five and he was incensed that rannaldini had been given a suite at the prince of wales with a room next door for clive his sinister leatherclad henchman while he boris had only a dimly lit shoebox facing a grubby brick wall with no minibar hermione was even crosser than boris having promised her his full attention rannaldini had rolled up with a beadyeyed helen and then spent his time caballing for despite lady appletons strictures corruption was gloriously rife everyone particularly the eastern bloc indulged in tactical voting all the judges had been tempted by massive bribes dame edith was shocked to be offered three steinways a diamond necklace and a weeks holiday for two by the black sea dame hermione less so the only safe unbugged place for intrigue was the heated pool rannaldini who had the advantage of a magnificent sardinian suntan and fluency in most languages soon had wrinkled paws from dogpaddling with large lady judges their long grey hair swept up on top a few of the judges argued the whole time the rest were too terrified of rannaldini and making fools of themselves to put forward any forceful opinions this happened particularly after the italian contestant whom dame edith had described as a fairly goodlooking pig who unfortunately sounded as though she was playing with trotters turned out to be the daughter of ernesto the italian judge the strain of listening to music from nine in the morning until eight at night was telling on all of them the old trouts found it impossible to stay awake particularly after bumpys scrumpy and a large lunch as contestant followed contestant however stars were beginning to emerge most of the judges liked han chai none of them liked benny who had only entered because both howie and rannaldini had persuaded him certain victory would lift a sagging career benny on the other hand was very famous and rather good with judges claiming not only genuine frenchrussian parentage but also aunts from latvia romania china and ireland who when necessary became my favourite relation also much fancied was carl matheson a cheery bouncing texan with a terrific stage personality whod been told by his agent to leave his tails behind this was an old trick the contestant would then appear not to have expected to reach the final if he did and walked onto the platform in his plaid jacket or a too large borrowed dj the audience and jury would be touched by his modesty and humility and the fairy tale element of a ragstoriches win and mark him up accordingly dominating the candidates however was natalia philipova whod come a long way baby since two years ago in prague when rannaldini had advised her to give up the piano then relented and financed her private lessons now he was determined to make her a big star hence his tickling of all the old trouts in the swimmingpool and his waking them with a cattleprod when it was natalias turn to play he had chosen natalias first round pieces well liszts piano adaptation of tristran and a chopin sonata with a funeral march middle movement reduced everyone to tears howie had already signed up natalia but he was softpedalling the connection as he and rannaldini didnt want benny to go into drunken orbit a win from natalia would be that much more impressive and dramatic if she beat an established talent like bennys finally there was anatole a moody handsome russian and a marvellous pianist he was left handed which made him very strong in the bass and gave his playing a wonderful thunder his hair was the browny blond of newly laid parquet and like most eastern bloc players he wore cheap clothes shiny brown trousers plastic shoes and his freckled back could be seen through his thin nylon shirt but nothing detracted from his eruptive presence his deadpan face deep husky voice and occasional bursts of temper reminded marcus agonizingly of alexei howie who was gasping to sign him up had nicknamed him the prince of polyester anatole like all the other russians whod entered had been playing his firstand secondround repertoire and his chosen concerto in concert halls all round siberia for the last six months although aware he would probably go back to siberia for good if he didnt win anatole was far more interested in winning the local pub talent competition all the contestants reacted to pressure in different ways some paced before they played some took deep breaths or did yoga others stared into space some shook and sweated anatole kept throwing up then lighting a cigarette immediately afterwards marcuss fourday wait would have been a torment if every day a fleet of cars hadnt arrived to ferry the contestants either to the concert hall or to big houses in the area where they were offered a grand piano on which to practise marcus was sent to a darling old lady called mrs bateson whod been a friend of thomas beecham deciding marcus needed fattening up she baked wonderful cakes for him all her family rolled up and listened whenever he played but when they appeared at the hall to cheer him when his turn finally came they had great difficulty getting seats the place was packed with press chasing more copy on ruperts estranged son and abbys livein lover driven crackers by helens moans about natalia and rannaldini marcus was almost relieved to get onto the platform then started the liszt b minor sonata with an appalling crash of wrong notes helen boris pablo gonzales edith jennifer the labrador mrs bateson and all her family gave a collective groan of dismay marcus on the other hand thought sod it hed obviously blown it so he might as well enjoy himself on this wonderful piano whose tone was as soft and mellow as any burgundy covered in cobwebs in his fathers cellar forgetting the audience he continued to play the liszt so beautifully that the entire hall was in floods he then raced with all the insouciance of an olympic skier through balakirevs oriental fantasy which because of its racing octaves and chords is supposed to be the hardest piece ever written he then collapsed in a giggling heap the moment he left the platform i have never been so scared in my life by this time he had brought the hall to their feet to his amazed delight he went through to the last twentyfour the second round was even more of an ordeal for the judges consisting of long fiftyminute recitals if any of the candidates overran lady appleton was meant to ring a large bell but was often too kind to do so many of the contestants however had complained of the soft muddy tone of the piano in the first round so it was now replaced by one with a harder brighter sound the first day of the second round was also pablo gonzales eightieth birthday thinking it was a learned work of discography the big ukrainian judge brought him a copy of the guinness book of records pablo was henceforth so transfixed with interest that he did hardly any judging at all all the other jurors fought to sit next to him so they could wile away the tedious hours of bach and debussy reading about the fattest dog the largest elephant or the heaviest twins in history meanwhile the irish judge nicknamed deirdre of the drowned sorrows by dame edith was quietly getting through a good litre of red wine a day boris was getting through about the same but was a little happier having orchestrated a whole act of king lear the chinese judge had reached schumanns first signs of madness on his laptop jennifer had put on half a stone eating digestive biscuits the ancient latvian judge who had promised to vote for natalia after caballing in the pool with rannaldini had not fared so well and was now in bed with a head cold unlikely to make the final rannaldini was so enraged to have wasted so much time on her and even crosser when a grinning dame edith suggested jennifer should take the latvians place that he was reduced to bonking hermione in the lunchhour once again marcus was the last to play this time his agonizing wait was extended because natalia had insisted on finishing liszts dante sonata despite lady appletons bell and then complained bitterly about the brittle tinny sound of the new piano a piano tuner was subsequently summoned and after laboriously checking the piano announced it was in perfect order marcus bore this out by dispatching the bach busoni chaconne with exquisite clarity and warmth making the allegedly brittle and tinny piano reverberate like an organ the jury were entranced particularly by the accompanying drumroll from a lunchless hermiones tummy even such an intellectual piece becomes audiencefriendly under his fingers murmured bruce kennedy noone looks better in a dark suit than marcus sighed pablo the bach was followed by beethovens waldstein sonata which was going splendidly until the middle of the slow movement when marcus pressed down the soft pedal for the first time to add a little colour he then discovered to his horror that the pedal had jammed and as a result only two out of the three strings were being struck in the treble he was so thrown he momentarily lost his place and ground to a halt throughout the rest of the slow movement and the ravishing flowing rondo which was why marcus had chosen the waldstein in the first place he had to bash away like benny in an attempt to be heard at all by the jury in the dress circle convinced the piano had been got at marcus came off the platform in a whitehot rage and immediately complained to the waiting officials this was regarded as dreadfully unsporting natalia kicking up about a tinny sound was quite different to accusations of sabotage back came the piano tuner huffing and puffing when instruments are out of tune in an orchestra he grumbled everyone blames the musician when a pianos out of tune everyone blames the tuner and having taken the piano apart once more proved there was nothing wrong with it still utterly unconvinced marcus escaped from the uproar and the lurking press and stormed round the town square until shortness of breath forced him to collapse onto a hard bench opposite against a pinkyyellow evening sky was the town hall where he certainly wouldnt be playing on sunday im sorry alexei he muttered almost in tears ive let you down how could he possibly be a great artist who only belonged to the world when he couldnt even make the final of a piddling piano competition to his right was a statue of the first lord appleton examining a roll of cloth and with bird lime all over his frock coat and top hat what was the point of becoming famous anyway the press dumped on you when you were alive and pigeons when you were dead oh fuck fuck fuck sighed marcus meanwhile the judges had retreated into the jurors room to select the last six unimpeded by parents teachers agents and representatives from the various countries the contestants had retreated to the bar the consensus of opinion was that marcus had blown it although they always have a brit in the last six to pull in the crowds said benny snidely piano competitions however do not end with the presentation of the award and a cheque for twenty thousand pounds afterwards the winner is assured a couple of years engagements in the greatest concert halls of the world in the past winners had often had difficulty coping with this pressure the reputation of the appleton worldwide depended on choosing a winner who could reliability was therefore considered even more important than talent someone who would carry out these engagements without letting them down someone who wouldnt make mistakes in recordings rannaldini was soon at work influencing the jury regretfully he said winningly i must abstain from voting for my dear stepson marcus but speaking totally impartially although it pains me to do so i feel the boy did not project enough particularly in the waldstein where he gave a very flat twodimensional performance bollocks thundered dame edith he played exquisitely in the chaconne and in the first half of the waldstein he had something quite beyond the notes he had a memory lapse snapped rannaldini who now that he had dame ediths job didnt need to suck up to her any more probably just nerves snapped back dame edith she felt marcus should go through pablo and bruce kennedy agreed pablo said he would resign if marcus didnt the russian sergei deliberately voting against bruce kennedy said he would resign if marcus did the waldstein had no passion he agreed with rannaldini the boy was a veemp two of the old bids from poland and yugoslavia whod been chatted up by rannaldini and accepted promises of help from him for several of their pupils voted against marcus as well so did hermione because rannaldini told her to and deirdre oneill because she hated the english so did the vast ukrainian because he was voting tactically the ancient swedish judge who had only been kept awake after lunch by bennys banging and nodded off afterwards felt guilty hed slept through the chaconne and gave marcus an amazing ten out of ten the french judge loathed both rannaldini and sergei and had a crush on dame edith so she gave him nine lili voted against him because rannaldini pinched her bottom in the lift and promised her a concert in new york ernesto promptly voted for marcus because he was jealous of rannaldini so did boris which tied the score and a casting vote was needed blodwyn purred rannaldini lady appleton looked up from a long list warmup piano to be delivered seven outside broadcast vans to be parked seven microphones and thought her name had never been pronounced so seductively sorry maestro do you theenk marcus campbellblack should go through surely not said those compelling inquisitorial nightblack eyes yes said lady appleton her friend mrs bateson had said the boy was a genius taking jennifer for a widdle in the town square dame edith passed marcus gazing into space with such a look of desolation on his face youre through you chump she yelled and i agree that piano was got at all the favoured candidates han chai carl the jokey homespun texan anatole the moody russian natalia and benny had made it marcus was the only outsider a few tears were shed by the disappointed contestants lord gargrave on whose piano a brilliant german candidate had practised was so upset the poor fellow hadnt gone through that he invited him to stay on for a weekends shooting euphoric that they had two days off before the finals edith irish deirdre boris and pablo gonzales whod never had lancashire hot pot before dined together at the dog and duck on the edge of the moor if i see another pair of crossed hands i go cuckoo said pablo collapsing into a chair and handing his sticks to the waiter bloody awful dump that prince of wales said edith splashing red wine into everyones glasses lousy grub piddling rooms and a fax takes two minutes from kenya and half a day to get upstairs hows lear she asked boris nearly finished now i wonder what to do next wheech is the largest newt in the world asked pablo who refused to be parted from his guinness book of records probably me said deirdre who was already well away wheech is the fattest cat rannaldini said dame edith smothering a roll with butter im sure hes rigging the votes blodwyns such an innocent i voted for that german boy so deed i said pablo i even stop reading thees wondairful book when he play the prokofiev so did deirdre and i said boris he still didnt make it at least we all got marcus through said dame edith with satisfaction i didnt said deirdre stonily god protect me if i ever vote for a brit dont be unsporting boomed edith waving to the waiter for some more red you werent married to one snapped deirdre i nearly am thought edith even though she and monica were running up massive bills ringing each other every day she didnt believe it were possible to miss anyone as much the fax that had taken so long to get upstairs was monicas confirmation of their purchase of a cottage with a stretch of river in the west of scotland the prospect of monica in breast waders made ediths mind mist over and she herself would be able to compose full time she hadnt written anything she was really proud of since the persuaders in but she felt dreadfully guilty that like george hungerford she had sold her orchestra down the river for love once she had announced her absolute determination to retire the cco had been forced to look for a new musical director and had searched no further than rannaldini both orchestra and management had voted him in unanimously hes the only person who could ever take your place edith said hugo the bastard had seduced the lot of them with his alarming charm but if edith hadnt wanted monica and out so desperately she would have tried harder to dissuade them she was brought back to earth by deirdres grumbling lancashire hot pot is exactly like irish stew talk about another british ripoff very delicious though said pablo with his mouth full do you know which is most venomous snake in world rannaldini they all said in unison sixtyfive marcus was flabbergasted that hed got so far he was also ashamed how much he was enjoying himself the bracing northern winds seemed to have blown away all his worries and obsessions and more importantly his asthma he got on very well with all the other finalists and they had great fun on their two days off before the final sightseeing eating fish and chips playing pingpong and cheering anatole on in the pub talent competition marcus was relieved helen had temporarily shoved off to london he was also tremendously touched when the huge ukrainian judge took him aside as the contestant from the ukraine had gone out in the last round he no longer had a vested interest the majority of the jury he felt despite rannaldini were in reality rooting for marcus we vant you to vin but we theenk you must change to heavyveight concerto brahms one or two or rachmaninov three something more explosive more dramatic the schumann may be the graveyard of musicians but it sound very easy it ees not theatrical enough to impress jury or bring audience to their foots marcuss eyes filled with tears he felt the kind words had somehow come straight from alexei but beyond thanking the big ukrainian profusely he explained hed worked on the schumann so hed stay with it if there ees any chance to win zee english start to feel sorry for other contestants sighed the ukrainian the finals would take place on saturday and sunday with carl anatole and han chai playing their concertos on the first night and benny natalia and marcus playing on the second abby had rung marcus with a change of plan saying shed be leaving the states the next night and flying straight to manchester arriving in appleton first thing on saturday morning to rehearse with the first three finalists in the afternoon america abby told him had been terrific and it was even more terrific hed made the final the only problem i guess is that woodbine cottage has been burglarized thank god the cats were in kennels and they didnt take anything except the tv and the video although the cops fingerprinted floras vibrator what about my studio said marcus whod gone cold thinking of alexeis letters under the floorboards no nothing appears to be gone from there marcus was ashamed how relieved he felt to have another fortyeight hours without abby mrs bateson jubilant he had gone through cooked him roast beef yorkshire pudding and apple tart for lunch and gave him a little jet cat for luck you must really project on sunday she begged him youve no idea how absorbent the good people of appleton are when they crowd into the town hall on friday morning there was a press conference where naturally the attention focused on marcus im so knocked out to make the finals he told the journalists that as long as i play well on sunday i dont mind too much about winning in the afternoon the finalists were taken for a drive over the bleak but ravishing countryside which now flamed with bracken they ended up having supper in the dog and duck which was a quarter of a mile down the road from st theresas marcus whod been asked by lady appleton to keep an eye on anatole was having great difficulty keeping the russian sober he must go to bed early if he were to cope with brahms mighty first concerto tomorrow but anatole had got even deeper into the pub talent competition and wouldnt stop singing knees up muzzer brown with the landlord han chai had fallen in love with the homespun carl who still couldnt decide whether to play in his plaid jacket or a borrowed dj they sat holding hands drinking cocacola in the corner benny who had fortyeight hours to sober up before he played his concerto was knocking back bacardi and drunkenly propositioning natalia who looking at her watch was wondering if rannaldini was back from london and would somehow tonight infiltrate himself into her bedroom at st theresas like a cat burglar she quivered with desire noone had ever been so marvellous to her before the competition he had also given her some betablockers to calm her nerves and do see eef you can persuade marcus to have one before he plays but dont say they come from me sadly my stepson ates me and wouldnt touch them but i so long for heem to do well how could anyone hate rannaldini wondered natalia marcus sat ekeing out a glass of red still stunned at reaching the finals idly playing to the life boats to the life boats on the pub table wondering what had happened to the soft pedal on wednesday wishing he could feel more enthusiastic about abby arriving tomorrow across the pub he could see anatole thumping out you are my sunshine his eyes creased with laughter above the high cheekbones marcus felt hollow with longing for alexei it was several seconds before he realized the barman was shouting marcus campbellblack phone for marcus campbellblack marcus winced he had insisted on dropping the campbell for the competition but hearing his famous name people nudged and stared as he edged through the tables he had told alexei he never wanted to hear from him again but always when the telephone rang he prayed it might be him equally irrationally he had prayed all week for a goodluck card the telephone was in an alcove by the stairs the walls were covered with numbers hallo he picked up the receiver youll have to speak up theres a hell of a din going on here hi marcus i gather congratulations are in order on your engagement to abby rosen lucky sod when are you getting married hearing the whining thin ingratiating very common male voice marcus started to tremble who the hell are you its the scorpion ive nothing to say marcus was drenched in sweat we wanted to run a little story about you getting to the finals of the appleton abby must be knocked out itll be hard for her not to favour you marcus was about to hang up when the voice thickened and became even oilier almost lascivious with menace another thing weve got in our possession some letters to you written by alexei nemerovsky marcus couldnt breathe his crashing heart seemed to have filled his lungs and windpipe hallo are you there they make very interesting reading things were obviously pretty passionate between you particularly in prague when you broke the bed i dont know what youre taking about croaked marcus i never wrote any letters to alexei he never wrote any to me oh come come some of them are very poetic my little white dove lying warm and no longer frightened in my hands theyre fakes wheezed marcus pplease burn them my father and mother noone could be interested i think they could its very much in the public interest two household names like your dad and nemerovsky not to mention lappassionata lovely girl abby tried to top herself last time a man cheated on her think youve been quite fair to her no yes it must have been you who broke into the cottage oh christ he shouldnt have said that you dont have any right to publish those letters thats a matter for the lawyers were going with the story anyway we just wanted to give you the chance to put your point of view to us the voice became suddenly cosy the mental nurse about to hand over the valium were talking six figures im sure you could use the money no no marcus was frantic please burn them im not anyone important youre ruperts son mate said torquemada chillingly does he know youre gay marcus gave a sob and dropped the telephone leaving it clattering against the wall he was desperately fighting for breath perhaps it would be better if he did die choking sobbing he stumbled through the night back to st theresas he kept slipping on wet leaves and fell over twice fortunately the foyer was temporarily deserted marcus tried to ring alexei but there was no answer abby would be on the way to the airport by now rupert was at the czech grand national marcus had read it in the times that morning penscombe pride was running in the big race on sunday just to prove he wasnt past it where was helen marcus tried to gather his thoughts oh christ he couldnt tell helen crawling into bed pulling the bedclothes over his head gasping for breath fighting an advancing tidal wave of panic he waited for the dawn and the army of reporters who like a slavering pack of hounds would tear him to pieces how was he going to face abby helen and worst of all rupert as soon as it was light he got up and staggered into appleton to get the papers the temperature had dropped bringing winter the glowing horsechestnut tree outside his room had been stripped in a day like a burst pipe in a distant room he could hear the leaves rustling down in the park as he passed the lake there was a dull thud and a figure leapt up in front of him marcus cringed imagining a lurking reporter but it was only a heron rising with flapping wings like a biplane it carried a wriggling carp in its mouth im that fish but without its innocence thought marcus in horror it would be so much easier for everyone if he topped himself he had to stop every ten yards to get his breath he was wheezing like the kind of brokenwinded old chaser his father would have dispatched to the knackers as he reached a newsagents on the edge of town the gutters were full of beech leaves like rivers of blood in a garden opposite a large magpie strutted across the lawn selfsatisfied rapacious in its white tie and tails it was just like rannaldini bird of ill omen one for sorrow oh please mr magpie wheres your friend begged marcus oh god let the scorpion not have printed it you dont want to read that rag chided the newsagent as marcus picked up a copy its roobish good luck for tomorrow evening we recognize you from the manchester evening news said his wife used to love your dad when he were show jumping gasping his thanks stumbling out of the shop collapsing against a wall marcus fumbled frantically through the pages there was nothing thank christ maybe it had been some practical joke maybe theyd pulled the story no that reporter had known too much he was only in remission he tried to act normally but he was shaking and wheezing so badly when he finally reached st theresas that natalia persuaded him to take one of rannaldinis betablockers theyre terreefic for zee nerves i had one before both rounds carl matheson was worried by tendonitis i guess i better see a doctor before i rehearse this afternoon abby had stayed on an extra twentyfour hours in philadelphia to confirm the american tour so she could brandish the details as one glorious fait accompli in front of miles the board and shepherd denston nor could they winge about money the wonderfully generous us cultural committee coupled with american bravo records had agreed to pick up most of the bill we figured wed lost you to the uk for good abby the chairman had told her we all feel its high time you brought your orchestra home abbys eyes filled with tears every time she repeated his words always one track she had concentrated all her energies on the deal in a desperate attempt to forget viking but now it was clinched surely she could ask him back the americans would just adore him appleton looked particularly bleak on such a cold wintery morning but at least the huge begrimed town hall had been decorated by the flags of the nations in the finals abby was delighted an american had made it she hoped carl would at least come second she reached the prince of wales at ten oclock which would give her a few hours zizz before rehearsing beethovens third with han chai at twothirty there was a tray of red poppies for remembrance day in reception abby couldnt see her pigeon hole for messages the first asked her to call marcus at st theresas urgently the second wanted her to call the scorpion like hell she would the third was to call miles the rsos greatest coup for years was to be the orchestra chosen to play in the appleton most of the board had flown up to bask in reflected glory looking round the splendid suite for which the orchestra had forked out to enable her to give interviews abby decided she better ring miles first where the hell have you been it was his milesbelowzero voice weve got to talk cant it wait protested abby ive just checked in no im coming over abby kicked off her shoes and unpacked the long slinky purple velvet dress slit up one side which she had brought to wear that evening on the offchance that among the five million viewers viking might be watching she must get the housekeeper to press it shed have to snatch time to wash her hair after the rehearsal she hoped miles hadnt organized some elaborate press conference god she was tired but she mustnt show it although with three different concertos to rehearse and perform it was going to be one helluva marathon she rang down for some black coffee at once please miles looking almost svelte in a new beautifully cut pinstripe suit was accompanied by a bootfaced lord leatherhead when they both grimly refused breakfast abby asked when the orchestra was expected i cant wait to see them she crowed ive got such terrific news ive fixed up the most incredible american tour with record backing ok its gonna put us in the black and on the map then amazed by their still bleak expressions she continued theyre planning to stage a cotswold fortnight down the east coast theyre paying accommodation travel subsistence printing and publicity and all because they want me right abbys voice broke im gonna take my orchestra home youre not taking them anywhere said miles brutally youre fired they all jumped as the telephone rang abby snatched it up i cant take any calls but it was marcus frantically stammering gasping for breath on the verge of tears abby darling i wanted to tell you to your face but i had to get to you before the press do abby could hear the desperate wheezing whatevers the matter im gggay abby im dreadfully sorry alexei and ive been having an affaire the scorpion have got hold of our letters theyre going to print them theyll probably run it tomorrow im so sorry the colour drained out of abbys face her legs started to shake so violently she had to collapse onto the bed i dont believe it how longs this been going on about four months but weve only seen each other twice and its over now i promise you sonofabitch screamed abby banging her fist down on her bedside table scattering ashtrays and message pads twotiming me exactly like christopher did only wanting me for the dough you fucker why didnt you break it off instead of making a goddamn idiot of me god i hate you hate you hate you her voice rose to a hysterical scream but marcus couldnt breathe and couldnt answer so abby slammed down the telephone and sat shuddering on the bed clenching and unclenching her hands her eyes darting madly round the room lord leatherhead got a miniature brandy out of the fridge and poured it into a glass he wasnt enjoying this at all when the telephone rang again miles snatched it up it was the scorpion im afraid miss rosen has no comment to make said miles then ordered the switchboard not to put through any more calls the scorpion has already been on to us with the whole story he told abby bleakly it reflects disastrously on the orchestra first their musical director posing naked with a lover to promote a pop record beattie johnson stitched me up whispered abby she stole that photograph but you gave her the interview all that nauseating claptrap about being maaadly in love miles lingered lubriciously over the word hes loving this thought abby numbly then we learn he added silkily that youve both got other people and are only masquerading as lovers to push the record thats bullshit shouted abby i loved marcus im supposed to be marrying the guy i didnt know anything about him being gay youve hardly been a vestal virgin yourself and your orchestra are so nauseatingly avaricious it cant be long before one of them sells the story of you and viking to the scorpion im not having an affaire with viking hissed abby miles gave her a pained look of utter disbelief what about the night rodney died there are dozens of witnesses that was a onenight stand everyone was plastered hilary was there she probably shopped us to the scorpion it only happened once for chrissake i find that very hard to believe anyway its going to be all over the evening scorpion this afternoon and all the other papers will carry the story tomorrow bringing utter disrepute on the orchestra the one thing the press hate is being cynically manipulated i didnt manipulate them right abby was hysterical i genuinely believed marcus and i were getting married look he gave me this ring she held out her right hand a virtuous woman should have a price above rubies said miles sarcastically as he selected a granny smith from abbys fruit bowl hillys new diet had done wonders for his spots i was only pushing madly in love gibbered abby because the orchestra got half the royalties im afraid we dont want your er illgotten gains we had an emergency board meeting this morning said lord leatherhead gently there was a unanimous vote demanding your resignation i can see hilly voting me out but not bill thackery bills a good friend not so you would know it miles bit viciously into the apple hes never forgiven you for not making him leader after lionel left nor for giving his solo back to julian oh for chrissake you cant expect to conduct the orchestra with such a scandal hanging over you added lord leatherhead well honour your contract and pay you up to the end of february george is still chief executive he wont let you fire me having seduced a member of the orchestra almost half his age said miles fastidiously i hardly think george or his opinion would carry much weight i doubt either if hed be very interested he hasnt even had the manners to leave a telephone number but i cant let the orchestra down leaping forward abby clung to miless new lapels please please youve let them down enough already whos going to conduct them at such short notice but abby already knew the answer rannaldini has very kindly agreed to step into the breach said miles triumphantly sixtysix at st theresas marcus came off the telephone in total shock wheezing in short bursts like a frantically panting dog oh poor darling abby he must get to her and stop her killing herself he couldnt find his puffer hed never make it upstairs to inject himself with steroids noone was about to help him lurching into the common room he found the score of the schumann concerto open on the upright piano with all his instructions pencilled in but where hed scribbled ped for pedal someone in emeraldgreen ink had turned the word to pederast giving a choked sob frantically battling for the tiniest breath he stumbled into the hall out through the front door slap into a cameraman and a girl reporter its him the reporter proffered her taperecorder as casually as if it had been a packet of fags how long have you been having an affaire with nemerovsky but marcus blue in the face could only give desperate little whimpers stretching out pleading hands for help you sure its him said the photographer snapping away like a jackal more like some kind of deaf mute probably a ruse to fox us said the girl have you told abby yet marcus looks as though hes having an epi you ok mate the photographer lowered his camera ducking round them marcus collapsed with a crash on the stone steps christ someone better give him the kiss of life said the reporter dont touch him shouted the doctor whod arrived to treat carls tendonitis then taking one look at marcus hes having a massive asthma attack fortunately in his car he had a portable nebulizer a breath mask which delivered the drug marcus so desperately needed in tiny drops of damp air in an attempt to rally him the doctor also gave him a steroid injection but marcus was too far gone the blue had a purple tinge now his airways had closed up like one of simons oboe reeds and he was too weak and exhausted to draw in air through such minuscule holes the doctor had to make a lightning decision it would take too long to summon an ambulance appletons little cottage hospital only worked skeleton shifts at weekends marcus must be rushed the ten miles to northladen general you drive he ordered the cameraman as they laid marcus down in the back of his estate car ill look after him and direct you you telephone northladen intensive care and tell them hes going to need a ventilator he added to the reporter who is he anyway he asked as the cameraman used to chasing princess di round gloucestershire hurtled at a steady mph between high stone walls rupert campbellblacks son what dyou give his chances the reporter had kept on her taperecorder not a lot hes not responding at all poor little sod i wonder if hes been taking betablockers a lot of contestants do to calm the nerves fatal with asthma aware that they had a very important patient intensive care was already all stations go within seconds of his arrival to the accompaniment of bells and flashing lights a lifeless unconscious marcus had been laid on a bed and given an injection to paralyse him totally this was so that he couldnt resist the transparent tube which had been shoved down his throat and which was now pumping air and oxygen from a huge black box into his lungs christ muttered the anaesthetist glancing at the box to judge the extent of the resistance in marcuss lungs hes up to eighty is that bad asked the reporter who passing herself off as marcuss sister had infiltrated herself into the room lets say a normal persons between ten and twenty then catching a flicker of terror in marcuss staring eyes the anaesthetist put on a heartier voice its all right lad weve had to paralyse you only temporarily to keep the tube down your throat this is to sedate you so you dont fight against it and he plunged another injection into marcuss arm dont fret yourself well soon have you breathing on your own theyre lying to me thought marcus in panic ive had a stroke or ive broken my back falling over im going to be trapped inside this coffin of a body for the rest of my life oh please let me see alexei once more and he drifted back into unconsciousness marcus was sinking sister rose a pretty nurse from glamorgan sat by his bedside talking to him all the time in case he woke and panicked mozart piano concertos were being played to soothe him they had tried taking him off the ventilator for short spells but he had showed great distress and no sign of being able to breathe on his own we better alert his next of kin said the anaesthetist he doesnt seem to have any will to live he must have had some terrible shock what this was became evident when the piece on marcus and nemerovsky appeared in the evening scorpion as vicious as it was damaging spectacles misted up grey buns stood on end as every judge in the lounge of the prince of wales read the scorpion inside their copies of the daily telegraph and the the times although miles had issued a brief emollient statement that abby had resigned and been replaced by rannaldini it soon leaked out that shed been fired and had vanished without trace both the hospital and the hotel were besieged by reporters helen in a state of mounting horror sat beside marcuss bed as drips tubes catheters huge black machines and most of northladen general appeared to be fighting to save his life i know its difficult kindly sister rose gave helen a cup of tea but try not to show how worried you are its crucial that marcus is subjected to as little stress as possible to complicate matters rupert had taken off for a twentyfourhour break with taggie before the czech grand national and leaving no telephone number could not be traced the rso arrived in appleton already hot and bothered because miles in the latest economy drive had insisted they travel on coaches without airconditioning as they hung up their tails and black dresses in the town hall dressingrooms they learnt from a distraught charlton handsome that marcus was on the critical list abby had been sacked and rannaldini had taken over news that both outraged and terrified them in one maestro stroke rannaldini had virtually gained control of both the cco and the rso he was already cleverly infiltrating cco players into the rso instead of extras one of their fiddlers had replaced bill thackery on the front desk of the first violins nicholas when badgered mumbled something about bill being off with a frozen shoulder more likely been frozen out said dixie now lappassionatas been given the push rannaldini doesnt need bills vote any more nor does he have to put up with bills terrible sound quinton had moved up to first horn but the entire section was shocked to find the third horn seat had been filled by rowena godbold the ccos charismatic blond first horn couldnt you and i just merge with each other and forget about orchestras said quinton with a leer as he followed rowenas tightjeaned bottom up onto the platform blue on the other hand was totally unmoved sunk into despair his mobile had been switched on since the tour but cathie hadnt telephoned little han chai couldnt stop crying over marcus and was almost too upset to rehearse beethovens third her chosen concerto at first rannaldini was moderately accommodating announcing that northladen general had his mobile number and would ring if there were any change in marcuss condition but he was soon picking on individual players and talking sinister notes into a pocket computer that is a strange sound your instrument ees making he sneered at barry thats because it didnt have any time for lunch barry cuddled the sunburnt junoesque curves of his double bass defensively what does it eet for lunch conductors snarled barry but the laughter was nervous and uneasy never had the orchestra been more in need of viking to raise their spirits it was during the break that the rso clapped horrified eyes on the evening scorpion and realized that poor abby had not just been the victim of a coup détat but also since marcus had been outed of a homosexual conspiracy like many departed conductors she had suddenly become very dear to them they had only needed a rehearsal to remind them how much they loathed rannaldini they were also desperately upset about marcus as the bulletins grew increasingly bleak nor were they the only ones even those judges whod taken bribes and frolicked in the chlorine with rannaldini were deeply shocked that such an outstanding candidate should have dropped out nor was benny very happy as the odds shortened on natalia i want first prize rannaldini why mocked rannaldini are the others so bad i only entered because howie promised youd see me right benny couldnt face the humiliation of being beaten by a girl particularly one he had failed to pull woken fleetingly by the chorus singing fortissimo on a cd of mozarts requiem finding he couldnt move and forgetting hed been deliberately paralysed marcus thought hed already arrived in hell standing at the foot of the bed wafting maestro magnificent in white tie and tails the prince of darkness in person stood rannaldini of course he wont die he was reassuring a sobbing helen but his solicitous air was belied by the implacable hatred twisting his face seeing the panic in marcuss eyes and the reading on the ventilator rising sharply sister rose who was for once reluctant to go off duty hastily ushered rannaldini from the room i know youre worried but its best if he has one visitor at a time emerging from the hospital on his way to the town hall just when it would make a maximum impact and the morning papers rannaldini paused for a second of course i am standing by my stepson he announced smoothly eef by some miracle marcus pull through what matter eef he is gay so are many many of my closest friends i weesh i could stay longer but i cannot let down the three young people who play their concertos at the town all now eef youll excuse me and as clive and a huge black basketball player called nathan whod been roped in as an extra bodyguard held back the ravening paparazzi rannaldini slid into his black limo meanwhile on the steps of the town hall dame hermione was giving an interview to sky television as a very close friend of rupert campbellblack my heart goes out to him at this difficult time like horses on the tightest bearing rein rannaldini drove the rso through the packedout evening performance anatole played his brahms concerto magnificently and was heavily tipped to take the competition from natalia although carl in his plaid coat had brought warmth and almost folksy charm to the mozart e flat major far west on the coast of cornwall in their little cottage under the cliffs flora george and trevor had taken blissful refuge they had no telephone nor television and had read no papers for days flora in the nude had just sung where eer you walk to george but had got no further than the second verse because trevor had thrown back his head and howled and george had pulled her back into bed running the three of them up supper of rainbow trout chips and dom perignon flora suddenly remembered it was the first night of the finals at appleton and turned on the ancient wireless to listen to abby and her friends in the rso she was appalled to learn not only that abby had been ousted but also in the news bulletin that followed that marcus was sinking fast in northladen general the abandoned chip pan then caught fire and might have burnt down the cottage if george hearing floras wails hadnt rushed in and put it out rannaldinis pulled off that merger sobbed flora and marcus is dying of an asthma attack well fly oop to appleton at once george drew her into his great warm bearhug but you wanted a rest from the orchestra this is meant to be our honeymoon with you honeymoons last for ever all the papers on sunday morning ran huge stories about marcus fighting for his life helen keeping an allnight vigil rannaldini standing by and rupert nemerovsky and abby being untraceable the reporter whod caught marcus on the steps of st theresas was delighted with her scoop caring sunday scorpion in mercy dash said the headline back in rutminster cathie jones couldnt stop crying poor sweet marcus whod always been prepared to accompany her poor blue so soon out of a job poor abby whod been so kind carmine would probably be fired too rannaldini wouldnt tolerate such bolshiness cathie trembled at the thought of her husband at home all day with noone to kick but herself as christmas presents she was planting some indoor bulbs laying them out in neat piles on the kitchen floor white bulbs called carnegie to remind julian of carnegie hall pink bulbs for abby blue delft of course for blue the damp bulb fibre squelched in her hands like chocolate cake mix as she put it into the blue chinese bowls she had bought for fifty pence each at the local market tiger the cat had just strolled up to inspect these impromptu earth boxes any moment hed bound through the piles of bulbs mixing up the colours gathering up the blue delfts she hid them beneath the damp fibre like me burying my love for blue she thought despairingly there were always things to do in the autumn to make winter bearable when the bulbs came up probably not in time for christmas their sweet smell would be a reminder of bluebells in the summer blue bowls blue bulbs bluebells how would she ever get through the winter without him boris couldnt sleep desperately worried about his little friend marcus and kept awake by the lorries still rattling down appleton high street suddenly he was roused by a terrible crash it must be burglars trying to steal the finally completed lear switching on the light boris found that the glass rack had fallen off the wall into the wash basin smashing everything including his halffull bottle of whisky and the aramis marcus had given him for his birthday he couldnt see lear anywhere and rushed in panic out into the passage where he bumped into deirdre who had also been woken by the crash having located the manuscript under his pillow deirdre who was wearing a red satin nightgown invited boris back to her room for a nightcap you know id never vote for a brit she told him fiercely but im sorry your friend marcus cant make it for a second marcus thought he had gone to heaven when he briefly regained consciousness and found sweet sister rose smiling down at him shed just returned from the dayshift with a pile of cds if anyone could make him heterosexual heres something to cheer you up she whispered the next moment prokofievs introduction to romeo and juliet poured into the room seeing the tears sliding out of marcuss eyes into his hair rose realized her mistake oh help im sorry nemerovsky danced that at rutminster didnt he turning off the cd player she took marcuss hand i was in the audience my boyfriend and i took the coach all the way down to rutminster to watch him hes such a hero i understand why you love him she gave marcuss fingers a squeeze theres nothing wrong with being gay you just need to accept that there isnt only one way to be in life sixtyseven at the start of the afternoons rehearsal with benny and natalia the orchestra enraged rannaldini by waving save the rso banners and all wearing hastily printed viva lappassionata tshirts miles rushed up in a frenzy take those bloody things off to which nellie promptly obliged showing off splendid duotanned breasts how could you nell stormed militant moll i think rannaldinis rather sexy pouted nellie if you collaborate nellie nicholson hissed candy well shave all your hair off by the time theyd changed into less subversive gear blue noticed that cyril whod been knocking back bumpys scrumpy at lunchtime was missing blue was about to send lincoln to find him when yet another highly embarrassed french horn player from the cco slid into the fourth horns place wheres cyril knickers shouted blue knickers was too distraught to answer if rannaldini kept feeding in extras hed be out of a job cyrils been sacked said rannaldini coldly for the second day running he was drunk when he arrived at the hall said miles sanctimoniously blue rose to his feet im going too then sit howled rannaldini there were demanding solos for the second horn in both the evenings concertos dont talk to me like barbara woodhouse snapped blue then all the colour ebbed from his face as his mobile rang only cathie knew the number with a trembling hand he switched it on blue my darling im leaving carmine she had piled the children the ducks the hens tiger the cat and all the bulb bowls into the car go to the bordello mrs diggorys got the key said blue softly theres plenty of whisky and tins in the larder and lots of catfood the ducks and hens wont hurt in the kitchen till i get there ill be as quick as possible i love you yippee yelled blue as he switched off his mobile yippee momentarily roused out of their despondency the rso looked at him in amazement where are you going screamed rannaldini over the hills and as far away as possible said blue im not playing your fucking concert then youre fired good you can send on my redundancy money is blue drunk too whispered cherub in awe to davie buckle only with appiness said davie ruperts and taggies romantic fortyeighthour break in an ancient castle high up in the czechoslovakian forests had not been a success taggie had had a punishing eighteen months anyway looking after bianca and coping with xav undergoing a final and completely successful operation to straighten his eyes she had then had to keep him quiet and happy during his convalescence but she had had a far more difficult task trying to soothe rupert as he became increasingly outraged and miserable over the defection of both marcus and tabitha although he had been far too proud to approach either of them abbys interview with beattie in the scorpion had destroyed him although again he wouldnt admit it rupert on the other hand was aware that he had been giving his sweet wife a rotten time and had insisted they went away for a break without bianca and xav he was then appalled how much he missed them theyre bloody well coming with us next time he told taggie as the helicopter landed on the racecourse at pardubika and marcus and tabitha too taggie wanted to plead but she didnt want to set rupert off before a big race the course itself resembled the park of some great house with massive beech hedges yew colonnades long lakes and banks acting as fences goodness they looked massive the off for the czech grand national was in an hour and a quarter rupert went straight to check on penscombe pride whod spent the night in his large luxurious dark blue lorry but before he could look at the horse dizzy his head groom beckoned him up the steps into the livingroom area of the lorry thank god youve come whats the matter its not pridie you better see this im sorry rupert but the press are everywhere rupert took one look at yesterdays evening scorpion on the front page was a startled wideeyed photograph of marcus at his most delicately beautiful ruperts son is gay said the huge headline it was as though hed always known it so he turned on dizzy and flora seymours just rung from appleton stammered dizzy quailing in the blast of such icecold rage she says marcus has collapsed with the most dreadful asthma attack hes in intensive care at northladen general helen didnt want you to be bothered but i think hes really really ill hes been on a ventilator for twentyfour hours hes had to pull out of the piano competition dizzys voice cracked she had known marcus since he was three hed always been such a kind gentle little boy flora left a number she added well get her for fucks sake having taken in the caption nemerovskys little white dove rupert skimmed the frontpage copy gay deceiver marcus campbellblack pretended to be straight to woo millionairemaestro abby rosen after his superstud dad rupert cut him off without a penny but all the time marcus was cheating on his lovely fiancée with megastar ballet dancer alexei nemerovsky continued on pages ripping the pages in his fury as he found the place rupert discovered other headlines the stately homo lappassionata flees red in his bed a principal with no principles above huge photographs of himself abby and alexei there was even a picture of woodbine cottage with a caption fag cottage irrationally rupert wondered how nemerovsky felt about getting fourth billing his eyes seemed to fill with blood he felt a thrumming in his head heres flora for you nervously dizzy pulled him back to earth i think hes dying rupert floras voice was shriller than ever with anxiety the hospital are worried stiff although theyre keeping up a pretence that his condition is stabilized i know youve had a row but marcus really really loves you he did everything for your sake all that mattered to him was you not thinking hed been an utter failure as a son i hardly think this latest escapade oh shut up let me finish he never betrayed you with rannaldini he tried to stop helen marrying him and hes refused ever to speak to rannaldini since then hes too loyal to you hes utterly utterly honourable please go to him im not having anyone dictating flora lost her temper people who live in bloody glass historic houses shouldnt throw stones if you hadnt carried on like a rabbit when marcus was a child causing scandal after scandal what did you do in the circulation war daddy and given him the tiniest bit of support he wouldnt have needed to search out fatherfigures like malise or nemerovsky have you finished hissed rupert yes but please go to him its the one thing that might save him what the fuck else do you think i was going to do its room twentyfive on the second floor said flora and hung up the dearest and most precious horse rupert had ever owned and trained was about to run in the most treacherous and demanding race in the world most people thought pridie was past his best and should not be subjected to such an ordeal nor had worry about this helped ruperts and taggies romantic break dizzy had told taggie about marcus rupert was ashen as he came down the steps of the box taggie ran to him holding him in her arms feeling him rigid with shock oh darling poor marcus poor you we must go to him what else can we do said rupert bleakly then turning to dizzy tell the pilot to refuel pridie whickered with relieved delight at the sight of his master and nearly pulled sandra the stable girl over as he bounded down the ramp he had been bred at penscombe and had never run a single race without rupert having given him a couple of polos rupert quickly felt the little horses legs praying he could find some swelling or heat to give him an excuse to pull him but they were perfect and pridies coat gleamed in the soft autumn sunshine redder and brighter than any of the rso cellos briefly rupert hugged his old friend were going to have to cope without each other pray for me pridie taggie felt utterly helpless on the flight home as rupert glared unseeingly out of the window tension flickering like lightning around his jaws only once did she try to tempt him with a large whisky but he shook his head violently its probably just a oneoff with nemerovsky she stammered hes so powerful and glamorous anyone would find him difficult to resist lots of people have flings what the fuck do you know about it snarled rupert gazing through the dusk down at the white horses flecking the english channel nnothing well shut up then he could be bisexual one affaire doesnt mean hes gay course he is always has been taggie gave up oh dear god she thought please dont let him be horrible to marcus back at appleton town hall the judges after a jolly rest day visiting deliuss old haunts in nearby yorkshire and enjoying a long lunch at the famous box tree restaurant in ilkley were looking forward to a boring untaxing evening although benny would pull out the stops and wow the audience tonight most of them had already chosen either anatole or natalia as the winner but with only two contestants this evening the edge had gone out of the competition the bleak bulletins from northladen general had cast a shadow over the proceedings they all felt poor marcus had been very shabbily treated after all as dame edith had pointed out noisily at lunch everyone knows there are only three types of pianist jewish gay or bad the scorpion and all the rest of the press they agreed were making a ridiculous fuss lucky lucky nemerovsky sighed pablo gonzales rather nice for helen to have a gay son said dame hermione with her head on one side theyre always so devoted to their mothers sevenfifteen benny had been to makeup and could be heard by the entire audience warming up in a practice room the great clock of the town hall had been stopped for two hours to prevent it tolling during performances time would stand still but hopefully the whole contest would be wrapped up by ten oclock in time for the news as benny left the practice room rupert gave his third police car the slip hurtling a hired mercedes through the driving rain towards northladen general a whiteknuckled taggie nearly bit her lower lip in half trying not to cry out in terror meanwhile in room twentyfive on the second floor marcus tried not to exhaust himself as desperately slowly he put on black evening trousers and the crumpled blue dressshirt which he had pulled out of his suitcase which his mother had brought him from st theresas he had waited feigning sleep until she had left for the town hall helen had sat with marcus through the night and morning until he miraculously regained enough strength in his lungs to come off the ventilator when the effects of the paralysing drug and sedatives had worn off and he was able to swallow again she had even fed him some pale tasteless scrambled eggs but he was acutely conscious that she couldnt meet his eyes and was dreadfully embarrassed to be in the same room with him noone had let him see the papers although helen had told him rannaldini had replaced abby but her face had said it all for now her ewe lamb wasnt going to die the other two nightmares had enveloped her life her husband was a compulsive womanizer and her son was a homosexual his career in smithereens there was also a deepseated guilt that her obsessive clinging love might have caused both these things if only malise was still alive rannaldini had been sympathetic but always at ruperts expense if rupert had not been a sadist you wouldnt have had to compensate so much marcus never had a father to relate to you always implied rupert and billy lloydfoxe were unnaturally close and even more so rupert and lysander its in the genes you mustnt torment yourself this situation suited rannaldini perfectly marcus had been the only serious threat to natalia in the competition and with helen cemented to marcuss sickbed and unhinged with worry he had had all the more opportunity to spend time with natalia he had virtuously resisted from making love to her after her rehearsal in case it relaxed her muscles too much before the final but between chatting to northern television and escorting benny onto the platform rannaldini found time to slip into natalias dressingroom how adorable the sweet child looked with her shining hair in rollers thees is how i warm up he said sliding his soft newly manicured hands inside her willowgreen silk dressinggown oh the wonder of those large springy young breasts helens silicone replicas were like two buns on a cake rack since she had fretted away so much weight good luck my maestro whispered natalia resting her spiky head against his starched white shirtfront i am safe when you are ere tonight promised rannaldini we weel drink champagne together from the appleton cup the rso stopped tuning up and gave a great shout of relieved joy as george walked into the hall with flora they both looked very tired from worry about marcus but their glow of happiness in each other and in his recovery seemed to light them from inside and set them apart from the blacktied taffeta and satin audience around them neither of them had bothered to pack much when theyd leapt into the helicopter george was now wearing a blazer a blueandwhitestriped shirt and no tie because flora had borrowed the only one he had brought to belt in his dark blue shirt which she had also annexed arent they glamorous sighed clare im sure floras pregnant hissed candy look how her boobs have grown the big smile of pride was wiped off georges face when he saw miles hilarys mother gilbert gwynneth mrs parker and lord leatherhead all huddled together looking wrongfooted in the stalls youve been bluddy busy in my ubsence said george not lowering his voice at all id like to remind you that im only taking a sabbatical and im still chief executive of the rso and you and your fancy piece miles hilarys mother turned purple better hop it as youre sitting in our seats to the left of the stage the flags of the five participating finalists soared to the dark blue vaulted ceiling if only the union jack had been up there as well thought helen despairingly as she huddled in dark glasses in the middle of the stalls behind the orchestra rose a huge far from portable redandwhite organ flanked by two proud unicorns holding up the red rose of lancashire above them two angels held out a scroll saying the truth is great and shall prevail there were gasps of admiration as rannaldini in his blackandwhite splendour swept on and mounted a rostrum a foot higher than usual so everyone could see him the great prevailer he smiled down at bennys shock of dark curls he knew exactly how to wrongfoot the foolish frenchman to natalias advantage his two bodyguards clive and nathan the black basketball player stood watchful at the back of the hall rannaldini was taking no chances as the clock started on the monitor the vast audience went quiet five four three two one the camera panned in on the little silver piano which would be awarded to the winner the last round of the appleton piano competition live from the town hall was under way sixtyeight the press swarming round the hospital were thrown into a frenzy by ruperts totally unexpected arrival particularly when he screeched to a halt in a muddy puddle drenching the lot of them whats the latest rupe is the kid going to be ok terrible shock for you they closed round him howd you feel about him being a woofter wrath gave rupert superhuman strength as he barged a gangway through for himself and taggie he had more trouble fighting his way through the barricade of outraged medics helen had left tearful instructions that if in the unlikely event rupert rolled up he mustnt be allowed to see his son its the one thing that really triggers off marcuss asthma ruperts got a terrible temper ill only be gone a couple of hours hes not allowed visitors he must be kept quiet im afraid noone can see him the pleas and then orders fell on deaf ears as rupert stalked through the lot of them he loathed hospitals the smell and glaring whiteness instantly brought back poor little xavs countless operations and taggie nearly dying twice when she miscarried it also took him back twentytwo years to helen also nearly dying giving birth to marcus a sickly carrotyhaired baby who from the start had never endeared himself to rupert finding the lift blocked by a massive matron rupert dodged round her and ran up the stairs with taggie panting after him three doctors pretty sister rose and two male nurses barred the door to room twentyfive i really must insist you dont go in there fuck off once more rupert parted them a bowling ball through skittles then he turned on a panting taggie stay outside i want to see him on my own id like to be with you pleaded taggie this is my problem snarled rupert that is the handsomest angel of death ive ever seen sighed sister rose expecting to find marcus unconscious and a mass of tubes rupert was astounded to see him sitting on the bed buttoning up a blue dressshirt his red hair hung lank and darkened by sweat to the colour of a copper beach his deathly pallor was tinged green by the fluorescent lighting his huge frightened eyes were black caves as though he could see deep into his own tortured soul dddad i thought you were at the pardubika marcus leapt to his feet cringing against hideous yellowandorange curtains waiting for the firingsquad invective for a second rupert gazed at him reminded of the only time hed gone stag hunting appalled by the terrified eyes of a little doe trapped against a huge wall he had been too late to call hounds off before they ripped her to pieces im really really sorry gasped marcus rupert shrugged its the way youre made campbellblack libido has to come out somewhere i guess sorry i havent been any help been meaning to ring you for months ever since you sent tag that mothering sunday card that was just after id met i wanted to see you oh dad for a minute marcuss lip trembled then he stumbled forward and for a brief moment he and rupert embraced passionately relieved the boy was all right rupert patted his desperately bony shoulder you poor little sod then as marcus halflaughed added oh god that wasnt very tactful get back into bed marcus shook his head im going to play dont be ridiculous but marcus stood his ground you won a gold with a trapped nerve if i dont crack it now i never will its the only way to throw off the stigma of being abbys walker alexeis catamite and rannaldinis stepson and my son too said rupert wryly look therell be other competitions its crazy to risk it when youve just pulled through thats why i pulled through would you terribly mind ringing the town hall i dont think they will let me use the telephone here just tell them i want to go on and ill be there in half an hour finding it difficult to breathe and talk he slumped onto the bed bennyll just be starting the second movement he smiled slightly and cupped his hand round his ear i can hear him now my tailcoat needs a press and a brush but someone can do that at the other end and could you get me a taxi because i dont think the hospital would do that for me either ill take you if youre really set on it marcus nodded unable to speak overwhelmed by ruperts totally unexpected acceptance then he muttered youve missed the pardubika im terribly sorry blood is thicker than water jumps said rupert getting out his mobile all hell broke out as the doctors frantically tried to dissuade marcus its insanity they berated rupert the pressure could kill him hes desperately weak and he needs to go on the nebulizer again in two hours time sometimes the mind reaches out and the body follows youve pushed him into it he has not protested marcus unearthing the score of the schumann from the bedside cupboard and swaying at the sudden rush of blood to his head as he stood up someones got to fight abbys corner she should neverve been fired you realize were not responsible if he insists on discharging himself boomed matron blocking the entire doorway the discharge of the heavy brigade said rupert bodily removing her from marcuss path taggie was hovering in the waitingroom on the way to the lifts with an undrunk cup of tea in her hands her eyes were very red marcus went straight into her arms its so lovely to see you they cried rupert put his arms round both of them but just for a second come on we mustnt be late the only concession the hospital made was to smuggle them out of a sidedoor panic gripped marcus the moment he was installed in the back of the car as they hurtled through the night rain lashing and clawing at the windscreen he took great gulps from his puffer and under a pallid overhead light desperately riffled through the score which seemed terrifyingly unfamiliar what were all the pitfalls he hadnt touched a piano for two days with abby the orchestra would have seemed familiar but rannaldini would take everything much slower or much faster whipping the orchestra up to an unnatural frenzy rannaldini also despised schumann as an overromantic wimp thank god neither rupert nor taggie talked although marcus noticed his fathers hand sliding over taggies whenever he entered a straight piece of road as they reached the outskirts of appleton the reflections of the orange streetlights shivered like carp on the shiny black cobbled streets breathing in the conflicting wafts of hamburgers curry and fish and chips marcus retched ruperts mobile rang it was northern television howyer doing can you make it by eightthirty then marcus can warm up during the interval everyones knocked out hes coming on most of the space round the hall had been taken up by the seven ob vans and the cherryred rso lorry but rupert got them as near the artists entrance as possible the only other stumblingblock was a river of damp press who immediately turned into a frenzied whirlpool christ its rupert shouted the daily express looks as though hes made it up with the lad dangerous bugger warned the mail watch out spect rupert forced him to go on said the mirror what dyou feel about your sons affaire with nemerovsky rupert rupert looked the reporter up and down about to tell him to get stuffed then he changed his mind shows nemerovskys got extremely good taste you dont mind having a gay son asked the sun in amazement briefly rupert put an arm round marcuss shoulders the rain falling through the rays of the streetlamps casting a speckled light on his haughty expressionless face ive got a son with enough guts to discharge himself from hospital and face the toughest ordeal of his life he drawled im very proud of him his sexual preferences as long as they bring him happiness are quite immaterial what about his engagement to abby much better they both found out before they got married do you know where abby is no nemerovskys got a terrible trackrecord arent you worried about aids asked an evillooking blonde ruperts face suddenly betrayed such hatred everyone shrank back if hed slept with you beattie he said icily id worry about something much worse than aids the surrounding journalists laughed nervously are you disappointed about the czech grand national asked the times rupert stopped in his tracks incredible that hed forgotten all about it in his race from the hospital its a snip won not penscombe pride said the telegraph lysander broke a shoulder pridie fell at the last fence for a second ruperts face clenched in horror then he said lightly but marcus wont and they were through the swingdoors i said he was a dangerous bugger grumbled the mail trying to make his biro work on a rainsodden page its his son whos the bugger hissed beattiejohnson awfully good of you to show up martin said an earnest woman in a billowing grey jersey brandishing a clipboard as she scuttled up to them on spindly redstockinged legs she looked like a turkey im chrissie she shook marcuss hand our presenter james verekers going to announce youre participating just before natalia philipova goes on means the competitions wide open do you need anything ironed i expect youd like to see your dressingroom before you warm up martin and then go to makeup but if james vereker could have a brief chat first james can have it afterwards martin needs to distance himself said rupert firmly as he relieved her of the dressingroom key come on martin marcuss laughter almost turned to tears as he saw the save the rso sticker on his door and the hundreds of cards and great banks of flowers waiting for him inside we were going to send them over to the hospital when we had a mo said chrissie apologetically marcus suppressed a flare of hope that one might be from alexei but there was no time to look could you bear to open them he asked taggie as he was pouring with sweat he tugged off his jersey then turning to rupert said i dont mean to be horrible but could you possibly keep mum away while i warm up tripping over cables climbing round petulant rankandfile fiddle players james vereker the presenter reached the rostrum having smoothed his streaked blond hair and straightened his peacockblue tie which exactly matched his eyes he said he was so very very pleased to announce that the british contestant marcus campbellblack would be taking up his place in the final after all over a burst of applause he shouted that marcus would be appearing after a further tenminute interval which would take place after natalia philipovas concerto the jury would then try to reach a decision during the ten oclock news and the scheduled programme on the male menopause of daniel deronda would be postponed to a later date like petrolignited flames excitement crackled around the hall cherub dropped a cymbal in his excitement the orchestra gave a great cheer only halfinduced by the fact that this would push them into overtime journalists were fighting to use the telephones with members of the audience frantic to reorganize restaurant bookings and pickup times and to check on last buses and trains the atmosphere had become electric people were hardly back in their seats when a thunder of applause greeted the arrival of rannaldini and natalia on the platform with a blacktie audience an orchestra in their tails and black dresses tend to look less distinctive and blend into one black whole nothing therefore could have stood out better than natalias poinsettiared taffeta dress which emphasized her small waist her lovely white arms and shoulders and her shining dark curls showing off her glorious cleavage she proceeded to bow several times to the judges in the gallery and the jampacked audience who were now well oiled by drinks in the interval benny had impressed but not entirely captivated bet rannaldini paid an arm and a legover for that dress muttered dixie marcus and helen had not been the only people to clock rannaldinis preference it was plain from the start that the ntv cameras were more besotted with natalia even than rannaldini as she delivered rachmaninovs third with an explosion of romantic passion the cameras hardly left her beautiful face whether she was smiling seraphically or whether her big scarlet mouth was drooping and her eyes closing in anguish during the sad bits swinging round fondly rannaldini followed her every note making sure phrases flowed into each other slowing down if she looked like falling over herself quietening the orchestra if there was any danger of her being drowned the brass section have at last learnt the meaning of the word pianissimo whispered flora in georges ear dont you absolutely loathe loathe loathe rannaldini george took her hand his jealousy instantly doused he had been thinking how satanically handsome the bastard looked as his hands languorously cupped and stroked the air and wondering how flora could possibly not still carry a torch for him gazing at her furious freckled profile only slightly softened by red tendrils still damp from the shower george marvelled yet again that his love seemed to double by the second and hes making it so bloody easy for that little tart hissed flora we cant let him take over the rso be kwyet whispered peggy parker furiously resplendent in puce velvet to match her face she was sitting beyond george she turned even pucer when she saw trevors little furry face emerging from floras dark blue shirt to lick his mistress on the chin mrs parker was however feeling considerable disquiet particularly as natalia reached the end of the second movement and the cameras panned lovingly on to the snowwhite handkerchief with which she wiped both the damp keys and her sweating fingers more like the rannaldini and natalia show chuntered lord leatherhead who was furious with miles for cancelling the rso bottledwater account when are we going to see some shots of the orchestra i agree hissed mrs parker clare and candy nellie and juno noriko and hilly are just as pretty as that czech and cherubs much prettier than rannaldini volunteered flora think that chap may be too overbearing for the rso muttered lord leatherhead in the row behind them gwynneth who was reviewing the competition for the guardian and gilbert for the independent were busily scribbling the last time they had heard rach three was in rutminster when only marcuss tenacity and presence of mind had saved abby and the rso from total calamity how different it was tonight not since toscanini wrote gwynneth who had a megacrush on rannaldini not since eileen joyce wrote gilbert who had his operaglasses trained on natalias bosom they both felt a huge satisfaction that they had been so instrumental in effecting the merger there would be no more bum surprises on moulin rouge canon airlie who should have sat next to gilbert had flu so miles had bagged his seat wearing a new dj specially run up by rannaldinis tailors miles craned round the piano to gaze at hilly she looked so lovely in her new diamond brooch another present from rannaldini he was glad marcus was playing the schumann which had a wonderful clarinet solo the last movement of the rachmaninov was a triumph it seemed impossible that natalias little hands could possibly cover all the notes playing with hardly a pause probing the depths of hell in the bass shaking out shoals of silver coins in the treble she galloped to a triumphant finale which was followed by an even more triumphant burst of applause rannaldini looking like a cat whod swallowed the canary isles made sure she got even more callbacks than anatole he was not pleased hurrying her back for a fourth time when the applause had almost petered out to go slap into julian bringing the orchestra off the stage the bars were crowded out but the consensus was that not even the stormy splendour of yesterdays russian nor the american whod played mozart so heartwarmingly could possibly beat natalia charlton handsome and ntv technicians were now reassembling the stage and readjusting microphones for the smaller orchestra needed for the schumann carmine jones who wanted to know if hed won the lottery was livid not to get cathie on his mobile marcus had been buoyed up by the sudden miraculous rapprochement with rupert but alone with the upright piano in the practice room he was overwhelmed with the impossibility of his task his fingers were rigid and inflexible yet slipping all over the keys even though rupert had made him put his jersey back on again he couldnt stop shaking his body encased in icy sweat even worse he was having increasing trouble breathing he looked at the plaster on the back of his hand where the drip had gone in how terrible if he had held up the competition for forty minutes only to have a memory lapse or even worse another asthma attack and let everyone down the piece seemed hideously unfamiliar and on stage he would have no score to help him he must relax make his mind blank take slow deep breaths sometimes the mind can take the body into impossible terrain wasnt that what rupert had promised the storm of hurrahs and bravos for natalias obviously sensational performance had long since died away hed be on soon our father began marcus which art in heaven what came next unable to remember he started to panicwhich art in heaven forgive us our trespasses oh alexei alexei for a second he banged his head against the top of the piano wiped out with longing he must concentrate frantically he leafed through the score to the last movement singing to the life boats to the life boats in a breathless tenor he tried to match the frantically syncopated piano part as he groped for a handkerchief to wipe his hands mrs batesons little jet cat fell out he mustnt let her down either the next moment he jumped violently as helen barged in marcus darling you mustnt go on dr brewster says it would kill you its insanity mum perlease i need to be on my own you mustnt go on for gods sake fuck off marcus raised clenched fists to heaven even you reject me helen burst into tears rupert whod been guarding the door had been caught temporarily on the hop as he tried to get through to czechoslovakia on his mobile to find out if pridie was all right but he immediately took helen away for a large brandy for a second they gazed at each other helens eyes were dark with resentment i couldnt help loving him so much he was all i had when i was married to you i know im sorry said rupert the passage outside his dressingroom was like a herbaceous border taggie had lined up all his flowers in vases so they didnt trigger off another asthma attack inside marcus couldnt see the shelves for cards one had been signed by every member of the rso taggie had kept back a white carnation for his buttonhole now she was pressing his tails howre xav and bianca marcus tried to force his trembling lips into a confident smile ok ive just rung home xavs always asking about his big brother oh marcus im so happy you and rupert have made it up hes so pleased and proud of you for going on marcuss hands were shaking so much that when rupert returned he had to tie his tie for him you can use your puffer between movements urged taggie thats the bit when we wait til flora claps said rupert is flora here asked marcus in amazed delight as he was giving his hands a last wash to remove the sweat howie denston barged in followed by a chattering retinue of his own sex markie baby why didnt you tell me you were gay youve no idea the doors i can open for you now get out said rupert slamming the door in all their faces a second later chrissie was knocking discreetly are you ready martin youre on now and gay news has asked especially if they can have a brief interview afterwards youre not talking to them snapped rupert charity does not begin at homos as they left the dressingroom marcus was nearly sent flying by a gorgon in a caftan got to phone my copy through cried gwynneth bossily never heard rach three played so well how little philipovas hands stretched that far must be a clear winner im going to stick my neck out marcus nearly burst out laughing at the horror on his fathers face beware a pale rider on a dark horse hissed rupert making a vsign at gwynneths vast back oh theres maestro rannaldini said chrissie reverently rupert straightened marcuss tie again taggie and i better go and find our seats good luck try not to rush things remind me to buy you some new eveningshirts turning he nearly bumped into rannaldini rupert was six inches taller but as he glanced down into the cold uncompromising face of his enemy he dropped his guard look after him please of course rannaldini smiled like an expectant wolf come along marcus then lowering his voice added nastily but dont play too slowly or well overrun the news brave boys thought marcus irrationally are not afraid of wolves shaking off rannaldinis obtrusively guiding hand he walked out onto the stage for a second he halted in panic at the beginning of the first violins blinded by the dazzling white camera lights staggered by the vastness of the audience an ocean of wary and unsmiling faces there was a sudden and embarrassed silence perhaps they would all boo him for what he had done to abby then he felt a small warm hand creeping into his good ruck marcus good ruck whispered noriko and a shove from rannaldini thrust him forward seeing how desperately pale shadowed and apprehensive he looked flora leapt without thinking to her feet bravo bravo marcus great to see you she yelled clapping frantically and a second later the audience had joined in coming down the row to take up marcuss two complimentary tickets were rupert and taggie sitting down next to flora rupert kissed her on both cheeks you are a star in every possible way sorry i chewed you out earlier glancing beyond her he encountered a murderous glare from the squareshouldered squarejawed minder beyond her rupert this is my future husband george hungerford said flora hastily marcus was amazed to see how many of the orchestra were smiling at him there was quinton in vikings place clutching his golden horn and candy and clare clapping wildly and dimitri discreetly waving two crossed fingers and randy and davie buckle cocking their heads and winking and barry and all the basses making thumbsup signs hilary simon and peter were too preoccupied with long difficult solos ahead to do more than nod but juno gave him a radiant smile she was feeling very chipper because james vereker the presenter had just asked her out to dinner good on you marcus go for it julian stood up and pumped marcuss hand as he passed then lowering his voice added youve got to win weve all got so much money on you rannaldini mounted the rostrum glaring round instantly wiping the smiles off everyones faces george would have difficulty overturning the decision of an entire board they knew rannaldini could put them all out of work next week once again they wished viking was here if only in the audience having lowered the pianostool checked if he could reach the pedals comfortably given his fingers a last wipe on his black trousers marcus put his head back with his eyes shut for a moment to compose himself then he placed his hands on the keys and was about to nod to rannaldini when the down beat descended like an executioners axe and the entire orchestra came in on the first crashing quaver caught on the hop marcuss first three bars followed like a mad scramble down the steps to a lake immediately followed by the woodwind taking off like a great swan across the waters surface this gave him eight bars respite to catch his breath before echoing the lovely piano expressivo melody then rippling on in accompaniment to the strings but rannaldini was taking it horrendously fast and marcus had his work cut out trying to keep up it was soon clear that this was a contest not a partnership with every tutti rannaldini whipped up the tempo with every exquisitely languorous cascade of notes marcus tried to slow it down he was touched that whenever simon peter and even hilary had ravishing solos which he had to accompany they tried to check their speed adjusting to his slower tempo but inevitably this made his performance uneven until following a magical andante interchange between woodwind and piano rannaldini suddenly accelerated as if he were turning up a mixer to full speed and marcus ran away with himself and came off the rails and stopped completely in the gallery dame edith pablo and boris groaned in despair but having thoroughly frightened himself marcus steadied realizing rannaldini was deliberately bent on sabotage his terror hardened into cold rage at least he looked absolutely beautiful on the monitor as though narcissus had wandered into the hall and was gazing at his reflection in the shiny black piano lid and as his confidence grew so did the depth and lyricism of his playing there was none of bennys unrelenting stridency nor natalias sloppy splashy lushness up in the gallery pablo even stopped grumbling that lady appleton had confiscated his guinness book of records all round the hall people began thinking that perhaps the schumann was the greatest piano concerto of them all even rannaldini couldnt rot up the cadenza although he did his best to distract the audience adjusting his gardenia examining his nails and flipping the pages of the score back and forth and he hardly waited for the final trill to bring the orchestra in at an even faster tempo but this time marcus was ready and like a television camera on top of a car he somehow managed to keep up with the galloping cheetah right to the end of the movement bloody marvellous muttered clare as she and candy tuned their instruments and adjusted the dusters on their shoulders even more marvellous muttered back candy is the man on floras right christ hes good looking how the hell does flora do it thats marcuss father said clare i think he once went to bed with mummy rupert was tone deaf but hed never taken his eyes off marcus throughout the entire movement was that all right he asked anxiously over the coughing and murmer of chat sensational whispered flora he kept his nerve despite chronic aggravation from rannaldini and marcus certainly wins on looks because of the red hair everyone says hes like helen but i reckon hes the image of you thats nice rupert blushed slightly i also think hes up to something observed flora ive seen that look before marcus reached for his inhaler had a puff and glanced up meditatively at rannaldinis impeccably tailored back wondering what devilries he was plotting now he has ridden expensively shod over too many people thought marcus rannaldini in fact was busy polishing his pewter hair and reflecting that the steel elf despite her squeaky sound was extraordinarily pretty he must remember to fuck her before he gave her the sack determined to observe the niceties this time he turned graciously to check if marcus were ready timidly marcus beckoned him the picture of concern rannaldini leapt youthfully down from his rostrum perhaps the little wimp had decided to retire beckoning him a fraction closer marcus hissed this ones for abby you bastard and giving a quick nod to julian he started playing ta ta ta tum ta ta ta tum the orchestra were so astounded they only just came in time rannaldini however was totally wrongfooted tripping over a cable in his builtup shoes he nearly fell flat on his face and was reduced to scrambling furiously back to his rostrum frantically flailing in a desperate attempt to regain the ascendancy over the orchestra who played on with broad grins on their faces the jury were divided between outrage ecstasy and helpless laughter as the slow movement was merely a short sweet intermezzo with the strings woodwind and piano mournfully echoing one another there was nothing rannaldini could do in retaliation except smoulder but the allegro vivace graveyard of pianists lay ahead that would be the time to show the little faggot who was maestro without a glance in marcuss direction rannaldini swept the orchestra into the last movement marcus had eighty bars of scampering glamorously round the keyboard before the orchestra like a willothewisp leading the unwary traveller into the quicksand launched into the deceptively simple jaunty little tune to the life boats to the life boats sung marcus to himself grimly it was one hell of a pace he mustnt panic at first the jury and many of the audience thought julian must be drunk because he had for once taken off his dark glasses and swayed crazily round his leaders chair bloodshot eyes rolling pale lank hair flying then deirdre twigged hes not dronk she whispered to boris in admiration hes josst making sure that every member of the orchestra can see him aware that marcus could never keep up with the terrifying syncopated crossrhythms if the musicians went at rannaldinis pace julian was utterly ignoring rannaldini playing at a slower tempo and the rso stayed with him after two days of responding with the docility of dressage horses they were suddenly raising two hooves to rannaldini abby very dear because she was now departed had been sacked unfairly this was their rebellion overjoyed astounded marcus realized they were doing to the mighty rannaldini what they had done to abby in the old days they were following the soloist he felt a great surge of confidence like shoals of goldfish released from a tiny tank into a great river like a door opening and sunlight pouring in on the darkness the notes were flowing gloriously away from his fingers rannaldini was insane with rage the leader whom hed fired in new york and would certainly fire again the moment the concerto was over was refusing like an overworked barman to let his eye be caught but being on camera rannaldini couldnt betray his fury short of thrashing julian with his baton he could do nothing i ave never seen anything like it murmured pablo to the other judges i ave waited many many years for that sheet to meet his vaterloo cest magnifique mais cest aussi la guerre to avoid public humiliation rannaldini had now readjusted his beat to marcuss joyfully dancing fingers nearly there murmured flora to rupert only one more fence to jump and perfectly controlled but racing faster and faster like a winner on the home straight at cheltenham the orchestra launched into the final tutti followed by marcuss last euphoric helterskelter up the keyboard leading into the last crashing chords accompanied by davie buckles tumultuous drumroll and it was all over marcus bowed his head as if he were in total trance there was a long stunned silence broken by flora once again leaping to her feet bravo bravo she screamed bringing her hands together in clap almost as noisy as the final chord a flash of lightning which was followed by the most deafening thunder of applause as stamping cheering yelling the entire audience rose to their feet for a moment marcus gazed at them in bewilderment the colour stealing into his face then he smiled more radiantly than any sunrise and getting unsteadily to his feet holding the edge of the piano for support bowed low as the applause grew more and more delirious then giddy he straightened up and fell into julians waiting arms unable to speak they hammered each others backs listening to an even sweeter sound a manic rattling of bows on the backs of chairs unfortunately for rannaldini marcus was blocking his exit and rannaldini was forced because he was on camera to hold out his hand marcus looked at it for a second then deliberately rejecting it he said quite distinctly that was for screwing up flora and abby and cuckolding my mother then he added as an afterthought and for trying to destroy my father and stalked off the platform how could marcus have rejected rannaldinis olive branch thought helen in horror im seeing rupert all over again that was worth a bloody gold crowed rupert as he and taggie fought their way out to marcuss dressingroom absolutely no doubt who the audience want to win marcus was waiting for them smiling apologetically ive probably screwed up my career for ever but god i enjoyed that he was so soaked in sweat yet burning whitehot that taggie needed ovengloves to hug him you were wonderful she said tearfully but what really made marcuss evening almost his whole life was ruperts face hed only seen that blaze of elation when his father had won big races or major showjumping classes in the old days you were fucking fantastic rupert told him then stopped to listen in wonder to the accelerating stamp of feet from the hall i only got applause like that at the olympics youve got to go back again marcus an ntv minion popped his head round the door you took it so fast weve got a couple of minutes to fill before the break going out of his dressingroom marcus collided with an outraged howie denston youve blown it you stupid fucker how could you screw rannaldini like that he controls everything the jury wont touch you now youre blown out of the water finished howie was followed by a tearful helen oh marcus how could you do that to rannaldini what must he be feeling at this moment natalias boobs probably said marcus curtly hes a bastard mum the sooner you chuck him the better and leaving a frantically mouthing helen he went back to face the ecstatic crowds and because rannaldini had refused to return bringing the orchestra and then hilary peter and simon to their feet and even kissing little norikos hand hey lay off yelled cherub from the gallery and everyone laughed for gods sake get them off the stage an ntv official was yelling to nicholas or well be into another hours overtime thats your problem said knickers cheerfully that was absolutely marvellous marcus he was always so sweet and polite sobbed helen taggie put an arm round her shoulders hes been under a terrible strain so have you lets all have a huge drink she added to rupert who was already opening bottles from a crate of champagne which he had magically produced when julian at last brought the orchestra off the platform he was accosted by a maddened rannaldini dyou realize he spat that you have just lost the chance of leading what will become the greatest orchestra in the world id far rather work for the happiest said julian coldly and walked straight past him sixtynine up in the jurors room it was pandemonium he had a memory lapse in the first movement intoned the chinese judge who still had hopes of han chai the boys a genius i never heard it so well played he has a delicateness and a strongness the others have not said the big ukrainian the last two movements were impeccable and so lyrical said the french feminist rannaldini sabotage marcus the whole time his manners to rannaldini were most disrespectful snapped lili seeing her steinway and her promised concert with the new super orchestra sliding away he wouldnt even shake the maestros hand i prefer natalia agreed ernesto who had changed sides after rannaldini offered him a cartier watch and trials for all his pupils she and rannaldini interacted so charmingly together thats because she has beeg teets said pablo who was still sulkily searching for his guinness book of records cant we have a serious drink blodwyn grumbled bruce kennedy not till youve finished judging said lady appleton pouring him a glass of evian what dyou feel hermione i would prefer natalia urged hermione in her deep voice and it would be more politically correct to give it to a woman this support had been drummed up by rannaldini while natalia had been resting that afternoon he had found half an hour to administer so much unpolitical correction to hermione that she could hardly sit down marcuss supporters gazed at her stonily i thought it was jolly funny snorted dame edith blowing cigar smoke in hermiones pained face rannaldini tried to scupper marcus and the boy rose magnificently to the occasion just like his father always did boys a genius and brave as a lion nothing more to be said lady appleton however had a lot more the reputation of the competition was at stake can one rely on marcus to perform all those concerts she asked cautiously oh well if youre going for the safe candidate boomed edith we might as well settle on the american and go and get blotto jennifer sitting in the next armchair her mouth full of crisps wagged in agreement the jury however bridled theyd all read a piece in the daily telegraph by norman lebrecht last monday which accused todays juries of rejecting genius passion and true individuality in favour of reliability and predictability marcus as a voice all his own a radiance beyond the notes sighed pablo what emotion what power what eenocence what wiseness what love he had a memory lapse repeated the chinese judge who was busy rewriting the chapter on the schumann concerto on his laptop i still think natalia has the ouch screamed dame hermione as ernesto surreptitiously pinched her on her pained bottom just a twinge of neuralgia she added hastily i shall resign if marcus doesnt ween said boris taking his hand out of deirdres and speaking for the first time i too said pablo and i shall resign if he does said rannaldini sweeping in in such icy rage that everyone wilted the ladies whod dogpaddled with him in the deep end felt their resolve weakening we cannot let soloist deectate hissed rannaldini we must eradicate thees kind of hooliganism i geeve heem every courtesy every encouragement see what he does in the middle movement see ow he reject my proffered hand never ave i been treated like that it is all part of grudge match he went on marcuss father ate me for marrying his exwife the boy worsheep his mother like many homosexuals he is wildly jealous of anyone she love he is seek he is unbalanced marcus is unbalanced said boris in amazement noone dared laugh rannaldinis rage was so controlled yet so venomous how could i have let that man take over my orchestra thought dame edith in horror marcus is seek in body too went on rannaldini constantly e pull out of concert at the last moment because of asthma we certainly must have a healthy candidate said a worried lady appleton with all those wonderful engagements lined up under that kind of pressure he will crack said rannaldini dismissively you see him go to pieces in the first movement how boring he play waldstein in early round you make terrible mistake pablo gonzalez could see the jury sliding away from him marcus was zee most chivalrous accompanist he pleaded whenever the orchestra ave big solo he just drop gently out of the limelight that seem balanced to me he get up from his deathbed and all that scandal with nemerovsky i agree with pablo i never see finer example of grace under pressure said the burly ukrainian stubbornly yes i thought you found him attractive said rannaldini bitchily i saw you having a clandestine dreenk with him the other night gentlemen gentlemen lady appleton glanced at the clock the news will be over in a minute or two we must vote there was a knock on the door of marcuss dressingroom outside stood a greyfaced piano tuner were busy snapped rupert i must have a private word with mr black then as marcus went outside with him the tuner stammered i know its too late to change anything but ive got to tell you what i did to the piano on wednesday he then explained how he had slid a ballbearing on top of the two concealed blocks of wood at the bass end of the keyboard which divide when the soft pedal is pressed the ballbearing just slipped down between the blocks holding them apart mumbled the tuner jamming the soft pedal for the rest of the waldstein when they called me back because youd kicked up a fuss all i had to do was roll out the ballbearing with a long screwdriver when noone was looking how very ingenious said marcus fascinated i couldnt think what had happened could you do it to benny next time the piano tuner was shattered i cant believe youre taking it like this he muttered im sorry i cant tell you who bribed me but im going to pay back every penny of the money i wouldnt advised marcus rannaldini can afford it thanks for telling me marcus couldnt be bothered to say anything when he went back to his dressingroom the whole confession had been a welcome interruption he had been interviewed by the frightful james vereker and now found the strain of waiting in a crowded dressingroom intolerable people including half of the orchestra seemed to have poured in to congratulate him and drink ruperts drink a still furious howie and a still tearful helen whod been bawled out by a foaming rannaldini and banished from the conductors room were the only dissenting voices seeing marcus whitening near to death the shadows deepening under his eyes rupert kicked everyone out you ok marcus nodded its crazy on the drive here all that mattered was that i got through it he blushed now i seriously want to win thats my boy youre learning course youll win youre a star now said taggie suddenly marcus remembered alexei warning him that stars could never belong to each other that the true artist could only belong to the world and the pain came roaring back what did winning matter without alexei there was a knock on the door chrissie had put on some crimson lipstick to match her turkey legs ready martin they are going to tell you the results beforehand in the green room rupert got to his feet and straightened marcuss tie again taggie brushed down his tailcoat good luck said helen in a tight trembling voice ill see you later by the way murmured rupert then waiting till helen had left he drew a cellophane box containing a white flower out from behind the curtain the envelope attached to it had been opened someone chucked this in the bin he handed the box to marcus ripping it open marcus nearly fainted as he breathed in the sweet apple smell of philadelphus instantly bringing back that baking hot june afternoon there were only two lines on the card i was wrong with love all is possible i am very jealous of the world alexei seeing the incredulous joy on the boys face rupert removed the carnation from marcuss buttonhole and replaced it with the philadelphus come on martin grumbled chrissie we cant keep the princess waiting although lady appleton will have told you the order beforehand do try not to show your disappointment when you file onto the platform as it spoils it for the audience anyway she added seeing marcuss face fall youre way ahead in the ntv viewers poll as he walked into the green room anatole greeted him in ecstasy i ween pub competition i ween thees he brandished a huge beer mug knees up muzzer brown he did a little dance hush chorused the ntv minions a strip of black velvet had been pinned to one of the green room walls in front was a huge arrangement of lilies and chrysanthemums on the table was a note saying james vereker to interview winner in front of black velvet immediately after results i dropped those flowers three times observed a passing technician hush said chrissie lady appleton cleared her throat ill give you the order back to front she told the contestants starting with the lowest dont forget to curtsy marcus when you shake hands with the princess said benny nastily natalia was perfectly calm she knew she had won rannaldini had told her so knees up muzzer brown sang anatole as the six contestants filed onto the platform sitting high up on the chairs that had earlier been occupied by the brass players marcus looked so white and stunned rupert knew with a terrible lurch of pity and disappointment he hadnt won im so sorry whispered taggie its ok rupert took her hand what matters somehow is that for the first time hes miraculously mine im sorry ive been so vile today i can always be relied upon to be a tower of gelignite in a crisis i love you doesnt her royal highness look dignified sighed peggy parker as the princess resplendent in listermintgreen taffeta and lots of diamonds led a trail of local dignitaries in robes and furry burghers hats slowly up the centre aisle to take their seats on the platform and now our finalists in reverse order said james vereker batting his dyed eyelashes at the princess lady appleton will announce the winners were just waiting for a signal from ntv said lady appleton her round pink face glowing like a harvest moon id just like to remind everyone that we judge the candidates on all three rounds not just tonights nor yesterdays efforts all right james she smiled into the camera in sixth place we have han chai as the little korean came dancing down the steps looking so pretty and happy to be sixth everyone decided she should have been placed higher and gave her a terrific reception fifth from france mr benjamin basanovich cried lady appleton benny was absolutely livid but he got an even louder cheer because everyone was so relieved he hadnt won fourth lady appleton cleared her throat and rustled her notes our very popular contender from across the atlantic still in his plaid jacket carl bounded down the steps two at a time grinning broadly thrilled to be meeting royalty taking the princesss little hand in his two big ones marcus is third whispered an excited flora to george and trevor then followed a long pause because the princess was having such a long chat with carl oh get on with it yelled dixie from the gallery third prize began lady appleton here we go at least hes placed thought rupert is our friend from russia knees up muzzer brown shouted anatole waving his beer mug bouncing up to the princess and charming her just as much as he charmed the crowd he kissed her hand rannaldini glanced across at natalia a tear was trickling down her rosy cheek little darling crying with happiness he thought complacently soon he would be drinking champagne out of her and the cup the atmosphere in the hall crackled with excitement lady appleton enjoyed her fouryearly moment of glory george squeezed floras hand till she winced i love you i love you oh please god make it be marcus she begged second a very worthy contestant is our charming friend from czechoslovakia natalia but noone heard her surname as lady appleton was drowned by a demented roar of joy that took the roof off as the crowd realized the home side had won on the strength of that they could now afford to feel sorry for natalia as battling with disappointment the picture of desolation she accepted her silver plate and allowed the kind princess to mop up her tears the atmosphere was now a seething cauldron a cheer rose and fell rupert hugged taggie until her ribs cracked the orchestra leaning over the gallery were yelling their heads off boris was kissing deirdre zank you zank you my darling you are not bloody bigot after all hes won screamed flora holding george even tighter as a somewhat squashed trevor barked his approval up in the dress circle a grinning jennifer barked back at last there was silence and the winner of the appleton piano competition lady appleton smiled round you dont need to be inspector morse to deduce that bellowed randy even lady appleton laughed the winner of the appleton she repeated shakily is our own marcus campbellblack the princess taking both marcuss hands had to shout to make herself heard are you sure youre all right youve been so terribly ill its a wonderful victory you played so beautifully and you look so beautiful marcus found himself blurting out the princess was so sweet and after that he couldnt remember anything she said until she handed over the little silver piano as well as a huge cup of course queers get on awfully well with women sniffed mrs parker oh shut up you old monster snapped flora speech bellowed the orchestra oh no thought taggie in anguish remembering how marcus had dried during a debate in front of the whole of bagley hall he had never been able to string a sentence together in public but marcus had taken the microphone and was waiting for a lull he was whiter than the piano keys a lock of damp auburn hair had fallen over his freckled forehead he looked absurdly young to speak now was far more terrifying than playing the schumann but he had to do it what a beauty and our own thought the audience in raptures your royal highness ladies and gentlemen gasped marcus fighting for breath id like to thank all the judges for giving me this amazing prize he waved the silver piano and the organizers particularly lady appleton for er organizing such a marvellous competition and mrs bateson for looking after me and baking such terrific cakes and everyone at northladen general for saving my life there was a burst of cheering as he gained in confidence he had a voice just like ruperts thought flora i also want to thank my parents marcus went on steadily my mother and my stepmother but most of all my father rupert campbellblack deliberately he emphasized the campbell it isnt easy for parents to accept their son is a homosexual and theyve been absolutely terrific he glanced in ruperts direction particularly my father oooooooh dear mumbled flora smearing all her mascara as she wiped her shirtsleeve across her eyes glancing sideways taggie also saw the wetness of ruperts lashes the silence was total and most of all marcus grinned up at the gallery ive got to thank the rso for playing so brilliantly today and being such a great orchestra tell that to the arts council roared dixie marcus joined in the laughter there was a volley of applause which faded because people wanted to listen aware that the cameras were rolling unfazed that he was addressing millions of viewers marcus went on but this may be the last time you hear the rso because they are being forced to merge with the cotchester chamber orchestra this means most of them will lose their jobs thats enough snarled rannaldini who was already foaming like a pit bull i agree maestro lady appleton rose to her feet the princess however who was looking madly interested stayed seated ive almost finished marcus raised his hand i only want to say the real heroine of this evening abigail rosen wasnt allowed to be here the orchestra gave another great cheer because abby was involved with me she was sacked and not allowed to conduct her own orchestra today although i love her very much i cant marry her because i couldnt give her the happiness she deserves noone has done more to make the rso the truly great orchestra you heard today marcuss voice broke but he just managed to finish i hope the ban will be lifted and abby will get her job back thank you the cheers were still echoing in his ears when he finally fought his way back to his dressingroom a mad party was spilling out into the passage everyone was opening champagne bottles and celebrating mrs bateson hugged him your little cat really worked marcus told her lord leatherhead and mrs parker and even awful miles were all there getting in on the act sonny will write you a concerto marcus promised mrs parker he says noone can play the interruption like you do from the first goatie gilbert was boasting i recognized marcus blacks talent rupert couldnt remember feeling so happy or so proud it was as though a dam built of years of irritation contempt and antagonism had suddenly burst and he could feel love for marcus pouring out of him sister angelica had been right about el dorado being found in the heart thank god it wasnt too late and he had time ahead to make it up to marcus i can smell the fatted calf said flora slyly rupert laughed lousy with cholesterol at least taggie knows how to cook it the downside is i dont get you as a daughterinlaw i suppose you couldnt wait for xav to grow up im suited said flora blushing slightly but thanks all the same then as george who was holding out a townhall teacup of water for trevor to drink out of shot rupert yet another murderous glance she added hastily you really must get to know george i dont think george feels thats strictly necessary said rupert across the room helen was in raptures over marcuss victory oh darling darling im so proud think of all the wonderful concerts ahead youll be in work for the next two years and your speech was so lovely so assured i hope abby heard it more importantly i hope the board did said marcus glaring at miles and taking a glass of champagne from rupert do you think you ought to drink after all that medication reproved helen the next moment howie denston rushed in and embraced marcus great kid great always knew you could do it youve talked to james vereker ok in ten minutes therell be a press conference ill field any tricky questions about nemerovsky and then theres the party youll be sitting near lady a and the princess your folks are invited of course tomorrow around ten well sign the contracts youll be working your fingers off for the next two years he tapped his mobile ive already had two big record producers on to me but marcus was rereading alexeis note fine howie then he looked up could you all clear out i want a word with mum and dad helens heart swelled marcus had grown so authoritative in a day he seemed to have turned into a man and she was feeling much more cheerful having just met lord leatherhead whod asked her out to lunch next week rupert meanwhile was talking to czechoslovakia on his mobile pridies absolutely fine dizzy was telling him youre not to be cross with lysander his shoulders been set and hes really sorry he didnt win doesnt matter marcus did said rupert jubilantly christ he did brilliantly taggie snatched the telephone from him and guess what she told dizzie rupert didnt fall asleep once as taggie joined the rest of the revellers drifting out saying absolutely brilliant see you at the party marcus shut the door and leant against it looking at his parents squarely you ought to be in bed chided helen im going to moscow said marcus helen gave a scream oh no you cant your career all those engagements ruperts sigh was almost imperceptible and in no way betrayed his desolation at suddenly discovering el dorado was disappearing into the mists again are you sure thats what you want he asked slowly marcus nodded moscows bloody dangerous at the moment i know but i will come back then ill drive you to the airport we better look up a flight i know them all backwards helen burst into tears please dont go after all weve worked for think what youre throwing away the queen elizabeth the festival hall the wigmore the barbican have you got some sort of deathwish i wanted penscombe to be yours and your sons she sobbed and your sons sons then youd never have to worry about money and now youre chucking everything away just when fates given you a second chance you and abby were so happy there are counsellors you could talk to mum said marcus gently as he hugged his mother you dont understand i love alexei i cant hang around this evening ive proved to myself i can play the piano i dont want to get into that circus i want to develop as a soloist in my own time gently he pulled away from her then briefly he put his arms round rupert i love you dad im sorry its taken me so long to say it i dont understand thought helen in despair why does rupert always swan in at the last moment and win out seventy when marcus didnt show up at the party it was at first assumed hed flaked out and gone back to bed a home win in itself was enough to ensure the most riotous celebrations anyway the rso were too busy getting legless to notice cherub whod packed in more drinking time because there was no percussion in the schumann was absolutely plastered and by smiling sweetly at pablo had joyfully appropriated the guinness book of records thats the biggest mole in history he pointed at hilarys rigid back going off into fits of giggles and heres the prickliest cactus he pointed at militant moll and heah we have the biggest goldfish pausing behind hermione he started making fish faces and mouthing i know that my redeemer his fellow musicians were in stitches whos the biggest rat asked fat isobel who had practically obscured ninion by sitting on his knee him said cherub pointing at carmine who was still trying to reach cathie on his mobile i am biggest gooseberry sighed pablo who was sitting at a table with a passionately embracing boris and deirdre and there is the coldest fish naughty cherub pointed at miles who up at the end of the room was being given the biggest flea in his ear by george not having been to bed for forty hours george was in fact suddenly overwhelmed with tiredness he had called an emergency board meeting for one oclock in the morning but he was not optimistic rannaldini had probably bribed too many of the board for george to be able to overturn their decision to appoint him musical director if he did it wouldnt save the situation there was no way the rso could survive even a month longer without a massive injection of cash george himself owed twenty million pounds to german banks at the moment so the money couldnt come from him anyway he wanted to be with flora who with sister rose and miss parrott was now noisily teaching dimitri and anatole the hokeycokey glancing round she smiled at him and george felt his heart melting like a yorkie bar in the sun meanwhile the largest plague of locusts discovered over the red sea in was nothing to the way the rso were demolishing the cold buffet only julian still violently shaking after his defiance of rannaldini couldnt eat or drink a thing through the sound of revelry he could hear the cannons opening roar of a rannaldini rabid for vengeance the long top table was the only one with a seating plan trapped between the princess and lady appleton rannaldini was having to be polite but his darkly tanned face was twitching like treacle toffee coming up to the boil cherub was off again thats the biggest toad in the world he said sticking a pink tongue out at gilbert and here comes the sexiest man squeaked nellie in excitement rupert campbellblack hes already taken said clare not bothering to look round nope sean bean nope clare swung round irritably viking she screamed viking yelled the rso as they joyfully and drunkenly stumbled towards him cousin victor cried deirdre in amazement letting go of boris but viking poised in the doorway looked so tall thin pale and quivering with menace that deirdre almost crossed herself hi kids almost absentmindedly viking pushed the orchestra out of the way his eyes narrowed to black thread never leaving rannaldinis face the next moment fleeter than any cheetah he crossed the room to the top table and reaching over had grabbed rannaldini by his suede lapels dragging him across the white tablecloth scattering glass silver china and flowers until rannaldini was standing beside him on the blue carpet how dare you hurt my abigail yelled viking and to equal cheers and screams of horror he smashed his fist into rannaldinis evil mahogany face lifting him up in a perfect parabola so his descent onto the pudding trolley was only cushioned by gwynneth who was piling her plate with a third helping of bombe surprise the interminable stunned silence was finally broken by dixie thats the only way youll ever get sir roberto to lie on top of you gwynnie he shouted the rso collapsed with laughter partners in cream partners in cream they chorused as rannaldini and gwynneth floundered in a sea of chocolate sticky fruit and meringue but the laughter died on their lips as rannaldinis minders clive and nathan moved in with deadly swiftness look out viking yelled julian run shrieked cousin deirdre it was sage advice viking realized he couldnt take on both clive and nathan particularly as a shiny dark object glinted menacingly in nathans huge hand get him hissed rannaldini rubbing black forest gâteau out of his eyes and viking was off darting through the little tables sending a huge vase of bronze chrysanthemums flying catching trevor and jennifer in flagrante behind the carving trolley out through a sidedoor up a flight of stairs shouting voices and footsteps pounding after him sent him hurtling along a corridor there was no time to catch the lift the footsteps were getting nearer at the end of the corridor were stone stairs and panting down seven flights and sidling across the lounge viking found himself in the lobby but as he paused to catch his breath clive emerged from the lift dummying past him viking hurled himself into the revolving doors only to find nathan leering at him on the other side still waving the same menacing shiny object with huge yuccas to left and right of the door there was no escape wincing as clive grabbed his arm viking turned looking into the vicious unpitying face of death the basstard had it coming muttered viking for a second or two death stared at him then suddenly warmed up and smiled almost affectionately couldnt agree with you more dear lisped clive been waiting ten years for someone to give rannaldini his comeuppance may i shake you by the hand then as vikings jaw dropped nathan bounded in through the revolving doors with a grin as wide as the keys on a steinway and thrust the menacing object into vikings hand you dropped your wallet man wed very much like to buy you a drink said clive its very generous of you both viking started to shake not entirely with laughter through the revolving doors he could see his taxidriver polishing off a pork pie and a can of lager to sustain him after the first leg of the journey from holyhead im on my way to heathrow said viking but perhaps ive josst got time for a quick one rannaldini swearing vengeance had disappeared to wash crême brulée out of his pewter hair before the emergency board meeting when the bellboy walked in with a telephone call for you mr hungerford as george lifted the receiver everyone around him could hear the frantic squawking as if a hen had just laid a dinosaurs egg mr hungerford cried miss priddock ay saw you in the audience thank goodness youre back an amazin thing has happened i dont know quaite how to tell you try said george unhelpfully but as he listened his idontwanttobebotheredwithpaperclips scowl creased into a huge smile that is amazing miss p woonderful in fact are you at home ill call you later yes it was great marcus won as he switched off the telephone he turned to flora well done john droommond hes caught the biggest rat in the world giggled flora cherub had reached the prehistoric chapter his finger moving shakily along the line the largessht exshtinct animal in the world wash the two hundred and fifty ton supersaurus he informed his audience and the most extinct ensemble in the world said george draining his glass of brandy is rannaldinis super orchestra coda happy birthday said gisela thrusting out a big bunch of autumn crocuses abby looked round listlessly and put down her violin thank you theyre lovely she examined the delicate veins on the pale mauve petals in fact theyre exquisite youre so good to me gisela id forgotten it was my birthday i guess hitting thirtys kind of painless compared with losing everything else in my life the autumn crocus bloom when everything else is dying said the housekeeper gently oh gisela abby turned hastily towards the window to hide her tears she had already wept enough to fill lake lucerne which as far as the eye could see sparkled brilliant blue and utterly unsympathetic in the afternoon sunshine in her old rustred jersey and brown suede skirt which was now hopelessly loose on her she had all the sad defencelessness of an autumn leaf blown against the window you must eat child urged gisela ive just made onion soup and theres bread fresh from the oven youre so darling im sorry im just not hungry and i cant practise any more ill take a walk along the lake can you put the flowers in water thank you i just love them handing back the crocuses abby ran from the room a crawling restlessness an inability to settle to anything was part of her malaise put on a coat gisela shouted after her but the front door had banged gisela had never seen such despair abby reminded her of a child whose family had all been killed huddling in the ruins of a bombedout city it was a beautiful day the air was misty and silky the lake reflecting a big cloud that had drifted overhead was greyblue now little waves caressed the banks along which autumn blazed amid the amber gloom of the woods the beeches stood out stinging red like huntsmen riding by abby could almost hear their horns oh viking viking splashing through the puddles from last nights deluge she battled to come to terms with the anguish of last weekend after the first dreadful shock of being conned and betrayed marcus being outed had been almost a relief it explained his lack of desire except for those heady frenzied days when hed first met alexei which had made her feel such a failure as a woman but she missed him as a best friend as she missed flora who now belonged to george in addition her violin wouldnt sing to her and she was eaten up with guilt and sadness at abandoning her friends in the orchestra to the nonexistent mercies of rannaldini she had let them down she had blabbed to the press she had loved not wisely but it was the loss of viking that wiped her out not only did she frantically crave his lovemaking but only now did she appreciate how much she had looked forward to seeing him every day how his dreadful sexist cracks had warmed her blood what dyou call a woman maestro mattress oh viking she sighed you can lie on me whenever you want how shed enjoyed the sparring how she missed his kindness his louche elegance the sun in his arms ive grown accustomed to his face thought abby as she watched the leaves drifting down for a last kiss with their reflection on the surface of the lake it was my thirtieth year to heaven she quoted sadly my birthday began with the waterbirds and i rose in rainy autumn and walked abroad in a shower of all my days what the hell could she do with the rest of all her days she couldnt go back to the loneliness of being a soloist being the tallest poppy waiting to be hacked down the press pulling out her petals this week we love her this week we love her not she supposed she could try for a job as a leader but as a soloist she had her own distinctive sound she would have to learn to fuse with the rest of the orchestra ive never been able to fuse with anything in my life she thought wearily she had the temporary security of rodneys house on the lake but that was being contested by his family she missed rodney so much too every room was filled with his ghost a faint waft of lemon cologne and cigars every evening she expected him to bounce in brandishing a bottle of champagne wearing nothing but his pinstriped apron oh well it was worth a try only now did she realize how much rodney had given her letting her stay for so long putting up with her tantrums always ready to listen she was sure his big heart had failed in the end because he had given so much of it away to other people she wished he could send her a fax just to tell her he was ok ahead mount pilatus already covered in snow gleamed in the sunshine pilate had come to the lake to suffer how did you hack it pontius pleaded abby if you and god have made it up put in a good word it was my thirtieth year to heaven she intoned wearily as she shuffled through a thick carpet of curling sycamore leaves or rather hell she had drawn level with the little island about sixty yards from the shore willows alders and tall ashes hung with glittering grey pelts of travellers joy crowded its banks every puff of wind sent a shower of gold leaves drifting into the water some falling into a little crimson rowing boat with pale blue oars which abby suddenly noticed moored in the rushes halting to listen to the water birds calling abby suddenly froze no it couldnt be they didnt have hunting in this part of switzerland but there it was again pa pa pa the faint sweet sad sound of the horn drifting across the water abby felt her whole body prickling her hair rising her tummy bungyjumping without the aid of any rope it must be the ghost of hans richter the greatest conductor of his age come back to mock her as one who had failed im going crazy thought abby it must be exhaustion and lack of food pa pa pa there it was again and not just any horn noone played with that dash and raw radiance sliding down the bank to the edge of the lake straining her ears abby tried to hush the galloping crescendo of her heart beat which threatened to blot out all sound it was coming from the island totally unaware of what she was doing drawn by her longing abby crashed through the bull rushes into the icy water for the horn had stopped tuning up and was now playing the soft infinitely tender love theme from ein heldenleben when after the tantrums the bitching of the critics the catalogue of past achievements and the great battle the hero and his wife are blissfully reunited oh how beautiful it was the rich dark notes were calling to her weaving round her like a great purring panther abby stood knee deep and quivering unable to believe what she was hearing then she plunged into the water gasping first at the cold pushing through a thick gratin of leaves then when she was out of her depth swimming faster and faster viking she croaked as she came up for air then choking and spitting oh viking im here im here and he had heard as if in a dream she saw him fighting his way through the nearest clump of yellow trees then pause on the bank gold conch in his hand with the travellers joy draping his shoulders like the grey wolfpelts of some viking conqueror his face was deathly white his slitty eyes beneath eyelids heavier than thunderclouds were searching and anguished oh abby i was only bossking then he chucked his gleaming horn in the rushes and slithering down the bank fell into her arms for a second he glanced down at her dripping face and removed a strand of weed from her hair with a desperately shaking hand she could feel his heart crashing against hers then he buried his lips in hers kissing her on and on holding her tighter and tighter then as she wriggled free hiding her face in his blackandgreen plaid shirt he muttered oh abby darling darling my darling ive been such a basstard to you but i cant live a single second longer without you ill die ill be cast away on an island of desolation for the rest of my life unless you rescue me abby looked up in bewilderment but saw no jokes no mockery only tenderness in his face and he was so pale youre not sick worried she touched his cheek only with love and i love you gasped abby ive been so unhappy suddenly she was sobbing and shivering so violently that viking pulled her up the bank holding back the trees and leading her into a little clearing then he put his leather jacket round her and pulled her down onto a mossy log holding her close and telling her he loved her until she was quiet and still why did you run away without saying goodbye she wailed because i knew you hated me i had to win that horrible bet in case anyone else got you i went home to ireland to distance myself to try and get over you but i couldnt it was like a party political broadcast on all four channels telling me how lovvly you were i didnt want to opset you so i thought id wait till after the appleton blue rang me and said youd been sacked i couldnt stay away any more i just prayed you might need me need you abby wriggled even closer to him ive done that from the moment i saw you me too viking shook his head i just took longer to admit it abby put her hand up to touch the scar where her ring had lashed his cheek i was so horrible to you not nearly as horrible as i was to you and did you know weve been looking everywhere for you gisela only confessed you were here last night because she was so worried she never told me youd called said abby indignantly why didnt you speak to me i bottled out i was scared of saying the wrong thing getting up viking retrieved his horn from the rushes this is the only way i can really express my love for you till i met you my heart was onbreakable like a cd he halfsmiled that one you stamped on still plays gathering up her hair at the back he twisted it round and round squeezing out the water my rosen dêtre i want to give you the world he said falteringly but i being poor have only my dreams but i wont be poor for long he added with a touch of his old swagger im going to get my act together make a bomb as a soloist keep you in fine style and stop being a womanizer abby laughed shakily youre not a womanizer youre a charmer orpheus with his lute ive come to lead you out of the onderworld back to rotminster they all miss you only because ive left and what about rannaldini hes gone what otterly routed he hadnt a clay foot to stand on after the way he screwed up marcus in the finals then at abbys look of bewilderment added marcus won you know he won gasped abby incredulously but thats wonderful he made a fantastic winners speech live and straight to camera telling everyone he loved you but he was no good for you because he was gay and that you should be reinstated thats incredible abbys eyes spilled over with tears oh how darling of marcus where is he vikings arms tightened round her please dont be sad sweetheart hes gone to moscow my god to alexei you dont still love him youre not too opset vikings face was suddenly so fearful and worried abby had to kiss him better entwining her body with his melting into him until she thought he was going to take her then and there in the leafy clearing god im so lucky he murmured and nugent promises not to eat sibelius or scriabin abby smiled still unable to take it all in then she nearly fell back into the water in amazement as she heard the most glorious cacophony leaping to her feet she was just turning towards the bank when viking who had also jumped up clamped her to his chest josst listen he whispered now i really am going crazy thought abby as a full orchestra belted out admittedly somewhat haphazardly the first bars of ein heldenleben before switching to happy birthday struggling frantically until viking loosened his grasp abby wriggled round then she gazed and gazed clutching his hand leaning against him for support as the tears flowed down her cheeks for the entire rso still in their white ties and tails and last nights black dresses were grinning at her from the bank they were all standing out of order and obviously in the middle of a splendid party randy and dixie were brandishing champagne bottles as well as their instruments dimitri was mopping his eyes with miss parrott fondly beside him her harp blending into the golden woods behind julian and francis were brandishing a huge streamer saying happy th birthday abby juno my goodness was dancing cheek to cheek with charlton handsome and even more my goodness there was lord leatherhead doing a stately jive with peggy parker while old cyril merrily bopped with old henry and a totally unharassed knickers twisted the day away with militant moll in the background stood george happily smoking a huge cigar and hugging a giggling flora who was trying to play her viola as isobel and ninion let off a great volley of bangers a little boat struck out from the bank with noriko rowing through the yellow leaves and cherub frantically pinging his triangle herro abby herro called out noriko actually shes a heroine shouted back viking then everyone cheered and cheered i dddont understand whispered abby they had an emergency board meeting last night after the competition said viking wiping her eyes and george decided to charter a plane to fly us all out its been one helluva bash we dropped miles and hilly in the english channel but george shouldnt be wasting money charting planes when were bankrupt were not any more viking could hardly speak for laughing john drommond won the lottery so even if you programme winifred trapp every day well still be solvent in the year i cant believe it muttered abby indeed you can darling its the only way they can tell you they love you added viking as happy birthday swung very discordantly into the wedding march your orchestra has come to take you home abby burst into tears of joy but theyre not together she wailed no but you and i are and thats all that matters said viking the end
