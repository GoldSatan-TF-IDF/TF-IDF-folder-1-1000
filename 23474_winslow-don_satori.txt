don winslow satori shibumi copyright don winslow and the trevanian beneficiaries a novel based on trevanians shibumi to richard pine part one tokyo october nicholai hel watched the maple leaf drop from the branch flutter in the slight breeze then fall gently to the ground it was beautiful savoring the first glimpse of nature that hed had after three years of solitary confinement in an american prison cell he breathed in the crisp autumn air let it fill his lungs and held it for a few moments before he exhaled haverford mistook it for a sigh glad to be out the agent asked nicholai didnt respond the american was as nothing to him a mere merchant like the rest of his compatriots peddling espionage instead of automobiles shaving cream or cocacola nicholai had no intention of engaging in meaningless conversation never mind allowing this functionary access to his personal thoughts of course he was glad to be out he thought as he looked back at the bleak gray walls of sugamo prison but why did westerners feel a need to voice the obvious or attempt to give expression to the ineffable it was the nature of a maple leaf to drop in the autumn i killed general kishikawa as close to a father as i ever had because it was my filial nature and duty to do so the americans imprisoned me for it because they could do nothing else given their nature and now they offer me my freedom because they need me nicholai resumed his walk along the pebbled path flanked by the maple trees a bit surprised that he felt a twinge of anxiety at being outside the closed small space of his cell he fought off the wave of dizziness brought on by the open sky this world was large and empty he had no one left in it except himself his own adequate company for three years he was reentering a world that he no longer knew at the age of twentysix haverford had anticipated this having consulted a psychologist on the issues that face prisoners going back into society the classic freudian replete with the stereotypical viennese accent had advised haverford that the subject would have become used to the limitations of his confinement and feel overwhelmed at first by the sheer space suddenly confronting him in the outside world it would be prudent the doctor warned to transfer the man to a small windowless room with voluntary access to a yard or garden so that he could gradually acclimate himself open spaces or a crowded city with its bustling population and incessant noise would be likely to upset the subject so haverford had arranged for a small room in a quiet safe house in the tokyo suburbs but from what he could learn from what there was to be learned of nicholai hel he couldnt imagine the man being easily overwhelmed or upset hel displayed preternatural selfpossession a calm that was almost condescending confidence that often crossed the line into arrogance on the surface hel appeared to be a perfect blend of his aristocratic russian mother and his samurai surrogate father the war criminal kishikawa whom he had saved from the shame of a hangmans noose with a single fingerthrust to the trachea despite his blond hair and vibrant green eyes haverford thought hel is more asian than western he even walks like an asian his arms crossed behind his back so as to take up as little space as possible and not cause inconvenience to anyone coming from the other direction his tall thin frame slightly stooped in modesty european in appearance haverford decided asian in substance well it made sense he was raised by his émigré mother in shanghai and then mentored by kishikawa when the japs took the city after the mother died kishikawa moved the boy to japan to live with and study under a master of the impossibly complicated and nuanced board game go a sort of jap chess albeit a hundredfold more difficult hel became a master in his own right so is it any wonder that hel thinks like an asian nicholai sensed the mans thoughts on him the americans are incredibly transparent their thoughts as obvious as stones at the bottom of a clear still pool he didnt care what haverford thought of him one doesnt solicit the opinions of a grocery clerk but it did annoy him shifting his attention to the sun on his face he felt it warm his skin what would you like haverford asked in the sense of what haverford chuckled most men emerging from long confinement wanted three thingsa drink a meal and a woman not necessarily in that order but he was not going to indulge hels arrogance so he answered in japanese in the sense of what would you like mildly impressed that haverford spoke japanese and interested that he refused to surrender such a small stone on the board nicholai responded i dont suppose that you could organize an acceptable cup of tea in fact haverford said ive arranged a modest chakai i hope you find it acceptable a formal tea ceremony nicholai thought how interesting a car waited at the end of the walk haverford opened the back door and ushered nicholai in the chakai was not only acceptable it was sublime nicholai savored each sip of the chanoyu as he sat crosslegged on the tatami floor next to the lacquered table the tea was transcendent as was the geisha who knelt nearby discreetly just out of hearing range of the sparse conversation to nicholais shock the functionary haverford knew his way around the tea ceremony and served with impeccable courtesy his ritual flawless upon arrival at the teahouse haverford had apologized that there were by necessity no other guests then led nicholai into the machiai the waiting room where he introduced nicholai to an exquisitely lovely geisha this is kamikosan haverford said she will serve as my hanto today kamiko bowed and handed nicholai a kimono to put on then offered him sayu a cup of the same hot water that would be used to brew the tea nicholai took a sip then as haverford excused himself to go prepare the tea kamiko took nicholai outside to the roji the dew ground a small garden that held only arrangements of rocks but no flowers they sat on the stone bench and without conversation enjoyed the tranquility a few minutes later haverford now kimonoclad walked to a stone basin and ceremonially washed his mouth and hands in the fresh water then stepped through the middle gate into the roji where he formally welcomed nicholai with a bow in turn nicholai purified himself at the tsukubai to enter the chashitsu the tearoom they had to pass through a sliding door that was only three feet high forcing them to bow an act that symbolized the divide between the physical world and the spiritual realm of the tearoom the chashitsu was exquisite elegant in its simplicity a perfect expression of shibumi as tradition demanded they first walked to an alcove on the wall of which hung the kakemono a scroll with painted calligraphy appropriate to the days occasion in his role as guest nicholai admired the skillful brushwork which depicted the japanese symbol for satori an interesting choice nicholai thought satori was the zen buddhist concept of a sudden awakening a realization of life as it really is it came not as a result of meditation or conscious thought but could arrive in the wisp of a breeze the crackle of a flame the falling of a leaf nicholai had never known satori in front of the kakemono on a small wooden stand was a bowl that held a single small maple branch they stepped over to a low table on which was a charcoal burner and a kettle as nicholai and kamiko knelt on the mat by the table haverford bowed and left the room a few moments later a gong sounded and he returned carrying the chawan a red ceramic bowl that contained a tea whisk a tea scoop and a cloth as teishu the host haverford knelt at his proper place at the table directly across the hearth from nicholai he wiped all the utensils with the cloth then filled the bowl with hot water rinsed the whisk then poured the water into a waste bowl and carefully wiped the tea bowl again nicholai found himself enjoying the old ritual but did not want to be lulled into complacency the american had obviously done his research and knew that in the few years of freedom nicholai had enjoyed in tokyo before his imprisonment he had established a formal japanese household with retainers and had observed the old rituals surely he knew that nicholai would find the chakai both nostalgic and comforting and it is both nicholai thought but be cautious haverford presented the tea scoop then opened a small container and paused to allow his guest to appreciate the aroma nicholai realized with surprise that this was koicha from plants one hundred years old grown only in the shade in certain parts of kyoto he could not imagine what this matcha might have cost then wondered what it might eventually cost him given that the americans had not gone to such extravagance for nothing pausing for precisely the correct time haverford then dipped a small ladle into the container and scooped out six measures of the finely powdered pale green tea into the chawan he used the bamboo ladle to heap hot water into the bowl then took the whisk and whipped the potion into a thin paste he examined his work then satisfied passed the bowl across the table to nicholai as ritual demanded nicholai bowed took the chawan with his right hand then passed it to his left holding it only in the palm of his hand he turned it clockwise three times and then took a long sip the tea was superb and nicholai politely finished his drink with a loud slurp then he wiped the rim of the chawan with his right hand turned it once clockwise and handed it back to haverford who bowed and took a drink now the chakai entered a less formal phase as haverford wiped the chawan again and kamiko added more charcoal to the hearth in preparation for making cups of thinner tea still there were formalities to observe and nicholai in his role as guest began a conversation about the utensils used in the ceremony the chawan is momoyama period yes he said to haverford recognizing the distinct red tincture it is beautiful momoyama yes haverford answered but not the best example they both knew that the seventeenthcentury bowl was rightfully priceless the american had gone to immense trouble and expense to arrange this modest chakai and nicholai could not help but wonder why and the american could not quite contain his satisfaction at pulling off this surprise i dont know you hel haverford thought as he sank back into his own seiza position but you dont know me either in fact ellis haverford was something quite different from the company thugs who had beaten nicholai to a bloody pulp during three days of brutal interrogation a native of manhattans upper east side he had spurned yale and harvard for columbia as he couldnt imagine anyone choosing to live anywhere but on the isle of manhattan he was majoring in oriental history and languages when pearl harbor was bombed and was therefore a natural to go into an intelligence desk job haverford refused joined the marines instead and commanded a platoon on guadalcanal and a company in new guinea purple heart and navy cross on his chest he finally conceded that his education was being wasted agreed to go into the covert side of the war and found himself training local resistance movements against the japanese in the jungles of french indochina haverford was fluent in french japanese and vietnamese and could make himself understood in some parts of china as aristocratic in his own way as hel although he came from far more money ellis haverford was one of those rare individuals who seemed comfortable in any setting including an exclusive japanese teahouse now kamiko served thin tea and brought out mukozuke a tray of light snacks sashimi and pickled vegetables the food is good nicholai said in japanese as kamiko served its garbage haverford answered pro forma but im afraid its the best i can offer i am so sorry its more than enough nicholai said unconsciously slipping into japanese manners that he had not had the opportunity to use for years you are more than kind haverford responded aware of kamikos passive attention nicholai asked shall we switch languages haverford already knew that hel spoke english french russian german chinese japanese and randomly basque so there was quite a menu from which to choose he suggested french and nicholai accepted so nicholai said you have offered me one hundred thousand dollars my liberty a costa rican passport and the home addresses of major diamond and his apprentices in exchange for my performing a service that i assume involves a murder murder is an ugly word haverford answered but you have the basic elements of the deal correct yes why me you have certain unique characteristics haverford said combined with specific skills required for the assignment such as you dont need to know that yet when do i begin nicholai asked more a question of how very well how do i begin first haverford answered we repair your face you find it unpalatable nicholai asked aware that his once handsome countenance was indeed a lopsided swollen and disjointed mess from the fists and truncheons of major diamond and his associates nicholai had worked for the americans as a translator until he had killed kishikawasan then diamond and his goons had beaten nicholai before subjecting him to mindaltering horrifying experiments with psychotropic drugs the pain had been bad enough the disfigurement still worse but what hurt nicholai even more was the loss of control the terrible helplessness the feeling that diamond and his disgusting little helpers had somehow stolen his very being and played with it the way a twisted and stupid child might have toyed with a captive animal i will deal with them in due time he thought diamond his thugs the doctor who administered the injections and observed the results on his patient with coldblooded clinical interest they will all see me again albeit briefly and just before they die right now i must come to terms with haverford who is essential to achieving my revenge at least haverford is interesting impeccably dressed obviously well educated just as obviously a scion of what passes for the aristocracy in america not at all haverford said i just believe that when you damage something you should repair it it seems only fair haverford is trying to tell me nicholai thought in a quite unamerican subtle way that he is not them but of course you are the clothes and education are but a patina on the same cracked vessel he asked what if i do not choose to be repaired then i am afraid we would have to cancel our arrangement haverford said pleasantly glad that the french softened what would be a harsh ultimatum in english your current appearance would prompt questions the answers to which dont match the cover weve taken a lot of trouble creating for you cover a new identity haverford answered reminded that while hel was an efficient killer he was nevertheless a neophyte in the larger world of espionage replete with a fictitious personal history which is what nicholai asked haverford shook his head you dont need to know yet deciding to test the board nicholai said i was quite content in my cell i could go back you could haverford agreed and we could decide to bring you to trial for the murder of kishikawa well played nicholai thought deciding that he needed to be more cautious when dealing with haverford seeing that there was no route of attack there he retreated like a slowly ebbing tide the surgery on my face i assume we are discussing surgery yes i also assume it will be painful very the recuperation period several weeks haverford answered he refilled nicholais cup then his own and nodded to kamiko to bring a fresh pot they wont be wasted however you have a lot of work to do nicholai raised an eyebrow your french haverford said your vocabulary is impressive but your accent is all wrong my french nanny would be greatly offended haverford switched to japanese a better language than french to express polite regret gomen nosei but your new dialect needs to be more southern why would that be nicholai wondered he didnt ask however not wanting to appear too curious or for that matter interested kamiko waited at their periphery then hearing him finish bowed and served the tea she was beautifully coiffed with alabaster skin and sparkling eyes and nicholai was annoyed when haverford noticed him looking and said it has already been arranged helsan thank you no nicholai said unwilling to give the american the satisfaction of correctly perceiving his physical need it would show weakness and give haverford a victory really haverford asked are you sure or else i would not have spoken nicholai thought he didnt answer the question but instead said one more thing yes i will not kill an innocent person haverford chuckled small chance of that then i accept haverford bowed nicholai struggled against unconsciousness yielding control was anathema to a man who had lived his life on the principle of firm selfpossession and it brought back memories of the pharmacological torture that the americans had inflicted on him so he fought to stay conscious but the anesthesia took its course and put him under as a boy he had commonly experienced spontaneous mental states in which he would find himself removed from the moment and lying in a serene meadow of wildflowers he didnt know how it happened or why just that it was peaceful and delicious he called these interludes his resting times and could not understand how anyone could live without them but the firebombing of tokyo the deaths of friends then hiroshima nagasaki and the arrest of his surrogate father general kishikawa as a war criminal that cultured man who had introduced him to go and to a civilized disciplined thoughtful life had robbed him of his precious resting times and try as he would he could not seem to recover the serenity that had once been natural to him tranquility was harder to achieve when they put him on an airplane with blackened windows and flew him to the united states taking him off the flight with bandages around his face as if he had been wounded he found it harder yet to maintain his equanimity when they rolled his stretcher into the hospital and put the needles into his arm and a mask over his nose and mouth he woke panicked because his arms were strapped down to the gurney its all right a female american voice said we just dont want you rolling around or touching your face i wont she chuckled not believing him nicholai would have argued further but the pain was acute like a horribly bright light shimmering in front of his eyes he blinked then controlled his breathing and sent the light to the other side of the room where he could observe it dispassionately the pain still existed but it was now a detached phenomenon interesting in its intensity ill give you a shot the nurse said it isnt necessary nicholai answered oh she said we cant have you wincing or clenching your jaw the surgery on your facial bones was very delicate i assure you that i will lie perfectly still nicholai answered through the slits that were his eyes he could now see her preparing the syringe she was a celticlooking healthy type all pale skin freckles rusty hair and thick forearms he exhaled relaxed his hands and slipped them through the bonds the nurse looked terribly annoyed are you going to make me call the doctor do what you think you must the doctor came in a few minutes later he made a show of checking the bandages that covered nicholais face clucked with the satisfaction of a hen that has just laid a splendid egg and then said the surgeries went very well i expect a successful result nicholai didnt bother with a concurring banality keep your hands off your face the doctor said to him turning to the nurse he added if he doesnt want anything for the pain he doesnt want anything for the pain when he gets tired of playing the stoic hell call you take your time getting there if you want a small measure of revenge yes doctor i do good work the doctor said to nicholai youre going to have to beat the women off with a stick it took nicholai quite a while to work through the idiom there will be some minor paralysis of some small facial muscles im afraid the doctor added but nothing you cant live with it will help you keep that indifferent front of yours nicholai never did call for the shot nor did he move camouflaged by night and the monsoons slashing rain the one they call the cobra squatted perfectly still the cobra watched the mans feet plop down in the mud and slosh onto the trail that led toward the bushes where he would do his personal business it was his routine so the cobra was expecting him the assassin had sat and waited many nights to learn the preys habits the man came closer just a few feet now from where the cobra waited in the bamboo beside the narrow footpath intent on his destination the man saw nothing as he wiped a sluice of rain from his face the cobra chose that moment to uncoil and strike the blade silver like the rain shot out and slashed the mans thigh the victim felt the odd pain looked down and pressed his hand to the bloody tear in his pants leg but it was too late the femoral artery was severed and the blood poured around his hand and through his fingers already in shock he sat down and watched his life flow into the puddle that quickly formed around him the cobra was already gone if major diamond was pleased that nicholai hel had accepted the deal he wasnt overly demonstrative in his enthusiasm hels a halfnippo nut job diamond said with scrambled brains yes haverford answered you had something to do with scrambling them didnt you he was a commie agent diamond shrugged sure hed roughed hel up a little used him as a guinea pig for some of the new pharmaceutical techniques so what they were at war with the communist bloc and it was a dirty war besides hel was an arrogant young shit that superior condescending attitude of his just made you want to hurt him diamond thought hed left him far behind when he transferred to the new cia and left japan for the southeast asian assignment but the troubling hel was like a kite tail they should have executed him when they had the chance now they were going to use him as an asset it was just like that pansyass pinko haverford another overeducated knowitall little prick shit haverford had fought with the viet minh during the war and what the hell kind of name is ellis anyway now haverford said hel was not a communist agent a soviet agent or an agent of any kind as your interrogation of him proved by the way haverford despised diamond from his looks to the core of his alleged soul the man resembled nothing more than an overstrung guitar with a pair of thin lips and drooping eyelids and the inner man was even uglier a bourgeois thug who would have been a cheerful nazi save for the accident of his american birth mores the pity diamond was the sort of intelligence officer that the army seemed to crank out like so many widgets unimaginative brutal his prejudices undisturbed by thought or education haverford hated him his class and what they threatened to do to americas relationships in asia john singleton head of the cias asia desk sat behind his broad desk observing the debate his white hair lay over his craggy face like snow on a rocky mountain his pale blue eyes were the color of ice he was truly a cold warrior in fact the coldest man that haverford had ever known singletons ruthlessness had made him a legend the éminence grise of the washington intelligence community he was respected even feared from foggy bottom to capitol hill even to pennsylvania avenue itself for good reason haverford thought compared to singleton machiavelli was a naïve choirboy and the borgias subjects of a rockwell painting standing beside singleton the devil himself would appear as the angel lucifer before the fall chief of the oss asian bureau during the war singleton was reputed responsible for guerrilla operations in china and vietnam and was even thought to have been influential in the decision to drop the bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki after the war he had politically survived the loss of china the surprise invasion of korea and even attacks from mccarthy and his cohorts in fact singleton was probably more powerful now than ever a fact that his many enemies albeit quietly attributed to his close relationship to satan now he looked across his desk at the two rival officers is hel unstable he asked haverford to the contrary haverford answered ive never met a man as selfpossessed as nicholai hel what are you in love with the guy or something diamond chimed in his mouth leering with the crude homophobic implication no im not in love with the guy haverford answered tiredly kill this mission sir diamond said to singleton its too risky and hel is a loose cannon i have much more reliable assassins in southern china that we could send to hel is perfect haverford said how so singleton asked haverford laid out his reasoning hel was fluent in chinese russian and french he was a trained martial artist who could not only execute the sanction but do so in a way that would leave the manner of death ambiguous a crucial factor in achieving the maximum positive result why is french important diamond asked smelling trouble its why we brought you in for briefing singleton said ellis hels cover will be a french arms dealer haverford said anticipating diamonds discomfiture with great pleasure selling weapons to the viet minh indeed diamonds lips bent into a grimace as that affects your indochinese bailiwick singleton said we thought you should know great diamond thought i dont have enough trouble trying to keep the frogs from punting another war without my own team sending aid to the enemy youre not telling me that youre actually going to of course not its just a cover to get hel to beijing haverford said but we didnt want you overreacting to any radar pings you might pick up diamond glared at haverford keep your boy the hell away from my turf dont worry but diamond was worried if knowledge of operation x and his real role in it ever reached washington x was an indochinese op run by the frogs so he thought he had it nicely contained now this hel business threatened contamination diamond turned to singleton sir id like to be kept current with all phases of the operation if you dont mind youll be briefed singleton assured him ellis keep him posted on everything you do yes sir and ellis if you could stay for a moment diamond left the meeting nicholai hel free he thought in the elevator he felt the involuntary tremor in his leg face it he thought youre afraid of the guy and with good reason hes a trained killer with a grudge against you and then theres operation x if theres even the slightest chance of that getting out he couldnt allow it to happen does hel know the identity of his target singleton asked haverford i havent told him yet singleton thought this over for a few moments then asked is there anything to what diamond said about hel being a loose cannon i dont think so haverford answered but ive taken the caution of providing to mix nautical metaphors an anchor singleton dismissed haverford then checked his schedule with his secretary and saw that he had a few moments for reflection he went into his private study sat down at his table and contemplated the go board in front of him hed been at this game against himself for some weeks now and the shapes of the opposing stones were slowly becoming beautiful they could almost be called graceful in the delicate interplay between the yin and yang of opposites only on the gokang did life promise perfect balance diamond would be diamond and haverford would be haverford they were virtually fixtures on the board but hel singleton moved a black stone hel would soon learn the identity of his target and would be shall we say motivated but to do what how would this go player respond it was not an exaggeration to say that the immediate future of asia depended on the complex persona of nicholai hel an anchor singleton mused how interesting solange was as lovely as her name her hair was the color of spun gold swirling with streams of amber her eyes as blue as a midday sea an aquiline nose betrayed the roman colonization of her native languedoc but her full lips could only have been french a light spray of freckles disrupted an otherwise almost monotonously perfect porcelain complexion and the soft curve of her high cheekbones prevented what might be an unfortunate severity she was tall just a head shy of nicholais height longlegged and fullbodied her breasts stretching taut the simple but elegant blue dress but it was her voice that affected nicholai the most low but gentle with that particular gallic softness that was simultaneously genteel and sensual welcome to my home monsieur i hope you will be comfortable im sure i will be solange offered her hand to be kissed as if most of his face werent obscured by bandages he took her hand in his her fingers were long and thin and kissed it the cotton of the bandage touching her skin along with his lips enchanté may i show you to your bedroom sil vous plaît said nicholai the long flight from the united states back to tokyo had tired him sil vous plaît she said gently correcting his pronunciation to hold the a sound a touch longer nicholai accepted the criticism and repeated the phrase echoing her enunciation she rewarded him with a smile of approval your nanny was from tours perhaps the purest accent in france but we need to give you an accent du midi i understand thats why im here i am from the south she told him montpellier ive never been it is beautiful she said sunny and warm and the light his bedroom was simple but tasteful the walls a yellow that was cheerful without being oppressively chirpy the spare furniture painted a middlerange blue that perfectly complemented the walls the large bed after the cot in his cell it looked massive was covered with a blue duvet a single chrysanthemum had been placed in a vase on the bedside table it is a japanese flower no solange asked yes and you have missed them yes he said feeling oddly touched thank you pas de quoi i beg your pardon the proper response would be to say je vous en prie she said but thecomment vous dites the vernacular would be il ny a pas de quoi or simply pas de quoi vous voyez très bien very good she said but roll your r on your tongue please comme ça she formed her mouth into a shape that nicholai found rather attractive très bien très bien and a bit more through the nose please he repeated the words giving the ending a nasal twang formidable she said notice the trace of a g at the end but just a ghost of one please you dont want to sound like a rustic rather a cultured man of the south are you tired or would you like to take lunch now i am more hungry than tired i have taken the liberty of preparing something she led him into a small dining room the window gave a view onto a karesansui japanese rock garden bordered by a high bamboo wall the garden had been done with skill and reminded him of the garden he had so meticulously constructed at his own home in tokyo he had found a measure of contentment in that home before making the decision to kill kishikawasama he asked am i allowed the freedom of the garden of course she said this is your home for as long as you are here which is for how long please as long as it takes you to recuperate she said effortlessly deflecting the real question then with a smile that was just mischievous she added and to learn proper french solange gestured to a chair at the table he sat down as she walked into the kitchen the room like the rest of the houses interior was completely european and he wondered where she had acquired the furnishings she probably hadnt he decided it was more likely her american masters who provided the resources to replicate a french country house albeit with a karesansui doubtless theyd calculated that he would absorb his french cover through some sort of decorative osmosis just as doubtless after consultation with a psychologist one of those priests of the new american civil religion nevertheless the room was pleasant and stimulating to the appetite so was the aroma coming from the kitchen delicate with a trace of wine perhaps and he thought he detected the musty aroma of mushrooms solange returned and set a stoneware casserole on the table removed the lid and announced coq au vin i hope you like the smell was tantalizing he said i have not had european cuisine in many years i hope it will not upset your stomach she said it is necessary though that you eat mostly french food from now on a pleasure but why solange pursed her lips into a pretty pout then answered i wish to say this delicately without giving offense please be blunt he said although he doubted that bluntness was in her repertoire as it is she said you smell like a japanese il faut que vous ayez lodeur dun vrai français i see it was so of course in his prison cell he could discern the nationality of someone coming down the corridor by his odor the americans had that beef smell on them the russians the strong scent of potato the japanese guards smelled of fish and vegetables and solange all he could smell was her perfume may i serve she asked please she ladled out a healthy portion of the rich chicken and wine dish then took some asparagus spears from another dish and put them on his plate then she poured him a glass of rich red wine it is good to serve the same wine in which you braised the chicken good french wine monsieur call me nicholai eh bien nicholai she answered please call me solange what a lovely name she blushed and it was very pretty then she sat down and served herself but waited for him to taste his food when he did she asked do you like its extraordinary he was telling the truth the flavors subtle yet distinct burst in his mouth and the taste of the wine recalled boyhood meals at home with his mother perhaps he thought i might take up european wine if i survive my compliments to the chef she bowed her head merci you made this he asked surprised i love to cook she said ive had little chance these past few years so it is a great joy solange took up her fork and ate with a relish that would have been considered unbecoming in a japanese woman but in her was quite appealing a joie de vivre that nicholai hadnt seen during the long years of war the hungry occupation the lonely prison it was a pleasure to watch her enjoy the meal after a few minutes he said so the man i am meant to imitate he ate french food even in asia i believe so how did he manage that money she answered as if it were obvious money makes all things possible is that why you work for the americans he asked instantly regretting it and wondering why he felt an impulse to offend her tout le monde solange said everyone works for the americans now including you mon ami she thought smiling at him she got up from her chair i made a tarte tatin would you like some that would be nice coffee i would prefer tea if you have it coffee for you now nicholai she said un express avec une cigarette she left for a minute then returned with the apple tarte a small pot of espresso and a pack of gauloises and set them on the table i apologize for my rudeness nicholai said i have become unused to conversation pas de quoi she liked that he apologized the tarte was delicious the coffee surprisingly more so nicholai sat back in his chair and solange nudged the pack of cigarettes toward him take two she said light them and give one to me seriously she laughed didnt you ever go to the cinema no it always seemed an odd concept to him to sit and stare at other peoples fantasies projected through a strip of celluloid i love the cinema solange said i wanted to be an actress nicholai thought to ask what had prevented her certainly she was attractive enough but then decided that the answer might cause her sadness so he refrained instead he shook two cigarettes from the pack put them both in his mouth then struck a match and lit them when the tip of one glowed he handed it to her formidable solange said paul henreid would be jealous nicholai had no idea what she meant but he inhaled the smoke and endured a spasm of coughing it hurt where the stitches were its been a while he said when he recovered apparently she laughed at him but he didnt feel in the least offended or embarrassed it was more as if they were sharing an amusing moment and he started to laugh himself again it hurt a little bit and he realized that it had been a very long time since hed laughed with another person solange discerned his thought it is good no we have not lived through laughing times i think you and me nor the world at large nicholai said she refilled his wine glass then her own lifted it and said to better times to better times you must learn to smoke nicholai she said all frenchmen smoke i sneaked cigarettes when i was a boy in shanghai nicholai answered the chinese smoke like chimneys smoke and spit we can do without the spitting i think after lunch he strolled in the garden it had been very well done indeed pathways led around an area of gravel carefully raked to replicate the ripples of the ocean a small island of short grass and stone in the middle of the sea represented the mountains of japan shrubs had been perfectly placed around the path to offer a fresh perspective at every curve like life itself nicholai thought the next few weeks passed in pleasant routine nicholai woke early and went into the garden to meditate when he came out solange had a café au lait and a croissant ready for him and while it took him some time to get used to the concept of bread for breakfast he came to enjoy it after breakfast they engaged in conversation during which she corrected his accent and suggested current slang and vernacular solange was an exacting taskmistress which nicholai appreciated for her part solange knew that the slightest slip a careless anachronism or a lapse into a stilted formality could cost him his life so she pushed him hard insisted on perfection challenged his intellect and considerable talent for languages he exceeded her expectations his pride made him a superb student they conversed through lunch and then nicholai took his customary walk in the garden knowing that he needed solitude she was discreet enough never to accept his polite invitation to join him instead she had a small rest before starting preparations for dinner when he came back they would go over maps of montpellier photographs of certain cafés restaurants and landmarks that a native would know she quizzed him about the place steanne the marketplace who sold the best peaches where one could get a decent bottle of wine for a price following the afternoon study session nicholai repaired to his room to rest study and bathe which he did in a gloriously hot japanese tub he emerged from the nearscalding water delightfully refreshed and then dressed for dinner which was always french and always superb after dinner they had a coffee and a cognac conversed casually perhaps listened to a little radio until solange retired to her bedroom then nicholai changed into a gi and went out into the garden for his nightly ritual at first solange peeked through her window blinds to watch him perform the intricate maneuvers of the kata the repetitive martial arts routines of hoda korosu naked kill he appeared to be dancing but after a few nights of watching solange started to perceive that he was fighting numerous imaginary enemies coming at him from all directions and that the motions of the dance were in fact defensive blocks followed by lethal strikes if it was a dance it was a dance of death nicholai enjoyed these sessions very much it was a joy to exercise in the garden it calmed his mind and spirit and besides his instinct told him that he might very well need to polish his rusty skills to survive the mission the target of which haverford would still not disclose so nicholai exercised with a purpose glad to find that his mind and body responded even after the years of relative inactivity although he did thousands of pressups and situps in his cell and that the complicated and subtle movements of the hoda korosu kata came back to him he had started studying naked kill during his second year in tokyo the rarefied form of karate which itself means empty hand was taught by an old japanese master of the lethal art who at first refused to teach an apparent westerner the ancient secrets but nicholai persevered mostly by kneeling in a painful position at the edge of the mat and watching night after night until finally the master called him over and administered a beating that was the first of many lessons essential to hoda korosu was the mastery of ki the internal life force that came from the proper management of breath it was ki flowing through the body from the lower abdomen to every vein muscle and nerve in the body that gave the hoda korosu strikes their lethal force especially at close range the other necessary element was the ability to calm the mind to free it for the creativity to find a lethal weapon among common objects that might be at hand in the suddenness of an unexpected attack as he resumed his practice now the first few nights were brutal in their clumsiness and would have been appalling had he not found his ineptitude almost comical but his quickness and strength developed quickly and it wasnt long before he reacquired some skill and even a measure of grace his master had taught him sometimes with a bamboo rod across the back to train with utter seriousness to picture his enemies as he dispatched them and nicholai did this as he slid back and forth across the garden repeating the lengthy kata dozens of times before he stopped his gi soaked with sweat then he treated himself to a quick bath collapsed into bed and was soon asleep one morning two weeks into his stay solange surprised him by saying this is a big day for you nicholai how so the unveiling so to speak of you of course she said your face he had gone to the doctors office once a week for the hefty irish nurse to change his wrappings none too gently at that but she had deliberately kept him away from a mirror until the healing process was complete so this would be the first time that he would see his reconstructed face if he was at all nervous or anxious he didnt betray it it was as if solange had told him that they were going to see a photo exhibit or a film he seemed detached if it were me she thought i would be a mess he was as cool as a march morning placid as a still pond the doctor said that i could do it solange said now nicholai asked if you wish nicholai shrugged it would be nice to have the bandages off certainly but he wasnt really all that curious about his face he had sat in solitary confinement for those years where it really didnt matter what one looked like there was no one there to react except the guards but suddenly he felt a twinge of anxiety which surprised and displeased him suddenly it did matter to him what he looked like and he realized that it was because of her i care what she thinks he marveled to himself im afraid of how shell react when the bandages come off and i am still ugly he didnt know that such feelings still resided in him remarkable he thought im ready nicholai said they went into the bathroom she sat him down on a stool in front of the mirror stood behind him and gently unwrapped the bandages he was beautiful there is no other word for it solange thought he is a beautiful man his emerald green eyes stood out now against the high sharp cheekbones his long jaw was strong his dimpled chin cute without being at all effeminate and he was youthfullooking far younger than his twentysix years even with all hed been through bravo doctor solange said are you pleased im relieved nicholai thought seeing the smile on her face she would have feigned the smile in any case but he was relieved that the surgeons apparent skill had saved them both that indignity he said im not sure that i recognize myself you are very handsome you think so listen to you fishing for a compliment solange said yes i think so you are very handsome but now you make me feel so old youre beautiful and you know it but fading she says perhaps i should go see this doctor haverford came that afternoon he inspected nicholais face as if it were a product to be testmarketed and then pronounced it satisfactory he did a good job im pleased that youre pleased nicholai answered they sat down in the dining room haverford spread a file out on the table and without preamble began you are michel guibert twentysix years old born in montpellier france when you were ten years old your family moved to hong kong to pursue your fathers importexport business you survived the japanese occupation because your family were residents of vichy france and therefore at peace with the axis powers by the time the war ended you were old enough to go into the family business which was arms haverford said la famille guibert has been in the weapons black market since the ballandmusket era is there an actual guibert family nicholai asked or is this a total fiction papa guibert is quite real haverford answered and does he have a son he did haverford answered he spread out photographs of what certainly could have been a young nicholai happily playing in a chinese courtyard helping the cooks smiling over a birthday cake sadly michel was in a terrible car crash disfiguring im told requiring massive reconstructive surgery he looks somewhat like his old self did you arrange for this accident nicholai asked no answered haverford my god do you think were monsters mmmmmm the mother she died just recently you were very torn up about it you amaze and appall me nicholai said youve matured quite a bit haverford continued you used to have quite the reputation as a gambler and ladies man and papa banished you back to france for the last three years you blew a shitload of the familys money at monaco repented of your profligate ways and have returned to redeem yourself how so nicholai asked you dont need to know yet haverford answered study the file solange will help quiz you on the details when youre thoroughly conversant with your new past ill brief you on your new future my new future nicholai thought what a uniquely american concept perfect in its naïve optimism only the americans could have a new future as opposed to an old one now we need to take some photos haverford said why because they were assembling a file on guibert explained haverford no one in the arms trade would go very long in this day and age without acquiring a jacket in every major intelligence service in the game the photos would be placed in cia deuxième bureau and mi files then leaked to the chinese through moles photos of michel guibert would be inserted into old kuomintang police files that the reds were currently sifting through the wizards in the lab would make guibert appear on streets in kowloon casinos in monaco and the docks of marseille by the time were done haverford chirped youll believe youre michel guibert and that you sat out the war in hong kong as a matter of fact from now on you answer to michel and only michel not nicholai got it michel as difficult a concept as that might be nicholai answered i believe i have a grasp of it yes solange came back into the room carrying a stack of clothes that she draped over the back of a chair your new wardrobe michel très chic she went back out to get more nicholai examined the clothes which appeared to be secondhand of course they were he thought it makes perfect sense when you step into someones life you step into his clothes and those clothes would be worn not new he examined the labels some of the older clothes were from a tailor in kowloon but most were french and mostly from expensivesounding shops in marseille a few of the shirts and two of the suits came from monaco all of them were expensive and of lightweight fabrics silk and cotton there were several pairs of twill khaki trousers pleated of course it seemed that michel favored white and khaki suits with colorful shirts and no ties and the clothes smelled of sweat tobacco and cologne you have to give the devil his due nicholai thought haverford had been nothing if not thorough solange returned with more clothes stood with the tip of her index finger to her lips and contemplated the wardrobe and nicholai let me see what shall you wear for the first shot it is set in hong kong no her serious concentration on this makebelieve was quite charming she selected a shirt put it back chose another and matched it with a suit this yes ouiparfait she handed the selections to nicholai and ordered him to go change when he came back from the bedroom dressed as michel haverford had a camera ready they went out in the garden to get a blurred outdoor background in what became a painfully tedious afternoon for nicholai they repeated this process numerous times solange having a wonderful time however selecting michels ensembles that was excruciating nicholai said after haverford finally left it was fun solange answered i love fashion and michel has a sense no you chose all those clothes didnt you of course she said you dont think id let them dress you out of fashion do you after a dinner of suprêmes de poulet à lestragon with green beans à la provençale a dessert of tarte aux poires et à la frangipane and the requisite espresso cognac and cigarette nicholai studied the guibert file the fiction was impressive in its volume and detail but nicholai had no trouble memorizing apparently important trivia such as which tabac michel favored in montpellier his fathers choice in whiskey or his mothers maiden name his mind crammed with such detail he changed into his gi went to the garden to perform his kata bathed and went to bed his proximity sense woke him during his years in prison he developed an almost extrasensory awareness of the presence of another living being a radarlike perception of the intruders exact distance and angle of approach now someone was in the room in the space of a second his mind ran through the possibilities and he selected the vase on the bedside table as the best most easily reached weapon then he smelled the chanel no and felt her presence enough moonlight came through the shutters to reveal solange standing in the doorway her body more revealed than hidden by the filmy black peignoir three years is a long time to be without a woman she said too long i think no her perfume filled his head as she came to the bed and kissed his mouth his ears his neck his chest and then slid down he was dizzy with pleasure as she did delicious things with her mouth and long elegant fingers and it wasnt long before he gasped solange please stop im afraid ill and i dont want to before solange stopped laughed gently and said after three years mon cher i think you will recover quickly no she resumed her ministrations and soon he felt the unstoppable wave roll through his body his back arched like the most powerful samurai bow and she held him tight with her full lips until he sank back onto the bed très fort she whispered in his ear as she slid up his body well after three years she laughed and rested her head on his chest her hair felt wonderful on his skin they rested for a little bit and then he felt himself recovering i told you so she said as her hand reached down to stroke him i want you inside me are you wet she guided his hand for him to feel for himself oh yes my darling for weeks now she lowered herself onto him nicholai couldnt believe her sheer beauty as he watched her rise and fall on him her blue eyes shone with excitement pinpoints of sweat appeared on her long neck her rich mouth smiled with pleasure he reached up and caressed her heavy breasts so different from the delicate japanese women he had known and she moaned her approval her loveliness the wet heat of her wrapped him in pleasure he took her by the waist and turned her over so that he was on top of her then pressed his lips into the crook of her neck and thrust into her steadily and insistently but without hurry vocal in her arousal she throatily whispered and then shouted the dirtiest of french obscenities as she encouraged him dug her long nails into his buttocks and pushed him harder his sweat mixed with hers they slid together and then she announced her petite mort her hips rose off the bed she held him inside her and said vous me faites briller vous me faites jouir come with me now her voice and words sent him over the edge there was no holding back and he poured himself into her then collapsed on her and felt her breasts flatten beneath him they lay there for quite a while then he heard her say i suppose it would be cliché to want a cigarette nicholai got up found a pack put two cigarettes into his mouth lit them both and handed her one so lovemaking was added to their daily routine although the sex was hardly routine solange delighted in dressing up for the boudoir and had a seemingly inexhaustible repertoire of lingerie that she enjoyed modeling for him nor was nicholai loath to be the audience for this erotic fashion show as she changed her hair her makeup and even her scent to suit the outfit her taste was exquisite daringly erotic without ever crossing the line into the burlesque always stylish never obvious her tastes in bed were eclectic as well and she gave nicholai every part of herself reveled in his taking her as genteel as she was at the dining table she was equally surprisingly earthy in the bedroom you have the mouth of a sailor he told her one night without a trace of disapproval but you love my mouth no she answered and then proceeded to prove to him that he did nicholai did love her mouth her hands her fingers sa cramouille sa rose he was fast coming to the truth that he simply loved her one night after a particularly robust lovemaking session she inhaled her postcoital cigarette and said no offense michel but you make love like a japanese nicholai was a bit taken aback but more curious than offended is that bad no no no she said quickly it is not bad is just different than a frenchman a bit comment vous dites a bit technical no if you are a frenchman you must make love dune manière plus sensuelle a bit more like music than science she knew sadly that he would soon leave to perform the errand for the americans and as a man he had needs and would satisfy those needs perhaps in a brothel the girls would talk and if they talked of a frenchman who made love like a japanese it would not do is this part of my training he asked staring hard at her he looked hurt are you part of my training for all your boyish looks she said refusing to lower her eyes in shame looking right back at him naiveté nevertheless does not become you are you asking me if i am a whore for the americans my darling we are both whores for the americans i fuck for them you kill for them dont look so hurt i adore making love to you vous me faites briller you make me shine no he heard the formal vous as opposed to the more intimate tu and wondered if she perceived their relationship as only business in any case solange taught him how to make love like a frenchman two nights later they tried to kill him nicholai was halfway through a difficult kata tiger burst through bamboo when his proximity sense told him that he was not alone in the garden the first assassin clad all in black a wicked dagger in his right hand dropped down the wall in front of him nicholai saw his wouldbe killers eyes focus slightly over his shoulder so knew that there was another assassin coming up from behind the dagger thrust came low where nicholai expected it he shifted into a cat stance and swung his right hand in a low outward crescent sweeping the knife hand away from his body then he stepped in grabbed the attacker by the collar of his gi and pulled him down pivoted and slammed his head into the garden wall he heard the neck break but didnt stop to look as he ducked under the hatchet blade that the second assailant swung at his head nicholai came up and jammed his left hand poised into a tigers claw into the mans eyes the other into his groin dropping his left hand nicholai locked the elbow of the arm holding the hatchet and lifted himself onto his toes the arm snapped like dry wood the hatchet dropped nicholai spun so that his back was to the attacker and he drove an elbow into the mans solar plexus he released the broken arm spun again and delivered a shuto strike to the carotid artery the man dropped to the ground nicholai knelt beside him felt his pulse and cursed himself for striking too hard his skill had not returned to the point where he could precisely calibrate the force of a blow and the man was dead this was unfortunate because he would have liked to question him to find out who had sent him and why clumsy nicholai told himself clumsy and imprecise you will have to improve he went back into the house and used the telephone to dial the number that haverford had given him for emergencies when the american answered nicholai said there are two corpses in the garden i imagine you will want to remove them stay inside ill have a cleanup team there right away nicholai hung up solange was standing in the doorway looking at him she wore a simple white silk robe held in place by a wide silk belt tied in a bow that begged for tugging a kitchen knife was clutched in her right hand held low by her thigh and her amazing green eyes blazed she looked to nicholai as if she were indeed ready to kill someone are you all right she asked im fine a bit more winded than id like to be perhaps he wondered at his lack of emotion then decided that the adrenaline surge had yet to recede and was masking whatever he might feel about his close call and the killing of two men nicholai looked at the knife in her hand and asked were you going to use that if i had to she answered are they dead yes you are sure quite sure solange walked into the kitchen and came back with two squat glasses of whiskey i dont know about you but i need one nicholai took the drink and knocked it back in one swallow perhaps he speculated i feel a bit more than i thought you are trembling a little she said perceptions to the contrary nicholai answered i am not a practiced killer it was true he had killed kishikawasan out of love something a western mind would struggle to understand but that act of mercy could not inure him against the professional dispatching of two sentient beings who despite the fact that they tried to kill him first were still human as the adrenaline faded he felt an odd contradictory mix of elation and regret solange nodded her understanding the cleanup crew arrived before nicholai and solange could finish a second drink haverford uncharacteristically dressed in an untucked shirt and blue jeans came in through the kitchen door my god are you okay im fine nicholai answered what the hell happened haverford asked nicholai told him about the assault omitting the details of his counterattack only saying that he was sorry to have killed the second man he could hear the soft sounds of the crew working outside removing the bodies wiping up the blood restoring the pebbled paths to their pristine order as if he thought nothing had ever happened the head of the crew came in whispered something to haverford and left they were japs haverford said nicholai shook his head chinese or at least in the employ of the chinese haverford looked at him curiously the japanese dont use hatchets nicholai explained the chinese do and only chinese tongs typically besides no japanese assassin would have fallen so easily for the angry monk paints the wall someone in china wants me or michel guibert dead ill get on it haverford answered and ill increase security around here dont nicholai said security will only draw attention the interesting question is how did they know where i was haverford frowned and nicholai enjoyed his discomfiture a welcome crack in the wall of his confidence almost worth a near death to see the agent said we should probably move you please dont nicholai answered its pleasant here and theres really very little danger if the assassins were japanese they would try again and again until they succeeded but the chinese think differently they would never repeat a failed stratagem im safe until i leave here haverford nodded could i have some of that scotch after haverford and the cleanup crew left nicholai and solange went to bed but did not make love neither of them felt particularly sexual after the events of the evening they lay in silence for a long time until nicholai said i am very sorry please accept my apology what for for bringing bloodshed into your home solange could see the shame on his young face truly it was the end of youth this killing business she knew that any decent person who still had a soul felt revulsion at the taking of life and she knew that she couldnt remove his pain only share it with him make him know that he was not a monster but a flawed human being trying to exist in a flawed world do you think she asked i have not seen bloodshed before her head on his chest his arm around her she told him her story she was a beautiful child the pride of the quartier even as a little girl her skin her eyes her hair the perfect bone structure of her face made her a treasure as she grew into adolescence the men of the neighborhood stole shamed sidelong glances while strangers in the city at large were not so polite verbally expressing their desires in graphic terms mama guarded her daughters virtue zealously she gave her a cultured religious education with the sisters took her to church every sunday and on all days of holy obligation most of all she went to great lengths to keep from solange the knowledge of how her nice clothes and new pairs of shoes were paid for there was sometimes a little money left over for solange to go to the cinema and she would sit in the lovely cool darkness watch the silver fantasies play in front of her and dream of one day becoming an actress herself everyone said that she was certainly pretty enough her mother disapproved actresses were little better than whores solange met louis at a formal dance held between their two schools and she found him distressingly attractive he was tall and thin with wavy brown hair and warm brown eyes and he was intelligent and charming the son of a prominent city doctor he was relatively rich but nevertheless a passionate communist he was also passionate about solange he truly cared for her but could not help but test her virtue as they sat under trees along the banks of the canal or in the cinema or even at his house at the rare times his parents werent home or at her apartment when her mother was out mama was terrified at the beauty she had become proud yes but fearful and she began to lecture her incessantly on the evils of men they only want sex she harangued and your precious louis is no different but dont give in only a salope sleeps with men without marriage one night louis walked her past a large fourstory house what is it solange asked its a brothel louis said at the very moment the door opened and solange saw her mother step out to take a smoke her black hair was disheveled her lips were puffy she lit her cigarette and turned to see solange staring up at her go home she said her voice breaking please solange go now but solange just stood there in shock finally louis took her by the arm and led her away the nazis came to the south of france later that year after the allies invaded north africa german soldiers occupied the city the police helped them locate jews la résistance organized and the gestapo came in to track them down the head of the gestapo in montpellier was a certain colonel hoeger and one afternoon he stepped out of his headquarters to enjoy the sunshine and ended up enjoying the sight of solange as well look at that creature he said to his captain how old do you think she is sixteen seventeen that face hoeger said and the body find out about her shes a child look at her shes ripe madame settes had become the brothel of choice for the german occupation forces and madame was rapidly becoming a wealthy woman as for solange she had become used to her mothers occupation having learned the sad lesson that what was once unbearable becomes commonplace with time she and mama had a civil if emotionally distant relationship and marie even came to feel somewhat relieved that she no longer had to disguise what she did solange even went to madame settes from time to time to bring her mother a meal or deliver a lipstick she had forgotten or some other minor errand the girls took to calling her little miss prim but gradually with some affection and every time madame saw her she would importune her to consider coming in to make some real money solange of course always refused she turned more and more to louis they spent virtually all their free time together although louis was very busy with his studies at montpelliers excellent and ancient medical school he was busier with the resistance even more passionate about his communism now that he lived cheek by jowl with facism a messenger at first he rode his bicycle around the city with coded messages hidden inside his medical texts but it wasnt long before his intelligence and courage brought him to the attention of the leaders and they began to give him more responsibility with them came greater risk and it terrified solange she knew of the torture chambers in the basement of gestapo headquarters had heard the firing squads and carefully avoided the scenes of gallows that had been hastily constructed for captured resistance she begged him to be careful of course he said that he would but he also found the dangers exhilarating and he returned from missions with an already keen joie de vivre honed to an edge louis wanted to live and that included making love to this beautiful girl whom he did love very much but she turned him down i dont want to become my mother solange was bringing her mother a tin of hot soup marie had a slight cold and colonel hoeger was sitting in the parlor his face was flushed with drink as he looked at her with delighted surprise do you work here no thats a pity he looked her up and down slowly and lasciviously not troubling to disguise his want do you have a name yes hoegers tone sharpened what is it solange solange said hoeger tasting it as he wished to taste her a lovely name for a lovely girl three days later hoeger made a direct approach he waited outside until he saw solange coming across the square and then approached her bonjour mademoiselle bonjour monsieur is there something fascinating on the sidewalk solange no sir then look at me please she looked up at him apologizing for his rude behavior at the brothel he now made a direct offer civilized he called it she would not be a whore but his mistress he would provide her with a suitable apartment a budget for clothing and some luxuries and appropriate really quite generous gifts from time to time in exchange she would well certainly she knew what she would provide in exchange certainly they didnt have to go into such details did they solange slapped him hoeger had not been slapped since he was a boy and he actually glanced around the square to see if anyone had noticed then remembered himself and said you are very rude as opposed to yourself sir who has just made an immoral proposition to a seventeenyearold girl you are free to go bon aprèsmidi bon aprèsmidi solange was home before she gave in to her terror she trembled for a good ten minutes made a cup of tea and sat down at the kitchen table to compose herself louis came over but she told him nothing of the encounter lest he do something foolishly gallant two days later louis was arrested it was a week from a zola novel solange told nicholai now lying with her head in the crook of his arm one of the bad ones she said it ironically dismissing the possibility of selfpity but nicholai heard the deeply buried hurt in her voice as she continued her story they caught louis redhanded stopped him on his bicycle and found the coded messages in his anatomy text they hauled him to the cellar of gestapo headquarters where hoeger went to work on him the handsome boy was quickly handsome no longer unfortunately for louis he was brave loyal and committed and would not reveal names solange heard about it that afternoon she went to her room and sobbed then washed her face combed her hair and put on the prettiest dress she owned examined her image and undid the top two buttons to reveal a deep décolletage sitting in front of the mirror in her mothers bedroom she applied makeup the way she had seen the whores do it then she walked to gestapo headquarters and asked to see colonel hoeger shown into his office she stood in front of his desk made herself look him in the eyes and said if you release louis duchesne i will give myself to you now and anytime that you wish in any way hoeger looked at her and blinked solange said i know that you want me he burst into laughter hoeger laughed until tears ran down his fleshy cheeks and then he took a handkerchief from his pocket wiped his eyes and got up get out of my office the nerve of you do you think i would risk my career betray my country just for the honor of breaking your cherry for you solange stood her ground can i see him certainly hoeger answered you can see him hanged thursday noon in the square around the gallows where five ropes dangled from the crossbeam a crowd formed and stood in sullen silence until a german army truck pulled up soldiers jumped out the back first then hauled out a group of prisoners five in all who had been sentenced to death louis was the last taken out there was nothing romantic about it nothing heroic louis looked badly beaten limp and in shock his hands tied behind him as they dragged him up to the gallows standing there in just a bloodstained white shirt and dirty brown trousers he peered out at the crowd uncomprehendingly and solange wondered if he was looking for her i should have given myself to him she thought i should have loved him completely i should have taken him inside me wrapped myself around him and never let him loose a soldier went down the line he finally came to louis jerked his head back roughly put the noose around his neck then bent down and tied his ankles together at the colonels orders they put no hoods over the condemned heads louis looked terrified other soldiers formed a line between the crowd and the gallows lest anyone try to interfere or run up and pull on the legs of the hanged to break their necks and abbreviate their agony solange forced herself to watch an officer shouted an order there was a crack of metal and wood and louis dropped his neck jerked and he bounced then he hung there twisting his legs kicking his eyes bulging his tongue obscenely thrust out of his mouth as his face turned red and then blue finally it seemed like forever he was still solange walked away through the crowd she heard a mans voice say he was a hero what it was patrice reynaud a railway conductor who had been a friend of louis patrice kept walking but repeated he was a hero your louis your louis solange thought if only i had let him be my louis that night she walked over to la maison de madame sette and went into the womans little office i am ready to begin work she said madame looked at her skeptically why now chérie why not now madame solange answered why delay the reality of life your mother will not like it marie didnt she yelled she lectured she wept i didnt want this kind of life for you i wanted something better for you so did i solange thought life decided otherwise madame sette of course was delighted and decided to make an event of it she spent an entire week promoting the auctioning off of solanges virginity the girl would fetch a very high price i will give you half madame told her that is more than i usually give half is fine solange answered put it away dont squander it madame advised her put your savings in the bank work hard and someday you can open up a little shop of your own a woman should have her own money in this world her own business yes madame the big night arrived and the parlor was packed with german officers most of the local frenchmen would have nothing to do with this and those that would had been intimidated by word from the resistance that it would not treat gently any man who bid for the virtue of a martyrs girl solange let madame dress her for the occasion a crude mockery of wedding garb the white diaphanous gown concealed little her white lace headpiece was set gently on her hair that fell freely and shining down her back adding to the image of virginity her makeup was slight and subtle a little pencil to widen her already beautiful eyes and just a shade of blush appropriate to a young bride solange felt disgust disgust when madame insisted on examining her to verify her purity disgust when she was being dressed up for the ceremonial travesty disgust as she sat in the bridal suite and prepared herself for the event disgust when she was led into the room which fell instantly silent as men swallowed their lust disgust when madame started the bidding high and it quickly went higher as the men were willing to spend small fortunes to have what they saw beneath the wedding gown hoeger sat silent his position and authority speaking for him he let the bidding rise to an unprecedented height then lifted the index finger of his right hand the bidding stopped right there no one certainly not his subordinate officers had the nerve to outbid the commander of the citys gestapo madame quickly counted three and closed the bidding hoeger took solange by the arm and led her down the hallway to the bridal suite he stripped off the dress threw her down on the bed and took her solange moaned she groaned in pleasure called him her man told him to do it harder told him it was wonderful he was wonderful said if she only knew she would have let him before let him anytime she bucked and tensed screamed as she came you beautiful creature he panted i had no idea she sighed so much pleasure he closed his eyes went back at it intent on his own pleasure she reached under the mattress for the knife that reynaud had given her brought it up and slashed his throat the resistance got her out of the brothel and hid her in the back of a produce truck then in a small cellar in the slums of marseille she was in the tight dark space for three weeks and thought she might lose her mind before they finally took her out and up into the air into the light she still had nightmares there was plenty of work for her there in the brothels frequented by the germans her job was to listen to pick up bits and pieces and as a result trains were derailed messages intercepted resistance fighters escaped just before the gestapo came for them and if one of the officers was gunned down at his favorite café or outside of his mistresss place all the better solange never went home in the hungry winter of she returned to the only work she knew becoming the mistress of an american officer when he was rotated home she found another then another this last one begged to marry her and take her back to texas but she told him not to be so foolish shortly after she met an oss officer who said that they might have use for a woman like her with that solange finished her story nicholai held her close until she finally fell asleep in the morning nicholai summoned haverford and demanded to know the identity of the person he was meant to terminate as im a target now myself nicholai said over coffee and croissant i think i have the right to know solange left the house earlier to buy groceries haverford listened seemed to seek a response in the milk swirling around in his cup then looked up and answered youre right its time so the soviet commissioner to red china haverford said yuri voroshenin the name hit nicholai like a hard slap but and perhaps only thanks to the minor paralysis of his facial muscles he managed to keep his expression placid as he feigned a lack of recognition and asked why eliminate him korea haverford answered egged on by the soviets the madman kim had invaded south korea and the united states was forced to intervene when macarthurs counterattack pushed to the yalu river near the border with china mao felt that his hand had been forced and sent three hundred thousand troops into korea the united states and china were at war worse the conflict isolated china from the west and forced it to accept soviet hegemony thereby creating a solid communist bloc from the elbe to the shores of the pacific we have to drive a wedge between beijing and moscow haverford concluded by assassinating this voroshenin nicholai asked what good will that do well hand the russians sufficient evidence to blame the chinese haverford explained the chinese will of course know that they didnt do it and conclude that the soviets sacrificed one of their own in order to blame the chinese and demand further concessions perhaps permanent bases in manchuria its a classic go ploy nicholai thought to sacrifice a line of stones to lure your enemy into a misapprehension of your strategy uncharacteristic of americans who reveled in the childlike game of checkers a deeper mind was behind this maneuver it could be haverford but certainly he lacked the position to authorize a killing at this high level who is it then nicholai wondered who is this go player tell me about voroshenin he said disabuse yourself of the notion that were sending you to murder some innocent diplomat haverford told nicholai yuri andreovitch voroshenin was a highranking member of the kgb a fact that the chinese knew and deeply resented above all else haverford warned our boy yuri is a survivor he laid out what the cia knew about yuri voroshenin born in st petersburg in the son of a schoolteacher voroshenin was a committed revolutionary even as a boy by the time he was fifteen he had spent time in three tsarist jails at seventeen he barely escaped a traitors noose and was exiled to siberia the bolsheviks ordered him to join the army in and he surfaced as a leader of the mutiny that sent soldiers streaming home from the front haverford took out a photograph that showed a young voroshenin in an army greatcoat and soldiers peaked cap tall and thin with the typical wirerimmed spectacles of the leftwing russian intellectual he sported an open happy grin that was unusual for an earnest revolutionary the great year of found him home now an agent in the petrograd division of the allrussian extraordinary commission to combat counterrevolution and sabotage the vchk the cheka violence was rife in the hungry city demobilized soldiers shot robbed and raped mobs looted churches stores and the homes of the rich the wives and daughters of bankers generals and tsarist officials sold themselves as prostitutes to feed starving families nicholai knew all about the petrograd cheka you neednt enlighten me nicholai said my mother told me the stories the cheka began the red terror a war of extermination against its class enemies shooting dozens sometimes even hundreds of white russians in any single day without trial or due process voroshenin cheerfully participated in the slaughter why bother with a commissariat of justice he asked once in a party meeting lets just call it the commissariat for social extermination and get on with it they got on with it his tortures became the stuff of nightmares he tied captured white officers to planks and slowly fed them into furnaces he shoved prisoners into nailstudded barrels and rolled them down hills he peeled the skin off captives hands to create gloves of flesh his name became a tool that mothers used to frighten their children in he helped suppress the mutiny at the naval base at kronstad accomplished with great bloodshed then he turned his attention to striking workers in the starving freezing city through the firing squad the truncheon and the torture cell he reestablished order then began tearing down sections of the city to provide fuel for the rest of it all this activity brought him to the attention of the rising power in moscow joseph stalin he next shows up in china haverford went on in of all places shanghai it was after all at stalins insistence that the nationalists slaughtered the communists there in and uncle joe thought chiang kaishek could use an adviser experienced in such matters nicholai was just a small boy when this happened but he nevertheless remembered it he used to prowl the streets of shanghai knew the reds from the greens and when the shootings stabbings and beheadings of thousands of young reds occurred it was for him childhoods end we lose track of him for the next fifteen years haverford said no one knows where he was or what he was doing but its a pretty fair bet that he was involved in the trotsky assassination in mexico as well as stalins staged murder of sergei kirov as a pretext for his great purges of the s the purge turned on voroshenin himself the dictators paranoia led him to imprison and execute his most gifted and ruthless subordinates especially those who had stories to tell and yuri was tossed into moscows dreaded lubyanka prison voroshenins career should have ended there with a bullet in the back of his head but as noted he was a survivor who used all his craft guile and courage to survive his interrogations he became a source of information too valuable to kill and he sat in his cell for three long years listening to the screams of less talented men hearing their executions and waiting for a moment of opportunity prison teaches you patience voroshenin later said it does nicholai agreed to haverfords blush hitler opened the prison door when he invaded russia faced with destruction stalin could no longer afford to keep his best people locked up voroshenin was quickly rehabilitated and released yuri landed on his feet again rather than be sent to the killing grounds of the war against germany he used his former connection to the kuomintang to be assigned back to china and found himself reunited with chiang kaishek in chongqing his assignment was not to help the generalissimo fight the japanese but to track down mao and his communists whom stalin accurately viewed as a potential future rival voroshenin had no problem fighting against his brother marxists no longer a true believer he had lost his faith in lubyanka and was now a hardened cynic believing in the advance of nothing except yuri voroshenin to that end he would ally himself with anyone and as easily betray them haverford showed nicholai another photograph of a khakiclad voroshenin standing outside a daoist temple with chiang bareheaded his hairline receding into a widows peak his skin pale and drawn from the years in prison there was still a vitality about him his shoulders were wide if a little stooped and he had certainly put on no weight since his youth a handsome man powerful he loomed over chiang as both men pretended to study a map for the benefit of the photographer our man yuri stayed with the nats through the whole war and then some haverford said when stalin called all his agents back from china he was afraid theyd been contaminated by mao so he had them purged again voroshenins head should have been the first on the block but he was the first to inform on his comrades and became the supervisor rather than the prime victim of the purge voroshenin personally conducted the interrogations directed the torture supervised the executions in some cases pulling the trigger himself and now he was back in china this is the man haverford said that stalin chose to represent him in china it was a deliberate slap in the face but what could mao do about it isolated abroad struggling to create a government and a viable economy at home he needed russian aid if that meant swallowing his pride the chairman was willing to smile and bow and do it for the time being nicholai listened to the biographical sketch of the russian murderer and torturer but much of it was redundant from his mother the countess alexandra ivanovna he already knew a great deal about yuri andreovitch voroshenin the question was how to accomplish the mission beijing at the start of was perhaps the most tightly guarded city in the world the chinese secret police were everywhere and the order keeping committees volunteer snitches and informers were on every block and in every factory worse foreigners were a rarity in the country mao used the korean war as a pretext to deport spies and agents and the very few westerners who remained were kept under constant surveillance why do you think that i as opposed to another one of your assets have a chance to succeed at this the question had been much discussed in rooms at langley and now haverford debated with himself how much of the answer he should share with nicholai hel the assignment requires someone who is fluent in chinese haverford said but who could pass for russian if the moment demanded it you doubtless have many such people on your payroll nicholai observed true haverford answered but in addition to being multilingual the man must also be brilliant unflappable and a trained killer who can do the job without the benefit of a gun or other standard weapon at this point the list of available candidates gets very short nicholai understood the thinking a gun would be very hard to arrange in a police state and in any case voroshenin wouldnt be likely to let an armed assassin anywhere near him that made sense but nicholai knew that there were other qualifications that narrowed the pool of candidates down to him and he wondered if haverford knew of the very personal motivation he had to kill voroshenin certainly haverford was manipulative enough he wouldnt blink at it but nicholai doubted that he knew there was really no way that he could no nicholai thought he chose me for other reasons you also require he said a man desperate enough to accept an assignment that has only a slight chance of success and almost no chance of escape even if he succeeds in the mission isnt that true only partially haverford answered well have an extraction team standing by to get you out but the odds are yes slim enough to require a man who otherwise has little to lose well nicholai thought that would be me or michel guibert the identity solved the problem of inserting nicholai into beijing there was no cover available as a russian because he would instantly be spotted as an imposter obviously he couldnt be chinese an american or british identity was likewise impossible but the guiberts had been particular darlings of the international left since the days of bombthrowing anarchists with mustaches and papa guibert had paid particular attention to the french communists in vichy during the war so the guiberts were exactly the type of capitalists that the communists would tolerate and now the chinese haverford explained had a particular use for the son its about vietnam he said more precisely both china and russia supported ho chi minh and his insurgency against the french colonial regime in vietnam hos viet minh troops needed weapons preferably american as the united states supplied the french and the viet minh could rearm themselves with captured ammunition china possessed a large cache of american arms through weapons captured in korea and because the americans had also armed the kuomintang from whom the communist victors had seized mountains of american weaponry why cant the chinese simply send the guns to the viet minh nicholai asked china shared a border with vietnam and the viet minh controlled the mountainous area on the frontier it should have been a simple matter to bring the armaments through the remote terrain to the viet minh strongholds they can and do haverford answered but it all comes down to money of course nicholai thought the chinese are cash poor haverford explained theyd like to make some dough especially in foreign currency from the deal at the same time they dont want to be seen making a profit off the backs of their revolutionary asian comrades so you provide a convenient excuse gee wed love to give you the weaponry but those slimy guiberts got to them first but we can make them sell the guns to you at a price so that was the plan nicholai under the cover of michel guibert would be inserted into beijing to conclude an arms deal with the chinese under the pretext of then turning around and selling the guns to the viet minh that gets me into beijing nicholai said but how does it get me into shall we say operational proximity to voroshenin haverford shrugged youre the go master john singleton received word of the failed attempt on the asset nicholai hel with little surprise and measured satisfaction after all if hel could be killed so easily he was not the man for the job after all yuri voroshenin would be no easy prey the fact that hel had dispatched his wouldbe killers with apparent ease boded well for the mission but diamond singleton thought as he moved a white stone into its new position is so predictable and disappointingly so that combined with his seeming lack of creativity created some concern about his suitability for the indochinese posting however the old go maxim defeat a straight line with a circle a circle with a straight line held a great deal of truth diamond for all his many shortcomings was certainly a straightforward type who at least would not trip himself up by overthinking a situation then there was the circle haverford nuanced to a flaw singleton was reminded of the old saying that a liberal is a man who will not take his own side in an argument and that certainly described ellis haverford but would he have the courage to choose a course of action and take it we shall see singleton thought as he turned the gokang around that is the wonderful thing about playing both sides of the board you never lose diamond smashed the wall with his fist it hurt examining his scraped knuckles he cursed again two on one a surprise attack and the goddamn chinese screw it up at least they had the decency to get themselves killed in the process a jolt of fear sickened his stomach hel is the real deal youll have to find a better way to get to him solange came through the door nicholai got up and helped her put the groceries away haverford noticed the little domestic tableau and it worried him due to the previous nights attempted assassination they had accelerated the schedule for hels departure hed mastered the french dialect absorbed everything theyd given him in an amazingly short time and recovered his fitness it was time to move and he didnt want his agent balking now because hed found love although he admitted what man wouldnt fall in love with solange did i interrupt something she asked no nicholai answered quickly haverford is just dropping off a file for me to read he stressed the read to let the american know that he didnt want to be briefed anymore and was capable of digesting the file himself haverford smiled there was always a power struggle between an operative and his handler it was to be expected and even encouraged he was glad to see hels emerging assertiveness confidence was a good thing in an operative to a point but the wise handler knew when to negotiate when to insist and when to yield i was just leaving haverford said getting up from the table the croissants were as always très délicieux merci after haverford left solange turned to nicholai and asked does it bother you what that i was a prostitute the question surprised him it is an honorable profession in japan it isnt in france im not french nicholai said theres nothing about you that i find to be anything but a delight a joy and an honor solange came into his arms kissed him lightly on the neck and said softly i think im falling in love with you and i with you his words surprised him as much as the actual emotion something he had not felt for years something he had taught himself never to feel again it had been his experience that anyone he loved went away usually through the portal of death je taime je taime je taime je taime aussi nicholai said delighted to hear the tu but what are we going to do about it nothing she sighed her breath warm and moist on his skin there is nothing to do about it except to love each other while we have each other they went into the bedroom to do just that nicholai got up while she was still sleeping went into the kitchen and found a can of green tea hidden in the back of a cupboard there is no reason he thought as the water heated that michel guibert could not have developed a taste for excellent green tea during his years in hong kong when the water boiled he poured it into the pot waited a minute then stepped outside and poured it onto the ground he repeated the process then poured the water in for the third time and let it sit recalling the old and wise chinese adage regarding the steeping of tea the first time its water the second time its garbage the third time its tea nicholai waited impatiently then poured the tea into a small cup and sipped excellent he thought refreshing in a way that coffee no matter how good could never be he took the tea out into the garden sat on one of the stone benches and listened to the water gurgle down the rocks just last night he thought i killed two men here and now there is not a trace as if it never happened and in a sense it didnt in a true buddhist sense this life is just a dream a samsara of false perceptions that we are somehow separate from any other being or entities in killing those men i died myself in my surviving they live in me i fulfilled their karma and they mine it will be the same with voroshenin the russians karmic consequence had been a long time coming over thirty years nicholai wondered if voroshenin even remembered or if he did even cared probably not nicholai decided do you even want to go through with this he asked himself true the americans are offering me a vast sum of money a passport and my freedom but the temptation is to go in and wake solange pack a few things and run where they cannot find us but where he asked himself would that be you have no passport no papers no money where and how far could you run if you couldnt get out of japan and in this closed tight society where could two roundeyes hide and for how long a few weeks at the most optimistic assessment and then what now that you know the identity of the target the americans would have to terminate you and solange too theyll believe you talked to her told her everything while it is usually true that what you dont know can kill you in the topsyturvy world in which i now exist what you do know can kill you just as easily if solange knew the identity of my target she could be in serious danger so there you are he thought she is a hostage to your actions i cannot allow another person i love to die i couldnt bear it but can you do it all he asked himself assassinate voroshenin and still have a life with solange is it too much to ask in this world perhaps he thought but he decided to try solange came out of the bedroom and into the garden her hair was charmingly tousled her eyes heavy and still sleepy nicholai put the file on his lap and closed it we are keeping secrets she asked dont worry i dont want to know she lit cigarettes and handed him one i dont care about whatever mens business you and haverford are cooking up in the end there is only food wine sex and babies thats all anyone really cares about the rest of it silly male games go play come back and give me a baby i would like that nicholai said very much good i want to get dinner ready she kissed him on the forehead and went inside nicholai went back to studying the file he couldnt have cared less about voroshenin as a human being assuming a fact not in evidence but was deeply interested in him as a target as such it was necessary to know how his mind worked his likes dislikes his habits in addition to a predilection for sadism the man also drank perhaps to excess but all russians drank nicholai doubted there was a vulnerability there the file suggested that he also liked his women no surprise to nicholai could that present an opening possibly but the new beijing was famously puritanical the communists had closed the brothels and most of the professional mistresses had fled with the kuomintang if voroshenin had a woman in the city he would keep her well hidden which suggested possibilities but would also keep the arrangement very secure what else voroshenin played chess again most russians did but apparently quite advanced as one would expect he liked to eat well he knew his wines and had developed in his years in china a taste for beijing opera that was about it nicholai closed the file solange was awake when nicholai came into the bedroom im leaving in the morning he said i know solange said i felt it he lay down beside her she rolled over laid her head on his chest and he put his arm around her ill come back for you i hope so i will when he went out the door in the morning she had only one word for him survive outside a maple leaf detached from its branch flickered beautifully in the sunlight and then fell part two beijing january beijing was freezing the north winds swept down from the vast manchurian plains and coated the willows their branches already bending under snow with a sheen of silver ice the sun was a pale yellow a thin disk in a pearl sky nicholai stepped out of the train station and took a breath of the freezing air which bit into his lungs with a burning sensation he pulled the collar of his russian coat up around his neck and wrapped the scarf around his neck the street was virtually devoid of traffic save for a few military vehicles soviet trucks and american jeeps liberated from the kuomintang most people were on foot the luckier few struggled to hold bicycles steady on the snow as they bent low over the handlebars to escape the wind a few rickshaw drivers picked up arriving passengers and pedaled off with them the back wheels slipping in the snow then a long black sedan its front fenders festooned with small red flags emerged out of the snow and pulled up on the curb a stocky chinese man in a padded wool overcoat and a pla cap with a red star on the front got out and walked up to nicholai comrade guibert yes i am comrade chen the man said welcome to beijing long live the peoples republic wan swei yes we were told you speak fluent cantonese chen smiled he gave the slightest emphasis on cantonese just to let nicholai know that it was inferior to mandarin the preferred dialect of government you lived in guangzhou was it hong kong ah yes silly games nicholai thought endless silly games i will be your escort in beijing chen said escort nicholai thought meaning spy watchdog and informer im appreciative shall we get out of the cold chen gave a curt nod back toward the car and the driver got out took nicholais suitcase and loaded it into the trunk chen opened the back passenger door for nicholai please nicholai slid into the back of the sedan and chen came around and got in on the other side the car heater was working manfully if futilely against the intense cold and chen stomped his booted feet on the car floor cold a bastard do you mind if i smoke nicholai asked knowing that the answer would be no and also knowing that chen would appreciate a cigarette he took a pack of gauloises from his inside coat pocket and held it out to chen please most kind chen took the proffered cigarette and then nicholai leaned over the seat and offered one to the driver he could see chens annoyed look from the corner of his eye even in the classless society there are classes nicholai thought the driver took the cigarette and gloating smiled at chen in the rearview mirror so nicholai knew now that he was not terribly subordinate a watcher to watch the watcher he thought he took out his french lighter lit both mens cigarettes then his own the car quickly filled with blue smoke good chen said take the pack i couldnt i have more chen took the pack five minutes in the incorruptible peoples republic nicholai thought and the first bribe had been accepted actually maos three antis campaign to root out corruption among party officials was in full swing and hundreds of bureaucrats had been summarily executed shot in public displays while thousands more had been shipped off to die slow deaths from exhaustion in work camps nicholai noticed that chen took four cigarettes from the pack and put them on the front seat for the driver prudent he thought this was nicholais first time in beijing he had been a boy in shanghai and that cosmopolitan city had seemed the world to him the old imperial capital was so different with its broad boulevards intended for military parades its vast public spaces so open to the winds that it seemed almost meant as a warning of how quickly and completely things can change and how vulnerable one is to shifts in the wind chen seemed a bit ahead of him you have never been to beijing before no nicholai said peering out the window as the car pulled out onto jianguomen avenue and you are you a native oh yes chen said as if surprised by the question im a beijingren born and bred outer city in two blocks the street became changan avenue the citys main eastwest arterial that flanked the southern edge of the forbidden city with its distinctive red walls nicholai could see the gate of heavenly peace where mao had stood a little over two years ago and declared the peoples republic of china he recalled from his briefing that yuri voroshenin was there with him that day enormous plaques on either side of the gate read respectively long live the peoples republic of china and long live the unity of the peoples of the world a small detour chen asked please chen ordered the driver to take them around tiananmen square which was a mess of construction work as it was being widened for even larger public demonstrations buildings were being torn down the rubble removed or leveled when it is done chen said proudly it will hold over a million people many of whose homes had been torn down nicholai thought to create space for them to publicly gather beijing was an impressive imposing city created for the exercise of power nicholai preferred shanghai although he was sure it had changed as well the china he had known was a motley of color and style shanghai was a center of high fashion but the residents of beijing in this time seemed almost cookiecutter in their uniformity most of them wearing the standard blue green or gray padded coats with baggy trousers and the same mao caps having negotiated tiananmen the driver turned north onto wangfujing street and pulled up in front of the beijing hotel a turnofthecentury europeanstyle building seven stories high with three arched doorways and a colonnade on the top floor the driver scurried out retrieved nicholais bag and handed it to a hotel porter the small middleaged man struggled to heft the bag to the lobby but spurned nicholais proffered hand he was the deputy mayor chen grunted ushering nicholai past the porter lucky to be alive the lobby seemed a house of ghosts nicholai knew this had once been the european center of power in beijing where the western barons of commerce lorded it over the asians and chinese waiters scurried with trays of gin and tonics whiskey and sodas as they endured the careless racism of the french germans english and americans it had been the same in shanghai but here just a short walk from the imperial palace it must have seemed even more insulting he was surprised that the communists hadnt simply demolished the building leaving its painful associations in rubble but he realized that the new regime needed a place to house its foreign guests the lobby was clean but lifeless scrubbed of any trace of decadence devoid of the sense of luxury and privilege that it doubtless once possessed as life under capitalism was aggressively gauche nicholai thought life under communism was deliberately drab the desk clerk a young woman clad in the ubiquitous lenin suit a gray doublebreasted jacket with a sash belt asked for his passport and was surprised when nicholai produced it with a greeting in chinese have you eaten today i have comrade and you yes thank you room the porter will ill take my own bag thank you nicholai said he reached into his pocket for a yuan note to give the porter but chen stopped him tipping is not permitted in the peoples republic chen said of course not nicholai said patronizing imperialist anachronism chen added quite a burden to carry nicholai thought for a small gratuity the elevator ride was frightening and nicholai wondered when was the last time that the creaky lift had seen maintenance but they made it to the fifth floor alive and chen led him down the long hallway to his room the room was basic but clean a bed a wardrobe two chairs a side table with a radio and a thermos of hot water for making tea the attached bathroom had a toilet and a bathtub but no shower french doors in the main room opened onto a small balcony and nicholai stepped out and looked down on the front of the hotel and east chang street to his right he could see tiananmen square these rooms are reserved for very special guests chen said when nicholai stepped back inside ill bet they are nicholai thought he would further bet that these rooms were also wired for sound to record every conversation of said special guests he took off his coat gestured for chen to do the same and hung both coats up in the wardrobe may i offer you tea nicholai asked very kind nicholai took two large pinches of green tea from a canister and put them into the pot then he poured the hot water in waited for a few moments and then poured the tea into two cups normally he would not have served tea made in the first steep but he knew that fuel for heating water was at a premium and that waste would be considered offensive he handed chen the tea and both men sat down in the chairs after a sufficiently awkward silence chen said this is very good warming thank you i can hardly accept gratitude for your hospitality chen was disconcerted at the thought that the visitor might be under the misapprehension that the hotel stay was complimentary he got right to it but you are paying for your room still nicholai said remembering now how blunt the chinese could be about business matters so unlike the japanese who would have engaged in ten minutes of circumlocution to subtly inform the guest that he was after all a paying guest chen looked relieved there is a dinner tonight in your honor you neednt go to the trouble and expense it is already organized i look forward to it chen nodded colonel yu aide to general liu himself will be your host general liu dehuai was a national hero one of the key generals on the long march and the founder of the legendary th route army until recently the commander of chinese forces in korea he was now minister of defense liu would have to approve the deal for the sale of the weapons through guibert to the viet minh the fact that he was sending an apparently key aide to evaluate guibert on his very first night in the country was significant and uncharacteristic of what nicholai knew of the chinese way of doing business typically they would let a foreign guest cool his heels easy to do in beijing in january for days if not weeks occupying him with lowlevel subordinates and endless sightseeing before getting down to business liu was in a hurry to do this deal im honored nicholai said chen stood up i am sure you are tired and would like to rest nicholai saw him to the door he waited five minutes then put his coat and hat on again and went back out into the cold although nicholai had pored over maps and aerial photographs they could not substitute for ontheground knowledge and he wanted to orient himself to the city his survival might depend on an immediate decision as to what alley to turn into what street to avoid and there would be no time for indecision or hesitation beijing in the early days of was a city of contradictions divided between spacious governmental sections and the narrow alleyshutongs on which most of the people lived the heart of beijing was the forbidden city as its name indicated closed off to the general public for most of its thousandyear existence now that the communist government had moved in and turned many of its buildings into offices and residences most of it was still forbidden most of the time the other beijing that surrounded the forbidden city was or used to be a vibrant active cosmopolitan city of some two million people with openair markets streets of fashionable shops small parks and squares where jugglers magicians and other buskers performed the beijingren the natives had the same tough jaded superior attitude of the residents of all major cities to them beijing was its own universe and they were not entirely wrong everyone had come to the imperial city not only all manners of chinese but for good or ill the rest of the world as well so the sophisticated beijing citizens knew all the varied cultures of china japan and europe a wellheeled beijingren might well have eaten in french restaurants bought suits from italian tailors watches from german craftsmen most of the modern beijingren had worn british suits or french dresses and danced to american music still any good beijingren from the impoverished nightsoil collectors to the richest merchant would proudly proclaim the superiority of beijing culture itself its fabled imperial buildings its bridges and parks and gardens centuriesold restaurants and teahouses its theaters and opera houses its circuses and acrobats its poets and writers beijing was a sophisticated imperial capital when london and paris were little more than insectinfested swamps of all the european capitals only rome could rival beijing in terms of antiquity sophistication and power the beijingren had seen it all within the living memory of many of its citizens beijing had survived invasions from the french the germans the nationalists the japanese and now the communists it had adjusted evolved and survived many observers were surprised that mao chose the city with all its imperial associations for his capital nicholai thought he chose beijing for exactly those associations no ruler could claim power in china without those trappings without possession of the temple of heaven no emperor could claim the mandate of heaven and nicholai knew that mao for all his communist propaganda saw himself as the new emperor indeed he had quickly shut himself up in the forbidden city and was rarely seen outside it the beijingren knew this they had known many emperors had seen dynasties rise and fall watched them build monuments to themselves and then watched them crumble and they knew that the communist dynasty was but one in a long line its time would come and its time would pass but the city would endure but in what form nicholai wondered as he walked out the front entrance up the street and then turned right onto changan mao had plans for the city and announced that he was going to transform it from a city of consumption to a city of production already blocks of old houses had been torn down to make room for new factories narrow streets were being broadened to allow tanks to roll up and down and soviet architects a perfectly oxymoronic phrase in nicholais opinion were now busily designing sterile concrete housing units to replace the old courtyard houses that were the center of beijing domestic life the courtyard walls lined the residential streets and hutongs with only small doors opening onto the street the doors opened onto another wall and a visitor would have to go to the right or the lefta device that outfoxed evil spirits which can only move in straight lines once around that wall the space opened onto an interior courtyard usually of pebbles or in the richer homes flagstone the courtyard usually had a shade tree or two and an open charcoal brazier for cooking during warmer weather depending on the wealth or poverty of the family there was a single dwelling structure of one or two stories perhaps with separate wings for the families of the sons the beijingren lived privately quietly and with great autonomy in these extended family units behind the walls this would never do for the controlobsessed mao who quickly condemned the desire for privacy as an individualist antisocial attitude while waiting for the soviets to complete their architectural atrocities he attacked the courtyard houses on an organizational level establishing safetykeeping committees in which neighbors were encouraged to snoop on neighbors blackclad squads of night people mostly erstwhile burglars used their former skills to prowl around rooftops and listen for the sounds of bourgeois activities such as the click of mahjongg tiles the trilling of a pet songbird or for antirevolutionary whisperings and conspiracies the assault on urban life was also conducted on public spaces theaters and teahouses were closed street performers harassed for licenses snack vendors increasingly forced into staterun collectives even the rickshaw drivers who once jammed the citys avenues were being gradually phased out as imperial relics symbolic of human slavery it didnt happen all at once but it was happening and the bustle that gave the city so much of its charm was being muted into fearful stillness in which every activity was watched and heard indeed nicholai discerned the man who instantly fell in behind him before he even left the hotel lobby china was poor in most resources save population so the intelligence service could easily afford to leave a man at the hotel with the sole responsibility of keeping an eye on guibert it was good to know nicholai wanted to ascertain the amount of surveillance that he would encounter so in that sense he was trolling for tails as haverford would put it nicholai thought of it differently of course and in terms of go a basic principle of the game was that motion attracts motion the movement of a single stone on an area of the board generally provokes a move from the opponent so it was he discovered in the espionage game at which he realized he was a neophyte pretending not to notice the surveillance he crossed changan into the old legation quarter past the old russian legation building which the current soviet delegation had reoccupied using only his peripheral vision he scanned the front of the building where the security sitting in russian sedans was clearly visible he kept his pace up as if bored with the legation quarter and intent on heading west to tiananmen square he walked around the vast square chaotic with construction his watchdog doing a good job of staying with him without getting too close and then turned north toward the great tiled roofs of the forbidden city his tail backed off then and turned him over to a second man so nicholai knew that the surveillance of guibert was something of a priority the tall roofline of the imperial palace easily recognizable from a hundred photographs loomed in front of him as he looked for a place to kill voroshenin that would offer the requisite time and space as well as offer an avenue of escape nicholai had hoped that the walls of the forbidden city might offer such a location but then he realized that the area was of course far too heavily guarded now that mao had taken up residence there and many of the buildings had been turned into housing for high officials or government offices nicholai went into the palace now a museum to get warm and firm up his tourist credentials and lingered on the grounds if one could be said to linger on this bitterly cold afternoon before leaving the forbidden city observing that he had now acquired an additional tail he turned east and walked across a lovely bridge over the southern reaches of beihai lake frozen and silver against the white willow trees along its banks it would not do to walk too confidently so nicholai assumed the gait and pace of a man who is slightly albeit unconcernedly lost he paused at the corner of xidan street pretended to consider his route and then decided to turn north his tails switched off one lingering as he fussed with his scarf the other coming ahead to pick up the trail it was enough for nicholai to get a good look at their faces without being noticed he dubbed one of them the greyhound for his tall slim build and foot speed and the other xiao smiley an ironic reference to his dour expression to be fair nicholai thought no one would be very happy to be pulled from a nice warm hotel lobby onto the freezing streets nicholai upped his pace to see if the greyhound would keep up with him or whether there was another agent to turn him over to the greyhound quickened his steps although he was careful to stay far behind nicholai as he went through the south gate into beihai park the park was lovely nicholai thought and represented the very best of asian landscaping art built around the oval of beihai lake its walkways wended through graceful rows of willow trees impeccable placements of stones and perfectly located pavilions every curve offered a new perspective and the whole thing came close to achieving the elusive quality that the japanese called shibumi understated elegance in fact in winter the park resembled a distinguished elderly lady spare and yet beautiful who preserves her posture and dignity even in the knowledge of cold death a man more verbally talented than i nicholai thought might compose a poem about her walking northward along the eastern edge of the lake he came to a bridge that spanned the lake onto an island nicholai read the small sign that pointed toward the jade isle and stepped onto the gracefully arched bridge he paused at the apex to look over the lake and see if the greyhound followed him the greyhound was smart and strode right past him never even glancing as he continued onto the island it was the smart move nicholai thought anticipating that i will keep going onto the jade isle but still allowing him to double back if i change my mind lazily scanning the scenery he saw xiao smiley stop and linger in a pavilion near the base of the bridge nicholai turned and crossed the bridge onto the jade isle which was dominated by a tall white tower on a small rise in the center of the thickly wooded island a narrow footpath flanked by trees and shrubs led up to the tower identified by a plaque as not surprisingly the white pagoda built in to honor the visit of the dalai lama ironic nicholai thought considering that the chinese had just invaded tibet the tower itself was closed nicholai strolled around the base of the tower which with its curved lines and additional steeple with a gold buddhist symbol on top more resembled tibetan than chinese architecture he finished his circuit of the tower and then took a narrow curving path down through the trees to the southern edge of the jade isle where the bridge of perfect wisdom crossed back onto the main part of the park from the bridge he noticed small docks on the islands and others across the pond and realized that on less inclement days one could hire a boat to access the island the jade isle has possibilities nicholai thought particularly at night but luring voroshenin there would be a problem schooled in paranoia by the stalinist purges the russian would not easily be lured anywhere and if he is the chess player he is reputed to be he will be quick to sniff out a ploy but it was a location to keep in mind and at least nicholai had fulfilled the immediate task of allowing himself to be spotted by haverfords spies in the white pagoda haverford sat and watched solange pack it didnt take long she actually owned very few things the rest of it the books the art the fine kitchen equipment even most of her wardrobe had been bought and paid for by the company and would be sold the bottom line was after all the bottom line shed taken her eviction stoically only putting up a small argument but where will i go she asked when haverford came to shut down the house he shrugged his lack of an answer the gesture evoked what they both knew shed been hired for a certain job for a certain period of time the job was over and the time was up and she should have thought of her future earlier and her concern was a bit disingenuous certainly she knew that a woman of her beauty charm and doubtless sexual talent would always find a man willing to pay for them she had done it before and would do it again and the money he had paid would be more than sufficient to tide her over and how will nicholai find me as a piece of acting it was beautiful i was almost convinced for a second there haverford thought smiling at himself and recalling what his father had said after rescuing him from a youthful entanglement with a broadway dolly that he thought he was in love with all actresses are whores haverford senior had pronounced and all whores are actresses this one certainly is haverford thought watching solange dab at her eyes with a handkerchief how will nicholai find me he didnt enlighten her that in the unlikely case that her emotions were genuine she neednt trouble herself over them now she folded a negligee into her suitcase paused and trained her remarkable eyes on haverford perhaps you and i we could make an arrangement he had to admit that he was tempted what man wouldnt be she was incredibly beautiful and would no doubt be a revelation in bed but there was no way that he could justify her continued presence in the house to the coldblooded company numbercrunchers we have an arrangement my darling he answered you performed a service brilliantly and i paid you you treat me like a whore solange said snapping the suitcase shut haverford saw no need for a response in any case he had just received word from his sources in beijing that hel had made his rendezvous on the jade isle and been duly spotted from the white pagoda men are fools solange thought as she left the house in tokyo a few tears the sparkle of an eye the twitch of a hip and their brains are as easily turned off as an electrical switch haverford was smarter than most but just as blind like the rest he sees what he wants to see and nothing more nicholai on the other hand dommage what a shame the problem with the new china yuri voroshenin thought as he sipped a vodka and looked out his window at the legation quarter is that there are no more prostitutes which was damn inconvenient the old china threw no such obstacles between a man and his needs to put it mildly shanghai for instance had some marvelous brothels but the peoples republic was ferociously bluestocking when it came to sexual matters and all the pleasure girls had been swept off to factories or farms this was a damn poor allocation of resources and a gross violation of the economic precept of highest and best use voroshenin remembered a different beijing the halcyon days of the s and s when the bada hutongs of tiangao just south of tiananmen square blossomed with flowers and willows and the old xuanwu districts narrow alleys teemed with teahouses opium dens opera theaters and of course brothels those were the nights when a man could go out and get a good dinner and a few drinks take in an opera and then attend to his less aesthetic tastes afterward sometimes with one of the actresses he had seen onstage or with an expensive courtesan who would serve tea then sing an aria and only later get down to business hed even enjoyed the negotiations with the madams who would have considered it a gross violation of decorum to offer her girls like menu items instead she would ask the customer for a loan to pay for household maintenance or some particular repair it was all done with subtlety and style at places like the house of the golden flower or little fengxians but that was before the damn reformers came alongfirst the persnickety chiang and then mao and now beijing was a city as desexualized as the eunuchs who once ran it sure there were a few black gate women independent prostitutes who risked arrest on the street but a man would have to have access to far better pharmacists than were available in presentday beijing to resort to that the only person getting any illicit sex in the new china was the chief puritan himself the chairman soviet intelligence had confirmed that mao had a personal battalion of actresses from the national peoples opera at his beck and call but it was just like that son of a bitch to feast while everyone else starved even by stalinist standards maos china was a cloudcuckoo land of epic proportions it would be easy to say that the lunatic was in charge of the asylum but mao was crazy like the proverbial fox all of his mad proclamations were ultimately selfserving and brought him yet more power and control the three antis campaign was rapidly stripping the country of its bourgeois middle management and the recently launched five antis campaign ill see your three antis and raise you two voroshenin thought with a chuckle tax evasion larceny cheating bribery and stealing economic information would soon rid china of most of its private businessmen and mao had used the korean war to conduct a witch hunt for spies and foreign agents that was reminiscent of the red terror in russia thirty years ago neighbor was encouraged to inform on neighbor suicides and executions were daily events and the atmosphere of suspicion fear and paranoia in the city was palpable no wonder uncle joe was jealous voroshenin tipped back the rest of his vodka and then heard leotovs distinctive knock the man taps on a door like a mouse voroshenin thought timid and tentative as the months in this frigid openair prison went by voroshenin found his chief assistant more and more annoying then again he thought beijing is making us all crazy come in leotov opened the door and stuck only his head through as if making doubly sure hed received permission to enter its time for the three oclock briefing yes its three oclock leotov minced his slight frame over to the desk and stood there until voroshenin said sit down we do this every afternoon voroshenin thought every damn afternoon at three oclock you stand in front of my desk and every damn afternoon at three oclock i tell you to sit down could you not just once come in and plant your skinny ass down in the chair without an invitation im going stir crazy he thought i need a woman so whats new in the asylum today he asked leotov blinked then hesitated was this some sort of rhetorical trap that would get him denounced and then purged the briefing voroshenin prodded leotov sighed with relief he ran down the usual goingson the reports from moles in the endless chinese committee meetings the chinese defense ministrys thoughts on the stalemate in korea the latest round of executions of corrupt officials and counterrevolutionaries then added and a new westerner arrived in the city voroshenin was bored out of his mind indeed who one michel guibert only one yes leotov was devoid of humor a literalminded drone of the sort we seem to crank out like tractor gears voroshenin thought and completely useless as a chess opponent plodding unimaginative and tediously predictable maybe i should have him arrested and interrogated just for amusement go on a french national the son of an arms dealer with ties to the french communist party the father was apparently quite useful to the resistance werent they all after the fact voroshenin said that was a rhetorical question leotov it doesnt call for you to come up with a correct response i couldnt bear watching you attempt it whats this guibert doing in beijing we dont exactly know leotov answered but we do know hes having dinner with general lius aide a certain colonel yu tonight well thats interesting voroshenin thought a french fellowtraveler an arms dealer being received by a highranking officer in the defense ministry surely the chinese arent looking to buy weapons from the french but it must be a matter of some urgency otherwise the chinese would make this guibert sit on his hands for weeks just to improve their bargaining position they would make him work his way up through multiple levels of bureaucracy before getting to an important general like liu if he ever got there at all so for a highlevel officer like yu to host guibert on the first day where is this dinner voroshenin asked in the banquet room of the beijing hotel a banquet is it apparently voroshenin stared at him do i detect irony vasili certainly not voroshenin frowned until little dots of sweat emerged on leotovs upper lip satisfied he said get on the phone to lius secretary and tell him that my invitation was apparently lost and i need to know what time i should show up do you think he will we pay him enough dont we voroshenin snapped he can come up with an invitation to a lousy dinner just tell him to strangle another chicken or press another duck or whatever the hell it is these people do yes comrade oh stop it get out vasili go see if the phones are working he watched as leotov jumped up crossed the room then slowly closed the door so as to make the least possible noise and not give offense it was profoundly aggravating as was the sudden appearance of a new player this guibert the game was at a critical juncture the move of a knight or even a pawn would achieve checkmate and what a pleasure it would be to take this particular king off the board hed had to deal with the obnoxious chairman for twenty years tolerate his boundless ego his sexual voracity his hypochondria and hypocrisy his endless treachery and relentless ambition but soon he would able to view maos severed head in a bamboo cage hanging from the gate of heaven theyd already chosen his successor gao gang was the chinese party boss in manchuria and he was ready to step in just waiting for the word to be delivered via voroshenin from the puppetmasters in moscow if all goes as planned over the next few months we will replace the troublesome mao with the pliable gao so this was not the time for an additional complication especially one involving liu the general was too smart too tough and his own man hed already rebuffed numerous offers to buy him and now whats he up to with this gunrunning frog voroshenin opened his desk drawer and took out the vodka bottle hed promised himself that he would only take one drink in the afternoon but beijing was really getting to him and the alcohol might quell his sexual frustrations perhaps they would have actresses at the banquet tonight maybe even whores as if theres a difference as if theres a chance he admitted he knocked back the drink in one throw looked at his watch and decided that there was time to go and visit kang sheng the head of the chinese secret police another broken promise he thought sadly the better part of him didnt want to go see the man despised himself for it and yet he was drawn kang sheng dressed all in black at this moment the head of the chinese secret police wore a black lounging robe and black pajama pants over black slippers but he was known to go about in public in black padded coats black suits and black furlined hats on a lesser person this sartorial eccentricity would have been labeled counterrevolutionary decadence and had potentially disastrous consequences but no one in beijing had the nerve to think much less utter such an opinion kang sheng had been maos chief torturer since he had personally tormented thousands of maos rivals back in jiangxi and survivors whispered that they had heard the howling of his victims during the long nights in the caves of yenan what he didnt know about xunban torture had yet to be discovered although to give him his due kang sheng was ceaseless in his efforts to discover new methods of inflicting agony in fact at this very moment comrade kang was diligently conducting research his new home near the old bell and drum towers in the northcentral district of the city was the former mansion of a recently deceased capitalist more of a small palace it had guest houses where kangs armed guards now resided as well as courtyards walled gardens and pebbled pathways kang had done nothing to change it except for the construction of a concretelined cave far in the back garden now teacup in hand he sat back in a deep chair in the cave and enjoyed the screams of his latest subject she was the wife of a former general in the northwest district who had been accused of being a spy for the kuomintang regime in taiwan a beautiful young lady sable hair alabaster skin and a body that was a sensual pleasure to behold she bravely refused to supply incriminating confirmation of her husbands treachery kang was grateful for her uxorial loyalty it prolonged his pleasure your husband is an imperialist spy no tell me what he said to you kang demanded tell me what he whispered to you in bed nothing a knock on the door interrupted his enjoyment what is it he snapped a visitor came the answer comrade voroshenin kang smiled there were so many ways of achieving power and influence send him in the key to the current condition of chinese plumbing nicholai decided was never to take no for an answer he tried three times to get hot water from the taps of the bathtub before he succeeded and when it finally came it did so with a scalding vengeance an allornothingatall response to his repeated entreaties gently lowering himself into the water nicholai was reminded of the tub hed enjoyed at his tokyo home in what seemed like a lifetime ago but was barely four years they had been happy albeit short days with watanabesan and the tanake sisters in the garden he had carefully constructed with the goal of shibumi he might have lived his whole life there quite happily had it not been for the honorbound necessity to kill general kishikawa that caused his subsequent arrest torture and imprisonment at the hands of the americans and then the offer of freedom in exchange for this little errand to terminate yuri voroshenin moreover nicholai despised nothing more than a torturer a sadist who inflicts pain on the helpless deserves death but voroshenin was only the first torturer on nicholais list next would come diamond and his two minions who had shattered nicholais body and mind and come close to destroying his spirit he knew that the americans didnt expect him to survive the voroshenin mission but he would surprise them and then he would surprise diamond and the two others it would mean leaving asia probably forever and that thought saddened him and caused him some anxiety about what life would be like in the west a european by ethnicity he had never even been there his entire life had been spent in china or japan and he felt more asian than western where would he live not in the united states certainly but where perhaps in france he decided that would please solange he could envision a life with her in some quiet place nicholai pushed the thought of her out of his mind to focus on the present picturing a go board in his head he played the black stones and placed them in their current position the point now was to push forward to gain proximity to voroshenin to create a position from which to get voroshenin in a vulnerable place given the close surveillance he couldnt simply track the target down and find an opportune moment no he would have to find a way to lure voroshenin to an isolated spot while at the same time losing his chinese tails he studied the imaginary board to find that opportunity but couldnt find it that didnt worry him like life the gokang was neither static nor unilateral the opponent was also thinking and moving and very often it was the opponents move that provided opportunity be patient he told himself recalling the lessons his go master otakesan had taught him if your opponent is of a choleric nature he will be unable to restrain himself he will seek you out and show you the open gate to his vulnerability let your enemy come to you nicholai sank deeper into the tub and enjoyed the hot water having made a lifes study of human weakness kang noticed the russians fascination with the torture it emanated from him as strongly as his body odor which stank of stale sweat and alcohol kang didnt judge he was a sadist himself it was simply his nature and if the russian joined him in deriving pleasure from other peoples pain it was merely a sexual preference the odor however was offensive a man could not change his nature but he could bathe voroshenin tore his eyes off the woman and said actually i came on business kang smiled you came on the pretext of business he thought but very well we shall humor your selfdelusion the vixen yips an opera he said to his assistant naming a relatively mild yet exquisite torture that he knew voroshenin would find compelling both from his taste for pain and his passion for beijing opera manban he added meaning that he wanted the beating conducted at a slow tempo kang knew that voroshenin would appreciate it we can go to my study voroshenin followed him into an adjoining room where he noticed that kang left the door ajar you mentioned something about business kang said enjoying the russians discomfiture this frenchman who arrived today voroshenin said of course kang would already know about him nothing of note occurred in beijing without its being reported to the head of the chinese secret police voroshenin heard the highpitched yelp which did indeed sound like a vixen yipping for her mate kang smiled in acknowledgment then said guibert i believe thats his name and what of him whats he doing here voroshenin asked something to do with arms to our revolutionary little brothers in vietnam kang answered guns to the viet minh apparently hes french voroshenin said and hes selling weapons to be used against his own people since when do gunrunners know nationality kang asked or capitalists morality the womans cry was perfectly in tune with the overall composition voroshenin objected vietnam is in the soviet sphere a glance at the globe would indicate differently youve never given a damn about vietnamese independence voroshenin grumbled listening to the womans moans kang heard them too the whimpers were now an underlying theme i am offended we care deeply about the plight of all peoples suffering under the imperialist lash this is lius operation it would seem so and you trust him i trust no one it was an open secret among the higher echelons of the intelligence communities that liu loathed mao and was always searching for an opportunity to displace him it was only the generals personal power and popularity among the army that kept him alive and out of this very cave as much as voroshenin shared lius distaste for the chairman lius success would be a disaster for the kremlin they already had their man waiting in manchuria a complete puppet unlike liu who would be independent and might very well edge china toward an alliance with the west it couldnt be allowed the woman hit a high note of crystalline purity voroshenin stood up i should be going ten years kang thought it was absolutely essential to preserve the soviet alliance for ten more years the ultrasecret militaryindustrial development was already under way in the southwest and would be completed in a decade and by that time china would have the atomic bomb would be an economic powerhouse as well and they would have completed the transformation of the society then there would be a reckoning with the condescending patriarchal neoimperialist soviets but they would need ten more years of russian economic aid and military protection to realize their plans and nothing must be allowed to interfere with that so he stood up took voroshenin by the elbow ushered him back into the torture room and asked do you want her the russian didnt answer and kang took his silence as assent he walked over to the woman and asked do you want to save your husband yes there is something you can do anything kang drew voroshenin aside take her he said any way you want my gift to you but for added pleasure when you are about to climax whisper into her ear the truth that her husband is already dead it will be exquisite i promise you he left voroshenin alone with the woman but lingered outside the cave to savor the subtle change in the tone of her screams what in the opera they would call wawa diao an aria of highest emotion the food was exquisite a native of shanghai nicholai was something of a snob when it came to the superiority of southern cuisine over its northern somewhat barbarian counterpart but he had to admit that these mandarin dishes were as superb as they were surprising yushangfang colonel yu explained when nicholai praised the food the emperors kitchen it makes sense when you think about it the emperor could command the best chefs in all of china they all came here to cook and their legacy lingers indeed nicholai thought the banquet started with hotandsour soup then proceeded with spareribs in sweetened chinkiang vinegar and zha xiao wan zi small fried meatballs made with prime ground pork and of course jiaozi the distinctive beijing dumplings yu had sat nicholai directly to his left at the circular table a place of honor and personally used his chopsticks to select the best pieces and place them on nicholais plate another high honor now the colonel perused the platter of cold pigs ear chose one and put it on nicholais plate then he took one for himself tasted it and nodded in approval im a southerner he said to nicholai a sichuan mountain ape and it took me some time to get used to this northern food but its all right huh its very good nicholai answered and yu was anything but simian surprisingly young for a man who was general lius right hand he was hardly a country bumpkin but a sharp sophisticated staff officer he was dressed tonight in civilian garb his mao jacket pressed the corners of the large pockets sharply creased his full black hair was cut short in the current style of course i miss my rice yu said to the table at large all these noodles you eat the other diners responded with the expected polite laughter voroshenin said surely colonel a man of your position could have pearl rice brought up from the south nicholai was impressed with voroshenins fluent mandarin and took further note of his tone of easy familiarity with the colonel perhaps it was the three maotais the man had consumed during the round of toasts that preceded dinner nicholai had politely downed three rounds as well and had to admit that he was feeling them but i am not an emperor yu said pleasantly although everyone at the table heard the subtle reference to mao who had the best rice brought into the city and handpeeled to leave the husks on nicholai found the remark significant it indicated that yu felt secure enough in his position to make a jibe at the chairman voroshenin leaned across the table and speared a pigs foot he used the moment to ask nicholai is this your first time in beijing it is first time in china not really nicholai answered i was partially raised in hong kong thats part of great britain isnt it voroshenin asked it was rude a sly dig at his chinese hosts so think the british nicholai answered but in reality hong kong is no more british than say mongolia is russian yu guffawed no offense nicholai said looking directly at voroshenin none taken voroshenin replied although both men knew that offense had been intended and received he kept his eyes locked on nicholais the other diners noticed the very western very unchinese directness of this standoff and chen seated to nicholais left was relieved when the waiters broke the tension by arriving with a platter of fried pigs livers wrapped in iris blossoms but voroshenin would not let it go the french have some colonies in asia im given to understand nicholai agreed french indochina to be precise well precision is important precisely although voroshenin said testing the waters i dont know how much longer the french can hold on to say vietnam ho chi minh is kicking the traces isnt he its a matter of time yu said and arms voroshenin opined wouldnt you say as a military man that the viet minh insurgency cant progress to the next phase of the struggle without a reliable supply of modern weaponry i mean they really cant stand up to french firepower with what they have now especially with the americans arming the french to succeed yu answered as he looked over the platter every insurgency must make the transition from guerrilla to conventional warfare our beloved chairman taught us that he pinched a piece of the liver and transferred it to nicholais plate but voroshenin pressed it cant be done without guns no yu said simply it cant and what brings you to beijing voroshenin asked nicholai supposedly switching subjects but fully aware of what he was doing business nicholai answered agricultural equipment voroshenin asked with faux innocence irrigation systems that sort of thing in the face of the american embargo good for you comrade but damn you look familiar michel something in the eyes have you ever been to russia nicholai saw the mans eyes scanning for a reaction he knew that he was being baited knew that voroshenin was trying to assess him but why nicholai wondered could he have an inkling could there have been a leak could voroshenin know the real reason for my being in beijing no nicholai answered have you ever been to montpellier the one in france thats the one yes but it wasnt there voroshenin answered he rudely stared at nicholai for another moment then said no offense but i once knew a woman in leningrad with eyes like yours she well were all comrades here right friends he was met with silence nicholai noted but despite the wellknown chinese reticence about public discussions of sexuality voroshenin continued she was a tiger in the sheets i had her every which way if you know what i mean the slight laughter was forced the moment horribly awkward voroshenin must be very confident in his power nicholai thought to so brazenly offend his hosts sensibilities certainly he knew better he just didnt seem to care as evidenced by the selfsatisfied leer that lingered on his face and his vulgar reference to my mother nicholai wondered a shot in the dark or does he know and is testing me a part of nicholai wanted to do it now it would be easy a simple matter of thrusting a chopstick through his eye and into his brain done in a flash before voroshenins thugs lurking like dogs along the wall could do anything but confirm their bosss death but that would be suicide so he met voroshenins gaze smiled and asked can you keep a secret comrade voroshenin voroshenin smiled in return i was born for it nicholai leaned slightly toward him and held his eye as he said im here to do a killing chen gasped nicholai laughed and said im sorry my mandarin its rusty what i meant to say of course is that im here to make a killing the diners laughed then voroshenin his face reddening said thats still a brave remark to make at a table full of communists mon ami i am what i believe you call a useful capitalist nicholai answered voroshenins eyes had provided no answer as to the state of the mans knowledge certainly he had been insulted and flushed with anger but then he seemed equally relieved when nicholai explained his grammatical error thats the expression yu said now enough talk of business at the table we are being terrible hosts interrogating our guest we should show brotherly hospitality so what in beijing would you like to see comrade guibert nicholai named the expected the temple of heaven the forbidden city perhaps an excursion to the great wall then he decided it was time to push a line of stones forward into voroshenins part of the board after all the russian had come this far toward him it was only polite to return the gesture and opera nicholai added careful to look at yu and not voroshenin i would very much like if possible to attend a real beijing opera are you a devotee of jingju voroshenin asked his interest piqued i try nicholai answered in his minds eye seeing the opponents white stones moving into place i studied the file on you you total bastard i know who you are its difficult in hong kong as you know impossible in france as you might guess but yes im a fan im going this week voroshenin said id be honored if you would accompany me really nicholai asked thats very kind if its not too much trouble none at all voroshenin assured him im going anyway the dream of the west chamber at the zhengyici and xun huisheng himself is singing the huadan the red maid role ive always wanted to hear him nicholai said yu said catch him while you can the party doesnt approve of men playing women on the stage it is effete and unnatural we shall soon be putting an end to this anachronistic practice but xun is sublime voroshenin argued these old operas are a waste of time yu sniffed ancient fairy tales and romantic fables of the old ruling class the jingju should be utilized for social purposes for propaganda and education madame mao is an enthusiast voroshenin argued of course yu countered and we are given to understand that she is even now writing new operas that will instruct the people in socialist principles sounds wonderful voroshenin said dryly he turned back to nicholai if youd like to attend i have a private box if your opponent is of a choleric nature he will be unable to restrain himself he will seek you out and show you the open gate to his vulnerability let your enemy come to you i accept nicholai answered with pleasure its a date a rendezvous he thought the waiters brought out a new platter set it in the middle of the table and nicholai saw that chen was looking at him for a reaction not to disappoint nicholai asked what is this yang shuang chang chen said then clarified goats intestine filled with blood a delicacy yu and chen watched for his response nicholai knew that the dinner was not only a ritual but a test of his manners his language skills his temperament it was also a timehonored ploy to lull a business associate with massive amounts of food and drink to dull his mind move the blood from his brain into digesting the food he was also aware that the selection of dishes was also a measure of his attitudes for so long insulted by western condescension and cultural arrogance the chinese wanted to see if he would meet them on their own terms if not it could very well end the business deal that was the cover for his mission nicholai was somewhat satisfied to see that voroshenins face had turned slightly green not waiting for yu nicholai speared a piece with his chopstick leaned across the table and put it on voroshenins plate then he took a piece for himself and put it directly into his mouth exquisite nicholai said to his hosts apparent delight then he looked at voroshenin and asked you dont like it the russian pinched the chunk of bloody intestine and popped it into his mouth but was unable to keep the expression of distaste off his face small victories nicholai thought are nevertheless to be savored the yang shuang was followed by a dessert course to please the western guests although it consisted of mandarinstyle delicacies such as glazed yams small honeycomb cakes and jellied bean curd nicholai was full to the point of bursting yu leaned back in his chair and said now we can really drink in honor of their respective nationalities they switched between maotai vodka and pernod a dusty bottle of which the bartender found in the back of a cabinet toasts were proposed and drunk our french guest our chinese hosts the eternal friendship between our three countries it was another test nicholai knew an effort to loosen his tongue with alcohol to see if he was who he said he was and a dangerous test for getting into a drinking match with voroshenin was no mean feat the russian was big a practiced drinker who could hold his liquor so could yu for a small man and the toasts went on our beloved chairman the great pilot comrade stalin who shows the way jean jaurès between toasts nicholai struggled to keep his head and recall his briefings as voroshenin pushed the conversation toward guiberts background there is a café in montpellier voroshenin said casually renowned among the locals for its pain au chocolat le rochefort on the square of st martin on the place steanne actually thats right through his thickening head nicholai thanked solange for her attention to detail and incessant drills even as his head began to swim but that was the point of drill after all just as in the martial arts repetition trained one to go beyond thought into pure reflex voroshenin kept at it the russian invited him to share memories some true others false about restaurants regional dishes even the local football side nicholai fended off each probe then chen started in about hong kong he had been there as a young man when he had fled the nationalist police for a while he waxed on about victoria peak the peninsula hotel the street markets of kowloon where did you live he asked on the hill nicholai answered casually recalling haverfords briefing and the fact that staged photographs had been created of him outside guiberts home in hong kong pictures that were doubtless in chens file chen then proceeded to ask him about a tea merchant on the hill that didnt exist and nicholai admitted to ignorance of any such place it would have been a childishly easy trap to avoid had nicholai been anywhere near sober but with three brands of strong liquor swirling around his stomach and brain nothing was easy he realized that they had been at the table for nigh unto four hours and not a jot of business had been discussed but i have been vetted he thought and now i must wait to see if ive passed the tests voroshenin rose unsteadily to his feet back to the office for me im afraid you know the kremlin night owls it is the same with us yu said pushing back his chair chen steadied him as he got up a pleasure voroshenin said to nicholai those eyes i wish i could remember a countess would you believe i will see you at the opera then thursday night its a date nicholai answered i will kill you during the dream of the west chamber sleep well comrade voroshenin voroshenin chose to walk home from the banquet to let the cold air attempt to clear the alcoholinduced fog from his head one bodyguard walked ahead the other two kept a pace or so behind him their hands in their coats on the butts of their pistols idiots voroshenin thought beijing especially this quarter is perhaps the safest city in the world the criminal class had been mostly exterminated in public executions and an assassination attempt was highly unlikely the only people who might try are the chinese themselves and if they want to kill me these three arent going to stop them but mao still needs to maintain his crouching posture and suck stalins balls so we are all pretty safe in china the greatest risk is being bored to death or the related danger of cirrhosis of the liver but this guibert if thats his name if hes a french gunrunner im a japanese sumo wrestler the man is a frenchman all right down to the stench of his cologne but an arms merchant hes far too aristocratic for that bourgeois occupation he possesses the slightly remote and superior air of a russian those damn green eyes was it possible back in his legation quarters voroshenin picked up the phone and dialed leotovs rooms get down here its two oclock in the i own a watch i said to bring your skinny ass down here five minutes later a sleepy and slightly resentfullooking leotov appeared in voroshenins office get on a secure line to moscow voroshenin ordered i want everything on this michel guibert and his family leotov glanced at his watch dont say it voroshenin ordered berias men rather famously work nights or would you like to find that out for yourself also i want everything on an old white the countess alexandra ivanovna i believe she might have left petrograd sometime in thats thirty years ago is it well done vasili see youve already got a start on it a soon as leotov left voroshenin opened the desk drawer and pulled out the bottle despite himself he poured a stiff drink and knocked it back those damn green eyes general liu zhu de was small of stature his irongray hair was cut short and his browned lined face showed both his southern roots and every step he had taken on the long journey from guerrilla leader in sichuan through the long march and creation of the th route army to the hideous losses he had suffered in command of the korean venture it was said that liu felt the death of every soldier he had opposed the korea invasion hadnt wanted the command but took it as a matter of duty now almost two years later each of the three hundred thousand casualties showed in his eyes and rumor had it that he blamed mao for every one of them colonel yu knocked on his door received permission to enter and sat down in the gray metal chair across from the generals desk he admired liu more than any man alive a fellow native of sichuan the general was a true communist and a patriot unlike the wouldbe emperor mao general liu worked for china and the people mao worked for mao and mao how was dinner liu asked his voice sounded tired voroshenin showed up didnt we think that he would he knows about the weapons to the viet minh liu nodded kang tipped him off he has spies in our department im sure shall i send guibert away not necessarily liu said tell me about him yu related the events of the dinner guiberts knowledge of chinese his manners his intelligence his little victories over voroshenin so you think he could be our man liu asked possibly liu sat back in his chair to think yu knew the issues the russians were keen to prevent chinese influence in vietnam as such they wanted to interfere with arms shipments that might earn china just that influence mao was a fool he had already let stalin trick him into the korean disaster and now he was falling even deeper into the soviets arms but a quick look at the map showed the danger the russians already controlled north korea and with it the long northeast border and the strategic yellow sea they retained bases in manchuria to the northeast and outer mongolia to the northwest to the west they threatened xinjiang its muslim population eager to join their brethren in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan let the russians gain control of vietnam as well and they would have the southern border too the french were walking ghosts in all of southeast asia it was only a matter of time the russians would scoop up cambodia then move on to the weak sister in siam and burma soviet agents were already busy in india the soviets could soon have china surrounded and then they would gobble up manchuria and the rest of mongolia and xinjiang but for now vietnam was the key the korean stalemate was all but over the soviets would control the north the americans the south vietnam was the next front the problem was that the americans were going to move in to replace the french that would be a terrible mistake for the united states and a huge problem for china an american move against the viet minh would derail any possible détente between beijing and washington and drive china toward moscow the americans were busy making their own worst nightmare come true a communist monolith but the future of china general liu knew it and yu believed it was not with russia but with the united states only america could provide a counterweight against the soviets only an alliance or at least a working relationship with washington could bring china the economic prosperity it needed to develop approaches indirect and tentative had been made but had been rebuffed by antiprogressive elements in the american intelligence and diplomatic communities the diplomats in washington were as afraid of their rightwing radicals as the chinese were of their own leftwing extremists yet approaches had been made people were at least talking and if general liu could count on washingtons support he might feel strong enough to make a move against the fauxcommunist dictator who now terrorized china but yu knew they were in a race against the clock the viet minh were going to win in vietnam the americans were also sending aid money and weapons to the french and had the cia crawling all over the country laying the foundation for the eventual takeover only a quick and decisive victory against the french might dissuade washington from a disastrous intervention that would keep america and china apart for decades and such a quick victory would require weapons rocket launchers for instance but liu thought we cannot afford to be seen doing it just yet we need middlemen we need the michel guiberts nicholai knelt over the toilet and vomited maotai vodka pernod and most of the contents of what had been a superb feast it is as the buddhists say he thought resting between retches everything changes and at the end of the day the most pleasurable food turns a disgusting mess he vomited again then splashed some cold water on his face and brushed his teeth not bothering to undress he just flopped face first on the bed for a few hours sleep he awoke early just before dawn got dressed then jotted a quick note in code which when haverford transliterated it would read zhengyici opera thursday night he rolled the thin paper into a tight cylinder and put it in the left pocket of his jacket on the street just as a fragile sun was coming up over the city he made a show of stretching just as a sleepy and very grouchylooking xiao smiley emerged his arms wrapped around his chest against the cold nicholai took off jogging the air burned his lungs and the wind stung his face but the exercise felt good and the acceleration of his heartbeat quickly warmed him as he ran north toward beihai park workers were already out sweeping last nights light dusting of snow off the sidewalks and the nightsoil collectors were coming back from delivering containers of human waste out to the countryside on the hutongs of xidan market the vendors were setting up their stands and lighting small fires in braziers stopping from moment to moment to warm their hands over the flames the smell of charcoal was in the air nicholai kept running aware that he was leaving the chugging smiley far behind it wouldnt be long though before the greyhound joined the chase and caught up with him he sped up barely avoided a spill on a sheen of black ice regained his balance and kept running until he reached beihai park he slowed to a jog again and trotted along the edge of the lake even in winter the earlymorning tai chi players were out moving slowly and gracefully against the silver sky and nicholai was suddenly serenely happy to be back in china again he ran along the lakeside and then turned left on the arched bridge to the jade isle he stopped at the apex of the bridge put his hands on the tiled rail and stretched his legs looking under his arm he saw the greyhound running along the lake headed toward him nicholai reached into his left pocket his hand screened by his body took out the note and slipped it under the loose tile then he finished his stretch and resumed his run making a circuit around the white pagoda and then heading down toward the south gate smiley stood on the south bridge cupping a cigarette in his gloved hands nicholai ran past him and headed back toward the hotel the air in the lobby felt hot and close nicholai went straight to his room coaxed some lukewarm water from the tap and took a quick bath he made a single cup of tea from the water in his thermos got dressed again and went down to the dining room where he got more tea a baozi and some pickled vegetables he enjoyed the moist chewy warmth of the steamed bun as he thought about the dead drop he had made on the bridge fairly confident that he had done it cleanly he had to acknowledge the possibility that he had been caught at it in which case he knew that the note was now in the possession of codebreakers and that he would soon be back in a prison cell a torture chamber or both he couldnt read chens face as his handler came through the door and approached him how are you this morning chen asked a little the worse for wear nicholai answered and you very good chen said colonel yu would like to see you now are you ready to go nicholai was ready the monk his hands folded in front of him stepped out of the white pagoda earlier just after dawn the monk known as xue xin had meditated in the tower and stared out the window onto the jade isle bridge and seen the man lean against the railing now he walked slowly toward the bridge slowly because he did not want to appear to be in a hurry but also because his legs were oddly bowed and he had little choice but to walk slowly he knew that he was risking his life knew that there was a strong possibility that any of the other strollers in the park or one of the tai chi players or a street hawker even one of the other monks might be a police spy waiting to see who came to pick up the message then one of two things would happen either they would arrest him immediately or they would lay back and follow him hoping that he would lead them to the entire cell but he knew that he wouldnt let that happen he was experienced enough to spot surveillance and skilled enough to dispatch himself with his own hand should it come to that xue xin would not allow himself to be captured he had been captured before tortured he had learned what no man should have to learn the sounds of his own screams and when they returned him to the cage it was only the kindness of his cellmate that kept him alive gave him hope when he wished to die shared the meager handfuls of rice that were their starvation diet now ten years later he still limped he knew that he shouldnt be alive at all his captors had decided to kill them all before the japanese took over so they marched them to a field outside the prison handed them sharpened sticks and made them dig a long trench when the common grave was finished they were lined up in front of it and xue xin was eager for the bullet that would end this life but the commandant explained that they were not worthy of expensive bullets and would be slashed and stabbed to death instead then it started a blur of silver blades and spraying blood and xue xin felt himself fall backward into the trench and was glad for death it seemed days later when he felt the dirt falling on him and he wanted to scream that he was still alive but he swallowed his fear and pain with the dirt the monks came that night like ghosts they padded through the fog and dug with their hands literally pulling him from the grave weeks later he could stand weeks after that he could walk if you could call it walking he had bad dreams every night waking in that grave now xue xin walked past the loosened tile in the bridge deftly snatched the message and tucked it into his robe in his other hand he clutched a slim sharp blade meant for his belly if they came for him or if he detected anyone following him but no one did he walked undetected out of the north gate into a hutong in the northcentral district five minutes later he was in the back of a small house squatting by the dim glow of a small radio transmitter into which he read the coded message he left the house reciting on mani padme hung the jewel is in the lotus the blade plunged deep into the victims belly the man gasped and then tried to stuff his innards back into his stomach as he staggered through the alley near luang prabangs crowded marketplace but it was far too late the cobra jerked the knife back turned away and walked quickly out the dark alley into the streets of the northern laotian town it all had to do with something called operation x but the cobra didnt really care all that mattered was the money and the payments from this client were always prompt and reliable the cobra fingered a small medallion and could feel the outline of the embossed face and the script per tu amicu for your friendship a large crowd had formed in tiananmen square traffic stopped and nicholai looked out his window to see a military caravan soviet trucks and american jeeps come past as the crowd hooted and jeered nicholai spotted the objects of their derision two men one western and one asian stood in the back of an open jeep propped up by pla soldiers holding their legs their arms bound to their sides by ropes in an open truck behind them a squad of soldiers sat their rifles held barrel up members of the mob threw garbage and old vegetables shouted insults rushed at the jeep and spat at the prisoners spies chen explained watching for nicholais reaction an italian and a japanese they were plotting to assassinate the chairman truly they confessed chens car fell in behind the military caravan as it slowly made its way past tiananmen square toward the temple of heaven the parade halted at the bridge of heaven and the crowd swarmed around it like an amoeba soldiers jumped out of the truck and roughly pulled the prisoners from the jeep and shoved them to an open space at the base of the bridge other soldiers used the rifles to push people back as an officer formed other soldiers into a file you execute them in public nicholai asked it teaches a lesson in a reversal of ethnic stereotypes the italian stood silent and stoic while the japanese prisoners legs gave out and he dropped to his knees sobbing a soldier yanked him back and then nicholai saw a man dressed in a long black coat and black hat emerge from the back of a car and walk toward the prisoners he held sheaves of paper in his left hand kang sheng said chen a tremor of fear in his voice nicholai watched kang strut in front of the crowd stand beside the prisoners and shout the proclamation that recited their crimes and condemned them to the peoples righteous rage the chairman in his mercy had allowed them to be shot instead of strangled beheaded or simply beaten to death by the mob kang finished the speech posed for a moment and then stepped offstage the officer shouted an order and the rifles were lifted with a metallic clatter that echoed through the crisp air the italian braced himself but nicholai could see the stain of urine darken his trousers the crowd saw it too and made much fun of it look he pisses himself he drank too much wine last night the japanese dropped to his knees again a soldier started for him but the annoyed officer shook his head barked another order and three soldiers adjusted their aim the officer had a feel for the moment and he lifted his arm but paused for dramatic effect until the crowd quieted there was a moment of silence and then the officer dropped his hand and shouted the rifles roared and nicholai saw the two prisoners crumple to the ground the temple of heaven its famous bluetiled roof glistening in the sun loomed over them spies chen concluded nicholais message was relayed five times before it reached haverford in tokyo still it arrived accurately and haverford decoded it instantly zhengyici opera thursday night the staff at the cia station in tokyo rushed into action within minutes haverford had a map of beijing and several aerial photographs in front of him and he drew a red circle around the zhengyici opera house minutes after that a chinese refugee a beijing native was in the room and identified the building as being in the xuanwu district southwest of the old city not far from the temple of heaven one of the oldest parts of the city it was a rabbit warren of narrow hutongs and old tenement houses before the communist takeover the area was host to the bada hutongs the redlight district haverford thanked and dismissed him then got on a secure line to bill benton chief of station beijing now working out of macau i need photos and plans of something called the zhengyici opera house haverford said and an asset check in the xuanwu district normally a request like this would take weeks if it was answered at all but benton had been told in no uncertain terms that haverford had immediate access status the requested pics and plans were on the wire within fifteen minutes and an hour later benton was back on the horn what do we have in xuanwu haverford asked youre in luck the temple of the green truth is right down the street and what pray tell is the temple of the green truth haverford said as he scanned for it and then found the building on the map the oldest mosque in beijing benton answered a photo of the temple appeared under haverfords nose it looked like any old chinese temple buddhist or daoist with blueandred columns and a sloping roof but then haverford noticed that the roof tiles were not the usual blue but green the commies left it standing no choice its in the middle of a hui neighborhood haverford knew that benton was playing the i know more than you know game but it was typical of the old china hands always defensive about the fact that they lost the country to the communists and ever resentful at now being subordinate to the asia desk and johnnycomelatelies like haverford but he was sympathetic most of their assets had been rolled up and now an entirely new network had to be built slowly and painfully chinesespeaking muslim minority benton explained been in beijing for a thousand years they call their brand of islam qing zhen the green truth do we own a few of these huis haverford asked more than a few benton answered they hate the fucking reds see them as godless infidels trying to suppress their religion also theyre hooked into the muslim minority out in xinjiang who are looking to secede it has possibilities haverford thought ill need an extraction team we can do that and a dead drop location for an asset in beijing haverford added can you toss a few guns to xinjiang sure ill get back to you with details benton said ill come to hong kong to work out the details he didnt want benton fucking this up and he didnt have much time to finalize a plan and get it to hel the weapon looked as ugly as it was lethal there is no honor and hence no beauty in it nicholai thought a sword is beautiful for the care and craft that goes into its creation and honorable for the courage it takes to wield in personal combat but a rocket launcher it is ugly in proportion to its destructive power anonymously produced by soulless drones on an assembly line in some american factory it brings no distinction to its owner just the ability to kill and destroy from a distance still nicholai had to admit as yu recited the weapons particulars its power was impressive the m rocket launcheraka the super bazooka weighed a mere fifteen pounds and was a little over sixty inches long half of that being barrel it fired an eightpound heat rocket that at a velocity of feet per second could penetrate eleven inches of armor plating at an effective range of a hundred yards it could take out a heavy tank an armored personnel carrier a halftrack or a fortified pillbox the weapon basically a tube with an electric firing device and a reflecting sight attached could be broken down into two pieces for easy carrying by two men it could be fired from a standing sitting or critically for its intended purpose prone position that is a man could lie in a rice paddy or stand of elephant grass and get off an accurate shot a welltrained team of two men could fire six rounds inside of a minute while an elite team could fire as many as sixteen shots in the same period of time could one man operate it if he had to nicholai asked once its on its tripod and they are included of course comrade guibert nicholai made him open each of the fifty cases and inspected each rocket launcher he was no expert on these weapons but a failure to do so would have aroused yus suspicions no serious arms dealer as guibert certainly was would have gambled on buying five cases of rocket launchers and fortyfive cases of mud bricks the weapons were packed in a thin layer of grease to prevent fungus damage to the gunsights you provide the solvent to clean them nicholai asked of course fifty of these weapons nicholai contemplated each of them capable of taking out a french tank halftrack or pillbox could make an enormous difference to the viet minh perhaps a decisive difference the viet minh had prematurely launched a conventional offensive against the french troops on the day river gunned down en masse by superior french firepower and armor the viet minh lost eleven thousand men in just twentysix days of fighting even so they had almost prevailed and might have done so had the americans not intervened with yet another new weapon they called it napalm liquid fire dropped from airplanes and the viet minh were incinerated where they stood does the american genius for mass destruction know no bounds nicholai wondered recalling the firebombing of tokyo and of course the atomic weapons that annihilated hiroshima and nagasaki ill take them he said depending of course on the price not that he really needed to drive a bargain haverford had supplied him with more than enough money but again what kind of arms merchant wouldnt try to drive the price down not michel guibert i am authorized to negotiate for the defense ministry yu said perhaps over lunch they repaired to an enclosed pavilion overlooking longtan lake the food was quite good a whole boiled fish in a sweet brown sauce followed by greens in garlic and then zha jiang ma thick wheat noodles with ground pork in yellow soybean sauce nicholai asked so what is your price what is your offer yu asked refusing to take the bait of making the first bid nicholai stated a ridiculously low figure perhaps you misunderstand yu replied you are not purchasing just the crates but the contents as well he quadrupled nicholais offer perhaps i misspoke nicholai responded i wish to buy fifty not five hundred but he raised his offer a bit we have expenses yu said he gave his new figure apparently heavy ones nicholai answered but now he knew yus real price for the colonel had shifted in mere arithmetic proportion toward his goal an unimaginative go player lacking in subtlety or flair but nicholai was eager to conclude this distasteful bargaining so he raised his offer to a figure just below yus desired one he was surprised when yu accepted it raised nicholais hackles and he wondered why yu quickly provided the answer now we must discuss transportation nicholai feigned interest of course he had no intention of actually buying these arms much less shipping them anywhere by the time the weapons were ready to go he would have killed voroshenin and hopefully made his escape still the game must be played so he said of course i will pay reasonable shipping charges to some location near the vietnamese border yu nodded you will deposit the funds into an account in lausanne when we have received the payment we will give you a location in yunnan province the appropriate army unit will help you to transport the merchandise to the vietnamese border beyond that it is up to you and your ultimate client i will deposit half the money into the swiss account nicholai replied and the other half when the merchandise and myself arrive safely at the border your lack of trust is unsettling i am told nicholai responded that despite the doubtless heroic efforts of the pla the mountains of yunnan are rife with bandits there are a few very minor counterrevolutionary elements clinging to survival yu answered we will wipe these tu fei out soon in the meantime nicholai said i should not wish my merchandise to be taken from me until i can deliver it to my client pardon my rudeness but i cannot help but think that the local army unit of which you spoke would be even more diligent if it had shall we say a rooting interest yu set down his chopsticks capitalists always assume that everyone is motivated by money and communists are not nicholai answered hence the bank account in lausanne and why do you assume that i am a capitalist you are certainly not a communist im a guibertist nicholai responded yu chuckled twothirds and onethird done nicholai picked up his chopsticks and went back to eating the deal is made liu asked yes answered yu good liu said and is he still pretending to be this frenchman guibert and doing it very well as a matter of fact liu laughed diamond picked up the phone yeah its me the voice said benton haverford asked me to bring you up to date im listening diamond said he chuckled to himself benton liked his job was lucky to still have it and wanted to keep it you are a chen searched for the word in chinese then decided on french gourmet nicholai shrugged im french when hed returned from his meeting with yu a pretty desk clerk at the hotel handed him his key and asked if he needed a suggestion as to a restaurant for the evening please nicholai said may i recommend hong binlou she asked chen was quite pleased that guibert wanted to go to the distinguished old establishment to sample its distinctive muslim cuisine one of the perquisites of being an escort to a foreign visitor was the opportunity to dine in restaurants that he otherwise couldnt afford or even if he had the money frequent custom of the finer establishments could expose him to accusations of decadence of course there was no pork but that was more than made up for by the succulent lamb on wooden skewers the mongolian hotpot and especially the sliced sautéed eel the waiters all of the hui people who had migrated from the western provinces generations ago wore short white jackets black trousers and as muslims white pillbox caps the few women in the place mostly relatives of the owners were veiled or wore shawls to cover their heads religious superstition chen felt obligated to say in order to cover himself in political orthodoxy you are a catholic i suppose by birth nicholai replied halfway through the meal nicholai excused himself to go to the toilet the waiter gave him only the slightest glance as he passed by him near the kitchen and eased through the narrow hallway to the toilet locking the door behind him nicholai relieved himself to satisfy any listening ears and turned on the tap to wash his hands and cover the sound of lifting the lid of the old water tank the message written on cigarette paper was stuck to the inside of the tank by a piece of gum nicholai translated the code committed it to memory then tore the paper into small shreds dropped them into the toilet and flushed you feel all right chen asked him when he returned to the table splendid nicholai answered why i was worried that the eel might have upset your stomach chen said its a common dish in my part of france nicholai said ah the waiter was a young man handsome with high cheekbones and startling blue eyes his hand trembled just a little as he handed nicholai the bill was everything as you hoped comrade it was everything id been told nicholai said glad that chen was busy mopping up the last of the red sauce with a steamed bun and didnt notice the waiters anxiety i am so pleased i will tell the chef please do the car and driver were waiting out front shall we walk instead nicholai suggested it is very cold were well fortified nicholai said patting his stomach inside and out chen agreed but was not pleased a car and driver were major privileges and now the foreign guest wanted to walk like a peasant still he must be humored the whisperings were that he had just concluded an important piece of business with the ministry of defense shoes crunching on the snow nicholai listened to the rhythm of his footfalls as he reviewed haverfords instructions in his head complete the termination run out of the theater through the market and into the temple of the green truth the extraction team anticommunist hui muslims will be waiting for you they will take you by truck to the port of qinhuangdao where a fishing boat will take you out to an american submarine in the yellow sea good luck good luck indeed nicholai thought it would take insanely good luck even to get out of the opera house never mind make it through the narrow streets to the mosque and then would the extraction team be able to get him through the multiple checkpoints all the way out to qinhuangdao doubtful but there was little point in dwelling on the unlikelihood nicholai got up for his morning run this time smiley and the greyhound were ready for him and nicholai wryly noted that they were now wearing running shoes at least the pla version of them nicholai didnt really like running it seemed a dull repetitive exercise lacking the excitement of cave exploration or the demands of naked kill kata but he supposed that it served a cardiovascular purpose hitting a stride he turned his mind to the challenge of killing voroshenin the russian had a box at the theater which provided the necessary privacy but would be easily secured doubtless his three bodyguards would be present as would the usual chinese security both plainclothes and regular police voroshenins guards will doubtless search me nicholai thought before allowing me into the box next to their master so i can have no kind of weapon on me thats not particularly a problem he told himself in fact its the precise reason you were selected for this assignment and are now jogging through the brisk beijing air instead of rotting in your sugamo prison cell the killing itself would be relatively easy at some point voroshenin would lean toward the performance on the stage thereby exposing his neck or throat to a lethal strike if this were a suicide mission in the japanese style there would be nothing further to consider nicholai would simply prepare himself for death and that would be that but given that you do not prefer to die he thought as he turned north toward beihai park you must then consider how you are going to dispatch voroshenin and get out of that box never mind the building the theater will be dark with the bright lights focused on the stage so that was an advantage then there is the noise beijing opera with its drums gongs and shrill vocalizations seemed to the uninitiated a migraineinducing cacophony that would easily drown out the sound of voroshenins dying although nicholai hoped to reduce that anyway with an efficient strike he entered the park and then decided to give his followers the gift of a little variety by taking the west instead of the east path around the lake its the least that i can do he thought for getting them up so early and there is no scheduled dead drop on the bridge anyway but he thought what if i can kill voroshenin without anyone noticing at all then i could simply get up and walk out followed only by my chinese handlers whom i could then leave behind in the hutongs of xuanwu before disappearing into the mosque is it possible he asked himself as he jogged along the lakes edge of course it is he thought hearing the voice of general kishikawa never consider the possibility of successconsider only the impossibility of failure hai kishikawasama he reviewed the dozens of methods that naked kill offered to dispatch an opponent from close range without undue fuss then he sorted them into categories based on his potential situation sitting to the right of voroshenin to the left behind him or a bit more difficult if he were separated by a seat with a guard or another guest between him and his target difficult yes but not impossible only failure is impossible unthinkable as he rounded the northern edge of the lake nicholai broke into a sprint to break up the boredom but mostly to see what sort of speed the greyhound really had it might come to that a footrace to create space and time to lose the man in xuanwu the greyhound lived up his moniker he accepted nicholais challenge and stayed with him for the first minute or so but then nicholai took it up another notch gained ground again and noted that the greyhound couldnt catch up so it is possible nicholai thought as he slowed down so as not to cause his followers any undue alarm it is possible to do this thing and live back at the hotel he stripped off his sweaty clothes took a quick bath in water that could only achieve tepid dressed and went downstairs for a spare breakfast of warm soy milk and pickled vegetables he had been eating too much and too richly his body felt consequently dull and slow chen arrived a few minutes later he sat down barked an order for tea and looked at nicholai unhappily you like to exercise he accused dropping all pretense that his guest was not under constant surveillance is that a problem it is selfindulgent i had thought quite the opposite chens mug of tea arrived at the table it is selfindulgent he explained in the sense that it uses up the peoples resources that could be better spent elsewhere such as lounging around the lobby nicholai asked wondering why it was so much fun to bait chen my men are very busy chen said they have a lot to do comrade chen i agree with you completely nicholai said it is a total waste of precious time and resources for your men to follow me about they are not following you chen huffed they are protecting you certainly it is a waste of resources to offer protection in the new peoples society nicholai observed blandly where crime is an anachronism that has been relegated to the imperialist past they protect you chen insisted growing more agitated against counterrevolutionary agents ah nicholai said he bowed slightly i now realize the mistake in my thinking please accept my apologies for my thoughtlessness i shall cease my morning run no chen said softening i just wanted to make you aware is that all youre having for breakfast it was nicholai answered but now i am thinking perhaps some steamed buns with red bean paste only if you want only if you will share them with me only to be a congenial host that settled they ordered the buns and friends again ate and discussed safely mundane topics such as the weather then they got up and went to the bank although they deeply resented these symbols of capitalism the communists nevertheless needed banks to conduct business so several survived in beijing their staffs vaguely shamed and tinged with guilt by association which bank chen asked when they got into the car banque de lindochine nicholai answered of course chens response was colored with mild irony there were banks and there were banks some kept a close eye on the transactions of their depositors others were more famous for blinking banque de lindochine had a wellearned reputation for the latter its censorial eyesight as stringently selective as that of southeast asia itself cheerfully and selfconsciously corrupt if a french arms dealer was going to conduct shady monetary business in asia banque de lindochine was the place to do it nicholai took a pack of cigarettes from his coat and offered one to chen and the other to the driver then lit all three xie xie the driver said the first words he had spoken to nicholai it took only a few minutes to get to the bank the driver waited in the car while chen took nicholai inside and asked to see the manager all bank managers are the same nicholai thought as the man emerged from his office looking slightly startled at having been interrupted for business this close to opening time this one quickly affected the standard attitude that any transaction with a depositor was an interruption nicholai had intended to speak chinese but now he used french instead do you speak french comrade yes of course the manager said jutting his chin toward the window into which the french banque de lindochine was etched nicholai thought the manager looked a little uncomfortable in his mao jacket certainly he would have preferred the standard charcoal gray suit that was uniform for bankers back in the good old days i wish to make a wire transfer and i wish to make it privately nicholai said deliberately rude so that the banker would instantly understand the difference in their social status behave obediently and want him to conduct his business quickly and leave he didnt want the manager to check too many papers or perform too much due diligence you have an account with us i assume yes of course nicholai said he handed the manager his passbook created by the cias forgers the manager glanced at it and your passport nicholai gave him the passport and the manager looked from the photo to nicholai and then back again very well mon comrade guibert please come with me when chen started to come with them the manager snapped not you nicholai followed the manager down a hallway to a glassed cubicle that contained a desk and a single chair he gestured for nicholai to sit down and then said please complete these forms nicholai sat and filled out the complex paperwork as the manager discreetly turned his back he handed the papers over and the manager asked him to make himself comfortable and wait as he waited nicholai hoped that haverford had indeed deposited the necessary funds the chinese were serious about business and wouldnt tolerate a deadbeat if the funds are not in the account nicholai thought i will be swiftly shown the door and just as quickly given the bums rush out of the country that was the best scenario the worst possibility would be that the paperwork would trigger an internal alert of some kind that there had been a leak from cia and that it would be the chinese police not the cowed manager who returned to the room the phone rang in haverfords room at the peninsula hotel in hong kong monsieur cartier the voice asked speaking french with a heavy vietnamese accent yes a large transfer of funds request has just come through our vientiane branch the speaker said and triggered an internal notice that you were to be notified yes from a monsieur guibert routed to what destination please the speaker rattled off an account number in lausanne thats fine yes thank you good morning good morning twenty long minutes later the manager returned with the happy news that everything seemed to be in order and escorted nicholai to a different room where a wire operator sat behind a broad wooden table the manager handed the operator the papers and told him to effect the transfer the funds will be available at opening of business in switzerland the manager said nonverbally according nicholai more respect it had been a very large sum indeed thank you nicholai said thank you for banking with us the manager replied then needing to let nicholai know that he was a busy man he added if there is nothing else that will be all thank you nicholai met the insulted chen back in the lobby finished chen asked brusquely the man is an officious fool nicholai said it doesnt matter i would like to see some of the sights now nicholai said if you would be kind enough to escort me with pleasure they got back in the car and headed for the great wall the plan haverford thought as he stood at the star ferry landing in kowloon is coming together hel had received the message sent through the muslim restaurant he knew where to go and how to get there the members of the extraction team composed of hui were making their way to the temple of the green truth well need some talent haverford warned things could get tough benton answered the whole team is trained in a muslim chinese martial art bajiquan very good for closerange work in confined spaces same art used by maos personal bodyguard the team leader is a master hell need to be haverford said dont worry benton answered hes quick and clean quick maybe haverford thought but nothing about what we do is ever clean it would be good to get out of hong kong haverford never really liked the city and the british were ridiculously sensitive about the cousins poaching on their turf just this morning his british counterpart wooten had accosted him at the breakfast table at the peninsula before haverford could even get down a cup of the less than mediocre coffee good morning adrian haverford said a little early for you isnt it a bloody marys on the way over wooten answered a large bluff man with if haverford recalled correctly a rugby background wooten looked out of place in china looks were deceptive wooten was a noted sinologist a first at cambridge and a lifetime in asia attesting to the fact what brings you onto my patch ellis it isnt the coffee ill tell you that then what is it awfully direct adrian its early and im hungover the waiter arrived with the bloody mary wooten took a grateful sip just passing through haverford said on my way back from macau checking in with some of the tealeaf readers there anything my king should know about not unless hes awfully bored haverford said its the usual unusual the chairman is winnowing his enemies what opposition he has are keeping their heads low antithis and antithat campaigns are going on my boys reported a benton sighting yesterday everybody gotta be someplace haverford answered echoing the old myron cohen joke hed have to catch him the next time he was back in new york but damn benton and his leadfootedness wooten nodded but a benton sighting and a haverford sighting raises the hackles you must admit haverford shrugged wootens red face turned unusually serious as he said i dont want you mucking around on my pitch ellis you or benton or the both of you do i make myself clear im just back to tokyo adrian didnt mean to be inhospitable wooten said how are you getting to the airport taxi no need wooten said ill get one of my boys to drive you otherwise they just sit around all day quaffing beer so im being escorted out of the colony haverford thought all right by me the planning here is about done anyway wu zhong smashed his elbow into the wooden post a bolt of pain shot up from his forearm through his wrist and into his hand still open in the distinctive rake posture that gave bajiquan its name but wu exhaled it away and looked back at the splintered wood his elbow had put a hole three inches deep into the post that was bajiquan it relied on quick single devastating strikes its great master li wu shen once said i do not know what it feels like to hit a man twice had this post been a man the explosive force of the blow would have shattered his throat or his forehead or simply stopped his heart wu would have continued practicing but heard the call for prayer from the minaret just a block away he slipped into a white kaftan put on his cap and stepped out of the dojo onto nelson street the mosque was the largest in hong kong servicing the islands small but devout muslim community the ulama had grown in recent years as refugees fled from the mainland and found a more congenial home in cosmopolitan hong kong than in chiang kaisheks taiwan as he walked toward the mosque wu was glad to be going to prayer tonight he would be infiltrated through the new territories across the border into his homeland the assignment itself should be nothing the danger lay in getting in and getting out a wushu instructor with the kmt army for years before he retired to civilian life he would find rough handling if he fell into communist hands now thirtyfive years old wu had a wife and three young children who needed him still he could not refuse an assignment like this it paid well moreover it allowed him to strike a blow against the hated communists godless kaffirs who oppressed his people not only would he bring home a years worth of income but the american agent promised to provide a shipment of rifles to the nascent rebel movement in xinjiang a tall man with impressively broad shoulders he had to turn sideways to get through the old doorway of the mosque he shucked off his slippers found the prayer mat in its accustomed place walked into the sanctuary and knelt several other men all friends from the neighborhood were already there and had begun prostrating themselves stretching his forehead to the floor wu could not get the assignment out of his mind killing was as nothing he had used his mastery of bajiquan to kill many times before communists in shanghai japanese in hunan and then the reds again until chiang gave up the fight and left so many of them to flee for their lives now he was in a new war a jihad to save his people if killing helped to achieve that then so be it he would do it and if it was gods will that he survive and come home to his family then inshallah if not at least he knew that the ulama would not let his family starve a brother would marry his widow and take care of his children comforted by that thought wu gave himself over to prayer and the ritual as always felt good to him old solid and reliable there was joy in pure worship peace in the repetition of the ancient words as he chanted there is no god but allah and muhammad is his prophet a blearyeyed leotov stood in front of voroshenins desk he had worked all night and now voroshenin didnt as much as offer him a glass of tea although he sipped his own the white sugar sitting at the bottom of the glass like sand under a lake at one of the vacation dachas that voroshenin could use but leotov couldnt so voroshenin asked leotov started with guibert it all seemed to check out the guiberts were indeed a languedoc family of arms merchants with loose ties to the french communist party papa guibert opened a hong kong office to take advantage of the business opportunities presented by the incessant warfare between chinese warlords following the revolution he appeared to have ceased operations during the japanese occupation owing his survival to that discretion and to the vichy french status as noncombatants there were rumors however that he continued to work with american collusion with vietnamese rebels fighting against the japanese especially but not exclusively ho chi minh and that lot his leftist ideology appeared to be somewhat flexible as after the war he dealt with both nationalists and communists in china as well as with independence movements in french indochina connections with l union corse voroshenin asked citing the corsican mafia that controlled the drugs and arms between france and its southeast asian colonies naturally leotov answered although guibert isnt corsican so the relationship is strictly business certainly he dealt with la corse during the war what about the son voroshenin asked michel voroshenin sighed yes again all appeared to be as it seemed leotov laid some grainy photographs on the desk the son was born in montpellier but raised in hong kong hence his fluent cantonese he had the reputation of a gambler womanizer and neerdowell out of his fathers favor until after the war and the auto accident the what there was a car crash in leotov checked his notes the summer of in monaco michel had apparently dropped a bundle at the casino drowned his sorrows and crashed the car halfway through a wicked scurve apparently it was touch and go for a while and guibert fils needed extensive surgery to repair his face the surgeries seemed to have accomplished a character transplant of a sort the son emerged a changed more serious man eager to take his place in the family business thats interesting voroshenin said leotov shrugged he really didnt see what was so interesting about it voroshenin did he hadnt survived the stalinist purges by being tone deaf and this auto accident struck a discordant note reconstructive facial surgery followed by a moral metamorphosis where is the father now he asked do we know i suppose in hong kong you suppose find out yes comrade all right what about ivanovna i have a full report leotov started to recite his findings leave it but there are i said to leave it leotov set the file on the desk and left voroshenin opened the desk drawer he had a feeling he would need a stiff drink to read this file the great wall certainly is nicholai thought a monumental as it were achievement of architecture and organization but like a static go defense it never fulfilled its function of keeping out an invader there is no point building a wall when the gatekeepers can be purchased still the wall was a marvel to see as it stretched along the rises and falls of the ridges and hills flexible as a giant snake its stones resembling the scales of a reptile or a dragon perhaps nicholai thought in the chinese zoological cosmology no he decided the go analogy is more apt the wall was like a thin long line of stones vulnerable by its very length unsupported by defensive depth a lesson to be had there certainly chen fell asleep on the drive back to beijing sparing nicholai the necessity to make small talk instead he began to prepare his mind for the task at hand and as he thought about it he realized that he was soon to become a professional assassin he had killed three men in his young life nothing by the standards of his generation which had endured the slaughters of the war his first had been kishikawa his father figure and he had done it to spare his mentor shame so it was a matter of filial duty almost as if he had assisted the general in committing seppuku the next two had tried to kill him first so they were acts of selfdefense but this would be an intentional act of murder for profit he could rationalize it by thinking that he was reclaiming his own life and solanges but the fact remained that he was about to take anothers life to benefit his own and moral evasions were as useful as the towers of the great wall yet the monetary compensation from the americans was almost irrelevant this was a matter of honor voroshenin was not just another man another human life shortly before she died nicholais mother had told him the story of what happened between her and yuri voroshenin petrograd was frozen and fast running out of fuel the winter of was unusually harsh the small supply of coal had already dwindled and the communists were tearing down private homes for firewood the famed lindens of taurichesky gardens had been stripped of the branches for firewood and the trees looked like execution stakes it was a miracle no not a miracle but a testament to her iron will that the countess alexandra ivanovnas family house occupying half a block on kirochnaya street still stood although the soviet petrograd had forced her to turn most of it into a kpmmunalka housing several dozen workers families well workers in theory anyway the lack of fuel and materials and the hyperinflation brought on by western financial assaults on the ruble had closed many of petrograds factories the workers were freezing and starving it was on a february afternoon that yuri voroshenin then the head of the petrograd cheka climbed the steps to the huge wooden doors and kicked the snow off his shoes he entered without knocking the enormous foyer was full of people shuddering in coats and blankets and yet she had prevented them from chopping up the expensive wooden furniture that filled the house voroshenin walked past them onto the sweeping curved staircase and went up to the rooms where she retained her apartment she was thin her cheeks a little sunken her skin pale with hunger even the upper classes were hardpressed to find or pay for food nevertheless she regarded him with the haughty look of the ruling class as if to ask what he was doing disturbing her at such an early hour of the afternoon clearly he was not used to insolence he wanted her to be afraid as well she might have been for this creature was responsible for countless executions and hideous tortures and she was at his mercy but she showed no fear good day comrade ivanovna i am not nor never will be your comrade you know that such an attitude could get you shot she closed the book now shall we go should i bring a wrap or are you going to shoot me here i am not amused nor amusing she reached to her bed table for a square of colored paper and unwrapped it to reveal a piece of chocolate and then noticed the bolsheviks hungry stare despite the fact that she had saved this little bit for weeks she said how rude of me would you care for a bite snapping the chocolate in half she held it out to him he accepted it i havent seen chocolate since i believe since before the revolution is the phrase youre searching for alexandra said pleasantly yes st petersburg was a city of large and small pleasures then its petrograd now as you wish she said she watched him savor the chocolate and then he said you will be required to move out what was she to do she asked nicholai as she told him the story her family had all been killed in the war or executed by the reds more than death she was terrified by the thought of being out in the street without her attachments her belongings her things there were few places to live in petrograd fewer still where a notorious white would find a welcome she had seen her peers on the streets carting human waste selling apples renting their bodies and where will i go she asked that is not my concern alone and helpless the only power she retained was the only power a woman had in those days she looked at him for several moments and then said it could be your concern that is whatever would make you think that the way you look at me she answered but am i wrong perhaps i am mistaken no you are not wrong releasing her hand from his grip she walked over to the huge bed she kept her apartments he joined her there many afternoons and most nights his position in the cheka protecting him at least for the time being against the social contamination of an affair with a member of the possessing classes one night he told her that he loved her she laughed certainly a good bolshevik such as yourself doesnt believe in romantic love perhaps i do perhaps you shouldnt she said romance is dead in this world my dear you should know you helped to kill it we have an arrangement voroshenin nothing more an arrangement indeed he thought she gave him herself he protected her from himself the symmetry was mindboggling the next afternoon he walked into her apartment his face white with concern alexandra you have to go now she looked startled i thought that the cheka knows about rizhsky prospect since the revolution she had carefully secretly bit by bit hidden the ivanov family fortune millions of rubles away in the safekeeping of an old accounting firm on rizhsky prospect for a fee the men there were slowly smuggling it out of the country little by little into banks in france and switzerland it was an act of incredible daring whites had been tortured to death for hoarding a watch a ring some loaves of bread and she conspired to hide millions and the discipline feigning poverty going hungry starving herself allowing herself only the odd little square of chocolate its only a matter of time before they come for you he said me too you have to go get out leave the country but my things my furniture a train east out of finland station tomorrow morning at seven voroshenin said ive arranged space for you and all your things a heavy bribe but apparently you have money no ive drawn up travel papers that will take you safely to vladivostok after that thousands of whites had taken this route to vladivostok then across the porous border into china where most had sought the relatively cosmopolitan refuge of shanghai it was not a pleasant choice but the only choice she had where is your money he asked ill need some of it for bribes the rest carry with you in cash ill go get it he shook his head too dangerous you would be arrested and then i could no longer protect you and you would tell them everything alexandra trust me on this you would tell them everything they want to know and more she told him where the money was but most of it is still there he asked she nodded they made plans cheka agents would storm her house that night confiscate and cart off all her furniture and belongings and take them to a waiting rail agent at the station where they would be loaded onto a special cheka car no one will have the nerve to inspect it voroshenin assured her she would be arrested before dawn and taken to the station for removal to some hellhole in siberia instead she would ride in relative comfort to vladivostok with the papers asserting her new identity and my money she asked i will deliver it to the train myself he said and what about you she asked arent you in danger i will be on the next train he said with my new papers in vladivostok we can decide what to do next about our arrangement but we have to act quickly he urged there is much to do and little time to do it and the cheka is on the hunt ivanovna gave him the address of the accountants in rizhsky and then started to gather her personal belongings jewelry china crystal treasured family heirlooms all the things she had protected against the mob for the past five long years voroshenin went to rizhsky prospect his chekan subordinates suitably bribed and cowed arrested her in the morning and took her to the train voroshenin of course never turned up she knew that she had been outsmarted and was lucky he had let her take her belongings into exile this was the story that the countess alexandra ivanovna told her son how yuri voroshenin had taken her honor and his inheritance voroshenin set down the file staring out the window he forced himself to focus on the current applications and not drift into the realm of memory the reports many of them copies of old and handwritten documents were unanimous in the opinion that the countess alexandra ivanovna had fled russia in but that much voroshenin already knew apparently she took the quite common eastern route through manchuria and into then wideopen china where she was reputed to have settled in shanghai although she had all her household possessions she was otherwise penniless but again voroshenin knew that and survived by using her wit beauty and seductive skills to charm a series of wealthy expatriates and adventurers voroshenin had no doubt about her seductive powers having experienced them himself the memory of her lush body satin skin and according to the reports ivanovna had seduced a german nobleman become pregnant by him and then refused the pro forma offer of marriage from the young keitel zum hel sometime around or she gave birth to a son whom unreconstructed aristocrat that she was she christened nicholai nicholai hel voroshenin noted was almost precisely the same age as michel guibert it was a coincidence but the men voroshenin knew who believed in coincidence were all dead men such as zum hel who had died at stalingrad ivanovna disappeared from intelligence reports until when the japanese occupied shanghai and her house was commandeered literally by the japanese general kishikawa the cited informants salaciously repeated gossip that the relationship became something a bit more than hostess and hosted and voroshenin felt an unexpected twinge of jealousy remembering afternoons in the countess might very well have made herself vulnerable to charges of collaboration had she survived the war but she died of natural causes but what of the son voroshenin wondered on the subject of nicholai hel the files had nothing more to offer the boy simply disappeared from the record which was not unusual voroshenin reassured himself in the chaos that was wartime asia hundreds of thousands of people simply disappeared now as voroshenin sat in his office at the russian legation he wished that he had ordered ivanovna to be executed or done it himself before the bitch could spawn but is it possible is it possible that this guibert is hel come for his vengeance just when i am on the verge of making my escape they toured all the major sights tiananmen square the temple of heaven the forbidden city the bell and drum towers and beihai park which youve already seen chen remarked he was relieved when nicholai suggested that they go to xidan market to sample the street vendors wares it was bitterly cold now in the gloaming dark of late afternoon and they paused by the open braziers and trashcan fires to warm their feet and hands as they wandered through the hutongs of xidan during one such hiatus nicholai finally learned that the drivers name was liang qishao and that he was a beijing native as he treated both men to fried dough cakes mugs of hot green tea scorched sausages roasted chestnuts and bowls of sweet porridge nicholai enjoyed the outing a colder and somewhat tamer version of his youthful forays into the seedier parts of shanghai and the common food was as delicious as anything served in the finer restaurants sated he said to chen now i would like to go to church to church a catholic church nicholai clarified i am french after all do any survive in beijing liang nodded dongjiaomin st michaels in the legation quarter could you take me there nicholai asked liang looked to his boss chen hesitated then nodded all right the church was lovely nicholai was not a devotee of religious architecture but st michaels had an undeniable charm its twin gothic spires rising above the otherwise low skyline a statue of the archangel michael stood above the two arched doorways chen had him dropped off on the east side of the building off the main street and neither he nor liang accompanied him through the iron gate into the courtyard nicholai enjoyed the rare moment of privacy before going inside the interior was relatively dark lit only by candlelight and the dim glow of a few lowwattage wall lamps behind sconces but the fading afternoon sun lit the stainedglass windows with a subtle grace and the atmosphere was quiet and peaceful as solange had tutored him nicholai dipped his fingers in the small well of holy water and touched his forehead and shoulders making the sign of the cross he walked down to the altar knelt in front of the votive candles and said a prayer then he retreated to the pews and waited for someone to come out of the confessional booth she was a chinese woman her head covered in a black scarf and she looked at nicholai and hurried out frightened he waited for a moment remembering the words solange taught him and then went in and knelt in the confessional and said in french forgive me father for i have sinned he could barely make out the priests face through the screen in the darkened booth but it looked asian what is your name son michel how long has it been since your last confession nicholai recalled the number called for fortyeight days go on nicholai confessed a precise list of sins in precise order lust gluttony dishonesty and lust again haverfords small joke when he had finished there was a short silence and the priests face was replaced with a piece of paper can you see the priest asked he turned up the lamp a bit yes nicholai said studying the floor plan of the zhengyici opera house a certain box was circled in red he memorized the plan the doorways stairs the halls then said i have it the priests face came back into view your sins are forgiven you ten hail marys five apostles creeds and an act of contrition try to curb your lust god be with you son nicholai left the confessional returned to the altar knelt and said his prayers voroshenin sat and thought there was something about the name kishikawa a few minutes later he thought he recalled something and got on the phone half an hour later he was on the line to moscow in touch with an old colleague colonel now general gorbatov yuri how are you in beijing if that answers the question ah to what do i owe does the name kishikawa mean anything to you i was the soviet part of the joint allied prosecution of japanese war criminals outside of tokyo back in gorbatov answered kishikawa was my biggest fish why do you ask did you execute him we were going to gorbatov said didnt get the chance why not it was extraordinary actually gorbatov said quite the story there was this young man who worked as a translator for the americans and was somehow a friend to kishikawa actually he was the son of a russian aristocrat hold on its coming to me ivanovna a countess no less do you remember his name the young mans he was quite a memorable chap very selfpossessed his name piotr hel nicholai hel voroshenin actually felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise what happened to the general thats the extraordinary part gorbatov answered young hel killed him in his cell right in front of the guards some sort of japanese strike to the throat apparently he wanted to save him the shame of hanging voroshenin felt his own throat tighten is this hel in our custody no the americans took him we were happy to see him go believe me do we know what happened to him i dont gorbatov said glad to wash my hands of it very spooky the whole thing if you ask me on which subject why are you asking yuri a favor piotr voroshenin asked forget i called he hung up the phone nicholai pushed a chair against the wall to create some space in his room then he stripped down to his shorts and did twenty repetitions of the demanding hoda korosu caged leopard kata he selected this particular form because it stressed closein fighting precise strikes that demanded the buildup of force at short range starting with the entire room he performed the kata in increasingly smaller circles until by the end he barely moved his feet as he fought in the tightening bamboo cage of his imagination although the form included brutal elbow and knee strikes its principal feature was its unique leopard paw hand posture the fingers bent at the second knuckle but not closed to make a complete fist the striking surface was therefore thin just the second knuckles intended to penetrate a narrow space precision was key that and the concentration of force and nicholai practiced until he could generate explosive power in a strike that traveled just two inches before striking its target he thought he might have as much as six inches to two feet in the actual situation but didnt want to allow himself the mental leisure of that luxury physically exhausted but mentally invigorated when he finished nicholai sat on the floor pulled himself into a rigid meditation posture and envisioned the plan of the zhengyici opera house he had the floor plan perfectly in mind and now he worked from the box voroshenin had reserved out the hallway and down a set of stairs a left turn would take him into the main part of the theater then into the lobby and out the main doors but a right turn at the bottom of the stairs led to another short corridor and a door that would lead to the backstage area at that point he could turn right to go backstage or left into the alley behind the theater so there it was and he mentally walked through the escape route out of the box left down the hallway down the stairs right down the hallway left out of the building he walked it twenty times in his mind before adding the next mental level obstacles first would be voroshenins guards but if he performed the strike properly they would not know anything was wrong for another crucial minute but he had to consider the possibility of having to fight his way out there was no way to know how the guards would be positioned so that would have to be improvised on the spot but that was the purpose of kata to train the body to react instantly to any threat without the fatal necessity of thought so he dismissed the guards from his mind the hallway outside the boxes should pose no problems there might be chinese police but if the killing of voroshenin raised no outcry he should simply be able to walk past them on his way to the toilet but he mentally slowed his pace walking casually not as a man who has just killed but as one who simply needed to empty his bladder he walked down the stairs and took a right at the end of the hallway was a door to the backstage and there would almost certainly be an employee of the theater a doorman to bar the way of adoring fans killing the man would be easy but killing the innocent doorman would be a shameful dishonor out of the question so now nicholai mentally rehearsed a nonlethal blow to the side of the neck to the carotid artery to disable but not kill he threw the strike lowered the man to the floor and opened the door the next door was just to his left and he stepped out into the cold night air simple he thought then chuckled at his selfdelusion simple if you get within lethal proximity to voroshenin if you perform the perfect strike that renders him quietly dead while still sitting up in his seat if the guards notice nothing amiss if you dont have to kill three more men and then fight your way through the chinese police if all of it goes your way its simple and easy but those are a lot of ifs small wonder haverford had given him a one in a hundred chance of success and survival and if not he asked himself if not then that is your karma your joss as the chinese would have it and you will be killed are you prepared for that yes kishikawas words came back to him when one is prepared to die that is settled there is then only the action to consider think then only of success because failure will take care of itself nicholai sat for another hour and envisioned the entire operation step by step going perfectly he got up coaxed hot water from the taps and bathed then he dressed and went down into the lobby where chen was waiting to inflict more hospitality on him the acrobats were wonderful superb athletes they performed amazing feats of strength balance and courage it all brought back to nicholai happier childhood days in shanghai going to the street circuses and marveling at the performers the show tonight was held under a huge tent dangerously warmed with gas heaters the floor was pounded dirt and the audience even the important officials and foreign guests such as nicholai sat on rough wooden benches ate peanuts and tossed the shells on the ground but it all added to the ambiance the other difference was in terms of theme the acrobats of nicholais childhood had been colorfully dressed as kings generals courtesans monkeys dragons and tigers and performed their tricks to ancient folktales the performers tonight were clad in pla uniforms and arranged their tricks around heavyhanded political tableaus such as the pla liberates the people from the evil imperialists or the peasants successfully struggle against the landlord or the ever piquant ohsowhimsical dijuan factory produces a record annual output of ball bearings still the acrobatics were fantastic and entertaining even wedged into the relentless propaganda if the costumes lacked color the performers did not and nicholai found himself absorbed in admiration of their skill they tumbled did double somersaults swung from the tops of bamboo poles balanced on wires created impossibly high human towers amazing arent they voroshenin said in french as he stepped over the bench and squeezed between chen and nicholai sorry a somewhat sorrylooking man stood behind voroshenin and nicholai noticed that the russian didnt bother to offer him a seat he was clearly an underling of some sort but not judging by his spindly frame a bodyguard nicholai turned and introduced himself michel guibert vasili leotov dijuan factory is one of my alltime favorites voroshenin observed ignoring the introductions and nicholai couldnt tell if he discerned irony in his tone certainly he could discern the vodka on his breath its superb nicholai said the circus ring became a sea of red as some of the performers unfurled enormous flags then turned them flat as other acrobats used them to leap from one flag to a higher one to a higher one as if they were climbing the sky on the red clouds of dawn the audience gasped as the final performer reached the pinnacle steadying himself with one hand on a skinny bamboo pole he used the other to pull a final flag from inside his jacket and waved it as all the actors sang we rise ever higher on the wings of chairman mao soon voroshenin said there will be no art no grace or charm in this country only mao thought it will be a wasteland surely youre having a joke on me it will be dull as the proverbial dishwater voroshenin added he tilted his head toward leotov still standing over his shoulder dull as this one if thats possible nicholai felt embarrassed for leotov slid over on the bench as far as he could and asked wouldnt you care to sit down he wouldnt voroshenin interjected he is as you see him a post besides if you arent bored enough already you soon would be with him as a companion his conversation is as vapid as his face which strains credulity i understand i mean look at the fellow leotovs humiliation was palpable but he said nothing then voroshenin leaned in toward nicholai and whispered in russian your mother was my whore nicholai i rode her like a sled nicholai felt the insult burn but he didnt flinch im sorry im sorry voroshenin said i lapsed into russian there for a second one forgets sometimes what country one is in but had there been the slightest blink voroshenin asked himself the slightest glimmer of selfconsciousness in the eye nicholai wondered the same thing he fought to keep the fury off his face as he asked but what did you say peering back into those green eyes voroshenin switched to french just that im looking forward to the opera tomorrow night no more than i i hope you can still come why wouldnt i cymbals and gongs clashed as the voices rose to a climax the two men held their gaze he knows nicholai thought chen droned on in his enthusiasm about the acrobatic troupe voroshenin knows the car slowed to negotiate a patch of black ice he knows my real identity or does he certainly he suspects your mother was my whore nicholai i rode her like a sled did i react to the language the name the insult even for a second if even for a fraction of a second voroshenin would have picked it up assume the worst he told himself assume that voroshenin now thinks he knows that you are nicholai hel what does that mean it doesnt necessarily mean that he knows you are here to assassinate him it only means that he knows you are not who you claim to be bad enough but not necessarily fatal but why nicholai pondered is voroshenin keeping the appointment at the opera because he doesnt know he only suspects which is why he was probing why he stretched a line of stones deep into my defense a risky move because hes given so much of his thinking away but voroshenin is no fool he must have thought it worth the risk and was it face it you dont know hes a chess player not a go player nicholai thought cursing himself for not knowing more about the western game it was linear though he knew that and geometrical rich in forward machinelike thinking poor in subtlety and nuance voroshenin believes that he sacrificed a minor piece a pawn i believe to expose a more important piece of mine and now he invites my countermove im looking forward to the opera tomorrow night no more than i i hope you can still come why wouldnt i a lot of reasons nicholai thought including the very real possibility that my purpose here has been discovered compromised in haverfords jargon by rights he knew that he should use one of the dead drops to report this development to the american but he also knew that he wouldnt haverford might call the mission off abort and nicholai didnt want that he wanted to kill yuri voroshenin fine he thought envisioning the russians florid face as he delivered his adolescent insult you play your chess game i will play go we shall see who wins voroshenin was furious livid with himself clumsy hamhanded and stupid he thought as he pushed open the door of the russian legation how could i have thought he would fall for such an elementary trick but was there a glimmer just a trace he walked up the stairs to his office and immediately went for the vodka bottle its improbable he told himself improbable unlikely and so anachronistic the offended son coming to settle a score older than he is to redeem his mothers honor no one kills for honor anymore that died with the romanovs and assuming that guibert is hel he doesnt necessarily know who i am or that i had any relationship to his mother so if guibert is hel what the hell is he doing here in the guise of a french arms dealer his paranoia rising voroshenin pulled the shades on the window he sat down but soon found himself pacing back and forth in the room assume he is hel he told himself what of it why is he here to know that you must first answer the question of who hes working for well you know that he was last in the control of the americans did they simply turn him loose after a few years he killed a jap general whom they were going to hang anyway so easy come easy go highly unlikely in the first place the rigid americans dont possess that level of moral flexibility in the second place hel couldnt obtain a cover without professional help and backing the guibert cover if thats what it is is both sophisticated and deep someone went to a lot of trouble and expense to place guibert in beijing and no intelligence service of any government would do that so some young man with a grudge can pursue his romantic notion of revenge for what then voroshenin walked to the window edged the bottom corner of the curtain open and peeked out onto the street it was empty quiet a gentle snow falling he let the curtain fall back hel was in american control but he appears now as a french national is this a french operation doubtful the french were still supine from the war and more than had their hands full in vietnam they were not about to do anything that would bring china into that mess all right so hel was in american control appears as a french national albeit with a chinese background is this a nationalist operation is hel on loan from the americans to the nats and if so for what purpose it didnt make sense why would the nats use a westerner when they had thousands of disaffected chinese available so that leaves the americans voroshenin concluded dont dismiss the obvious just because its obvious hel was in american control and still is quite a useful tool really familiar with china speaks the language has russian and french as well born to be a spy when you think about it youd have recruited him yourself and its a pity that gorbatov didnt when he had the chance so assume hel is working for washington whats his task his cover as an arms dealer puts him in touch with the ministry of defense and he was hosted at dinner by liu general liu maos chief and only rival could the americans be using hel to make overtures to liu or has he already accepted them his smile genuine for the first time that night at last voroshenin saw the entire board his next move and its potential result im sorry alexandra he thought your son will have to die under exquisite torture but that is the cost of allowing oneself to become a pawn in someone elses game he looked at his watch it was only midnight kang sheng would still be up nicholai slipped out of the hotel he simply took the elevator down to the basement had a pleasant chat and shared a few cigarettes with the men in the kitchen and then went out the delivery entrance at the back of the hotel then he walked briskly into the legation quarter the streets were almost empty now this late at night with most of the beijingren securely tucked away inside their living units lights were on of course in the russian legation and nicholai stood across the street under an elm tree and watched the front door a car pulled up and waited its tailpipe smoking in the cold voroshenin trailed by his faithful hounds came out a few minutes later and got into the car which quickly pulled out a nice piece of luck nicholai thought for the move he contemplated was a terrible risk but otakesan had taught him that very often not taking a risk was more dangerous than taking one cupping his hands against the bitter wind he lit a cigarette moved to a spot under the glow of a streetlight and waited it took twenty long minutes for vasili leotov to work up enough nerve to come out chin tucked into his collar hands jammed into his coat pockets his head on a swivel looking nervously about he crossed the street nicholai walked slowly away out of range of the listening devices that doubtless studded the soviet building he could hear leotovs footsteps crunch on the snow following him he shortened his step and slowed his gait allowing the smaller man to catch up with him if i have guessed right nicholai thought i might become a wealthy man if i have guessed wrong i will certainly be a dead one kang sat back and savored his dragon well tea the finest in china supplied only to mao and himself as he regarded the tang dynasty painting on the wall the overall effect was sublime so kang was more than annoyed by the interruption what was that maotzi voroshenin doing here after midnight kang sighed and gave permission to allow him in then he put a smile on his face and walked out to greet his unwanted and uninvited guest an unexpected pleasure kang said voroshenin caught the tone its urgent apparently kang said please come in kang walked him into the large sitting room which was filled not only with paintings but also with bronzes rare ceramics and ancient seals all liberated from the former possessing classes his collection of fine art was worth many thousands of yuan his assemblage of erotica only slightly less valuable in terms of money far more precious in the influence it purchased with mao a fellow enthusiast had voroshenin the poor lonely fellow come on some pretext to see if there was new pornography the russian looked at the tang painting a classically formed depiction of a southern mountain new he asked do you like it its good the maotzi wouldnt know good from garbage kang thought that being the case he didnt offer him tea which anyway wouldnt be appreciated but some rice wine instead the russian was an incipient drunkard it would sooner or later kill him and kang hoped it was sooner the drink having been offered and accepted the russian said rudely quite an art collection you have here kang didnt like the smirk on his face i do what i can to preserve our cultural treasures he said at least the ones not already stolen by europeans they both knew that the best collections of chinese art were to be found in the hermitage and the louvre one day kang thought we shall get them all back you said something about an urgent matter what if voroshenin said liu could be linked to the americans what if shit were gold kang responded what if voroshenin countered guibert were made to say that this arms shipment to the viet minh was a sham to cover up something else such as what if he were to confess voroshenin asked carefully selecting his words that the weapons were not for the viet minh but were to be diverted to counterrevolutionaries in yunnan instead then i am very much afraid kang said that would implicate general liu in an imperialist plot to overthrow the peoples republic the chairman would be shocked and heartbroken of course it was a delightful thought kang had been searching for years for a pretext to arrest liu one that the army and public would accept and this dissolute russian might just have handed it to him but why would guibert confess to something like that kang asked his eyes alight with wry amusement actually he could think of a dozen reasons toads drinking monkeys holding a rope angel plucking a zither or perhaps some new technique that had yet to be discovered or named and how are the americans involved in this guibert voroshenin answered is actually an american agent named nicholai hel he told kang what he knew of the guiberts and of nicholai hel omitting of course his own past with alexandra ivanovna do we know this for a fact kang asked no voroshenin admitted but im reasonably sure reasonably sure is not good enough kang said i cant arrest a foreign national on reasonably sure torture him and then find out that he really is this michel guibert even the french might object to that it is tempting though kang thought so tempting the thought of parading an american spy down to the bridge of heaven and having him shot the titillating image of that bastard liu following him a few days later it would solve so many problems but this guiberthel connection it was tenuous at best what would you need voroshenin asked kang leaned back and thought about it for a few moments perhaps if the father were to tell us this is not his son nicholai rose before dawn performed ten caged leopards and then got dressed to go out for his morning run the very real prospect that this might be his last morning sharpened the air brightened the colors and lifted the mundane sounds of the citys waking to the level of a symphony the rumbling of a truck engine the jingling of a bicycle bell the clatter of a trash can being dragged across the pavement all had a clear crystalline beauty that nicholai appreciated for the first time the trees then took on a startling fresh beauty artful compositions of silver white and black delicately and perfectly balanced changing tones with the gathering light the ice on the lake reflected their images back to themselves as a friend reveals to a friend his best qualities the morning was truly beautiful the tai chi players truly beautiful china itself was truly beautiful and nicholai realized with some sorrow that he would miss it all if he should as was probable die tonight but that is tonight he thought and this is this morning and i am going to enjoy every moment of it as he ran onto the arched bridge to the jade isle another jogger fell in behind him this was new and nicholai was aware of the interlopers footfall behind him he flexed his hands preparing them for the leopard paw if necessary the runner was catching up with him and smiley and the greyhound were a good twenty yards behind the dream of the west chamber he heard the runner puff what about it be quiet and listen in short bursts the runner gave him the bones of the story then said near the end the sheng and the dan find each other again the runner sang i have helped the lovers come together although i have suffered hard words and beatings the moon is rising in its silvery glow i am the happy red maid there will be much noise gongs drums cymbals then a moment of darkness yes that is your moment the runner picked up his pace and sprinted past nicholai onto the island then disappeared around a curve nicholai held his own pace and then saw an odd sight a lone monk walked toward him on the bridge he had a strange gait as if walking were painful or he had some old injury that still troubled him he came in small delicate steps as an old man would who feared that the bridge was slippery with ice but as he came closer nicholai saw that he wasnt really old his eyes were old though they stared straight at nicholais as if searching for something and nicholai recognized that those eyes had seen much too much things that no eyes should be made to see eyes that held knowledge that no man should be forced to know nicholai stopped in his tracks the monk said softly satori what satori to see things as they really are the monk turned around and limped back toward the jade isle nicholai hesitated and then followed him what am i not seeing the trap the monk answered and the way out of it the vegetables were delicious the steamed bun delicious even the ordinary tea outdid itself i should die more often nicholai thought if this is what the possibility of imminent death does for the senses he could only imagine how making love to solange today might feel one might die from just the heightened pleasure a silly thought he chided himself you wont die from pleasure youll die in the trap unless you find the way out but like all traps in go or life itself the way out is never back the way you came once in you can only get out of the trap by going through the trap chen arrived to take him to the ministry of defense that acrobatic troupe was good last night eh chen asked sitting down at the table sharing breakfast with guibert had become a habitual perquisite superb thank you for taking me too bad that russian had to show up chen looked around leaned across the table and muttered tell you something please i hate those maotzi bastards im not overly fond myself chen smiled with satisfaction at the shared intimacy good buns quite good im sorry youll be leaving soon chen said looking down at his plate am i leaving soon tomorrow ah we should be going the day was now bright and sunny a warming front had come in jackets were left unbuttoned scarves hung loosely around necks people tilted their faces to catch the warmth of the sun nicholai insisted they take a detour into xidan to buy some roasted chestnuts youre cheerful today chen observed as they munched on the treats i love china they got back into the car and drove to the ministry of defense the payment went through colonel yu said of course yu handed nicholai a sheaf of travel papers your train to chongqing leaves tomorrow morning at nine please be on time rail tickets are difficult to acquire what do i do when i get to chongqing you will be contacted nicholai looked skeptical in truth he couldnt care less but the role had to be played out to the end you told me you would give me an exact location im afraid that is not possible at the moment yu said dont worry we wouldnt cheat you its a long train trip to chongqing nicholai answered i dont want to run into some accident or find myself wandering about the city and not hearing from you i give you my word i gave you my money yu smiled again it always comes back to money i didnt hear that you declined the payment what will you do on your last night in beijing yu asked im going to the opera an imperial relic if you say so nicholai stood up if i get to chongqing and do not hear from you within twentyfour hours i will go to the viet minh and explain that they were cheated by the revolutionary comrades in beijing comrade guibert you are an arms merchant i am so you will sell these weapons to our vietnamese comrades yes for a profit thats the idea yes yu frowned torn between candor and courtesy he finally said i do not understand how a man can live without ideals its easy when you get used to it nicholai answered and it does not bother you the young colonel said that these weapons might be used to kill your own countrymen i have no country nicholai said realizing that this was a rare statement of truth the people are my country yu said with practiced conviction nicholai looked at his fresh face aglow with idealism with any luck he thought hell have time to grow out of that he walked out of the office and the building emile guibert left his mistresss flat in hong kongs western district in a nice part of town the flat was expensivemerde la femme was expensive but both well worth it a man comes to a certain age and success he deserves a little comfort not a tawdry assignation in some blue hotel over in kowloon he decided to walk to his club for his afternoon pastis it was a pleasant day not overly humid and he thought that he could use the exercise although winifred had given him quite the workout a lovely girl a chinese pearl winifred delightful in every aspect always beautifully dressed beautifully coiffed always patient and eager to please and not some foulmouthed salope either but a young lady of refinement and some education you could have a conversation with her before or after you could take her to a gallery to a party and know that she wouldnt embarrass herself or you winifred was the new love of his life in fact a new lease on life itself the very renewal of his youth lost in this reverie he didnt notice the three men come in one stepped around him toward the elevator the other went to check his mail at the boxes along the opposite wall the third barred the doorway excuse me guibert said he felt a forearm come around his throat and a cloth held against his face haverford sat in the situation room in the tokyo station and finished his coded cable to singleton in langley all in place hrs advise proceed or abort part of him still hoped that singleton would call the whole thing off it was so risky from so many angles fail or succeed hel could be captured if captured he might talk if he talked kang would quickly wrap up the whole beijing network from the white pagoda to st michaels to the muslims in xuanwu liu could be terminally weakened and china forced even deeper into the soviet orbit great rewards demand great risks singleton had said fine haverford thought in fact everything was in place the extraction team was embedded in the mosque its leader had successfully been infiltrated into the country a string of sleeper alerts about a chinese attempt on voroshenins life had been successfully planted into the soviet intelligence services through double agents and would be triggered after his assassination a similar string indicating that the killing was a disinformation plot by the soviets and laying the blame on an apparatchik named leotov had been laid with the chinese as for the assassination itself hel had done a brilliant job of luring voroshenin onto the killing ground hel was fully briefed on the site the opportune moment of the opera and his escape route haverford looked at his watch a graduation gift from his old man five hours and fifty minutes until the opera commenced an hour or so after that the termination the train was in motion nothing could stop it now unless hel backed out which he wouldnt or singleton called it off which was unlikely still haverford hoped he would and sat waiting for the abort cable voroshenin sat by the phone the damn thing was quiescent and the clock not his friend barely three hours now until his appointment with hel the more he thought about it the more convinced he was that guibert was hel and the more concerned he became that whatever hels assignment with the americans he had really come on a mission of vengeance if this were russia or one of the eastern european satellites he would simply have the young man killed or if it were a city in western europe he could arrange for his quiet disappearance even in china just a few years ago a few coins and a whisper in the right ear and the young hel would be fish food by now but not in china these days even with the soviets enormous influence beijing wouldnt easily tolerate an unsanctioned killing on its territory there would be an incident and an incident could very well send him back to a cell in lubyanka better there than dead though he thought fingering the pistol he had slipped into his belt that morning before leaving his quarters if it is hel and if he does intend to kill me for some fancied transgression against his slut of a mother i do not have to play the sacrificial lamb they say he killed that jappo general with a single strike to the throat well let him try i have three bodyguards all trained in judo all armed and if somehow he gets through them voroshenin touched the gun butt again and felt reassured but why is my hand shaking he took another sip of vodka when this is over i shall have to do something about the drinking he thought perhaps go off to one of those spas in the mountains clean air exercise and all that hopefully it wont come to my shooting hel he thought hopefully they will have picked up the elder guibert sweated him and made him admit that his real son died in that car crash then i will not have to worry about it at all i can enjoy the opera knowing that young hel will be singing a different kind of aria to a tune of kangs composition but ring damn phone the old man was tougher than he looked i have met the sûreté he told them the gestapo lunion corse the green gang what do you bande denfoirés have to show me that i havent already seen they threatened to kill him he shrugged im old i take one decent shit every three or four days get one good hardon a week if im lucky i sleep three hours a night be my friends kill me they threatened to hurt him what can i tell you that i havent told you guibert answered you show me pictures ive told you yes that is my worthless son the one who thinks that money squirts out of chickens asses and that you should always hit on sixteen hurt me he was a tough old bird and one that didnt sing is michel in beijing he parroted after they had wrenched his thin shoulders almost out of their sockets what can i say except that hes supposed to be does that mean he really is you tell me whats he doing there supposed to be buying guns guibert said but if i know my boy hes chasing pussy is there still pussy in beijing if youre looking for him look there if you dont find him look for a pair of loaded dice hell be betting against them your real son died in a car accident they told him this man is an imposter i dont know my own son why do you bother to ask questions of a man who doesnt know his own child how stupid must you be then the old man got aggressive this is hong kong there are laws here not like the shitholes you must come from i know every cop and every gangster the tongs call me sir you let me go right now ill forget about this call it a mistake you dont ill be tickling your feet while youre hanging from meathooks now untie me i have to take a piss they untied him and walked him into the toilet the phone rang voroshenin had the receiver in his hand before the ringing stopped yes hes tough so we think hes telling the truth voroshenin didnt he looked up at the wall clock three hours and fifteen minutes have one more go i dont know what to ill tell you what to do voroshenin said when guibert came out of the toilet winifred was on her knees in front of the chair her eyes wide with terror her mouth wrapped around the pistol barrel that his interrogator held in his hand his finger on the trigger the interrogator looked at guibert and said three two nicholai eased into the steaming bath karmas gift to him he thought as he lowered himself into the nearscalding water took a deep breath and then exhaled relaxing away the slight pain then he lay back and let the hot water soothe his muscles and his mind as a boy he would spontaneously slip into a state of total mental relaxation his mind taking him to lie down in a serene mountain meadow but the vicissitudes and sorrows of the war had stolen that tranquility from him and he mourned that loss deeply as he also regretted the loss of his freedom and control over his own life the best that he could do now was to control his breathing and clarify his thoughts that this was in all likelihood his last night in the trap of life saddened him only because of solange recalling the buddhist tenet that all suffering comes from attachment he acknowledged that he was in love with her in a very western romantic way and that the thought of leaving her was painful the thought that diamond and his minions would escape justice also saddened him but he comforted himself with the idea that karma was perfect so if i live he thought i will avenge myself if i die let them be reborn as maggots on a dung heap he turned his mind to his mission envisioning it step by step he walked himself through the evening chen would pick him up at the hotel and drop him at the theater he would go to voroshenins box sit down and enjoy the opera at precisely the right moment as the drums pounded and the gongs clanged he would strike his mothers tormentor with a single explosive blow to the heart then he would simply walk out of the theater elude his watchers and make his way to refuge at the mosque suddenly something about it troubled him he reenvisioned it and the same troubling feeling lingered but he could not discover its source switching paradigms he envisioned the scenario as the go board set his black stones down and played the game it had its expected challenges but nothing more if nicholai thought voroshenin knows my real identity and recalls his treatment of the countess alexandra ivanovna then i might well be moving into a trap but i already know that and am prepared there is something else he switched mental models again and decided to play the white stones against his own black it was a revelation oddly he found that he counted among the white stones not only the russians and the red chinese but the americans as well his mind lined them up as white stones and examining the board as he would if he were playing that side he saw it satori ninety minutes from operational status unable to contain his nervous energy haverford paced the situation room in thirty minutes they would go dark all substantive cable and telephonic traffic would cease some flak would be thrown up runofthemill crap to let the soviets and chinese think that it was just business as usual but there would be no communication between langley and the situation room singleton would go off to some affair at the white house diamond was going hunting with his buddies if this went south it would all be on the tokyo station do a final status check we just did did i ask you what you just did they ran another check alpha tiger in place bravo team in place the monk in place go player in place papa bear papa bear papa bears off the radar what papa bear the nervous young agent said hes off the radar run it down frantic phone calls to hong kong turned up nothing emile guibert wasnt at his house on victoria peak not at his office downtown his club in western not at his mistresss pad off the radar they were thin on the ground in hk because of british hypersensitivity in fact haverford briefly considered reaching out to wooten for help the mi man had the hong kong police on his payroll and could scour the island quicker than the small american contingent but he decided that he couldnt answer the questions that wooten would ask and that the payback would be too ferocious so he had to leave it to bentons people the search took twentyeight endless minutes haverford jumped on the cable pbear off grid abort advise john singleton took his wool overcoat off the coat rack and put it on his left shoulder suffered from bursitis so it took a few seconds he wrapped his scarf tightly around his neck put on his hat and headed out the door of his office for most people going to the white house was a thrill for singleton it was a chore he was halfway down the hall when his assistant scurried up behind him yes an urgent cable from tokyo he glanced at it and said not now you dont want to res i cant very well respond to something that you didnt give to me can i he said i had already left the building ill look at it when i come back the elevator doors slid open were dark the young agent said that is not good haverford thought singleton had hung him out to dry the old spymaster would take credit for the success but dump blame for the failure on haverford its your call just find emile guibert haverford snapped and spare me your observations of the obvious sorry fiftynine minutes out once operational haverford had the authority to abort the mission at his discretion he could flip the kill switch which would trigger an alert that hel knew to look for in that case hel would simply walk out of his hotel a preplanned diversion would occupy his surveillance and he would go straight to the niujie mosque keep trying on papa bear yes sir assume the worstcase scenario haverford told himself assume that voroshenin has guibert and is sweating him assume that guibert has given it up given that scenario voroshenin knows that guibert is a cover but guibert couldnt have given him hels real identity all voroshenin knows is that michel guibert is a cover under british control which is what guibert believes voroshenin will take the next logical mental step though hell believe that the british were subbing in for us hell know its an american operation so what does he do he gives it to the chinese to his buddy kang what does kang do either he lets hel stay operational to see where it leads him or he picks hel up and tortures the truth out of him everything they knew about kang indicated the latter course of action you confirmed that go player is in place haverford asked he signaled their watchers outside the hotel had seen hel go in but not come out and they observed the correct arrangement of the window curtains only ten minutes ago hel had called room service to request a fresh thermos of water for his tea so there was every reason to believe that he was safely in his room and not in kangs hands but for how long haverford wondered abort he told himself get a signal to the monk hit the kill switch now nicholai stepped out on the little balcony across the boulevard lit by the amber streetlamp the monk still stood under the tree facing south the mission was a go nicholai started to pull a cigarette out to light it and acknowledge then the monk moved we have papa bear kill the abort signal haverford said where the hell was he it turns out that papa guibert found himself a new honey and took her to her place he was surprised and a little indignant to find out that handlers were looking for him so i wanted a little variety he told the brit who was under haverfords employ so what i am french he didnt really expect a brit to comprehend a mans sexual needs the british were about as sensual as their food keep him on ice haverford ordered did you signal the monk back confirmed haverford sat down and looked at the illuminated wall clock twelve minutes out voroshenin was on the phone the old man had broken no frenchman of his generation would let a beautiful woman have her brains spattered all over the walls and confirmed that his son had died in the car crash and michel guibert was the cover of an agent working for the british the british my liver voroshenin thought the british are assclenching happy just to hold on to hong kong theyre not going to wake the dragon by messing about in china besides it wasnt london that had control of nicholai hel it was washington kang finally came on the line wei he asked blandly as if nothing out of the ordinary was going on the father confirmed my hypothesis voroshenin said there was a long pause then kang said enjoy the opera i will actually voroshenin thought nicholai saw the monk start to turn to the north then change his mind and face south again the mission had been aborted then just as quickly revived that didnt trouble nicholai the gokang was a kinetic field that required fluid thought and action but then the monk did something unexpected he turned to face the hotel and looked directly up at nicholai even from that distance five floors down and across the street nicholai could feel the monks eyes almost as he had once sensed the intensity of kishikawasama and otakesan nicholai nodded cupping one hand around his cigarette he lit it the signal that he was ready to proceed he took a long drag then stepped back into the room and shut the doors behind him then he left the room and went downstairs go player acknowledged roger that now all haverford could do was sit and wait worst part of the job diamond made a point not to be in or even near the office but he left word where he could be reached and an order that he be immediately briefed on any developments coming out of beijing waiting around is the shits he thought the north wind had picked up again and nicholai wrapped his scarf around his neck as he stepped out into the cold night air and waited for chen and the car where were they chen was usually pathologically prompt across the boulevard the monk walked away toward the south the last check nicholai thought with a twinge of sorrow the last chance to stop this thing literally just walked away the car came up the street its red flags snapping in the stiff breeze it pulled up in front of the hotel the back door opened and chen got out sorry to be late he said traffic he looked afraid chen ushered nicholai into the backseat and got in beside him nicholai started to greet liang but saw that it was a different driver where is liang nicholai asked sick chen said the smell of fear came off him a sheen of greasy sweat shone on his cheeks nicholai took two cigarettes from his pack and offered one to chen the escort took it but his hands shook as nicholai held the lighter up to the cigarette he steadied chens wrist and said perhaps it was catching maybe you should go home and take care of yourself nicholai looked into his eyes its all right im so sorry chen answered that i was late truly it doesnt matter he let go of chens wrist nicholai sat back in his seat smoked looked out the window and pretended not to notice when the car turned not for xuanwu but toward the bell and drum towers kang readied the stage he wanted it perfect a flawless setting for the drama that he was about to enact the play that he had already written this nicholai hel person would speak his intended lines maybe not at first when his masculine pride would force him to resist but eventually he would give in and pronounce the words he would come in as a man but leave as a eunuch enter the stage as a sheng but exit as a dan shamed and pleading to die but the dignity of a private death was not on the page for this hel kang would save what was left of him for another performance his humiliation played before an audience of thousands at the bridge of heaven hel would have a placard on his back instead of an embroidered robe he would be bound with heavy ropes and he would take a final bow to the bark of rifles and the roar of the crowd kang fingered the exquisitely thin stiff wire sharpened at one end looped at the other with which he intended to skewer hels masculinity drawing the jinghu bow across the strings is what kang had titled this new technique and he could already imagine the notes that hel would achieve as the wire was pushed and pulled back and forth through his testicles kang had dressed for the occasion a black jacket with black brocade over black silk pajamas and black slippers he had slicked his hair back carefully trimmed his eyebrows and applied the most subtle indistinguishable layer of rouge on his cheeks he looked forward to matching the rhythms of the mental torture along with the physical show hel the agony that was inevitable then offer to rescind the sentence and then apply it anyway draw the strings back and forth between despair and hope terror and relief anguish and cessation building to a climax in which there was only pain as in any worthy opera the music would be punctuated by passages of speech as hel recited his monologues yes he was an american agent yes he had been sent to pull the strings of the puppet the traitor liu yes they conspired to deliver guns to antirevolutionary elements in yunnan yes they hoped to murder chairman mao he heard car doors close and then footsteps on the pebbled walkway the opera was about to begin the lights in the house dimmed as the stage lamps came up voroshenin comfortable in his private box leaned forward and looked down at the black square stage traditionally placed to the north of the audience he loved this old theater with its red gilded columns framing the stage its old wooden floor the vendors milling around selling peanuts and steamy hot towels the chatter the laughter the chair beside him was empty hel had not arrived voroshenin knew that the foolish young man was attending an opera of his own one in which he would unwillingly sing the lead role after a moment of anticipatory silence the orchestra struck its first notes and the audience hushed as xun huisheng stepped onto the stage dressed as a huadan a saucy young woman xun wore a long scarlet mingera robe with flowers brocaded on the shoulders and wide water sleeves he stood center stage and gave his shangching the opening speech identifying himself as the red maid then waving his hand with a grace born from decades of practice he produced a scroll from the sleeve paused and began the famous first aria this letter is the evidence of the affair commanded by my lady i am on my way to the west chamber in the early morning silence reigns supreme let me the red maid have a little cough to warn him voroshenin was delighted go player is off the radar haverford felt his blood go cold and his stomach flip what he didnt arrive at point zero didnt or hasnt haverford asked the young agent shrugged a few seconds later he asked do you want to give the scramble code a scramble code would do just that send the extraction team in the niujie mosque scrambling for cover before they could be rounded up send the monk the hui agents all of them running for the border he considered the possibilities the mundane hel was simply delayed tied up in traffic the treacherous hel had chickened out and was running on his own the catastrophichel was in kang shengs hands the last scenario would definitely trigger a scramble code no haverford said lets give it a while longer where are you nicholai three police agents hauled nicholai from the car pushed him over the hood and handcuffed him behind his back he didnt resist this wasnt the moment they straightened him back up and an agent held him by either elbow spy chen yelled at him his eyes begging forgiveness flicks of spit hit nicholai in the face as chen screamed now you will feel the peoples righteous fury now you will know the anger of the workers and peasants chen turned to get back into the car but the driver was out of the car pulled a pistol and held it at chens head li ar chen i arrest you for treason against the peoples republic the third policeman grabbed his arms twisted them behind him and cuffed him no chen yelled not me him not me i did everything you said the driver holstered his pistol slapped him hard across the face then ordered take him the policeman pushed chen in front of nicholai without a word they frogmarched him through a stone garden to what looked improbably like a cave one of the cops knocked on the thick wooden door and a moment later nicholai heard a muffled come the door opened and the agents pushed nicholai inside it was indeed a cave or at least an effort to replicate one in concrete communists nicholai thought they do love their concrete the ceilings were curved and the walls painted with streaks to imitate geological striations this cave was beautifully furnished with rosewood tables and chairs a lounging sofa and the machinery of torture there was a bench of sorts obviously used for beatings and perhaps sodomy a staggering variety of whips and flails hung neatly from assigned hooks and two straightbacked chairs the seats of which had been removed bolted to the floor the cops shoved nicholai down onto one of the chairs removed the cuffs and used heavy leather straps to tightly fasten his wrists to the arms of the chair nicholai watched as they took chen roughly stripped off his clothes and then hung him by the handcuffs from a steel rail that ran across the ceiling then they tied his ankles down to bolts in the floor so that he was spreadeagled his chin on his chest chen hung quietly weeping an interior door opened and kang sheng made his entrance nicholai had to admit that it was dramatic the lighting perfect the moment correct and he held an ominous prop that glistened in the lamplight a wire perhaps a foot long needlesharp on one end good evening mr hel i believe it is guibert if you insist kang smiled nicholai fought the terror that he felt rising in his throat and forced himself to keep his mind clear kang has already made the first mistake he thought he has shown his opening position on the board by revealing his knowledge of my real identity perhaps kang said when i have shown you what i have planned for you you might decide to be more cooperative theres always that chance nicholai answered there is always that chance kang agreed pleasantly hels bravado was delightful so very sheng and how thoughtful of him to play his role so beautifully the fall of a falcon is so much more dramatic than the fall of a sparrow he turned his attention to chen who would play the perfect chou the clown counterrevolutionary dog no chen blubbered im a loyal liar kang screamed you were part of this conspiracy you helped him every step of the way no yes kang yelled you took him to the church didnt you yes but nicholai said he had nothing to do with be quiet kang snapped it will be your turn soon enough i promise you that just now it is the fat pigs how many yuan do you eat a day pang ju is that why you like entertaining foreign guests so that you can fatten yourself on the backs of the people no no it is because you are a spy no no kang said i will give you one chance to confess this was the boring part of the play the shangching the preamble prisoners never confessed at this point knowing that they would be signing their own death warrants they knew the pain they were about to suffer knew that they would eventually confess to the capital charge but human nature is such that they must first struggle to survive chen was silent very well kang said nicholai saw chens eyes almost bulge out of their sockets as kang approached him with the needle kang giggled i have never done this before so it might take a little experimentation chen jerked as kang touched the point of the wire to one of his balls the problem is the flexibility kang said he pulled the wire back a couple of inches and then pushed xun huisheng hit a marvelous note rich in tone pitchperfect rising in an oblique ze look my poor mistress frowns every day and the young man is sick and skinny despite the punishments imposed by the old lady i the little red maid will help their dreams come true voroshenin clapped as the audience below shouted hao hao in approbation of the superb performance colonel yu sat in his office and worried the socalled michel guibert had not arrived at the opera nor was he in his room and none of the watchers knew his location all they could say was that they had seen him get into the car outside the beijing hotel was he in voroshenins hands or in kangs either way it was a desperate situation who knew what kang would make him say if mao was ready to make a move against general liu this could be the prime moment guibert would confess to the murder plot against the russian commissioner and kang would make him implicate general liu escape routes had been set up through the south was it time for the general to flee activate southern wind perhaps yu cursed himself it had been too bold a move premature perhaps for them to have allowed the american plot to move forward perhaps they should have tossed guibert out of the country five seconds after he stepped in but it had been so tempting to set stalin and mao back at each others throats the russians would move gao gang into place prematurely mao would respond but lack the strength to succeed general liu would move in to fill the power vacuum so tempting so rich with possibilities and the idea to kill voroshenin at the opera was lovely in its irony very unwestern but then again this guibert should i go and tell the general yu asked himself actualize the escape plan and demand that he leave immediately years of long work would be wasted hopes squandered dreams of a truly communist country indefinitely delayed perhaps destroyed but can you take the chance of the general being arrested tortured shot where is this man guibert nicholai struggled not to vomit chen screamed and screamed his body tossed against the chains as kang sawed the wire back and forth through his testicles all the time offering advice on how to better vocalize hum qi he coached using operatic terms exchange breath slow in slow out now steal breath a sharp intake please sudden fierce thats it very good nicholai made himself focus on his own breathing in deep through the nose force it down into the lower abdomen hold and store release deep through the nose force it down into the lower abdomen hold and store release hold and store hold and store deeply in the abdomen until you can feel it in all your muscles he tuned out the sound of chens agony i confess i confess i confess chen screamed but kang appeared not to hear him and continued drawing the jinghu bow across the strings until chen shrieked at a pitch that was scarcely human he would not stop until chen demonstrated all the mouth shapes of a proper opera singer kaikou open mouth qichi levelteeth houkou closed mouth and finally cuochun scooped lips kang pulled the wire out and chens neck dropped his body went limp sweat dripped off his skin onto the concrete floor i am a spy chen said between sobs i was part of the conspiracy i helped him every step of the way to send arms to rebels in yunnan yes to murder chairman mao yes who gave you your orders kang asked was it general liu yes it was general liu nicholai knew that chen would say anything now agree to anything to prevent kang from resuming the torture and kang had revealed more of his strategy remain calm kishikawasama came to him and keep your thoughts as clear as a pool breathe and store your ki liu is the target he realized and you are only a string of stones on the way to that target very well kang turned to him and said now mr hel it is your turn he held up the wire it really isnt necessary nicholai said ill tell you anything you want to know kang smiled admit that you are not michel guibert i admit that i am not michel guibert admit that you are nicholai hel i admit to being nicholai hel why did you come to beijing nicholai hel nicholai leaned forward in his chair as far as the straps would allow he looked straight into kangs eyes and answered i came to beijing to kill yuri voroshenin kang turned pale get that pig out of here kang ordered wait outside position on the board changed nicholai thought not wanting underlings to hear anything that sensitive kang has removed those stones for me breathe and store your ki breathe and store your ki the agents unhooked chen and dragged him out of the room when the door closed kang asked you admit that you came to assassinate voroshenin admit it nicholai said i proclaim it why nicholai jutted his chin toward the wire in kangs hand i wish to spare myself needless pain and i wish to make a deal you are in no position to make any deal how do you know kang waved the wire in front of his face i will make you tell me without any deal probably nicholai agreed but possibly not you know that i was raised as a japanese what is your experience with japanese under torture and what if you make a mistake what if you miscalculate and i die under your ministrations then you will never know this is delightful kang thought exciting a different script a departure from the usual he asked know what how you can get power over voroshenin he saw it in kangs eye it was fleeting but it was there power over voroshenin was a very desirable prize kang was desperate to get out from under the soviet thumb stone moved breathe and store your ki breathe and store your ki kang laughed but the scoff was unconvincing and you can tell me how to get voroshenin under my power nicholai nodded how put down that wire kang set the wire down how blackmail specifically nicholai shook his head if i tell you how do i know i walk out of here alive how do i know i leave china alive youll have my word you think me a fool kang nodded toward the wire if you make me perform drawing the jinghu bow across the strings i promise that you will tell me as you said spare yourself that agony as for your life breathe and store your ki breathe and store your ki do not waste effort negotiating over lies lull him now lure him into overconfidence draw his stones into the trap yuri voroshenin nicholai said extorted my mother into handing over a considerable fortune which he placed into various bank accounts and investments it was quite some time ago but interest accrues and yuri is now an extremely wealthy man i am sure that he wouldnt want beria to hear of it much less uncle joe do you have a tape recorder of course get it nicholai said i will relate the whole story and voroshenin will be yours breathe and store your ki breathe and store your ki kang got the tape recorder and nicholai passed on to him the whole story that his mother had told him about what happened in petrograd thirty years ago how long has it been haverford asked thirtyone minutes the traffic scenario was out either hel had taken off or he was under adverse control give the scramble order he thought sauve qui peut every man for himself but if you pull the extraction team and hel is alive colonel yu got up from his chair left his office and walked down the hallway the general was at his desk he heard the door open looked up from his work and quietly said yes im afraid its time sir for southern wind he explained the situation when he had finished general liu said make some tea please general i really think that make tea liu repeated softly and steep it three times nicholai finished his speech kang said so that is why you wish to kill voroshenin wouldnt you no kang said i hated my mother im sorry kang shrugged but certainly the americans didnt sponsor you to come on a matter of personal revenge kang said why did they send you to kill voroshenin nicholai answered why nicholai told him all of it the whole plot to drive a wedge between beijing and moscow because it didnt matter now all he needed now was for kang to make the anticipated move there was a chance that he wouldnt but nicholai discounted it a mans nature is his nature kang had revealed his and he would act according to that nature kang did you have told me everything now everything very well kang said he picked up the wire it is time to resume the opera breathe and store your ki breathe and store your ki nicholai allowed fear to seep into his throat as he said but why i told you everything exactly but there is no point now the point is kang said as he squatted in front of nicholai that i will enjoy it stones in place nicholai forced all the energy into his legs felt it course through the veins and muscles as kang reached up to unbuckle his belt and pull down his trousers store and release the energy exploded from nicholais feet and through his legs as he surged upward with all the ki he had stored in his body the chair shattered from its bolts kang sprawled back then got to his feet nicholai spun twice to develop momentum and then whirled into him and struck him with the legs of the chair sending kang spinning toward the wall then nicholai threw himself into kang smashed him into the wall and heard the air come out of kangs lungs nicholai backed off and did it again then again then pinned the shocked and rattled kang against the wall and pressed all his weight against the smaller man trapping his hands kang still clutched the wire and nicholai counted on his next move desperate kang pressed the point of the wire to nicholais throat nicholai let it come felt it bite into his throat felt the blood start to come and saw kang smile in triumph then he craned his neck down grabbed the wire with his teeth jerked his neck back and yanked the wire from kangs grasp kangs eyes went wide with surprise nicholai stretched his neck as far back as it would go then jammed it forward the wire went into kangs eye he screamed in agony wriggled against nicholai trying to escape nicholai held the wire just there for a moment then said for chen he pushed and sent the point through kangs eye and into his brain kang stiffened groaned and died nicholai let his body crumple to the floor then he lowered himself down and started on the buckles of the leather strap with his teeth it took five long minutes to free one wrist then he unbuckled his other hand he took a few deep breaths gathered his energy got up and then took the tape out of the machine and put it in his pocket looking at his watch he saw that there was still time to go kill voroshenin the three agents were tormenting chen in the outer room one looked up in surprise as nicholai came through the door the more so as nicholai killed him with a kick to the head the second went to pull his gun but was dispatched with an elbow to the throat the third tried to escape but nicholai grabbed him by the back of the neck and slammed his head into the door crushing his skull against the heavy wood all of this took no more than five seconds and then nicholai knelt over chen who lay quivering on the cold concrete floor did you kill him chen asked his voice rattling painfully nicholai answered he placed his index and middle fingers on chens neck along the carotid artery xiao chen think of bowls overflowing with pure white pearl rice and dishes of pork in hot brown sauce do you have those things in mind chen nodded good nicholai said he pressed until he felt chens life slip away nicholai found the corpse of the largest agent took off his coat slipped it on and then put on the dead mans hat he walked out of the cave through the beautiful garden and outside where he saw the glow of a cigarette inside the car the engine was running the heater on nicholai walked over and rapped on the window open up the driver rolled down the window what do you want its fucking cold brother let me in nicholai said in chinese the bastard wants us to go for some hot noodles and pork the locks unclicked and nicholai slid in the back he pressed the agents pistol into the guards neck zhengyici opera house and i know the route brother so dont fuck me around kang will kill me actually he wont the driver put the car in gear and pulled out the drive took twenty minutes nicholai used the time to try to restore his energy he was exhausted the exertion it had required to break the chair from the floor had drained his ki and now he was uncertain if he had sufficient energy left to perform the perfect strike required to silently kill voroshenin much less make his escape he also realized that emotion had sapped his energy the terror of the torture chamber the effort to maintain his selfcontrol the horror of chens agony the genuine sorrow over the mans death all had taken a toll over the killing of kang and his three minions nicholai felt not a jot of remorse if the buddhists were right kang would spend long ages in bardo the limbolike stage between death and rebirth before returning to the earth for a lifetime of suffering now nicholai concentrated on his breathing on attempting to recuperate his strength he felt it slowly coming back but whether it would be enough and in time was a real question the car arrived at the opera house go another block nicholai said the driver went up a block and pulled over nicholai set the pistol down and then hit the driver with a shuto strike to the base of the brain as the driver fell dead over the steering wheel nicholai got out of the backseat and walked to the zhengyici a guard at the front door stopped him my name is guibert nicholai said i am guest of comrade voroshenin the opera is almost over the guard complained i was otherwised engaged nicholai answered sliding his index finger back and forth through a v he made with his other hand the guard chuckled go in nicholai stepped into the lobby which was almost empty recalling the plan of the theater he quickly found the stairs bounded up and walked down the corridor two of voroshenins guards leaned against the wall outside his box they straightened as they saw nicholai and one reached his hand inside his jacket now nicholai thought either voroshenin has played his cards very close to his chest or i am dead he strode toward the guards and put his hands up in a what are you going to do shrug the guard without the pistol was sullen he patted nicholai down from his armpits to his ankles found nothing and opened the door to the box the encroaching light caused yuri voroshenin to turn around even in the dim light nicholai could see the surprise in his eyes thats right he thought im supposed to be dead he edged past the guard standing inside the door and sat down next to voroshenin im so sorry im late he whispered in russian on the stage below the sheng lit by a vermilion lamp his face vertically divided into a whiteandblack design delivered a speech bemoaning the loss of a battle it was beautifully performed every syllable perfectly in place before voroshenin could respond nicholai added i was unavoidably detained xue xin saw nicholai go into the theater he turned to a small boy huddled against the flaming trash can and said run tell your sifu that the performance has not ended the boy ran xue xin waited until he saw nicholai get into the theater and then he ambled off slowly working his way to the alley in back go player is on the screen jesus christ haverford felt limp sweaty and exhausted hel was a rollercoaster ride where at point zero no shit no shit sir colonel yu ran down the hall and burst into lius office hes at zhengyici liu considered the development it was one thing for the american agent to have made it to the opera house quite another for him to complete his mission there but if he did kill voroshenin then there was something to consider good tea said liu drums boomed and gongs clanged as the handsome sheng came back onstage the dan beautifully garbed in a silk brocade robe crossed the stage in tiny steps as delicate and light as falling cherry blossoms she waved her fan saw her lover then looked up to the moon a solitary white spotlight and began her aria it was beautiful her voice was a revelation a seamless blend of form and emotion as she built to her high note nicholai saw voroshenins right hand slowly ease into his jacket at his waist knife or gun nicholai asked himself gun he decided and what is he waiting for the same thing that you are darkness and more noise if he waits for the climactic moment he can shoot you and have your body hustled out of here before anyone can notice avoiding a public incident very smart of him very disciplined the music began its rise nicholai leaned over toward voroshenin i relate greetings he said whispering into voroshenins ear from the countess alexandra ivanovna my mother he felt voroshenins body tense his hand inch toward the pistol nicholai hel im going to kill you in a moment nicholai said and theres not a single thing you can do about it xun huisheng warbled i have helped the lovers come together although i have suffered hard words and beatings the moon is rising in its silvery glow i am the happy red maid the drums rattled the gongs clanged the theater went dark voroshenin went for the pistol nicholai trapped his hand breathed deeply and released all the ki he had left into a single leopard paw strike to voroshenins chest he heard the russian grunt then voroshenin slumped back in his seat his mouth a frozen oval the guard started forward too much vodka nicholai said as he got up down in the orchestra the audience was applauding wildly nicholai walked out the door of the box your boss is sick nicholai said they rushed inside nicholai let his mind take over and walk him through the escape down the stairs and to the right down the hallway toward the interior stage door where an old man sat on a stool you cant go in here the old man said im sorry liao nicholai said as he swung his right hand in a lazy arc and struck him as gently as possible on the side of the neck he caught the old man and lowered him gently to the floor opened the door found the next door to his left and stepped out into the alley it was only as he walked out the back end of the alley that he felt something warm running down his left leg then a jolt of burning pain and realized that voroshenins gun had gone off and that he was shot then he saw the monk standing at the end of the alley satori nicholai said yes yes the monk limped off in one direction nicholai in the other he saw it clearly now what would happen in the temple of the green truth satori the way out of the trap signal what haverford asked he stubbed out his thirteenth cigarette of the night and rolled his chair over to the young agent who sat by the cable go player is on the move toward point one ill be goddamned haverford said half in surprise half in admiration nicholai fucking hel the blood froze on his skin forming a bandage of sorts it didnt hold up as nicholai walked quickly through the hutongs of xuanwu his heart beating strongly pumping blood into his leg and breaking the intermittent clotting but the cold slowed the blood loss and eased the pain nicholai wasnt thinking about his leg he placed a map of the district in his head remembered haverfords instructions and moved swiftly past the few people out on the streets in the winter night some watched him most had their faces wrapped against the cold and were indifferent to this tall kweilo as he strode past them none of them noticed when he dropped the crumpled tape recording into a trashcan fire police sirens started to wail headed toward zhengyici opera house voroshenins body had been discovered nicholai put the go board in front of his eyes and scanned the new situation the kang stones had been removed the voroshenin stones captured but voroshenins corpse had been revealed and soon if it hadnt already happened the chinese national police would discover that their master kang was also dead murdered if you care to call it that they would be coming for him and the move now was to get to other black stones on the board he had an appointment in the temple of the green truth wu zhong waited in the sanctuary a team member a muslim brother had relayed the signal that go player was on the way inshallah he got to his feet stretched and prepared his muscles for the task at hand the american had told him what to do nicholai turned onto niujie street and saw the mosque its three sections roofed in green tile a small minaret with a crescent rising above the center section a whitecapped hui chinese waited by the iron gate go player the opera is over the hui took nicholai by the elbow looked around and quickly ushered him through the small courtyard and into the door of the section farthest to the right it was dark inside lit only by oil lanterns and nicholai blinked to adjust his eyes as the door shut behind him his escort led him through the foyer to a narrow set of stairs then showed him into the basement and closed the door a tall wideshouldered man stood in front of him welcome go player the man said in heavily accented mandarin thank you nicholai answered the man glanced down at nicholais leg and then observed you are hurt shot im afraid the target terminated you are certain terminated nicholai repeated his leg started to throb and worse felt weak underneath him this was very bad because the chinese man in front of him struggling with his english carefully pronounced haverford sends his regrets wu zhong moved with unbelievable speed for such a large man and nicholai just managed to slip the elbow strike that would have crushed his throat the blow missed by a thread as nicholai turned sideways and raised his forearm to block he pivoted to throw a punch of his own at the mans exposed temple but his leg gave from under him and he toppled to the floor wu zhong turned saw nicholai on the floor and raised his leg into an axe kick to cave in his opponents chest the leg came down nicholai rolled away and wu zhongs heel left a hole in the wooden plank wu followed with a low front kick to the head nicholai got his arm up in time and took the force of the blow on the shoulder but his arm went numb he rolled onto his back just as wu zhong reached down to grab him slipped his kicking leg between wus arms and struck him full on the chin with the ball of his foot wu zhong flew backward the kick should have killed him or at least knocked him out but nicholai hadnt fully recovered from the ordeal in kangs cave was weak with loss of blood and the blow he had just sustained so the lethal power wasnt there but it gave him time to jump back to his feet and set himself as wu zhong came in throwing powerful left and right punches to drive nicholai back toward the wall blood flowed freely from his wounded leg now he felt lightheaded and knew that if he allowed the larger stronger man to pin him against the wall he was finished he ducked under the next two punches and drove into wus midsection his leg sending a fierce jolt of pain through him as he pushed off the floor and drove wu to the floor wu tried to wrap his forearm around nicholais neck to snap it but nicholai jerked his head out of the trap as they fell to the floor wu did wrap his own leg around nicholais right leg trapping it so nicholai had no choice but to use his wounded leg to pry wus legs apart then despite the pain he drove three successive knee strikes straight into wus exposed groin the man groaned but didnt yell and he didnt change his position instead he brought his big arms up behind nicholai and pounded his fists into the back of his neck and head nicholai felt the fog gather around him first would come fog then darkness he raised himself up to avoid the fists and thats what wu needed he bucked his hips and threw nicholai off sprawling backward nicholai struggled to get up but his wounded leg wouldnt let him wu struggled to his feet as nicholai pulled himself backward along the floor now seeking the wall so that he could ball himself up against it and try to weather the storm he knew was about to break on him the first kick came to the kidney the next to the small of the back the next to his wounded leg nicholai heard himself howl in pain he pulled himself back but his arms were too weak now and his feet could find no purchase on the floor he wanted to die standing he tried to push himself up but his arms collapsed and he fell flat all he could do was roll over so that he could at least die facing his opponent in the clarity before death he saw the go board and knew the answer to why haverford would leave the black stone in place he wouldnt he didnt wu zhong chambered his leg for the lethal axe kick salaama he said peace the bullet struck wu zhong square in his broad forehead and he fell backward nicholai turned his head in the direction of the shot colonel yu lowered his pistol the monk standing behind yu squatted beside nicholai and said satori youre late nicholai said then he blacked out part three wuliang mountains yunnan province china the sound of a flute woke him at first nicholai thought it was a bird singing but then he heard the deliberate repetition of a particular phrase and realized that he was listening to someone play a lusheng but there was birdsong in the background birdsong and clean fresh air and then he knew that he was no longer in the city or in the tight fumechoked back of an army truck but somewhere in the countryside perhaps even in the wilderness he turned toward the slight breeze he felt on the back of his head but movement was still painful and difficult and it took him over a minute to roll over and feel the cool air dry the sweat on his face his leg throbbed in protest of the motion a voice snapped an order in a language that nicholai did not understand and then he heard footsteps quickly shuffling across a wooden floor he didnt know where he was but then it seemed like a long time since he had known the last thing that he clearly remembered was his fight with the formidable bajiquan practitioner and his rescue by yu and the monk he remembered waking up briefly in the back of what must have been a truck because its rattling forced him to suppress a scream of pain before he blacked out again he recalled being given a shot of what was probably morphine and the deep painless slumber that followed and he had a vague memory of being lifted out of the truck and placed in another soft worried voices and a nightmare in which he heard concerned whispers and hushed discussions about amputating his leg now he reached down in alarm and felt with intense relief that both limbs were still attached to his body but his left leg was hot and swollen and now he recalled the fevers and the shaking his head being lifted to receive sips of bitter tea and the horrible pain as the truck bounced over rough roads as it first climbed and then descended hills indeed nicholai saw that he was in the hills now outside the window he saw a lush forest of firs pines camphor and nanmu trees in a series of rolling ridges below him the landscape seemed impossibly green after the white and silver of beijing and the blackness of the journey to this place wherever it was maybe im dead nicholai speculated without alarm perhaps this is chin tu the paradise promised by the amida buddha but the pure land was not for killers and he had killed yuri voroshenin with a single leopard strike to the heart at first he thought this might have been part of his morphineinduced dreams crazy twisted images of solange haverford shengs and dans and sharp wires and men dressed all in black but then he realized that the memory of killing voroshenin was just that a recollection of an actual event and he felt some satisfaction at completing his mission even though the americans had betrayed him nicholai blamed himself as much as them i should have seen it earlier he thought as he lay in what he now realized was a hammock i should have known that haverford never intended to honor his part of the deal even this small mental exertion exhausted him and he sank deeper into the hammock feeling only now that his clothes were soaked with sweat his leg hurt and his body still ached from the beating he had absorbed in the temple of the green truth then nicholai heard footsteps and felt the palm of a hand on his forehead the hand lingered for just a moment and then he heard a voice he recognized as the monks say the fever has broken good for a while we thought we were still going to lose you so i am alive but shouldnt be the monk answered by all rights you should be in bardo awaiting rebirth perhaps i am perhaps we all are the monk said who knows my name is xue xin michel guibert if you wish xue xin said a trace of amusement in his voice we need to turn you back over now and change your clothes it will hurt nicholai felt two pairs of firm hands on his shoulder and then they turned him onto his back a jolt of pain shot up from his leg to the top of his head and he swallowed a grunt of pain xue xin looked down on him and nicholai recognized the man from the bridge to the jade isle the alley outside the opera and the temple of the green truth his closecropped hair was jet black but what seized nicholais attention were his eyes they looked through you albeit not unkindly if xue xin was eaten up with sympathy it didnt show on his face you will have tea no thank you you will have tea xue xin said the tea nicholai decided tasted like wet grass but xue xin insisted that the brew of herbs was healing his infection if you want to live drink xue xin shrugged if you dont dont nicholai drank colonel yu was relieved to see the american agent looking better at first they thought he was going to die hed lost a great deal of blood from the bullet wound and had taken a severe beating as well the internal damage from the bajiquan blows alone would have killed a man with less ki and the leg quickly became infected nor did they have the leisure to give him adequate medical care theyd had to get the american out of beijing and quickly yus own pla staff carried him to a waiting army truck that quickly drove out to the ring road where they transferred the unconscious man to a military convoy headed south an army medic dug the bullet out of his leg in the moving truck then they managed to hook up a blood transfusion and started to administer morphine for the pain it might have been easier to let him die yu thought dispose of the body and simply shrug at the mystery that swept across official beijing like the north wind the government was rattled to say the least the russian commissioner voroshenin was dead officially from a heart attack suffered while watching the opera but no one in the intelligence or military communities believed that not along with the coincidental murder of kang sheng found with a wire thrust through his eyeball and into his brain the american plot had worked perfectly moscow and beijing were busy blaming each other mao dug a hole and pulled it closed over himself especially with his dog kang no longer there to protect him general liu remained the calm and stable figure ready to step in to end the chaos the only problem yu thought now as he looked at nicholai was the disappearance of a french citizen michel guibert he had been seen going to the opera voroshenins guards quickly summoned home to moscow had reportedly claimed that guibert was sitting beside voroshenin in his private box at the time of his death but got up suddenly and left then disappeared was he dead was he involved in voroshenins death in kangs beijing and moscow buzzed with rumors some had it that guibert had killed voroshenin others that it was his assistant leotov who had also disappeared shortly after his bosss death the russians claimed that guibert was a chinese agent the chinese countered that he was russian each accused the other of hiding him at the same time that each accused the other of killing him to stop him from talking to quote the chairman himself all is chaos under the heavens and the situation is excellent guibert opened his eyes where are we nicholai asked you dont need to know yu answered the air while cool was still warm for winter and the nanmu tree nicholai could see through the window didnt grow up north the brief dialogue he had overheard as the attendants came in and out was unintelligible to him not han chinese at all so he guessed that it was some southern tribal dialect sichuan or yunnan he said yunnan admitted yu in the wuliang hills why beijing was unhealthy for you nicholai remembered his manners thank you for saving my life gratitude is misplaced yu answered i was doing my duty mr hel how long have you known my real identity he asked yu since before you entered beijing yu answered he recited nicholais history to him his birth in shanghai his removal to japan his killing of kishikawa his torture and imprisonment by the americans the chinese seemed to know it all nicholai could only hope that they did not realize the depth of his connection to the late yuri voroshenin am i a prisoner nicholai asked i would prefer to call you a guest can the guest get up and leave the question is academic in any case yu answered the reality is that you cannot get up much less walk and even if you could you have no place to go they are hunting for you everywhere mr hel this might be the only place in the world where you are safe a sadly accurate summation of the reality nicholai thought since the moment i killed kishikawasama the locations and circumstances change but the fact does not i am a prisoner he heard kishikawas voice if you have no options then it is honorable to accept your imprisonment although you might consider seppuku but you have options what are they nikko you must find them yourself examine the gokang when you are trapped and can find no escape route you must create one again please how it is your kang nikko no one else can play it for you you wanted voroshenin dead nicholai said probing obviously to create a rift with the soviets yu nodded and you rescued me from the american ambush because how often would we get a chance to obtain an american agent so motivated to cooperate yu asked im sure you can tell us names places methods of operations after all you agreed to be rescued hel had understood the monks warning and signaled in turn that he understood the act of a drowning man reaching out for the rope surely he knew it would come with a price nicholai said i will tell you nothing the americans betrayed you yu answered why would you hesitate to betray them in turn their dishonor is their own nicholai responded mine would be mine how japanese i accept the compliment nicholai said he tried to sit up but the effort was painful and enervating i will not become an informer but i will force the americans to honor the arrangement they made with me and how will you do that yu asked amused at this wounded man who could barely support his own weight yet there was something in hels eyes that made yu believe him where is he singleton demanded i dont know admitted haverford is he dead i dont know alive again diamond didnt bother to conceal his smirk singleton frowned at him and then turned his attention back to haverford you dont know much im trying to find out try harder haverford thought briefly of defending himself voroshenin was dead apparently at hels hands and the chinese and russians were snapping at each others throats and while hel had possibly escaped he hadnt been found not by moscow or beijing anyway because there had been no blowback at all apparently no one had connected voroshenins assassination to the company i want him found singleton said do you understand i do diamond said stressing the firstperson pronoun and sounding like a sycophantic schoolboy whats that supposed to mean haverford asked hels gone over to the other side and you know it diamond said and im not so sure youre not happy about it thats a goddamn lie you calling me a liar diamond jumped up from his chair haverford stood up a liar a torturer they started for each other this is not your sixthgrade schoolyard sit down both of you singleton waited until both men took their chairs my straight line and my circle singleton thought we shall see which one wins it is a basic law of go and of life the side that wins is the side that deserves to win haverford thought of resigning on the spot he could probably find a job in academia or in one of the new think tanks theres a concept now sprouting like mushrooms in the damp intellectual soil of the greater washington metropolitan area the place had after all once been a swamp but there was unfinished business so he clamped his jaw tight and listened assume hel is out there singleton said lure him in how youre clever young men singleton answered youll think of something the meeting was concluded think like nicholai hel haverford told himself as he left the building for his hotel in dupont circle no easy task he admitted as it was probably true that no one else in the world thought like nicholai hel well try anyway he ran his thoughts through nicholais options would hel could hel yes he decided both im going to deliver the weapons nicholai said it was a bold even risky move a breakout maneuver on the gokang that had small chance of success and could only place him in great danger still when one is surrounded there are few choices other than to surrender die or break out please dont be ridiculous yu answered your cover as an arms merchant was just that a cover not a reality i saw the rocket launchers nicholai said they looked quite real props yu answered for your little opera the play is over mr hel and yet here you are in yunnan nicholai answered for weeks now near the vietnamese border perhaps that is mere coincidence or perhaps you are overly solicitous of my recuperation but more likely its because you intend to take the rocket launchers across the border into vietnam even if that were true yu said it hardly concerns you let me tell you why it does nicholai said i have demonstrated skills that might be very useful im fluent in french have an established cover as an arms merchant and im a kweilo which would give me certain advantages in the french colonies so much for my utility here is my offer i will deliver the weapons to the viet minh and retain the payment as my recompense for services rendered once the weapons have been safely delivered you will provide me with a new identity and documentation then we are quit of each other it seemed the perfect solution nicholai thought the americans through the gift of the rocket launchers would unintentionally honor their deal with him and it would have the added effect of harming their interests you think a lot of your value mr hel it is simply an objective evaluation yu stared at him if you reemerge anywhere in indochina the americans will find you just so yu agreed to consider his offer the americans will find me nicholai thought when yu left the room no we will find each other and i will hold haverford accountable for his treachery and then i will find solange diamond pored over the hel file goddamnit he thought how could hel have escaped the trap in the beijing temple and that chinese kungfu son of a bitch who was supposed to have been so good yeah so goddamn good that he let hel put a bullet in his head and kill the rest of his men as well two swings at hel he thought two misses first he dispatches the two wouldbe killers in tokyo then the massacre in beijing three strikes and youre out diamond told himself the next try has to connect but you have to find hel before you can kill him lure him singleton had said easy for the old fart to say a little harder to do lure him with what what bait can you set that would bring hel in diamond went back to studying the file that singleton had forced haverford to turn over start at the beginning he told himself start in tokyo find the bait that will bring that arrogant halfjap bastard waltzing in nicholais room was pleasant large airy made entirely of poles it sat on stilts the space below housing chickens and a pig nicholai learned that it sat on the edge of a remote buddhist monastery in the hills of wulian high above the lekang river and that the nearby villagers were puman people an ethnic minority that spoke a dai dialect but little han chinese he could see the people through the window the men wore black turbans the women colorful headscarves with pieces of silver sewn into them it was all so different from drab beijing as a further comfort yu had acquired all of guiberts clothing and personal effects and had them brought to yunnan nicholai particularly appreciated the razor and small travel mirror and one morning asked for a bowl of hot water so he could shave his image in the mirror was a bit of a shock his skin was pale his face drawn the beard gave him the look of a prison camp survivor shaving made him look and feel better but he realized that he would have to start eating regularly to regain his health i want to get up he said the young monk who had brought the water looked nervous xue xin says not for five more days is xue xin here at the moment the young monk comically looked around the room no then help me get up please i will go ask if you go ask nicholai said i will try to get up on my own while you are gone and probably fall and die as a result what would xue xin say to you then he would hit me with a stick so the monk helped him out of the bed nicholai tentatively put some weight on the wounded leg the pain was ferocious and it started to buckle beneath him but the monk steadied him and they walked across the room then back again after three trips nicholai was exhausted and the monk helped him back into the bed the next morning he walked outside painful and slow at first his walk from the village to the monastery became part of a thricedaily routine as he rebuilt his physical and mental stamina making his unsteady way along the narrow stonelaid paths he focused on details unraveling individual birdsong from the cacophony of a score of species identifying types of monkeys from their incessant chatter and warning screeches distinguishing plants and vines from among thousands in the verdant forest the jungle was reclaiming the monastery its vines cracked the old stones swallowed columns and stiles crept over flagstone pavilions like a patient persistent tide of go stones on a board yet statues of buddha peeped through the vegetation his eyes content with the knowledge that all things change and all physical matter inevitably decays the discipline of the walk was good for nicholais mind and every day the pain lessened and his strength returned until he could walk with strength and confidence his spirit recovered as well and soon he began to think about the future he almost tripped over the monk xue xin was on his hands and knees with a small blade carefully trimming vines away from a stone path that led to a modest stupa the monk wore a simple brown robe tied at the waist with a belt that had faded almost to white he looked up and asked are you feeling better yes thank you xue xin slowly got to his feet and bowed nicholai bowed deeply in return you dont bow like a frenchman xue xin said i was raised in china nicholai answered later in japan xue xin laughed that explains it the japanese they like to bow yes they do nicholai agreed would you like to help xue xin asked forgive me nicholai said but it seems an impossible task not at all every day i clean each days growth away but it grows back nicholai said then you just have to do it again the next day exactly so nicholai took to helping xue xin with the repetitive task of trying to keep the path clear they met every morning and worked for hours then stopped and took tea when the afternoon rain slashed down nicholai learned that xue xin was an honored guest at the monastery they put up with me xue xin said i work and you i dont know if i am a guest here or a prisoner nicholai answered truthfully although he left it at that as in life itself xue xin chuckled are we its guest or its prisoner as life dictates i suppose not at all xue xin answered what do you mean it has stopped raining xue xin observed in response they went back to work on the path the next day xue xin observed you attack the vines as if they are your enemy are they not no they are your allies xue xin answered without them you would not have a useful task to perform i would then have another useful task nicholai answered annoyed with another set of allyenemies xue xin said it is always the same my easternwestern friend but by all means if it makes you feel better attack attack that night lying in his kang lonely and missing solange nicholai had a crisis of the mind and soul raised as he was he was familiar with basic buddhist philosophy only the unfamiliar would call it a religion or the buddha a god that all suffering comes from attachment that we are prisoners of our longings and desires that keep us bound to the endless cycle of life death and rebirth he knew the buddhist belief that these longings make us take negative actions sins if you must that create and accumulate bad karma that must be ameliorated through the lifetimes and that only enlightenment can free us from this trap he got up took his flashlight and made his way to xue xins cell the monk was in full lotus position meditating you wish to trim vines by moonlight xue xin asked very well but do it without me please i want my freedom then trim vines that is glib nicholai answered i expect more from you than zen riddles you are suffering nicholai nodded xue xin opened his eyes exhaled a long breath as if to reluctantly end his meditation and then said sit down you cannot find enlightenment you can only be open to it finding you thats satori and why you chose it as a code word nicholai said back in beijing you needed to see things as they really were xue xin answered until then there was no helping you if you cannot find satori how it might come in a drop of rain xue xin continued ignoring the question a note from a faraway flute the fall of a leaf of course you have to be ready for it or it will pass unnoticed but if you are ready and your eyes are open you will see it and suddenly understand everything then you will know who you are and what you must do satori satori xue xin repeated then he added if our thoughts imprison us it stands to reason that they can also set us free yu came to see him the next morning the chinese had accepted his offer the normal route of arms shipments from china to vietnam yu explained was through lang son across the border and directly into the north of vietnam where the viet minh had secure sanctuaries in the mountainous jungles but they were not going to take that route the rocket launchers were needed in the south not the north that is information that our enemies would pay dearly to obtain yu said indeed it is nicholai thought since its last disastrous effort in the south the viet minh had confined their activities to the north but now it appeared that if armed with the new weaponry they were planning to launch a new southern front the northern viet minh were dominated by the soviets the southern were more independent or allied with china a successful southern offensive would shuffle the geopolitical deck in asia yu was playing a deep game given the fact that the weapons had to go to the southern viet minh units there was only one possible route down the lekang river into laos it would be no easy feat he explained the lekang ran through deep gorges with boiling rapids and sharp rocks that could pierce the hulls of boats like eggshells the river was not easily navigable until south of the town of luang prabang deep into laos luang prabang itself would present problems they would have to switch boats there for the rest of the journey and the area was rife with spies and french special forces and then there was the binh xuyen whats the binh xuyen nicholai asked pirates yu answered pirates nicholai asked it seemed a tad anachronistic originally river pirates from the vast rung sat marshes south of saigon the binh xuyen now opium merchants virtually controlled that city their leader a former convict named bay vien supported the viet minh but had changed sides and was now a close ally of the puppet emperor bao dai and his french masters as a reward bay vien controlled drugs gambling and prostitution in saigon and used the resulting vast wealth to acquire modern arms and equipment thats saigon nicholai said what does bay vien have to do with laos its where the opium comes from yu answered the viet minh used to buy raw opium in the mountains east of luang prabang and sell it to buy weapons but through bribery intimidation and assassinations the binh xuyen had virtually taken control of the laotian opium trade luang prabang swarmed with binh xuyen yu went on a viet minh agent will meet you there and escort you into vietnam nicholai noted the shift to the secondperson singular and mentioned it this is why we require your services yu said my superiors have decided that they cannot take the risk of my getting captured in french territory he told nicholai how he would be contacted in luang prabang and later in saigon and then resumed his briefing in laos the lekang changed its name to the mekong as it flowed through cambodia into the mekong delta of vietnam the delta would be a challenge not only would they have to evade the patrols of the french army and the foreign legion but they would have to make their way through a network of blockhouses and forts worse still the mekong delta was patrolled by wellarmed militias allied to the french occupiers where do i deliver the weapons nicholai asked we dont know that would make it difficult yu explained in saigon you will be told where to rendezvous with a viet minh agent codenamed ai quoc to whom we will deliver the weapons quoc is one of the most wanted men in the country in hiding even now hes survived a score of assassination attempts and the french have a huge reward on him you wont be told his location until the last possible moment nicholai mentally reviewed the obstacles the river the binh xuyen the french their vietnamese militias and then locating the elusive ai quoc so basically he said this is a suicide mission it does have that aspect yu answered if you want to change your mind now is the time i dont very well we have an arrangement then nicholai asked yu shook his hand nicholai found xue xin at his usual task of trimming vines i came to say goodbye nicholai said where are you going im not sure nicholai answered then decided that he owed a better answer to find my satori and if you dont then i will keep my eyes open nicholai answered we will meet again xue xin said in this life or another nicholai felt an emotion welling up inside him something he had not felt since the death of general kishikawa i cannot tell you how much you have meant to me you dont need to xue xin said i know nicholai knelt and bowed touching his forehead to the ground thank you you are my teacher and you mine xue xin said then the monk knelt back down and resumed his work serene in the knowledge that nicholai hel had determined his destiny we will meet again he thought yu had left the crates of weaponry in the care of a local battalion commander colonel kis belly hung out over his belt an indication that life was good for a commander in the remote hills of yunnan he treated yu and nicholai to a very good lunch of fish vegetables and mounds of rice served by an orderly who virtually salivated as he presented each dish ill take command of a squad of your soldiers yu said to colonel ki and well need some of the local puman as porters to lang son to the river yu answered we will take them from there perhaps ki said you have misunderstood what lekang really means in chinese it means unruly waters nicholai answered unruly to say the least ki commented with the expression of mild sympathy that one gives to an acquaintance who has just embarrassingly revealed that he is terminally ill but there was money to be made for a nominal fee i can provide boats i have already arranged for the boats ki inwardly cursed the rivermen who had sold their services without gaining his permission or giving him his cut and worried how such a transaction could occur without his knowledge an escort then you are four days march from the river and despite the partys heroic efforts there are still bandits in these mountains bandits bad people ki said shaking his head very bad people the porters shouldered the heavy crates on bamboo poles down the steep mountain trail slippery with mud from the recent rains the short legs and long trunks of these puman tribesmen gave them an advantage that nicholai did not possess as each step jarred his already sore knees and ankles while the climb up from the last valley had been grueling the descent down into the next was simply painful and nicholai thought that the route more than lived up to its sobriquet the dragons tail theyd been on it for three days now with another day yet to go before they reached the river and the boats the soldiers that yu commandeered went out ahead and along the flanks some had chinese burp guns slung over their shoulders others carried captured american mi rifles at each pause in the day and at their camps for the night yu gathered the soldiers and conducted study sessions on marxist theory and maoist thought communism nicholai thought it promises to make everyone equally rich and instead makes everyone equally poor during a break in the march one day nicholai took out a pack of cigarettes shook out two and offered one to yu french yu observed they are very good i think take one nicholai said youre allowed the occasional bourgeois indulgence a man needs a whiff of sin now and then nicholai thought or he becomes something not quite a man yu took the proffered cigarette with an expression of delicious guilt nicholai lit it for him and yu took a long drag it is very good thank you not at all yu took two more short disciplined puffs carefully snuffed the cigarette out on the ground put the butt in his shirt pocket and buttoned it nicholai thought of solange and missed her is there a girl at home he asked yu as a revolutionary yu answered i have no time for bourgeois concepts such as romantic love so there is yu allowed himself a shy smile she is also a revolutionary but perhaps someday when the revolution has been established you yes a french girl and you think about her yes after three years in prison nicholai thought he had come to terms with loneliness its return to his internal life was a mixed blessing but yes he thought about solange too often and not often enough he took the next painful step down the mountain they stopped for the night at a daoist monastery built on a small knoll along the side of the trail the view was magnificent the food somewhat less so composed as it was of congee with small bits of vegetables and fish but nicholai ate ravenously and then stood on the periphery of a rectangular stone pavilion and watched the monks perform their kungfu kata which he recognized as the classic southern hunggar form of tiger and crane beautiful and doubtless deadly he thought although not as efficient as hoda korosu but that was the main distinction between chinese and japanese martial arts the former used many elaborate and circular moves while the latter emphasized one quick direct fatal strike nicholai contemplated which was superior and decided that it was the chinese for beauty the japanese for killing on the far side of the pavilion yu inflicted communist doctrine on his students one of the victims a thick country lad named liang stared wistfully off into the bamboo thickets doubtless wishing that he could find sanctuary there but liang was something of a special pet of yus and so goodnaturedly sat through the lecture as if genuinely interested yu had great if misplaced hopes for him one more day on the dragons tail nicholai thought they would reach the river late the next afternoon and load their cargo onto the waiting boats it would be a nice change to be on the water and off the arduous trail he walked back to the chamber that had been assigned to him it was a small room with a single kang the classic chinese raised bed which was draped with thin mosquito netting someone had already come in lit a lantern and left a thermos of hot water and an old porcelain cup with which to make tea but nicholai craved rest more than the stimulation of the strong southern green tea so he stripped off his clothes climbed into the kang and stretched out he closed his eyes and told his mind to allow him five hours of sleep he wanted to wake up well before dawn to make sure that the caravan got an early start nicholais proximity sense woke him before his internal alarm did the two men smelled of cheap chinese tobacco their heavy steps made clear that they were bandits and not professional assassins they tried to walk quietly but were clumsy and obvious amateurs assume that to step slowly is to step softly while professionals know that the opposite is true and are both quick and light willing himself to remain still nicholai measured the slow heavy footsteps of the lead bandit as they creaked on the wooden floor if they were going to use guns they would have done it already but they apparently didnt want to make noise and spring the main attack prematurely before they had eliminated the leadership so it would be a sword a knife or an axe maybe a garrote but more likely an edged weapon that could slice through the mosquito netting sparing the extra second to open it so there would be time for hoda korosu he edged his hand along the kang felt for the teacup and slid it beside him under the thin sheet silently he crushed the cup in his hand until he felt blood running from his palm and then pinched the sharp shard of glass between his thumb and forefinger then he waited the footsteps stopped and nicholai felt the bandit pause as he lifted his arm to strike nicholai swung the shard in a horizontal backhand that sliced the bandits throat the knife arm came down in a limp useless arc and then the bandit his left arm futilely clutching his throat pitched forward onto the kang the second bandit made the fatal error of backing up and reaching for the pistol at his belt as nicholai launched off the kang grabbed the heavy metal thermos and swung it like a club the mans skull fractured with a sickening crack nicholai bent over his body took the pistol and stepped outside red muzzle flashes tore the black silk fabric of the night yu clad only in trousers stood with a pistol in his hand trying to form the startled men into some kind of order nicholai heard the zipzip of gunfire and felt the little pockets of air concuss as the bullets flew past him he had experienced bombings beatings and handtohand combat but this was his first firefight and he found it chaotic the bandits had chosen a good time to strike the hours of deepest sleep before dawn and the fight had the surreal quality of a waking dream the bullets were real however and nicholai heard the hollow thunk of a round strike the soldier beside him the boy reached down to the hole in his stomach and looked at nicholai with an expression of hurt surprise as if to ask if this were really happening then howled with pain nicholai eased him to the ground as gently as he could the boy would die and there was nothing he could do he could only try to save the cargo nicholai exchanged his pistol for the soldiers rifle and moved out yu was already rallying the men he had left toward the crates stacked in the monasterys central pavilion a few of the sentries guarding the crates had already fled two others lay slumped dead at their posts while three crouched behind the boxes and returned the shots that were coming from the bamboo thicket on the far side of the pavilion but they were under heavy fire and it was obvious that they couldnt hold out for long yu started across the pavilion for the pile of crates but nicholai held him back it was brave but useless to join the three soldiers in their isolated post we would just become additional targets nicholai thought a few more sacrificed stones in a soontobe eliminated position on the board better to create a new position and give the bandits something new to think about so nicholai squatted behind a stone bench set at the edge of the pavilion he waited until he saw a muzzle flash come from the bamboo and fired at it then heard a man scream in pain yu did the same with the same result the shooting from the bamboo stopped as the bandits considered how to handle the new situation nicholai used the pause to bellycrawl across that side of the pavilion to a bench on the perpendicular side it would be better he thought if the bandits formed a tactic to deal with a situation that had already changed go is a fluid game it was quiet for a moment longer and then a spray of bullets hit the stone bench that nicholai had vacated yu pressed himself flat on the stones and survived the blast but the bullets kept him down as a group of a dozen or more bandits sprang out of the bamboo and rushed the crates nicholai on the flank of the attack easily picked the lead bandit off with his first shot but missed the second one and had to fire again he dropped the next man but the bandits in the bamboo adjusted quickly and turned their guns on him nicholai flattened out and the bullets passed over him then he pushed himself up on his hands and the balls of his feet took a deep breath and vaulted over the bench lit only by muzzle flashes the scene before him played like cinema in a bad old theater with a creaky projector nicholai saw flickers of the melee at the crates a bayonet thrust a pistol fired at close range a wounded mans mouth agape he plunged in firing his rifle until the clip was empty then he used it like an ancient chinese weapon a sharp blade on one end a blunt object on the other he swung and thrust ducked and dodged beyond thought in the realm of instinct that came from constant training but the bandits were simply too many the most skillful go player will lose his few isolated white stones against a tide of black ones it was inevitable die with honor hai kishikawasama the cherry blossoms of kajikawa floated in front of his eyes as he recalled his walk so long ago with the general kishikawa had focused on the beautiful blossoms to prepare himself for his death then through the flashes of light nicholai saw a row of brownrobed monks bamboo staffs in their hands advance onto the pavilion the fight became a whirling blur of bamboo a taifung but the rain pellets were wood striking flesh and bone and then it was over like a sudden squall the surviving bandits fled back into the forest without the precious cargo but six soldiers and one monk lay dead and others were wounded nicholai squatted beside the body of one of the bandits yu held up a lantern and they examined the dead mans face it took a moment but then nicholai recognized him the orderly who had served lunch for colonel ki you have been careless and stupid nicholai told himself michel guibert did not see the obvious ploy whereas nicholai hel would have he resolved to retain a piece of his authentic self regardless of any situational guise the monks mopped up blood under lantern light nicholai found the abbot bowed deeply and apologized for fouling the monastery with violence you did not the abbot responded they did still i was the cause of it and so i will ask that you leave at first light and never return nicholai bowed again may i risk a possibly impertinent question when the abbot nodded nicholai asked i thought that you were pacifists why buddhists are pacifists the abbot answered we are daoists we eschew violence except when necessary but it is the mission of our order to offer hospitality so we were forced to choose between two competing values our desire not to harm our fellow creatures and our vow of sanctuary to our guests in this case we chose the latter you fight well when one chooses to fight the abbot replied it is ones responsibility to fight well nicholai found yu in his chamber angrily stuffing his small gear into his haversack they were your own men nicholai said i know that his face already showed a loss of innocence nicholai felt some sympathy but it did not prevent him from pressing the necessary question how am i supposed to trust you now yu led him out of the monastery to a wide spot on the trail where a soldier was bound around the chest to the trunk of a tree it was liang blood ran down his nose and a purple welt swelled under his eye he had been beaten he was one of the sentries yu said disgustedly the one who survived he claims he fell asleep but i suspect that he deliberately let the bandits pass either way he is guilty the monks would not let me execute him at the monastery so i brought him here you should not execute him at all at the very least he failed in his duty so did we nicholai said we should have been better prepared he caused the deaths of comrades yu insisted again as did we nicholai argued men arent perfect the new man must be yu responded perfect at least in his duty nicholai looked at liang who trembled with cold and fear while we debate philosophy nicholai thought its cruel he tried again perhaps he was performing his duty to ki his duty is to the people he is the people yu in response yu pulled his pistol from its holster and held the barrel to liangs head his hand trembled as the boy cried and begged for his life yu pulled the trigger and that is how you know he said that you can trust me diamond found her in vientiane in the square outside the patousay the monument even with its laotian spires reminded him a little of an arc de triomphe indeed solange thought so too it reminds me a little of home she said in montpellier we have something similar what are you doing in laos diamond asked looking for work monsieur she answered what are you doing in laos looking for you ah well your task at least is finished yours too maybe diamond said he was instantly jealous of nicholai hel the thought that the arrogant bastard had slept with this gorgeous creature was infuriating how so she asked we might have something for you he said we she inquired her tone slightly sarcastic and tantalizing at the same time you mean we americans yes i usually deal with monsieur haverford she said she pronounced it averfor which diamond found stimulating beyond belief hes on another assignment he sent me im mr gold her smile was sensuous ironic and infuriating really no they walked out of the park onto lane xang what do you have in mind monsieur gold she asked diamond told her then added i think youll like it it could be very lucrative and saigon is a lot like france isnt it in some aspects yes so your answer pourquoi pas what does that mean she trained the full force of her green eyes on him and smiled why not good diamond said his throat tight good uhh do you need a taxi where are you staying at the manoly she answered i can walk thank you i could walk with you she stopped walking and looked at him what are you asking now monsieur gold i think you know diamond answered summoning up his nerve with the thought that the woman was after all a glorified whore i mean you said you were looking for work she laughed but not that desperately they quickly made the necessary arrangements for her trip to saigon and he walked away hating her but the whore will serve her purpose he thought the file said that hel had fallen in love with her and intended to return to her good if the son of a bitch is alive hell come find her in saigon and i have connections in saigon solange made sure that the disgusting american wasnt following her and then returned to her hotel and had a mint tea in the quiet of the shady garden saigon she thought very well saigon nicholai had yet to surface and she had to face the probability that he never would men die and men disappear and a woman must take care of herself the abhorrent gold was right that saigon was a congenial city french in many ways they reached the river late that afternoon nicholai had to admit it was something of a shock early in winter he had expected the lekang to be at its lowest flow still beyond the long eddy where the waiting rafts were beached on the pebbled shore the river ran fast full and angry the roar of water running shallowly over rock was impressive even intimidating but there was no time for trepidation nicholai worried that ki might take another shot here where they would be pinned down without cover on the narrow strip of beach he was glad to see that yu had posted two of his true believers to cover the trail we need to get loaded he said to yu yu shouted some orders and his soldiers helped the porters carry the crates onto the rafts where the boatmen lashed them down the head boatman a squat middleaged tibetan with a cigarette in his mouth approached nicholai are you guibert he asked in americanaccented english that nicholai knew too well from his years in his cell listening to the american guards converse in what passed for their native tongue thats me i lost two men just getting down here theyll be reborn well the boatman shrugged his indifference at the concept of reincarnation this life was plenty to deal with at the moment im tasser he didnt offer his hand michel guibert i know that did you bring the money yes give half now nicholai said half when we get to luang prabang tasser scoffed and looked at the roaring river give me the whole megillah now in case we dont make it to luang its your job to see that we do make it nicholai said he counted out half the money and handed a wad of bills to tasser by the way where did you learn your english tasser pressed the fingers of his right hand together and made a swooping arc american flyboys theyd crash their crates into the mountains and id get what was left of them down war had gone a couple of more years id be sitting pretty could we speak in chinese instead i dont pollute my mouth with that foreign tongue tasser said in chinese he switched back to english you got any decent smokes gauloises frenchie shit no thanks suit yourself i will tasser said so whats in the crates none of your business tasser laughed then crumpled up one of the bills and tossed it into the water you gotta grease the river gods he explained but one of his men scrambled downstream retrieved the bill and brought it back to tasser nicholai raised an eyebrow theyre gods tasser said what are they gonna do with cash nicholai walked away and found yu nervously peering back up the trail he took out a cigarette and handed it to the colonel back at the monastery yu said you didnt fight like a man motivated just by profit yes i did do not fool yourself yu said you believe in a cause even if you dont yet know what it is i believe in my own freedom individual freedom is bourgeois illusion yu answered you should give it up i wont if you dont mind just get the weapons to their destination yu said you have my word they shook hands nicholai walked back to the rafts lets get going he yelled and the boatmen pushed off the river quickly swept them away the river slowed and flattened for a distance that nicholai judged to be a couple of miles the water ran fast but evenly and he had a chance to peruse the rafts and their crews the rafts were about fifteen feet wide and made of buoyant logs tightly lashed together although with enough give to allow some flexibility they had hardly any draft and seemed to roll easily over the shallows long oars were laid on the sides although the crew didnt need them in this current a canopy had been stretched over poles at the aft with a charcoal stove just in front the crates were stacked in the middle of the raft and tightly lashed to boltholes that had been drilled in the sides the crewmen four to each raft were all tibetan with squat bodies full faces and skins darkened by the sun they sat crosslegged at the sides near the oars and enjoyed the respite given by this relatively benign stretch of river i never pictured tibet as having much of a river trade nicholai said to tasser you got that right how did you learn to do this crazy brits tasser answered theyre always going up or down something up mountains down rivers as long as its crazy and dangerous before the war a bunch of wiseguys from oxford wanted to be the first to go down the lekang they needed a river sherpa i was a kid needed the moola and thought what the hell did they make it down most of em all the way to luang prabang i dunno tasser said what do you mean nicholai asked tasser looked at him and smiled ive never been down this stretch of the river nicholai felt the water quicken beneath him and looked downriver where a cloud of mist suddenly appeared whats that he asked tasser took a map from his pocket and spread it out nicholai looked over his shoulder and the map appeared to be more of a picture a cartoon really of the river with drawings of tall peaks and midstream boulders tasser considered for a moment and then hollered over the increasing rush of water that would be the dragons throat the dragons tail the dragons throat tasser shouted pointing at his adams apple he looked at the map again and asked what the hell does level mean ya think a few seconds later he answered his own question holy shit the first fall was only twenty feet but it crashed onto a broad shelf of rock that would certainly smash the rafts to pieces nicholai felt the bow pitch forward grabbed on to a line and held on there was nothing else to do then they went over the edge they landed with a heavy impact and nicholai was sure that he would feel the raft break up beneath him the logs bounced and rolled but held together and the current swept them over the rock into a chute where the water was whirling in a violent circle just upstream of a second waterfall get to the oars tasser yelled and his men abandoned the relative safety of the line and scampered to man the oars nicholai could see why the circular current was pulling the raft sideways and if it went into the falls broadside it would surely capsize as it went over they had to right it so it entered the next fall bow first but the raft was spinning like a leaf in the wind where are the lifejackets nicholai hollered to tasser the what tasser hollered back the current spat them out but sideways the starboard side facing the waterfall and nicholai saw a large backcurrent a small wall of water coming toward them look out he yelled the backcurrent lifted the raft and pitched one of the aft oarsmen off the starboard side nicholai one hand on the line crawled back and tried to pull him out of the water but tasser yelled the oar get the oar goddamnit nicholai grabbed the oar just before it slipped into the water the crewman was pulled back into the circular current and nicholai saw him try to stay above water as the current spun him around and around like some malevolent funhouse ride pull tasser yelled nicholai sat down and pulled on the oar straining every muscle and sinew to try to pull the raft around they were almost straight when the bow went over the edge this fall was not as high they landed in a deep pool and the raft bobbed once before it was pulled into the next chute of water the flume raced to a narrow fall between two towers of rock the raft scraped the edge of the rock to the left bounced off and then slid over the low fall onto a shallow stretch that rushed over rocks that banged against the bottom downriver he saw a large column of what looked like smoke it wasnt smoke though nicholai knew that could only be mist from a large volume of water crashing over a very high waterfall pull to the side tasser yelled nicholai looked to his right where tasser was pointing toward a long eddy but the current was pulling them away and they had little time or space to make it over into the eddy and the crews were already exhausted he lifted his oar from the water as the crew on the port side pulled when the raft was pointed starboard both sides would row as hard as they could for their lives he took a few deep gulps of air and then at tassers order started to stroke it was only a small bump but it was enough nicholai had pulled himself up on the end of his stroke and the bump hit before he could settle back down and lifted him up and off the side of the raft the first thing he felt was the shock of the cold water as he went under he pulled himself to the surface then felt the mental shock of knowing that he was in the river and inexorably headed for the waterfall he had been in bad situations before while exploring narrow passages in caves during his happy years with friends in japan then the chambers had closed in and seemed to offer no way out or hed been trapped by underground streams the water hissing below him in the pitch black and hed enjoyed the danger so now he forced his mind to dismiss the terror and focus on survival the first thing to do was get turned around so he struggled successfully to get feetfirst into the current he didnt know what waited at the bottom of the fall but it was certainly better to encounter it with his feet instead of his head smashing his legs perhaps instead of his neck or skull he knew that he was dead anyway if the fall landed shallowly on rock but honor demanded that he do his best then he pressed his arms tightly to his sides and closed his legs to create as compact a vessel of himself as he could so his limbs wouldnt create levers that might tip him sideways and roll him akimbo over the falls he held his neck and head up out of the water until the last possible moment then took a deep breath his last he wondered and went over the edge the fall was long and violent the water battering him to try to knock him out of his posture but he held firm waiting for the landing that would shatter his body maim him or offer the next challenge then he felt the stillness of a pool and realized that hed survived the fall he looked back up and realized that hed plunged at least forty feet treading water to catch his breath he looked downstream and saw on the right edge both rafts pulled up on the shore they were in bad shape the canopy of the first raft was stoved in and several oars were broken the second raft looked little better its bow jagged like a broken tooth but both had made it through the dragons throat and miraculously the crates sat in the middle like cows lying down in the face of bad weather one of the crew standing on the edge saw him and started to point and yell as nicholai exhausted swam for the shore where he just lay on the rough stones unable to move thought you were a goner tasser said standing over him so did i glad you made it thank you yeah you have the rest of my dough on that sentimental note he pulled nicholai to his feet they spent the next three days resting repairing the damaged rafts and oars and perusing the rough map of the next stretch of the river this socalled map is useless nicholai said so tasser and nicholai walked downstream climbed a steep cliff on the right bank and confirmed their worst fear an enormous fall higher than the one that nearly killed them loomed just downstream we cant run that nicholai said nope they would have to go around it with only nine men a portage would be long and arduous but they had no choice so they went back and began the long task of disassembling the rafts and hewing poles with which to heft the crates this took two more days making an unplanned delay of five days so dwindling supplies became a concern with no villages in the wilderness of the lekang river gorges in which to buy food they would have to cut rations a serious problem with the increase in labor that the portage would extract but no one complained about these hardships when weighed against the terror of another run down worse rapids the men worked steadily and in two days they were ready to set out for three days they worked in relay teams hefting pulling dragging and pushing the rafts logs up the slope beside the massive waterfall then lowering them down using ropes wrapped around trees as counterweights then while two of the crewmen reassembled the rafts the other six men carried the heavy crates with their lethal cargo over the same route to the extent that one can enjoy grueling physical labor nicholai did so the battle against the physics of hauling heavy material up and down a mountain and the struggle against the limitations of his own body and spirit seemed simple and clean as opposed to the more underhanded conflicts of his mission no deception was involved in this just the direct application of muscle and sweat determination and brains nicholai found it to be a cleansing process even the sharp edge of hunger that came on the second day seemed only to sharpen his senses and purge the malaise that he only now realized had set in after leaving solange and the tibetan crewmen were a marvel of cheerfulness and stamina having begun their working lives as sherpas lugging heavy baggage on the slopes of the himalayas they were not daunted by this task and seemed to find the complexities of maneuvering the loads to be a pleasant intellectual as well as physical challenge they loved to solve the problems of weight and counterweight using complicated arrangements of ropes and knots that fascinated nicholai he resolved that if he survived this mission he would spend more time in the mountains and master the techniques of technical climbing at night the tibetans would build a fire brew strong pots of tea from the dwindling supply and make soup that got thinner each night still it was a good time resting sore muscles and listening to the tales of ghosts and spirits sage holy men and brave warriors that the crewmen would tell while tasser translated into colloquial american english then nicholai would sleep the sleep of the dead waking only just before dawn when the days good and hard work would begin again he was almost disappointed when after three days the portage was accomplished the rafts reassembled and the journey downriver could begin again the river was gentler below these falls jagged rocks and shallows with the occasional rapids still caused problems but in only two days tasser checked the cartoonmap and happily announced were out of goddamn china they were in the french colony of laos and the river changed its name from the lekang to the mekong in an almost mystical way the river itself seemed to recognize the change it broadened slowed and darkened with the collected silt brought all the way down from the himalayan foothills like us tasser observed brown and down from tibet the mountains that flanked the river became greener verdant with jungle vegetation and here and there a bamboo village its houses on stilts against the seasonal floods appeared suddenly around a bend of the twisting river they put in at one of these villages to buy food and nicholai realized that tasser knew a little more than he let on i dont know what you got in those goddamn crates tasser said and i dont want to know but if youre taking them where i think youre taking them keep your lips zipped these are hmong people and they dont much like commies so dont give them any of that comrade shit or they might take one of them curvy knives and lop off your head got it got it another thing tasser warned as he piloted the raft onto a sandy spot along the right side of the river turn a blind eye to what you see here he pointed across the river thats siam over there land of the thais also land of the poppy this here is prime opiumgrowing country and the river downstream from here is a highway for dope the hmong grow it so do the thais its how they feed their kids i understand youd better tasser said we smile we buy our groceries we get back on the water pronto nicholai stayed on the raft while tasser took two men and went to buy supplies naked hmong children happily dove off a rickety bamboo pier into the water the women in their unique black caps sat nearby kept a watchful eye and sneaked shy glances at the tall european sitting on the raft nicholai heard dogs barking in the village and the ubiquitous bleating of goats and cackling of chickens barely half an hour later tasser returned with mesh nets full of bananas and other fruits greens rice and smoked fish nicholai felt ashamed of his suspicions as tasser gave the order to shove off and the raft swirled back into the gentle current then the captain handed nicholai a bottle of clear liquid take a belt tasser said nicholai took a swallow and felt like his stomach lungs and brain were on fire good god man what is it laolao tasser answered hmong moonshine nicholai helped one of the crew build a fire in the charcoal stove and soon they had a delicious meal of rice fish and bananas then he took his turn at an oar and when relieved sat on the edge and enjoyed the beautiful verdant countryside the green mountains and limestone cliffs two days later they came into luang prabang nicholai cut an odd figure checking in to the small guesthouse his clothes were torn and mudstained his hair long and disheveled his face brown as a nut and weatherworn he ignored the desk clerks stare with an aristocratic insouciance and asked for the best room available preferably with a view of the river does monsieur have luggage monsieur does not will it be arriving from the airport perhaps probably not nicholai said he produced a handful of bills from his pants pocket and laid them on the counter passport nicholai handed over the passport indentifying him as michel guibert it was a calculated risk one that might send teletypes singing in beijing moscow and washington but nicholai doubted it luang prabang was a backwater even in indochina and there were probably no alarm bells here to be rung still french intelligence would no doubt have a presence here but nicholai was counting on that the clerk copied down the passport information and handed it back to nicholai with a key room has a charming view of the river would monsieur like a razor sent up yes please nicholai answered and coffee croissant and the most recent newspaper available if you will the clerk nodded with satisfaction clean and shaven nicholai sat on his small balcony and enjoyed the excellent croissant the pastry seemed at odds with the intense heat that was building in the late morning but nevertheless tasted good along with the cup of strong espresso it was all very french even as the file of saffronrobed young monks walked by on their way back from the ritual morning alms solicitations a main thoroughfare of the old laotian royal capital khem kong road ran along the riverbank and was lined with shops restaurants and french cafés a blend of odors steamed fish and crepes spoke redolently of the towns mixed culture ancient buddhist temples stood beside elegant french colonial manor houses the redtiled roofs of which would not have been out of place along the mediterranean sea instead of the banks of the mekong beautiful emerald green mountains rose across the brown muddy river it was a scene of great tranquility in sharp contrast to the shipment of lethal weapons waiting on the rafts just a few hundred yards upriver nicholai took another bite of the croissant and read his newspaper a weekold copy of the journal dextrêmeorient he hadnt seen the news in several months but was not surprised to see that little had changed negotiations to end the korean conflict dragged on the viet minh had defeated the french at a battle near hoa binh in the north a cambodian nationalist demanded that french forces leave the country then was forced to flee and was branded both a communist and an agent of the cia by the editorialist in saigon the puppet emperor bao dai welcomed a delegation from the french film industry and he almost missed it at first in the dull list naming the delegation françoise ariend michel cournoyer anise maurent solange picard solange was not in tokyo but in saigon as a member of a french film delegation interesting saigon he thought how interesting how coincidental haverford must think me a fool nicholai walked up the street to a clothier the heat of afternoon was on the air was moist with the promise of rain the dry season in southeast asia would soon be over the monsoons would be coming on with the temperature at least a hundred degrees and humid nicholais shirt was soaked with sweat by the time he went into the shop he bought three cotton shirts two pairs of linen trousers a white linen suit a pair of oxford shoes and a panama hat and had them sent back to his hotel then he found another shop and bought a decent suitcase now he could simply pack walk away from the suicide mission to take the weapons into the south of vietnam and go to saigon into the trap that the americans were setting with solange as bait he could see the gokang and the stones moving and he saw his way through but he couldnt and knew that he couldnt he had given his word to yu and he had to go and make contact with the viet minh agent nicholai sat in the back of a pedicab as it wound its way down sisavangvong road the cab dropped him off at the edge of an old luang prabang institution the night market an openair bazaar with hundreds of small stands selling balls of sweet sticky rice bits of fried fish steaming cups of tea and a few dozen delicacies that nicholai didnt recognize other stands offered delicate parasols brightly colored paper lanterns cotton shirts trousers sandals candles and little statues of buddha the rich smells sights and sounds were a heady contrast to the austerity of the long river journey the merchants loudly proclaimed the virtues of their wares or haggled with buyers the acrid smell of charcoal fires competed with the aromas of sizzling chili sauces in open woks and even under lantern light in the dark alleys the various merchandise combined to make a riotous panoply nicholai easily edged his way through the crowd at least a head taller than most of the shoppers he was nevertheless inconspicuous the laotians were used to the french colonials and nicholai looked and acted like one he came to a stand selling live birds the birds were pretty and much too small to eat choosing a bird with electric blue and green feathers he untied it and the bird flew into the night albeit without the buddhist prayer that freed birds were usually meant to convey nicholai strolled farther into the market drank a hot green tea made a few small purchases and then tried some fried fish in hot chili oil and coriander hed not quite finished it when a man sidled up and quietly said in french follow me they left the market through a narrow alley and nicholais nerves tingled in this potential trap but it was not unlike working through a tight chamber in a cave and he calmed his mind and let his senses guard for danger they emerged from the alley into a tight dirt street nicholai smelled the distinct aroma of opium as he followed the man into a ramshackle building it was dark inside the front room lit only by the glow of the pipes the smokers sitting or lying around the walls lost in their opium dreams didnt even look up but nicholais proximity sense alerted him the third opium smoker along the wall in the stained black shirt was there to kill him if need be nicholai grasped the small ivory letter opener with the carved elephant handle hed bought at the night market wangbadan nicholai said in cantonese son of a bitch he saw the flicker of recognition in the alleged viet minhs eyes before the man quickly recovered and asked in french what the ivory blade flashed out of nicholais sleeve and pressed against the neck of the supposed viet minh agent he said in cantonese if that man moves ill kill you the agent understood he looked at the opium smoker and slowly shook his head then he said to nicholai i didnt see you buy that thats right nicholai said where is the man that i was supposed to meet i am the man you nicholai pressed the point against his carotid artery i wont ask again dead nicholai felt more than saw the gun come out from under the opium smokers black shirt and he flicked the letter opener the blade went straight into the gunmans throat and he slumped to the floor the other binh xuyen took the chance and launched a knee strike at nicholais solar plexus he turned to deflect the blow then crossed his hands grabbed the mans head and jerked in both directions the neck snapped and the man went limp in his hands nicholai let him drop just as three men with machine pistols burst through the back door im impressed monsieur guibert the boss of the binh xuyen gang was physically unimpressive short and slight with a receding line of nevertheless jet black hair his left eye went off at an odd fortyfivedegree angle and it looked like the orbital bone around it had been smashed he wore a plain khaki linen shirt light khaki trousers and sandals over white socks now he contemplated nicholai for a moment and asked would you prefer to speak in french or chinese as you wish nicholai said in french do you know who i am the man asked in cantonese i imagine nicholai answered that youre with the binh xuyen i am not with the binh xuyen the small man said i am the binh xuyen bay vien bay nodded you should be flattered by my personal attention i usually delegate these errands but i was in town on business anyway so you appear to have killed two of my men monsieur guibert nicholai knew that this was not the time to attempt a retreat to back off would be to die generally speaking i do kill people who try to kill me first they disobeyed instructions then bay said i had hoped to accomplish this without violence simply have you sell your wares to what you thought were viet minh pay you your money and let you go on your way but now bay shook his head with what appeared to be regret please understand its only business nicholai knew that this development had rearranged the stones on the gokang his promise to colonel yu to deliver the weapons to the viet minh now seemed impossible to redeem and his own death wouldnt change the outcome he could almost hear otakesamas gentle counsel when the immediate situation is untenable nikfro what do you play for time otakesama play for the long game yes poor business nicholai answered how so fifty rocket launchers will make the binh xuyen very powerful nicholai said so what would a hundred make you or two hundred bay vien scoffed you cant get that many not if im dead nicholai agreed he could virtually see bay vien thinking as well he might the binh xuyen would eventually have to fight the militias other gangs and perhaps the viet minh they might even have to go up against their current ally bao dai and his regular vietnamese troops in the future these weapons could decide the outcome of a battle fought in the streets of saigon and bay viens thinking nicholai contemplated will determine if i live or die ellis haverford always liked saigon in the guise of an employee at the united states information service he had been in and out of the city quite often over the years and considered it a second home to him it was the ideal blend of the best of paris and the best of asiathe food the architecture the wine the fashion the women all without the gray winters and accompanying existential angst that often plagued the city on the seine saigon was a sophisticated town with an easy tolerance for viceits casinos were honest and wellrun its brothels cheerful hospitable and famed for the staggering variety of their courtesans and he liked the citys bars saigon was a great town for booze and boozy conversations the escalating war brought reporters from all over the world always good for a laugh and a little inside information always available for latenight card games and earlymorning bloody marys besides haverford liked the vietnamese he loved their kind demeanor respected their long struggle for independence admired how they had adopted the best of western culture and adapted the worst still he hoped to spend as little time as possible there praying that the cold warriors back in washington would not step into the shoes of the french he had fought in vietnam before and he didnt want to fight there ever again now he waited for nicholai hel hoping that he would arrive with the spring rains nicholai took a separate pedicab down to the river got off a half mile from where the rafts were docked and walked the rest of the way tasser shone a bright lamp on him as he approached that you mike and if it wasnt nicholai stepped onto the raft a truck will be pulling up anytime now well transfer the cargo not a minute too soon for me tasser said these fucking hmong give me the heebiejeebies what will you do now back to the high mountains tasser answered see if any more crazy brits yanks or frogs want to climb to the top of the world look for me in the photos ill be the guy they dont name a pair of headlights came down the road tassers men offloaded the cargo onto the shore nicholai shook tassers hand thank you for everything its been a genuine pleasure same here tasser gathered his crew and disappeared into the darkness nicholai walked toward the truck bay vien sat in the front passenger seat the truck rolled out of town in the morning nicholai in the front seat beside bay vien where are we going nicholai asked bay pointed east across the river up toward the mountains why you ask too many questions bay answered sucking on a cigarette he was irritable unused to the early hour and the jostling of the truck besides the binh xuyen boss wasnt thrilled that nicholai insisted on coming along with the weapons instead of just meeting him in saigon until i get my money nicholai had said i stay with my merchandise i dont pay bay answered until your merchandise is safely delivered so i guess youre stuck with me now nicholai lit a cigarette of his own and sat back enjoying the relative cool of the early morning and the streaking red shafts of daylight coming over the hills young boys were already herding buffalo down to the river for a drink and a bath and women were collecting buckets of the muddy water to bring back to their village they waited twenty minutes for the ferry to return from the other side of the river then the heavy truck carefully drove onto the floating platform thick ropes on the ferry ran through large eyebolts and then out to the harnesses of elephants one on each side a young lao mahout kicked his elephant in the flank and the two animals started across the river pulling the ferry along with them the ferry came to a shuddering halt on the opposite bank two large sheets of corrugated tin were thrown down for traction and the truck rumbled up the slope and onto a dirt road that cut up through the forest they climbed for five hours slowly making their way up the switchbacks into the mountains where limestone cliffs punctuated the otherwise green hills fields of dry mountain rice broke up the jungle while other scorched patches told of primitive slashandburn agriculture men women and children most of them wearing loosefitting black jerseys baggy black trousers and black turbans were out on the burned fields hoeing away the debris and getting the rich red soil ready for planting small shaggy ponies grazed the edges of the burned fields who lives here nicholai asked risking conversation more awake bay was a little more gregarious the meo they came down from sichuan two thousand years ago nicholai saw the rice fields and small patches of potatoes and other vegetables then as they climbed higher he noticed a different crop poppies the meo are also florists nicholai asked dryly bay chuckled the viet minh used to control the opium crop now we do i guess its caused some resentment an hour later the road leveled onto a valley and then a broad plateau that led into a town mostly wooden shacks and a few shops clustered around a few brickandtile buildings and an enormous colonial structure that looked as if it had been some kind of administrative center the old french governors palace bay said where are we nicholai asked xieng khouang bay answered its about the only town up here the french built it back in the s then the japs took it when they got chased out the pathet lao had it for a while until the meo helped the french take it back why did they do that money bay answered why does anyone do anything they drove through town without stopping a mile outside of town they came to a large airstrip that had recently been bulldozed out of the terrain an americanmade dc with french military markings sat on the strip guarded by french paratroopers other soldiers along with meo men loaded crates from trucks and carts into the cargo hold this you didnt see bay warned he got out of the truck nicholai slid out behind him and followed him across the dirt landing strip to where a paratroop captain stood supervising the loading the captain saw bay vien walked toward him held him by the shoulders and kissed him on both cheeks then he noticed nicholai captain antoine signavi michel guibert they shook hands signavi stood just a shade shorter than nicholai he wore crisp camouflage gear jump boots and the vermilion beret of a paratrooper i have some beer on ice about the best i can do up here he led them just off the airstrip to a canvas canopy with a portable table and three stools an orderly reached into an ice chest came out with three bottles of tiger beer opened them and set them on the table signavi held up his bottle santé santé nicholai echoed three more weeks signavi said and this runway will be a river of mud unusable the road up here too very difficult ill be glad to be back in saigon he removed his beret exposing a thick head of black hair i have some cargo bay said to put on this flight its okay sure signavi answered were light this trip and two additional passengers you and you signavi asked bay nodded signavi looked hesitant in my area of business nicholai said discretion is of the utmost importance i see nothing and i say less ill vouch for him bay said you can understand signavi said that this is all sensitive were fighting a war someone has to pay for it and the reds in paris are unwilling to do it so one holds ones nose and does what is necessary he jutted his chin toward the opium being loaded onto the plane nicholai shrugged who am i to judge indeed signavi said his nuanced tone leaving no doubt that while he was going to tolerate this gunrunner for practical purposes he nevertheless found it distasteful nicholai wasnt willing to allow the implied insult to pass he asked signavi is that a corsican name guilty signavi said napoleon and i we both sought our futures in the french army we take off first thing in the morning ill arrange beds for tonight i hope you will both join me for dinner nicholai never ceased to marvel at the french ability to dine well under any circumstances here at a secret airstrip in the middle of the laotian highlands emerged a lunch of vichyssoise cold roasted guinea fowl and a very acceptable salad made from local greens all washed down with a decent white wine dining accomplished signavi led them to a large barracks tent surrounded by concertina wire his proximity sense woke him he lay still and listened to the sharp clickclick as the wirecutters snipped the fence then to the sound of a man crawling bay vien was sound asleep on his bed by the tent wall nicholai dove just as the blade slashed through the tent he knocked bay off the bed onto the floor then got up and went through the tent door the wouldbe assassin was already running back toward the fence a klaxon sounded and a searchlight swept the ground nicholai heard alsatian dogs bark and then one burst across the stockade ground after the man the man leapt for the fence and became entangled in the concertina wire he twisted in the wire a grotesque acrobatic act as the machinegun bullets hit him signavi clad in satin pajamas a pistol in his hand ran out and a moment later bay vien came out of the tent and looked at the corpse hanging from the fence viet minh bay said he turned to nicholai you saved my life guibert just looking out after my interests nicholai answered he walked back into the tent and lay back down bay came in im in your debt he said forget it i wont bay said its a matter of honor nicholai understood colonel yu knocked on the door of lius office and received permission to enter liu looked up from the stack of papers on his desk yes the viet minh agent who was supposed to meet hel was killed ah so hel didnt make the rendezvous obviously theres a report yu said unverified that he went with the binh xuyen stay on top of it liu ordered yu left the room deeply troubled if hel was with the binh xuyen he was either a prisoner or had willingly betrayed him the plane followed the mekong south nicholai watched out the window as the broad brown river flowed out of the mountains down into the plains of cambodia then broke into multiple tributaries as it entered the delta in southern vietnam looking down at the endless stretch of green rice paddies crossstitched with irrigation canals and dotted with innumerable villages nicholai knew that he had made the right decision to deal with bay vien blockhouses and guard towers rose every two or three kilometers above the paddies and nicholai could spot military convoys patrolling the main roads not only was the foreign legion thick on the ground but also the wellarmed militias whose arms the french purchased from the proceeds of the opium in the planes cargo hold the french army bought the opium from the meo purchasing their loyalty as well then the army sold the crop to the binh xuyen who monopolized the opium traffic in saigon the french used the profits to pay the militias and mountain tribes to fight a guerrilla war in the countryside while the binh xuyen held saigon for them we would never have made it through all this nicholai thought with the shipment of arms it was the right thing to do he had a dull headache that throbbed with the pulse of the engines and was exacerbated by the engine fumes the propellers were noisy and the plane rattled and bumped and he was glad when he saw the sprawling metropolis of greater saigon appear below but the plane banked southeast away from the city and down the coast and nicholai saw what looked like a military base vung tau signavi shouted over the noise cap stjacques the plane made a rapid descent and landed on the military airstrip trucks were waiting and binh xuyen troopers in green paramilitary uniforms hopped out and quickly loaded the crates of opium and rocket launchers im off to a bath and a decent drink signavi said he shook nicholais hand perhaps ill see you in saigon i would enjoy that good see you there a black limousine pulled up two troopers armed with machine pistols got out and escorted bay and nicholai into the back of the car and it quickly drove off the airstrip where is the cargo going nicholai asked the opium to our processing plant in cholon bay answered the weapons somewhere safe until ive been paid nicholai said the rocket launchers are still my property and as such i have a right to know where they are bay nodded fair enough theyre going to the rung sat the swamp of the assassins colorful its the base of the binh xuyen bay said smiling remember we started as river pirates your property will be quite safe there when do i get paid nicholai asked do you have an account in saigon i prefer cash as you wish bay said its nothing to me ill arrange for payment tomorrow meet me at my casino le grand monde what do i have as security bay turned and glared at him my word saigon was beautiful nicholai thought the citys sobriquet as the pearl of the orient was perfectly justified as he rode in a blue renault taxi down the rue catinat the broad boulevard lined with plane trees studded with sidewalk cafés bars restaurants expensive shops and exclusive hotels seemed a perfect blend of french and asian culture as if someone had chosen the best of both and placed them in happy harmony side by side vietnamese police in their distinctive white uniforms stoically struggled to manage the swirling citroën and renault autos cyclopousses vespa scooters and swarms of bicycles that competed for the rightofway in a chaos that was a true mixture of the french and asian styles of driving honking horns jingling bells and shouts of goodnatured abuse in french vietnamese and chinese contributed to an urban cacophony child street vendors darted and dodged through the traffic to sell newspapers bottles of orange soda or cigarettes to customers momentarily stuck in a jam or sitting at a café table or just walking down the busy sidewalks the women were magnificent nicholai thought slim tiny vietnamese in tight silk ao dais stopped to window shop while the elegant french colons dressed in fashion only a year removed from paris runways strode in their slow longlegged gait to the unabashed admiring stares of the café denizens the cab pulled up to the continental hotel a broad white colonial building in the beauxarts style with its arched windows and pedimented doors it was the apero hour that time in the late afternoon when the privileged classes sought refuge from the heat and the days work and all the smarter types gathered on the continentals broad café terrace that flanked the boulevard just across catinat from the usis office the continental was a convenient place to have a drink exchange information and intelligence to such an extent that the café was nicknamed radio catinat or perhaps to find a companion to share a table now or a bed later ellis haverford looked through the antigrenade netting to observe the new arrival as nicholai unfolded himself from the backseat of the small car he was dressed like a classic southeast asian colon in the clothes that he had bought in luang prabang vietnamese bellboys in short white jackets and black trousers ran out to take his luggage and take it into the lobby im glad to see you nicholai haverford thought he had been reasonably sure that hel would come to saigon but it was good to know he was right nicholai walked past a rather surprising bronze statue of napoleon to the reception desk monsieur guibert the métis clerk smiled he had received a call from bay vien himself and was appropriately obsequious welcome to the continental it is our pleasure to have you thank you your room is ready the clerk said and monsieur mancini invites you to have a drink with him if it is convenient for you in the bar six oclock please relay my honored acceptance nicholai said signavi had apparently wasted no time informing his corsican colleagues of his arrival in the city mathieu mancini had come to saigon after world war i married a wealthy vietnamese woman and bought the continental reputed to be the head of lunion corse the corsican mafia in saigon he was a confidant of bao dais and a friend to bay vien a bellhop took nicholai to his room on the fourth and top floor it was large and highceilinged with whitewashed walls and simple but elegant wooden furniture french doors opened onto a small private balcony behind iron grillwork a ceiling fan circulated the humid air providing some relief nicholai tipped the bellboy and then was glad for some privacy and solitude he called room service for an iced beer drew a steaming hot bath and luxuriated in it for half an hour it was good to be in a city again and experience some luxury and sophistication that he hadnt known since shanghai the contrast between the nearscalding water and the cold beer was a sharp delight and nicholai allowed himself to give in to the realm of the senses for a few minutes then he evaluated the go board he had advanced his position im safely out of china he thought have funds or will have tomorrow and am in saigon with bay vien as a patron and protector good and good and solange is likely somewhere in the city better but my position is nevertheless precarious haverford is sitting in the bar across the street apparently unconcerned with being discovered he knows im alive and where i am beijing and moscow will soon know if they dont already and might well send people to kill or kidnap me of the two the chinese are the greater threat as the russians will have a problem getting agents into saigon the guibert cover has a short life i need a new identity and quickly if im ever to get out of saigon and before i leave i have things to accomplish but all that is several moves off he reminded himself the next part of the game is to see what mancini wants the corsican greeted him warmly monsieur guibert mancini said he kissed nicholai on both cheeks patted him on the shoulders and continued welcome welcome mancini smelled of cologne and tobacco thank you monsieur mancini call me mathieu please im michel the continentals owner was short but looked immensely powerful barrelchested with the big sloping shoulders of a former boxer a few strands of silver glistened at the temples of thick black hair that was slicked straight back his offwhite cotton suit and monogrammed white shirt were beautifully cut and he saw that nicholai noticed ill introduce you to my tailor mancini said vietnamese guy at the botany shop just down catinat i would appreciate that youre new to saigon first time here youre in for a treat mancini said its a beautiful city beautiful so many pleasures on offer and which nicholai wondered are you going to offer me pastaga mancini asked using marseille slang for pastis he searched nicholais eyes for any blink of incomprehension i could do with a pastis nicholai answered solange had covered the word with him many times and familiarized him with the thick yellow liqueur a close cousin of absinthe ah youre from the south mancini said montpellier nicholai said deciding to end the honeymoon but you knew that already i know everything young man mancini said amiably come on then i wont insult you with the crap we serve the colons the real stuff is out here as he led nicholai out of the bar into a private garden mancini said me im from corsica originally but you already knew that did you also know that corsicans make the best assassins in the world is that right nicholai answered he wondered what the ninja might have to say about it take it as a fact and a warning nicholai thought they walked into a narrow strip of garden where several older men sat around two white wroughtiron tables the men all wore white shortsleeved shirts and either white or light khaki loosefitting trousers a couple of them sported broadbrimmed hats for protection against the sun nicholai knew that he was looking at lunion corse mancini took off his jacket draped it on the back of a chair sat down and gestured for nicholai to do likewise this is my newest guest mancini said as nicholai took a chair michel guibert he introduced each of the five men antonucci guarini ribieri sarti luciani each of whom offered a hand with a gruff nod mancini filled nicholais glass with pastis the men looked on as nicholai took the carafe of water set on the table and poured some in to dilute his drink then he raised the glass said salut and sipped his familiarity with the pastaga seemed to relax the group who sat back in the chairs drank and took the sun so mancini said what brings you to saigon business nicholai answered how is your father asked antonucci antonucci looked to be in his early fifties and was as skinny as mancini was stout but the deeply tanned forearms under his rolledup sleeves looked like iron and despite his casual but expensive clothes the man looked like he could be a day laborer hes well nicholai responded you know him weve done business antonucci said in the past well nicholai said raising his glass heres to the future they drank a round then antonucci raised his glass toward mancini and said to my new neighbor mancini explained to nicholai after years of trying i just managed to acquire the majestic hotel next door to antonuccis nightclub your nightclub nicholai asked la croix du sud antonucci said then added pointedly in the corsican quarter on the harbor where all the imports and exports come and go youd like his club mancini said to nicholai one of those pleasures we talked about come tonight antonucci said tonight nicholai asked antonucci leaned across the table and looked nicholai full in the face tonight a little while later mancini and antonucci went out the back gate and strolled across the broad opera square on the other side the saigon opera house loomed in all its french colonial glory the other corsicans had drifted home it was that hour the hour of the pipe and these longtime residents of saigon had acquired many local habits what do you think mancini asked smart young man antonucci said pausing for a moment to relight his cigar maybe we can make some money with him they walked across the square quiet now in the torpid hour before the cool of evening would bring out young lovers old strollers people looking for relaxation and those searching for excitement in his lifetime antonucci had seen many things he had started life as a shoeless shepherd but soon decided that a life of barefoot labor and drudgery was not for him so he hopped a freighter to indochina jumped ship in saigon and within two years turned the gaggle of girls he pimped into a prosperous brothel he used those proceeds to buy the croix du sud the southern cross which turned a profit of its own but really served to launder the money he made with mancini smuggling heroin and gold into marseille they bought the heroin directly from the french army bay vien bought the bulk of it but la corse purchased the surplus the profits were enormous even after the hefty cut that went to bao dai they used the money to buy yet more clubs restaurants and hotels mancini had the continental and now the majestic luciani owned the palace it wouldnt be long before the corsicans had a monopoly on saigons hosting business their children or at least their grandchildren would be restaurateurs and hoteliers instead of dope and currency smugglers it was a good life and he had survived the french then the japanese briefly the british who were fools anyway and then the french again now the french desperate for allies turned a blind eye to the heroin and the corsicans had forged a working relationship with the binh xuyen and bao dai all this could end if the communists won and took over the country but still antonucci thought he could work out an accommodation with them asia was asia and life would go on as usual communist or no men would still want women and money corsica had been conquered by everybody greeks romans arabs turks normans french germans and the corsicans were used to working out a way of living with all of them it was a national trait an innate talent but now the americans were edging out the french and that was a different story les amerloques the crazy americans were impractical puritanical and moralistic they would seek to dump bao dai and put in their own man sweep the carpet clean and now this young guibert had turned up and the rumor was that he had sold a shipment of stolen american arms to bay vien we should find out more about this guibert use the belgian dwarf i cant think of his name de lhandes mancini said odd little fellow but he seems to sniff out everything useful very useful guibert might be just what he claims to be the heir to his familys gunrunning business but then again perhaps he is an agent of french intelligence the deuxième bureau sdece or perhaps the sûreté or does he serve the americans as so much of the world seems to do these days maybe he is simply a young man on the make in which case we can make some money together i already did mancini answered even before he arrived the dwarf says that he appears to be who he says he is bay viens people say the same thing i had his room searched while we were having pastaga we shall see antonucci thought he looked at mancini and uttered the ancient words per tu amicu per tu amicu mancini ritually responded for your friendship his room had been tossed carefully and professionally nicholai observed but tossed nevertheless before leaving the room he had plucked a hair from his head and placed it across two drawers on his bureau and now the hair was gone it didnt matter they would find nothing they werent supposed to find had mancini ordered it probably although it could have been the french who had a veritable alphabet soup of police and intelligence services in saigon none of whom were known to be overly respectful of privacy and the corsican mob expects my presence at la croix du sud tonight for what purpose to be grilled seduced observed threatened perhaps assassinated again it didnt matter to complete his assignment he would have to do business in saigon and the corsicans had made it very clear that he couldnt do business in saigon without doing business with them leave it to later he told himself you have something else to do now he splashed some water on his face to wipe off the sweat and the slightly dizzying effect of the pastis then went downstairs and out onto the street rue catinat was amber in the late dusk as the streetlights came on nicholai took a moment to orient himself on one end of the boulevard was the harbor on the other end the distinctive twin spires of the cathedral de notre dame a fiveblock walk took him to a shop called international philately the man behind the counter was a turbaned sikh the three shelves of the glass counter held frames of postage stamps most of them rare many of them expensive how may i help you sir i was hoping nicholai said using the code that yu had given him to contact the viet minh that you might have a mythen blue or green sir green green meant that he was under no immediate danger and that it was safe to proceed i will need to check in the back please thank you the man was gone for less than a minute and returned with a thin glassine envelope he carefully opened it and showed nicholai the block of stamps nicholai held it up to the desk lamp for inspection and said yes ill have them five hundred and forty piastres please nicholai paid him the sikh returned the stamps to the glassine envelope sealed it and then slipped it into a larger padded envelope that he handed to nicholai nicholai put the envelope into his jacket pocket and left he stopped at a newspaper kiosk bought that days edition of the journal dextrêmeorient and a packet of cigarettes nationales then went farther down the street found a table at a café called la pagode and ordered a beer he opened his paper read for a moment until the beer wonderfully cold arrived then he took out the envelope and using the paper to shield his hands from view opened it and read what was written on the inside flap of the larger envelope one oclock tomorrow go to sarreaus pharmacie buy two packets of enterovioform then walk to the neptuna swimming pool and wait vietnamese women stunningly elegant wrapped in silk strolled slowly by shy but fully aware of their effect then there were the métis the mixed heritage of asia and europe impossibly beautiful with their golden complexions and almond eyes which in their glint seemed to say that east and west can definitely meet and that it is indeed possible to have the best of both worlds and the occasional colon woman with blonde hair like solange nicholai felt a tinge of guilt along with the physical stirring but if the coming of night signaled a certain sexual excitement it also meant danger and the vietnamese police and french army patrols also came out a prosaic reminder that this beautiful city was also a city at war the restaurants on the boulevard sported antigrenade screens and the eyes of the police showed not the usual boredom of merely walking the beat but an alertness to genuine threat the binh xuyen rode up and down the street in their green jeeps a few with machine guns mounted on the back nicholai finished his beer left a few piastres and headed out bernard de lhandes found the saigon chief of sdece in his office service de documentation extérieure et de contreespionage only the french bureaucracy de lhandes thought could come up with that title sans prélude de lhandes took the bottle of cassis from the desktop helped himself to a glass and folded his thin frame into a chair the air around the desk was thick with smoke and colonel raynals ashtray was already overflowing raynal was a fat man with dark heavy rings under his eyes de lhandes thought that both conditions came from his spending countless hours behind his desk smoking cigarettes and eating bad food as he went over the stacks of reports that came through every day if you were charged with keeping up with all the espionage in saigon you were charged with a lot theres a new player in town de lhandes said the corsicans had asked him to find out what he could about this guibert and de lhandes was in the business of buying and selling information if he could do both at the same time all the better raynal sighed there were already too many old players in town a new one was the last thing he needed and who would that be something called a michel guibert de lhandes said he turned up at the continental raynal resisted the bait probably just some businessman probably de lhandes agreed as he helped himself to another drink and one of raynals cigarettes but he joined the corsicans for their afternoon pastis raynal sighed again a true parisian he despised corsicans as a matter of social duty and resented that his job forced him to at least tolerate if not actively cooperate with them here in saigon what do they want with this guibert was it it was de lhandes said and who knows who does know de lhandes pondered what lunion corse is ever up to it has its greasy fingers into every pie he slumped a little more into the chair and contemplated the slow circulation of the ceiling fan raynal had a fondness for the belgian dwarf and he was useful a few piastres here and there a few chips at the casinos a girl tossed in occasionally it was little enough and raynal needed assets just now especially the sort that warned him of newcomers operation x could we have come up with a less creative name was running smoothly and nothing must be allowed to interfere with that he thought if x failed we could very well lose the war with it indochina and with that any vestiges of a french empire personally he didnt give a damn he would much rather be drinking at a civilized boîte in montparnasse but professionally it mattered to him a great deal his job was to defeat the viet minh insurgency in the south and if that meant distasteful operations like the certainly distasteful x then cest la guerre and de lhandes brought old news signavi had already called to report that this guibert had apparently sold weapons to bay vien and had witnessed xs operation in laos raynal had questioned signavis judgment in allowing guibert to actually fly in with the opium shipment but signavi answered that bay vien had given him little choice de lhandes yes would you mind going around and having a drink or something with this guibert raynal asked sound him out if youd like patrice please of course raynal opened a desk drawer pulled out a used envelope and slid it across the desk for your expenses de lhandes took the money xue xin clipped a vine away from the stone and looked up to see a novice monk approaching what is it he asked unhappy to be interrupted i have a message for you well what is it i am instructed to tell you the boy said looking puzzled that the go stones are pearls thank you the boy stood there you may go xue xin said he returned to his work and smiled nicholai hel was in saigon diamond received the cable and went straight to singletons office he cooled his heels in the waiting room for a good forty minutes until the receptionist told him he could go in the old man didnt look up from the briefing book that he was reading yes hel is in saigon now singleton looked up really the boss was in one of his moods in which every response came in the form of a singleword interrogative diamond continued sir he seems to have arrived on a french military flight with a shipment of weapons rumored to be rocket launchers that information made singleton somewhat more expansive where did the flight originate xk would that be an initialization of xieng khouang yes sir singleton thought for a moment well thats not good no it isnt it was especially not good diamond thought as he hadnt received this information from haverford but from signavi who had phoned him shortly after hel left cap stjacques the frenchman had asked him to find out everything he could about this michel guibert signavi was worried about guiberts alleged prior relationship with the viet minh especially with the agent ai quoc signavis vietnamese special forces troops had been hunting ai quoc for months to no avail who is in possession of the weapons now singleton asked the bx diamond answered seeing singletons annoyed look he added the binh xuyen hel is creative thats one word for it do you have a better word in mind no sir singleton sat back and thought this hel person is really quite remarkable he decided remarkable unpredictable and dangerous take care of it singleton said what should i tell haverford singleton pondered hels remarkable escape from beijing why tell him anything he went back to reading the briefing book diamond stood there for a couple of seconds before figuring out that hed been dismissed feeling the receptionists contemptuous look on his back he hurried out of the office and into the elevator discovered that he was in a sweat and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand then he realized that it was all working out hel would finally be terminated and but what if hel talked to haverford about what he had seen in laos and what if singleton ever found out that he left the office and booked himself on a military flight to saigon the supposedly brilliant hel had walked right into his trap cities nicholai pondered as he walked along boulevard bonard are like women of a certain age the evening masks the signs of aging smoothes over lines shades decay replicates the golden glow of young years so it was in saigon which at night became a lady in a basic black dress with diamonds around her neck haverford was doubtless a fine intelligence agent but he made a damn poor street operative and his clumsy efforts to follow nicholai were almost comical nicholai quickly grew bored of the game however and literally turned on him near the clock tower outside the central marketplace he looked to be alone but nicholai scanned the crowd for signs of other agents it would be almost impossible to tell he had to admit they could be mixed among any of the shoppers or merchants in the busy pavilion but he looked for the overly watchful the purposefully disinterested or anyone who made even glancing eye contact with haverford nicholai eased into the crowd circled and came up behind him dont turn around nicholai said and walk easy haverford said but he kept walking nevertheless he took the offensive where have you been ive been worried about you after setting me up to be killed im touched i dont know what happened in beijing haverford said we had an extraction team in place and then you just went off the radar you had an assassination team in place what are you talking about haverford asked as they walked past stands selling everything from cold soup to silk parasols if something went wrong in beijing it had nothing to do with us but haverford had to wonder was it possible that stupid bastard diamond had coopted the extraction team in an attempt to terminate hel what are you thinking he asked himself of course its possible and now hel blames you nicholai herded him out onto the street boulevard de la somme was busy with evening traffic if haverford was going to try anything it would have been in the market you can turn around haverford a look of hurt innocence in his eyes turned to face him you have this all wrong i dont know what happened back there maybe chinese intelligence made you somebody flipped i dont know how did you get you owe me money nicholai said a new passport and certain addresses in the united states ill forgive the monetary debt but there it is haverford thought hel had done just what i figured hed do amazing and characteristic nicholai did you bring those weapons into i will require the passport and the addresses of course haverford said theres no problem with that the sooner the better in fact you have to go underground nick the whole world is looking for you nicholai suspected that by underground haverford meant under the ground but in either case had little choice but to go along how soon can you get me the addresses and the papers tomorrow haverford answered or the next day at the latest ill set up a meeting point ill tell you when and where nicholai said then he asked where is solange i dont know why dont lie to me i dont like it nicholai snapped you brought her here knowing i would come you have it all wrong nicholai yes i had beijing all wrong too didnt i he saw a cyclopousse coming down the street flagged it down and moved haverford out to the curb get in i dont get in haverford got in when he turned back around hel had disappeared yu received the message from saigon hel had made contact you are an interesting man nicholai hel he thought haverford sat in the back of the cyclopousse and contemplated the state of nicholai hels mind had he come to saigon for solange or for other reasons and if so what were they as for solange how and why had she come to saigon and what was she doing he recalled singletons orders back in washington youre clever young men lure him in well it looks like we both did nicholai felt at ease in cholon the chinese quarter of the city it reminded him of a damper poorer shanghai in the old days the little stands and small shops were the same the neon signs the same the smells of cooking over charcoal the incense wafting from temples the shouts the laughter the crowding it all reminded him that the chinese were great wanderers pilgrims who took their culture with them and replicated their old cities in the new he walked along lao tu street the main thoroughfare and felt right at home cholon was reputed to be dangerous at night particularly for a kweilo but nicholai had never felt threatened even in the worst slums of shanghai and he didnt feel in jeopardy here even as he turned off the street and walked up narrow alleys into a neighborhood of fourstory tenements again they all looked the same rectangular wooden structures with tiny balconies from which laundry was hung men in sleeveless tshirts leaned against the railings smoking cigarettes women inside yelled domestic questions in an attempt to engage their husbands in at least some form of conversation on the street itself young toughs in brightly colored shirts and tight slacks gathered on the corners watching for opportunities but didnt see one in the tall colon who walked as if he knew where he was going and what he was doing and he greeted them in chinese as he walked past they left him alone nicholai found the address he was looking for the tiny lobby reeked of stale opium smoke nicholai walked up the creaking slanting staircase to the second floor the hallway was narrow and slanted as if it was tired and wanted to lie down a door opened and a woman clad in the tight red silk dress of a prostitute looked at him for a moment then continued down the hall nicholai knocked on the door of room no one answered he knocked twice more then opened the unlocked door leotov sat dozing in a rattan chair by the small window the room was sweltering and tight and leotovs bare chest was shiny with sweat he wore a pair of khaki trousers and sandals his face was sallow and he hadnt shaved for several days the opium pipe was in his lap he opened his eyes and saw nicholai his eyes were yellow and runny but wide in the dreamlike state of the opium addict where the hell have you been he muttered in russian i thought you were probably dead there were moments when we shared that opinion ive been here for weeks leotov said bitterly clearly blaming his opium habit on nicholais lack of promptness i was detained nicholai answered i didnt count on being so seriously wounded it delayed me by weeks nevertheless i apologize it is good of you to have waited leotov slowly pulled himself up from the chair and shuffled around the room as if looking for something but unable to remember what or where it was you dont know what its been like he whined being on the run having to hide in this hovel never knowing when i took recourse in the local vice nicholai could virtually smell the fear and paranoia coming off him i see that superior bastard leotov spat you and him both superior bastards the him nicholai supposed referred to the late yuri voroshenin but he was already bored with leotov do you have them i have them leotov said as arranged in their encounter in beijing leotov had taken voroshenins passport and personal papers including his deposit book at the banque de lindochine in saigon where the russian had not only an account but a safety deposit box so im looking arent i he shoved aside some clothes on the floor and came up with a small leather portfolio that he held up in triumph here you go heres your precious papers bastards the both of you nicholai took the portfolio and flipped through it voroshenins passport several bankbooks scribbled notes wheres my money nicholai took bills from his pocket and handed them to leotov wheres the rest of it leotov demanded our arrangement nicholai reminded him was onethird now the rest when i successfully gain access to the safety deposit box the documents looked authentic but there was no telling until they were put to use when will that be leotov asked tomorrow ill meet you somewhere i can barely get organized to make it out of this room you get out to buy opium dont you nicholai asked a boy comes leotov chuckled room service i should kill him nicholai thought that would be the smart thing to do and perhaps the kind thing as well an opium addict is a loose cannon a mentally incontinent creature who will open his mouth and tell anything to anyone he doubted that leotov could in fact make it across the river to collect the rest of his fee for delivering voroshenins documents but a deal was a deal i can wire you funds here if you prefer a neighborhood bank if i prefer leotov mumbled if i prefer where is that damn boy do you happen to have the time i seem to have misplaced my watch nicholai knew the watch had been misplaced at the pawnshop or simply taken by the opium delivery boy or any other resident of the flophouse while leotov was in an opium dream he looked at his watch and answered eightthirty where is that boy leotov asked doesnt he know i need i need that money to get out of this shithole find a safe place not looking over my shoulder every second i recommend costa rica nicholai said leotov wasnt listening he sank back into his chair and stared out the window nicholai took the bills clutched in his hand and stuffed them into his trouser pocket giving him at least a chance of retaining them then nicholai took his leave he walked past the boy coming up the stairs the french saxophone player licked her lips glanced at nicholai and then wrapped them around her mouthpiece and blew nicholai seated at a frontrow table at la croix du sud couldnt miss the unsubtle gesture smiled back and sipped his brandy and soda the club specialty the allfemale band twelve frenchwomen in highcut sequined gowns were quite good at the glenn miller and tommy dorsey swing tunes then nicholai saw a gnomelike man a dwarf with long hair a red beard and an enormously corpulent stomach waddle his way toward the table on short bowed legs sweat poured down his fat cheeks and he looked like nothing more than a small hirsute locomotive about to derail no hunting there he said amiably as he sat down and jutted his chin toward the band thats antonuccis private reserve all twelve hes a virile little man the saxophone player eyed him again shes just being friendly nicholai said shell get a beating if she gets any friendlier de lhandes answered if you want a woman i dont the dwarf offered his hand bernard de lhandes formerly of brussels now consigned to this gustatory backwater where the charm of the women is in direct inverse ratio to the banality of the cuisine by the salty tears of saint timothy how a refined gourmand is expected to inflict a death from gluttony upon himself in this place ill never know although i try i try michel guibert nicholai lifted his glass santé santé comment ça va as well as can be expected the gnome huffed considering that i just dined if one wishes to call it dining at le givral and all i can say is that whoever conspired to commit the aioli sauce must have been born somewhere in the less enlightened regions of sicily presumably in some village whose benighted inhabitants are congenitally deprived of both taste buds and olfactory perception as the balance or rather the lack thereof of the garlic and olive oil smacked of sheer barbarism nicholai laughed which encouraged de lhandes to continue his diatribe the fact that i nevertheless managed to consume the entire boiled fish and a leg of lamb de lhandes said the mediocrity of which would have brought tears of boredom to the eyes of a perpetual shutin is a testament to both my tolerance and my gluttony the latter of which qualities i possess in far greater measure than the former de lhandes was pleasant company a stringer for several wire services he was based in saigon to cover the damn war over drinks he filled nicholai in on the status quo bellum the viet minh were strong in the north and that was where most of the fighting was they were weak in the south especially in the mekong delta area but still capable of staging guerrilla assaults in the countryside and terror attacks bombs grenades that sort of thing in saigon the legendary guerrilla leader ai quoc had gone into hiding but the rumor was that he was planning a new offensive in the delta on the political side bao dai was a french puppet far more interested in graft gambling and highpriced call girls than in attempting to actually govern much less win independence from france if you believed the rumors and de lhandes believed them he used the huge subsidies that the americans paid him to buy real estate in france he was also partnered with bay vien and the union corse getting a profitable cut from the opium that the former sold in vietnam and the latter shipped to france and then the united states in the form of heroin in exchange the two criminal organizations helped him keep order in saigon including cholon the chinese quarter on the other side of the saigon river home ground of the binh xuyen de lhandes said but the best food casinos and brothels and beyond that the rung sat de lhandes replied the swamp of the assassins there you never go mon pote or if you do you never come back the conversation lapsed as they sat back and enjoyed the rather sexy orchestra they werent alone in that at the bar a large and raucous group of what appeared to be offduty french soldiers looked on in appreciation grateful to see european women at other tables sat men who looked like they might be journalists or government workers or spies nicholai thought like de lhandes the stringer was subtle for a european he had gently tried to sound nicholai out find out what he was doing and nicholai had given him little or nothing beyond the fact that he was looking for business opportunities now de lhandes said drugs guns women and money im sorry you said you were looking for business opportunities de lhandes said the best opportunities in saigon are in running opium arms whores or currency he looked for nicholais reaction there was none the music ended and the band took a break a waiter came over to nicholai and said monsieur antonucci would like to see you in the back nicholai got up from his chair so did de lhandes the waiter shook his head him he said jutting his chin at nicholai not you de lhandes shrugged and then said im going out for a night in cholon if you care to join me i can be found at larcenciel any cabbie will know it i dont know de lhandes said well make a night of it a few drinks maybe some gambling at le grand monde my pal haverford is meeting me good man he says hes some sort of diplomat but of course hes a spy it sounds like fun nicholai said but i oh come along de lhandes said rumor is that bao dai himself will be there not a bad connection for a man hoping to set himself up in business here ill try nicholai said he followed the waiter to the back room nicholai sat down across the desk from antonucci you like my place the corsican asked its quite good yes nicholai answered the small backroom office was surprisingly cluttered somehow nicholai had expected a neater more businesslike atmosphere the desk was a shambles of documents letters old newspapers and overflowing ashtrays a lamp its shade stained with dead bugs hung over the desk one of antonuccis thugs a tall thick man leaned against the wall the bulge in his jacket doubtless intentional antonucci relit his cigar rolling it carefully around the flame of his lighter satisfied with the even burn he turned his attention back to nicholai and said youre a young man ambitious is that a problem antonucci shrugged maybe maybe not he waited for a response but nicholai knew that any response to such a wide opening gambit could only be a mistake so he sipped his brandy and waited for antonucci to move the next stone ambition is good in a young man antonucci said if he is mature enough to know that with ambition should come respect youth thinks it invents the world nicholai said maturity respects the world that it finds i didnt come to saigon to change it or to disrespect its traditions monsieur antonucci i am glad to hear that antonucci said tradition is that no one conducts certain kinds of trade in saigon without paying respect to certain other people so nicholai thought the union corse already knows about my deal with the binh xuyen did bay vien inform them or was it their fellow corsican signavi nicholai would place his money on the latter if certain men traditionally control for example the armaments trade men of respect shall we call them then that is one tradition that a young man would certainly wish to honor you are wise beyond your years not to put too fine a point on it nicholai said what is the percentage on tradition here i am told that it depends antonucci said on the particular cargo that is going in and out but say three percent is traditional so i hear anyway three nicholai raised an eyebrow three nicholai raised his glass to tradition then to tradition antonucci said per tu amicu nicholai downed his brandy and stood up ive taken too much of your time thank you for seeing me and providing me with your wise counsel antonucci nodded after nicholai left antonucci told his thug tell yvette i wish to see her on the next break fifteen minutes later the saxophone player came into the office you make eyes at strangers antonucci asked her no i was just trying to be hospitable to the customers he slid his belt from its loops and doubled it over so nicholai thought as he walked out to find a cab lunion corse wants its cut why not the cost of doing business he got into the back of the blue renault which took him down gallieni boulevard across the dakow bridge and back into cholon the cab pulled up on trun hung dao street by a twostory art deco building with a gaudy mauveandgreen façade nicholai went into larcenciel through the long grenadescreened terrace into the restaurant and upstairs to the nightclub the bar was packed with attractive chinese prostitutes in skintight cheongsams who struggled to chat up customers over the loud filipino orchestras dismemberment of artie shaw hits de lhandes was at the bar what are you drinking he asked nicholai what should i be drinking well they have tiger and kadling beer de lhandes answered cold but they make a mean gin fizz ill have one of those then nicholai said taking some piastres from his pocket may i youre a gentleman nicholai ordered and paid for two gin fizzes then in chinese politely declined the invitation of a working girl who tried to perch herself on his lap and offered carnal delights previously unheard of in the mundane world you are a man of iron will de lhandes observed a veritable fortress of restraint i will admit it is tempting give in not tonight de lhandes gave him a long evaluative look then asked or are you a man in love nicholai shrugged ahhh de lhandes said not only a man of iron will and restraint a man of fidelity i am impressed and inspired glad to be of service but i will doubtless yield to the temptations of the flesh de lhandes said later tonight if that is i have the cash to do so it is a mournful state of affairs when the considerable girth of ones masculine member is adversely affected by the regrettable slimness of ones money clip alas the unique nature of the rest of my physiognomy generally precludes amorous arrangements of a less commercial nature women find me a charming companion at the table but less desirable for the walk into the boudoir suffice it to say i am therefore limited as to the menus from which i can select that being the sad case my sexual future depends on fickle affections of the little wheel at le grand monde saigons finest temple to the gods of chance in my unceasing attempt to make one vice pay for the other and do you rarely de lhandes said sadly if experience is the best teacher i am an exceedingly poor student how was your chat with antonucci fine nicholai answered he just wanted to warn me off the saxophone player they both knew it was an evasion hes lunion corse you know de lhandes said watching for nicholais reaction what is that dont play me for a fool mon pote de lhandes said and ill return the favor tell me then do i have in you a friend or a police informant i cant be both they laughed and nicholai ordered another round of drinks you seem to know whats going on he said its my business im looking for a group of french film actresses nicholai said who isnt they arrived last week nicholai said you wouldnt know which hotel theyre at would you would i know de lhandes asked ive parked myself across the street like a dog hoping for a glimpse the eden roc nicholai wanted to set his drink down and go directly to the hotel she was so close but he curbed his impulse and disciplined himself to take care of business first things first he told himself then you can go and find her do you have an interest de lhandes asked same as yours not the same de lhandes observed you have a chance my friend by the golden pubes of the village virgin you have a chance they finished their drinks and crossed the street to le grand monde the casino was in a courtyard protected by a high stucco wall topped with strands of barbed wire outside binh xuyen troopers patrolled on foot and in jeeps with mounted machine guns guards at the entry gate stopped and gave them cursory searches for weapons or explosives saigon these days de lhandes observed his arms raised to shoulder height to allow the guard to pat him down the guard nodded de lhandes in then searched nicholai and passed him through that accomplished they went through broad doors into the enormous white building highceilinged and lit by chandeliers the casino was a decent attempt at its progenitors on the riviera and in monaco the thirtyodd gaming tables were covered in rich green felt the furnishings mock fin de siècle were clean and well kept up the crowd save for being predominantly asians could have been from the south of france dressed expensively in the latest styles the working girls and there were many were suitably muted in their nevertheless seductive attire and the wives girlfriends and mistresses of the wellheeled men gracefully ignored their presence whitejacketed chinese croupiers worked quickly and efficiently while larger men obviously security stood in the corners keeping watchful eyes the large room was filled with excited chatter shouts of victory and curses of loss the clatter of dice the clack of chips and the spinning of roulette wheels a cloud of cigarette smoke hovered like protective coverage over the triumphs and disappointments haverford sat at a roulette table giving nicholai only the slightest glance he pushed some chips onto the table and watched the wheel spin he won bay vien resplendent in a sharkskin suit and a beautiful chinese woman on his arm stood and watched the action whos that nicholai asked bay vien de lhandes answered boss of the binh xuyen he and bao dai own the joint would you like to meet him not especially nicholai said you will sooner or later de lhandes said if youre going to do any business in saigon right now nicholai said the only business im going to do in saigon is at the roulette table they went to the cashiers window and purchased chips then walked back to the table where de lhandes promptly lost on his first try by the hirsute sack of saint anthony de lhandes cursed by the inexhaustible appetites of the daughters of the dordogne by the unspeakable perversions of the sisters of not going well nicholai inquired i am condemned to a chastity born of penury de lhandes answered nicholai stepped up to the layout and watched the game it seemed quite simple players made bets based on the ball landing on a number from one to thirtysix they had to choose to make difficult inside wagers on a specific number or a cluster of numbers or more likely yet less remunerative outside bets on the even odds of the ball landing on red or black the combinations of types of wagers seemed infinite but a child observing the game could readily discern that the odds were always in favor of the house i hope you have better luck than me haverford said he looked a little glum a dwindling stack of chips on the table in front of him he offered his hand im ellis haverford by the way un bon ami de lhandes said a genial pal for an american michel guibert nicholai said then added and what do you do in saigon mr haverford ellis haverford answered im with the united states information service do you dispense information nicholai asked or acquire it first the latter and then the former haverford said enjoying the game and you what brings you to saigon the weather haverford laughed the ferocious heat or the stultifying humidity first the latter and then the former are you going to try your luck haverford asked at the roulette wheel i might take a spin nicholai said he started conservatively placing a modest twopiastre outside bet on black and won leaving his winnings on the layout he added chips and placed three more bets on black won and then shifted to red the croupier spun the wheel the ball rattled around and landed on red two more reds and a single shift back to black later nicholai had acquired a tidy stack of chips a small crowd driven by the herd instinct of gamblers toward a run had gathered around the table one of them was bay vien himself who stood at the far end and regarded nicholai with a look of slightly jaded curiosity nicholai merely glanced back at him but wondered when and if he would make good on his promise of payment nicholai moved his chips onto the square marked straight up he said to the croupier thats a thousand dollars man haverford said mon pote the odds are thirtyseven to one nicholai said im aware it seemed obvious several people hastily placed bets on black a few of the braver ones put money on a split between and the doubters among them laid chips on red rien ne va plus the croupier said ending the betting as he spun the wheel the ball landed on how did you know haverford asked extraordinary de lhandes muttered by the popes wrinkled scrotum nicholai shifted the pile of his winnings in a square layout on four numbers and pick them up by the puckered anal cavity of dont be foolish michel nicholai looked across the table at bay who merely smiled seemingly unbothered that guibert was beating the house then again nicholai thought he is unbothered corner nicholai said if the ball landed on any one of the four numbers he would win bets were quickly laid down for and against him rien ne va plus the ball landed on cash out pick them up a feast i tell you even in this colonial purgatory and by the pubic hairs of the mona lisa the women you could have tonight piles of them nicholai pushed the chips back onto tits and asses like cezannes hay bales and bay looked at nicholai and nodded as if to say be my guest such a variety a fivestar michelin sexual buffet by the boiling hot spunk of nicholai looked back at bay straight up thats madness de lhandes said haverford just shook his head the gamblers around the layout scrambled to place counterwagers rien ne va plus the wheel spun the ball clattered rattled and bounced nicholai wasnt watching the ball however he had his eyes trained on bay who met his stare with the same fixed smile nicholai heard the wheel slow and stop and heard the crowd collectively gasp as the croupier announced dix ten nicholai didnt move to pick up his chips or change his bet michel you won he heard de lhandes say dont be a fool my new friend thats a lot of money encore nicholai said straight up mon pote you are throwing your money away a fortune nicholai glanced over at bay who shrugged the croupier closed the betting the ball rolled bounced landed on and bounced onto ten bay turned away from the table put his arm around his woman and walked toward the bar nicholai picked up his chips worth a little more than bay had paid in full for the rocket launchers the casino was abuzz with the newcomers amazing run nicholai walked over to the bar and bought a round of drinks well played de lhandes said indeed haverford added dryly by the blue veins on jane russells sainted breasts de lhandes enthused that was spectacular for a moment i thought that the admittedly fatclogged arteries of my overburdened heart which more resemble pâté de foie gras than actual bloodbearing vessels were about to burst thors throbbing member man you terrified me but i am happy happy no overjoyed for your exemplary good fortune santé santé nicholai said no one beats this casino de lhandes said unless nicholai thought the casino owner owes you a large sum of illicit money and found a clever and entertaining way to pay you the roulette wheel was as crooked as a dogs hind leg a commotion and a fresh buzz was happening around the entrance to the casino the security guards made their way toward the noise outside through the main door nicholai could see a convoy of large shiny black sedans pull up captain signavi emerged then a squad of binh xuyen troopers machine pistols in hand piled out of the lead car as other troopers hastily formed a cordon from the cars to the door could it be de lhandes asked with some sarcasm in his voice a royal visit the third car pulled up troopers opened the back door and a middleaged vietnamese man in a white dinner jacket emerged from the car as the guards their heads on swivels looked anxiously around its bao dai haverford explained to nicholai the playboy emperor he waved his fingers miming a puppeteer bao dai turned and reached his arm back into the car clearly to fetch another passenger in the backseat i hope its his latest mistress de lhandes said the rumor is shes fantastic nicholai watched as the woman eased gracefully out of the car she was fantastic solange she wore a black gown with fashionably deep décolletage and her blonde hair was swept up and off her long neck with just one tendril carefully disarranged to flow down to her shoulder solange took bao dais offered arm and allowed him to escort her through the cordon of guards each of whom labored unsuccessfully not to stare at the tall elegant frenchwoman who was the emperors latest love i heard shes a film actress de lhandes said at least thats what she calls herself id like to be in that movie haverford said nicholai disciplined himself not to slap his stupid face but could not prevent the flush he felt burning his own cheeks when it receded he let his eyes meet haverfords but if the american was ashamed he didnt show it i had nothing to do with it he whispered to nicholai if you didnt nicholai wondered who did its good to be the emperor de lhandes observed as bao dai and solange came into the casino nicholai watched as bao dai introduced solange to various important men watched as she held her hand out to be kissed as she smiled made small witticisms and dazzled she seemed very much at home in this society a bit too comfortable for nicholais tastes and he was annoyed with himself that he felt so face it he told himself the word is jealous he wanted to walk over and kill bao dai with a single strike the way the man pawed her stroked her bare arm signaling his ownership of her to all in the room it was disgusting and he was angry with her for allowing it hypocrite he accused himself you are a whore as much as her you both sell yourselves you are both playing roles if she plays hers well so do you michel guibert i dont suppose well be introduced de lhandes said haverford smiled were not high enough on the pecking order for that de lhandes sighed so i can only lust from afar bad for you good for le parc à buffles haverford said the casinos courtesans were well beyond de lhandess limited means but le parc offered a menu for all budgets then she saw him tall she looked over her companions shoulder and spotted nicholai only the most discerning observer could have noticed the small tremor of recognition before her green eyes moved on to a brief glance at haverford but nicholai saw it he walked over to them bay vien looked surprised at the intrusion nicholai glanced at bao dai but addressed his words to solange michel guibert formerly of montpellier and hong kong enchanté mademoiselle enchantée monsieur solange said her eyes warning him away before she turned her look to bao dai the emperor noticed the colons rude approach to his mistress but easily hid his annoyance welcome to vietnam monsieur guibert what brings you to saigon thank you your excellency nicholai said im starting a business a manufactury superb bao dai said and what will you manufacture i was thinking of marionettes nicholai said looking straight at bao dai you know puppets it was a deliberate insult and everyone who heard it knew it but bao dai merely smiled and asked what sort of puppets french i think nicholai said or do you think american i didnt think the americans were known for such things solange said yes their ventriloquists use them they call them let me think nicholai looked directly at bao dai yes dummies its quite clever actually the dummy appears to be talking but of course its really the ventriloquist but if you didnt know better youd swear that yes i think we understand the concept monsieur solange said turning slightly to signal bao dai that she wished to move on well best of luck in your business monsieur guibert bao dai said if there is anything that we can do to facilitate your endeavor i hope you will not hesitate to let us know we always like to encourage entrepreneurs yes ive heard that nicholai said even as far away as laos they speak highly of your cooperative nature bao dais eyelids closed for just a moment and then opened again when they did nicholai saw that his eyes were black with repressed rage do you gamble monsieur guibert a bit your excellency he just beat the house for a tidy little fortune bay vien said indeed bao dai said raising his eyebrows perhaps then you would like to join me in a private game id be honored i prefer games that match player against player as do i good bao dai said actually ive become very fond of the american game of poker solange kept the frozen smile on her face but nicholai could tell that she was livid she stared at him with a look that said just go away he smiled at her it will be high stakes bao dai said hoping to embarrass him nicholai looked at solange and answered i like high stakes no limits actually bao dai added better ill get a table together bay said in the private room will you be joining us nicholai asked solange word of the newcomers insult of bao dai and the impending poker game quickly spread through the house bay vien passed by nicholai and muttered this game wont be fixed you know i trust you to see that it isnt he walked over to the bar christ man de lhandes hissed are you out of your mind insulting the emperor hell have your throat cut but by the love my mother would have laded upon me had she not been so horrified at what emerged from her womb you have balls guibert clanging great magnificent balls what are you doing haverford asked playing poker nicholai answered what are you doing playing poker i guess haverford answered he walked off to find bay vien bay was a popular man a few moments later bao dai pulled him aside i want him broken every last piastre to his name and de lhandes said to anyone who would listen by the glossy belly of buddha would you not love to be in that room six men sat at the round table nicholai bao dai bay vien haverford signavi and the dealer bay vien announced the rules the casino would deal but a buck would rotate from player to player to determine the order of betting and set the game that dealer could choose between one of two games sevencard stud or fivecard draw the latter with jacks or better to open there would be no silliness such as wild cards and jokers were cut from the deck importantly there were no limits on raises or stakes nicholai sat with a squat glass of singlemalt scotch straight up and looked at solange who stood over bao dais shoulder like some kind of goodluck fetish it was demeaning he thought demeaning and cheap and far beneath her unless he thought she is playing a role that the americans have cast her in just as you are playing a part in their melodrama but what is her role bao dai neatly stacked his chips into several piles haverford sat to nicholais left bay to his right they cut cards for first deal bay won and chose fivecard draw nicholai picked up his hand two hours later the room was full of stale smoke and fresh tension haverford was all but out as was bay vien signavi had a modest stack of chips in front of him but nicholai and bao dai were the big winners and headed for a showdown nicholai found the game itself tedious beyond description as he had for three long years in prison listening to the american guards play endless rounds of the childish game poker lacked nuance and creativity and was painfully puerile when compared to go it was a simple matter of risk analysis and money management and basic mathematics dictated that five players over the course of a certain number of deals would basically receive the same hands in that sense it was remotely similar to go as it involved decisions as to when to be aggressive and when to yield nevertheless he found the oneonone battle against bao dai compelling he was surprised at how badly he wanted to take the emperors money and beat him in front of solange speaking of a lack of nuance he thought he picked up his cards to see that the deal had given him a pair of queens and a pair of tens it was enough to stay in the betting for the draw and he threw his chips in as bao dai raised the betting he got his card the ten of clubs bao dai opened and nicholai saw him and raised him haverford tossed his cards on the table not my night signavi looked hard at nicholai whose face was placid and unreadable he grunted in disdain and pushed his chips in bao dai smiled across the table youre bluffing all right the emperor called and raised nicholai and signavi both saw the bet bao dai laid his cards out a red flush full house nicholai said and swept up the chips signavi swore in disgust bao dai only smiled but nicholai observed the slight flush of anger and frustration on his cheeks he glanced up to solange who quickly turned away walked to the bar and fetched bao dai a fresh whiskey nicholai looked at his own stack of chips he had over two thousand piastres worth about bay vien had the buck ordered a fresh pack and called for sevencard stud the dealer shuffled and bay vien cut nicholai looked at his two down cards it wasnt promising a four and five of clubs his first up card was a jack of hearts bao dai showed a queen of diamonds and bet nicholai stayed in the next round brought him the eight of clubs and bao dai the queen of spades the emperor looked up smiled at him and raised by three hundred piastres nicholai tossed in the chips to see his next card a jack of diamonds pair of jacks showing the dealer said haverford folded bao dai drew a deuce still the high hand showing he bet another five hundred piastres and nicholai stayed in to get the six of clubs the emperor drew the queen of clubs three of a kind showing queen high solanges eyes looked almost sorrowful bao dai bet another five hundred sat back and looked at nicholai do you still prefer games that match player against player nicholai wasnt sure if he was matched against a player or against a player and the house but he answered yes my preferences dont seem to have changed so bay vien folded signavi also threw in his cards its not my night i see he got up went to the bar and poured himself a pernod so it comes down to you and me bao dai said to nicholai as it was meant to be nicholai said insolently he looked directly at solange who turned her face away the lady is tired i think bao dai said shall we make this the last hand fine with me haverford said bay and signavi quickly assented bao dai raised an eyebrow at nicholai as long as theres a winner and a loser nicholai said i think i can assure you of that i wonder if you can nicholai thought recalling that the emperors ally and business partner had ordered the fresh deck owned the casino and the dealer ive made a fortune tonight and still have enough left to purchase a fresh start in life the emperor has three of a kind showing judging from his aggressive betting he has another card down i have only one chance to beat even his up cards i have to draw a seven of clubs the odds are overwhelmingly against me bao dai reached up and brushed the top of solanges hand nicholai pushed his chips in the deal came bao dai reached for his down card nicholai said lets neither of us look excuse me lets neither of us look your excellency nicholai suggested as he pushed all his chips toward the center and lets do make this the last hand thats insane haverford said solanges green eyes flashed like emeralds he could already have four queens under there and know it haverford hissed nicholai was aware of that he looked at bay to see if he could discern whether the fix was in he couldnt bao dai took a deep breath and then pushed his chips in i see you he said then he looked to bay and asked is my credit good here of course bay said jokingly but his face looked strained as if he hoped that the emperor wasnt going to do what he feared but he was i see you bao dai repeated and i raise you two thousand piastres i dont have it i know bao dai said pleasantly i warned you this was no limits the sad fact is you had no business being in this game i played you like a puppet bay looked disgusted signavi found a reason to look down at the table as haverford saw something fascinating on the floor they were all embarrassed for bao dai he had humiliated himself as a man but solange looked straight at bao dai and her expression was one of contempt it was ephemeral it quickly shifted to a mask of indifference but nicholai saw it and it was victory enough good night then nicholai said and started to get up your credit is good here bay said to him glaring at bao dai to the limit of two thousand piastres nicholai asked exactly is bays offer sincere or is the deck stacked and hes setting me up for an even bigger fall i saved you from a bullet nicholai thought looking at him would you set me up now nicholai sat back down he looked at solange who looked back at him i call your bet nicholai said bao dai turned his down cards and showed his hand his first card was the queen of hearts four of a kind he looked at nicholai and his leer said i told you that you had no place here my hand my pot my woman nicholai turned his remaining down card the seven of clubs my god youre rich de lhandes observed it was true nicholai had taken enough money from bao dai to set himself up for life to his credit the puppet emperor had taken his losses with a suave grace small wonder nicholai thought he could easily replace the money with the funds he took from the americans and his percentage of the gambling prostitution and drug business still it took courage to face down the powerful bao dai and michel guiberts name was on hundreds of tongues in cholon before nicholai even left the casino i will arrange security for you bay offered all that money the crime lord thought while the cholon criminals were usually afraid to defy the binh xuyen by committing robbery on its turf this amount of money could provoke a rash action someone might be willing to risk his life and the lives of his family for such a fortune that wont be necessary nicholai answered i suggest bay said that you allow me to put your chips in the safe i will arrange an armed escort to the bank for you in the morning thats very kind of you nicholai said and i accept haverford approached nicholai and whispered that was stupid and dangerous i agree tomorrow at the sporting bar five oclock very well there was a bustle in the main room as bao dai prepared to leave the emperor looked back at nicholai waved his hand and waited for his guard to form solange looked over his shoulder at nicholai where shall we go now de lhandes asked to the parc à buffles nicholai said loudly enough for solange to hear she turned away momma the brothels madam alerted to this guiberts new wealth was waiting for him monsieur guibert bienvenue she warbled her chins quivering with the effort felicitations on your triumph your pleasure is my pleasure thank you my pleasure is your profit he thought but never mind but this establishment is not for a man of your distinction momma said you must accompany me to the back which is reserved for our special guests nicholai could almost feel de lhandess envy i assume my friends will be equally welcome madame of course momma said broadening her smile to encompass de lhandes any friends of monsieurs they followed her out through a courtyard past armed binh xuyen guards who kept an eye on a long line of soldiers waiting patiently for the less exclusive services the brothel was a model of assimilation and nicholai observed the diverse nature of french forces in vietnam paratroopers from the métropole foreign legion troopers from all over europe lanky senegalese soldiers and squat vietnamese momma led them into a separate building ornately decorated in colonial fin de siècle nicholai found it grotesque and tasteless when compared to the spare elegance of japanese geisha houses the house of mirrors was an establishment so exclusive that only the very rich knew of its existence or could afford the quality of its services like the finest of french restaurants if you had to ask the price you had no place there momma rang a small handbell and quickly a platoon of girls formed behind her in rank and file a choice for every taste and predilection most of the women were asians in tight brightly colored cheongsams or white satin ao dais but a few european women wearing peignoirs stood literally head and shoulders above them one had blonde shoulderlength hair and heavy breasts barely concealed under the filmy nightgown the madam noticed that nicholais eyes rested on her that is marie she whispered belgian like the french but dirtier nicholai selected a chinese woman instead her black flowered cheongsam was buttoned to her neck her black hair pulled into a tight bun ling ling will please you momma said i have no doubt nicholai answered and please put my friends selections on my bill you are a good friend i am a man reborn de lhandes said scanning the line of women with the eye of a starving gourmand examining the menu at a fourstar parisian restaurant he was in a torture of indecision torn between a zaftig slav from belgrade and a japanese who looked as if shed been chiseled from alabaster one doesnt wish to be perceived as a glutton michel but i dont mind spending bao dais money nicholai answered have both by the priapism of a pope michel ling ling although nicholai knew that pretty pretty was obviously not her name took nicholai by the hand and led him to her chamber he didnt violate her privacy by asking her for her real name the pseudonym was a small way of keeping what little she had left of herself for herself should i undress or would you prefer to undress me she asked you can undress nicholai answered he was not deluded about the nature of this relationship he didnt wish the pretense of romance or seduction this was a simple business transaction she unbuttoned her cheongsam and hung it up in the small closet nicholai undressed she hung up his clothes as well and she then took him in her hand and went to her knees in a gesture of foreplay that nicholai knew was a subtle health inspection satisfied she pulled him down onto the bed nicholai was pleased that her body was thin and spare what the chinese describe as a lean horse more a zen garden than the lush generous hothouse that was solange is she in bed with bao dai now he wondered is she pulling the puppets strings making him dance to her charms nicholai was surprised at this flash of sexual jealousy it was so western unpragmatic and foolish he turned his attention back to the very lovely naked woman on the bed looking at him expectantly let down your hair please he said she reached behind her head and pulled out a cloisonné pin her black hair fell shimmering around her shoulders relieved that they could converse in chinese she was frank about ascertaining his other preferences would you like to begin with the middle way she asked then perhaps finish by fetching the fire from the far side of the mountain neither actually nicholai said you do not find me attractive i find you very attractive nicholai said but it is so delightful to hear your beautiful chinese that i would find it most pleasurable to spend our time in conversation she looked at him curiously but chattered away he made polite listening sounds and the occasional brief contribution to the conversation but his thoughts were elsewhere your rudeness to bao dai was stupid he told himself your anger at solange unfair deliberately making an enemy of the countrys ruler was just courting danger and as for your attitude toward solange did you want to drive her into another mans arms youll be lucky if she ever wants to see you again he waited in the foyer for de lhandes to return from his buffet in a little while the dwarf came rocking down the hallway on rubbery legs damn generous of you michel de lhandes said to a fault if i might say so but if the indulgence of even recently made friends is a vice of yours then i say hurrah for vice in all its variegated forms and twisted permutations speaking of which youre an information broker nicholai interrupted yes de lhandes said do you have information you wish brokered i wish to obtain some and a generous discount for you my friend de lhandes said about whom may i ask which indeed i may should and must in fact if i am to be of service to you on the taxi ride back to saigon nicholai told de lhandes what he needed your luck holds de lhandes responded by my happily exhausted but cruelly abused male member your luck holds lets hope so nicholai thought solange pretended that she was lying on the beach at frontignan and bao dai was a small wave that kept washing over her the wave finally broke she waited for a politely appropriate spell of postcoital intimacy and mutual praise then rolled over for a cigarette he seemed quite interested in you bao dai said getting up for a smoke of his own and a glass of scotch a drink thank you no who did bao dai smiled indulgently please my darling trust me when i say that ive had more than my fill of games tonight we both know that im referring to your handsome fellow countryman that guibert that guibert solange got out of bed slipped into a white silk robe and cinched the belt around her waist then she sat on the louis xiv loveseat and looked over at him men do find me attractive am i meant to apologize for that only if the attraction is mutual bao dai answered was it solange shrugged you said yourself that he is a handsome man the world is full of them i suppose you could have me blinded youre being glib what else should i be she asked when youre being silly im with you darling not with him im a little hurt i thought you noticed he walked over and put his arms around her neck she hated his touch im sorry he said perhaps its that he took so much from me tonight i was worried that maybe he took you as well oh now you are being silly she answered turning her neck to kiss his fingers vous me faites briller later he went into his private study picked up the phone and ordered kill him nicholai lay on his back on his bed and forced solange out of his mind focusing instead on creating a mental gokang he reviewed the state of play as it stood at the moment my position he decided is strong but ephemerally so i have sufficient funds to launch and sustain my next moves but what should those moves be the possession of voroshenins papers is promising but the promises must be fulfilled a tricky prospect nor can i rely on haverfords promise of a new passport it could just as easily be a setup for another termination attempt and in any case would still leave a trail that the cia could follow then there are the papers i am due from the viet minh but do i want them and the chinese to also have a way to track me in either case i would still be in my perpetual peripatetic prison but let them both think i need their passports or that we do solange had been so difficult to read she would have made a superb go player maybe she will he thought if she decides to come with me and we manage it but she had looked indifferent icy and angry in turn furious in fact when i took the money from bao dai was it an act the theatrical skills of a firstclass courtesan on display or is she really with bao dai and through with me certainly she gave me not the slightest sign otherwise but then again given the situation she had to be circumspect or was i the one exposed to the theatrical skills of a firstclass courtesan his doubts surprisingly painful he moved on to scan the position of the white stones that still surrounded him they were many and they were in motion start with haverford and the americans despite his protestations to the contrary it is still most likely that he intended me to be killed in beijing and was surprised and dismayed that i survived now that ive openly surfaced in saigon were both pretending at least to be friends and allies but will the americans make another attempt if so which americans it is most likely that diamond was responsible for the attempt back in the rock garden in tokyo which seemed like another lifetime would he now make another attempt in saigon with or without haverfords assent then there are the french doubtless edgy at the thought of a stranger getting near their opiumsmuggling operation they will be suspicious perhaps lethally so and if the army isnt moved to act the civil authorities might be considering that a mess will soon land on their desks as soon as it is discovered in moscow and beijing that michel guibert is alive in saigon and what about lunion corse the opium trade is the wellspring of their wealth from which they draw to purchase their hotels clubs and restaurants while they appear to be cooperative soliciting as is their nature their cut of the action corsican is virtually synonymous with treacherous on the topic of treachery he thought can you really trust bay vien a man who has switched sides before and doubtless will again will his albeit temporary alliance with bao dai cause him to betray you as well and if so to whom bao dai is the obvious choice but it is well to keep in mind that bay after all is chinese although many generations removed from the homeland but cholon is chinese surely swarming with beijingcontrolled operatives even if bay himself isnt one of them beijing will certainly be coming for me as will moscow even if leotov has not already lost his nerve and contacted them they will soon find out if they havent already that voroshenins killer is in saigon the kgb certainly cant be seen to let that go unavenged they will be coming if not here then somewhere else and they will be relentless michel guibert needs to disappear and quickly hopefully he thought solange picard will disappear with him but it all depends on what happens tomorrow with delicious irony my future depends on yuri voroshenin he put the imaginary board away and went to sleep michel guibert was the talk of rue catinat even the waiters at breakfast treated him with an increased deference and nicholai saw the staff and other guests subtly point to him and whisper he found his new status amusing so did de lhandes he arrived in the dining room looking remarkably fresh from the previous nights excesses sat down at nicholais table and sniffed disapprovingly at the fare but my friend he huffed this is shit especially for a man of your taste and wealth these corsicans wouldnt know cuisine if it crept up their anal cavities and warbled piaf tunes look they can even make a debacle of breakfast would you like a real croissant i suppose come on then de lhandes led him outside and down to the corner of rue catinat and le loi to a place called la pagode where the outdoor café stubbornly refused to adorn itself with antigrenade netting the owners act as if there is no war de lhandes said they consider putting up such vulgarities as the edge of a slippery slope this my nouveau riche friend is how quality is preserved over café au lait croissant which were nicholai had to admit delicious and apricot preserves de lhandes slipped him an envelope exactly what you requested and what do i de lhandes waved a small dismissive hand on the house my friend i cant you can and shall de lhandes said curtly am i not allowed to return a gift in my own way with what means i have at hand by the ancient bells of st germain i would have cited notre dame but youll understand that im a bit sensitive about the quasimodo association thank you nicholai said youre welcome nicholai was impressed that de lhandes never asked why he wanted the contents of the envelope or what he intended to do with them it has been a long time he thought since ive had a friend later that morning bay vien personally picked nicholai up to deposit his winnings in the bank they rode in his personal car armored and escorted by machinegunwielding guards you are a difficult friend bay said on the drive how so you embarrassed the emperor bay said in his city in front of his woman my woman nicholai thought but he said you helped me everyone saw how you looked at her bay said for that alone not to mention the money he could kill you more likely he would ask you to do it true and would you bay said id feel badly about it youre a good guy for a colon and you have balls but dont kid yourself michel guys like you come and go i will have to live with bao dai for a long time so if he asks me to get rid of you he didnt need to finish the sentence i would understand nicholai said leave saigon bay said get your money and get out tomorrow today if you can i have business here the rocket launchers bay asked dont think ive forgotten your offer to procure more of them but do it from laos you dont need to be in saigon i have other business here what kind of business my business nicholai said please tell me you are not going after this woman bay said i have a dozen blonde frenchwomen as i said nicholai snapped its my business bay regarded him for a long moment do it quickly xiao do it quickly and get the hell out before i have to do something that i really dont want to do they arrived at the banque de lindochine the binh xuyen guards escorted nicholai and his cash inside he met with the banker a colon in his midfifties in a private office i wish access to my safety deposit box please nicholai said laval had heard of this guibert all of saigon had he said im sorry monsieur but i wasnt aware that you had a safety deposit box with us i do nicholai answered in the name of yuri voroshenin he slid voroshenins passport across the desk laval glanced at it and then looked back at nicholai i am informed that monsieur voroshenin recently passed away as you can see nicholai said you were apparently misinformed this is most irregular monsieur laval said nicholai the banque de lindochine is most irregular laval looked insulted he sat back in his chair and then ran his long fingers across his high forehead do you have any additional identification that might authenticate your identity monsieur whoever you are nicholai nodded removed an envelope from his jacket pocket and handed it to laval the banker took it opened it turned ghostly pale and sputtered this is outrageous i agree nicholai said i imagine madame laval would agree as well how did you get these laval asked stunned by the photographs of him in bed with a young cambodian girl does it matter this is hardly the act of a gentleman again we are in perfect harmony those copies are for you to keep i have others safely stored away however if this is not adequate identification he slid a stack of piastre notes across the desk perhaps these pictures might suffice laval hesitated then he took the stack of bills and stuffed them and the photos inside his jacket pocket he grudgingly led him to the vault and handed him the key nicholai opened the steel box bankbooks for accounts in switzerland and the united states in addition to the accounts were stocks and securities a bit ironic for a communist nicholai thought he knew nothing of such things but could hope that voroshenin did and had invested the ivanov fortune wisely then there were codes to other safety deposit boxes in zurich bonn paris new york buenos aires of course nicholai couldnt know what they contained but there was already enough money to fund what he wanted to do and for he and solange to live in reasonable comfort and safety and on the subject of safety nicholai was delighted to find what he had hoped to find and what a man of voroshenins profession would surely store in a secure place passports one french another german with unintentionally exquisite irony one was costa rican the same nationality that the americans had promised him and speaking of the americans voroshenin had even provided himself with an american passport one michael pine resident of park avenue in new york city nicholai took the contents of the box put them in his briefcase and walked out of the vault laval was waiting for him now i wish to open an account please nicholai said handing him the american passport in this name the account was opened nicholai kept enough for immediate expenses deposited the rest and instructed laval to wire it to their branch in marseille laval obediently did so nicholai wished him a pleasant day and left the men sat in antonuccis office mancini antonucci guarini ribieri sarti luciani the whole leadership of lunion corse sat around the table and listened to what captain signavis guest the amerloque who called himself mr gold had to say the socalled michel guibert diamond said is an asset of an american antinarcotic unit sent to infiltrate the indochina marseillenew york heroin connection the men were silent for a minute finally mancini said this is what comes of doing business with outsiders he seemed like a respectful young man antonucci responded he took a cigar from its humidor and carefully lit it not showing his fury at having been deceived by the young guibert its the times guarini offered consolingly theres more diamond said his handler is an american working in saigon under usis cover haverford mancini said i knew it more silence ensued more sipping of espresso more slow deliberate smoking then mancini said the haverford thing has to look like something else a robbery use some of the local boys what about guibert antonucci asked signavi interjected hes something different he can handle himself the men took this in antonucci said ill give it to the cobra a dour overweight frenchman was waiting for nicholai in the lobby of the continental he slowly unfolded himself from his chair and approached nicholai as he waited for the clerk to retrieve his room key monsieur guibert yes the mans suit hung off him like laundry dark circles under his eyes gave an impression of even greater colonial lassitude patrice raynal he said sdece i would like a word the bar nicholai suggested perhaps your room raynal suggested for your privacy they repaired to nicholais room where raynal refused the offered drink lowered himself into a chair and got right down to business i dont like you guibert ah nicholai responded most people wait a day or two until they decide to dislike me they have not had the advantages raynal said of receiving hostile wires from moscow and beijing demanding your immediate arrest and extradition nor equally strident inquiries from norodom palace inquiring about the identity of a frenchman who insulted the emperor and made improper advances toward his escort nor have they received the reports that you sold a cargo of extremely lethal and probably stolen weapons to the binh xuyen and that you took an extremely illadvised airplane ride to cap stjacques the binh xuyen are your allies nicholai said pleasantly raynals voice was tired you see publicly theyre not the french government does not consort with pirates and dope smugglers and just this morning guibert before i even had a chance to spike my coffee with a fortifying jolt of cognac i received word that a certain admittedly minor soviet functionary formerly of the beijing delegation was dead in a cholon flophouse an apparent suicide but jaded cynic that i am i cant help but wonder if your presence in the same city is merely coincidental you do seem to have a habit of being in the vicinity of dead russians leotov dead nicholai wondered keeping any sign of it off his face an overdose or the russians or the chinese i suppose i have that in common with any number of say germans witty raynal said i dislike you more every minute so are you arresting me nicholai asked tired of the jousting obviously extradition to either of the communist capitals would be the end of the game no raynal said we dont take our orders from moscow or beijing not even from washington yet but your business in saigon is concluded you managed to make a nice little lagniappe at the casino last night leave guibert as soon as possible bay vien told me the same thing he was correct raynal said i really dont care what happens to you i just dont want it happening in my little garden not to put too fine a point on it get out va ten he pushed himself up from the chair looking even more wrinkled than he did when he arrived one more thing he said as he walked to the door leave his excellencys woman alone nicholai stepped over to the note that was set on his table if raynal had noticed it he hadnt let on he opened the envelope ciné catinat à deux heures unsigned but in her hand he looked at his watch he had just enough time to make his rendezvous at sarreaus and then go meet solange nicholai walked up to the counter at sarreaus and asked for two packets of enterovioform you are sick to your stomach the clerk asked otherwise i would not have asked he paid for the pills and then went back onto rue catinat and walked down toward the neptuna swimming pool the vietnamese who had followed him from the hotel was still on his tail whoever he works for the viet minh or the french should be informed of his ineptitude nicholai thought unless the point is to be discovered in which case he should be promoted nicholai strolled to the pool it was a blistering hot day and the pool was crowded children splashed and annoyed the serious swimmers attempting to do disciplined laps in the marked lanes nicholai lingered under a plane tree at the edge of the little park lit a cigarette and watched his tail made a show of disappearing into the crowd so many games nicholai thought to market the instruments of death he waited for fifteen minutes grew bored and irritated and decided that enough was enough as he was walking away from the neptuna a vietnamese fell in at his side the man was especially short and clad in khaki shirt shorts and rubber sandals you brought the police the man said they brought themselves nicholai answered i could lose him easily the man scoffed but you i apologize for my stature buy cigarettes its a bit late to stunt my growth buy cigarettes the man jutted his chin at a tobacco shop and then he melted into the crowd nicholai walked over to the tobacconists the owner an old man handed him the pack an address was scrawled on the back take a cyclopousse the old man snapped nicholai went back out on the street to hail one of the bicyclepowered rickshaws the first one in a long queue hurried to pick him up nicholai gave him the address and the driver pedaled out into the swirling saigon traffic nicholai noticed the police tail get into the next in line but the driver argued with him with much yelling and handwaving by the time the police tail found a driver who would take him nicholais rickshaw had disappeared into the current the route led across the dakow bridge over the saigon river into cholon and nicholai recalled the sad joke that there is a chinese quarter in every city in the world except shanghai this one was no different threestory tenement buildings painted in vivid greens blues and reds their tiny railed balconies decorated with drying laundry leaned over the narrow streets as if they might imminently collapse onto them every other block seemed to have a small buddhist temple or a shrine to a lesser chinese god the driver navigated the vehicle through the clogged noisy streets and pulled up alongside what appeared to be a tailors shop then refused the payment that nicholai offered as he got out nicholai went into the shop and was immediately hustled through a door into a back room his proximity sense was on high alert but discerned no danger apparently the viet minh had not brought him there to kill him was it possible that they didnt know about his transfer of the weapons to the binh xuyen the man who had met him near the pool was already there he did not give a name but said brusquely you did not make the rendezvous in luang prabang no nicholai answered you did not make the rendezvous in luang prabang our man was murdered shortly before i can hardly be held responsible for his negligence nicholai answered you have no feeling see that you remember it the agent frowned at the distasteful necessity of dealing with this mercenary creature where are the weapons so nicholai thought either they do not know or they are not certain he needed time and space to complete his maneuvers on the board just a little space to move the stones into position where is my money when we get the weapons the viet minh agent answered where are they in a safe place nicholai answered we have heard rumors so the viet minh had heard about his airplane ride with the binh xuyen and the french into saigon yet his making contact through the stamp shop had confused them otherwise they would have tried to kill me immediately he thought you shouldnt listen to rumors its a morally debilitating habit you are playing a dangerous game the agent said if you have sold the weapons to the binh xuyen you will answer for it i answer only to myself nicholai responded in addition to the money i believe there is also the matter of a new passport the agent said you will get your money when we get the weapons and your new papers when the weapons reach their destination that would be to this ai quoc person the agent didnt answer which is answer enough nicholai thought he knew he had to take the offensive you will give me the money and the papers when i deliver the weapons to you that is inconceivable nonsense nicholai responded as i just conceived of it you might think it improbable inconvenient perhaps impossible but inconceivable no i will pass along your request the agent said stiffly it is not a request nicholai said it is a nonnegotiable demand nicholai knew that he was acting far too western confrontational and direct but he didnt have the time for elaborate asian courtesy and he needed them to believe that the papers were crucial to him do not contact me again nicholai pressed i will contact you within two days to tell you where and when we can make the transfer if you do not have the money the deal is off if you do not have the papers the deal is off do we understand each other i understand you far too well good nicholai said now i have an appointment he took a cyclopousse back into the city and had it drop him off near the ciné catinat she was silver in the reflected light of the screen solange sat two rows in front of him arranged her long legs in the narrow aisle lit a cigarette and looked up at the screen simone signoret starring in casque dor the film was a belle epoque crime story that held little interest for nicholai and he was glad when after twenty minutes solange got up and left the theater he waited a few seconds and then followed her out onto rue catinat she walked quickly with long strides and didnt look behind her until she came to the eden roc hotel where she checked her image in the glass doorway and saw his reflection nicholai waited until she went in then followed her into the small lobby where he saw the vietnamese desk clerk smile in recognition and hand solange her room key so he knew that this was her official address although he suspected that she spent most of her nights at the palace she went into the elevator and nicholai stood off and watched the brass arrow above the doors indicate that she went to the second floor he went over to the small shop purchased a journal and perused the headlines before he allowed himself to walk over to the stairway door to make sure that neither the desk clerk nor the concierge were watching then went in and took the stairs up to the second floor he walked the corridor and found that the door to room was ajar he stood outside for just a moment allowing his senses to confirm that the perfume was hers he went in and shut the door behind him solange stood in the small living room that was foolish she said lighting a cigarette foolish and jejune what was your behavior last night shes beautiful nicholai thought her golden hair a casque dor indeed soft in the muted afternoon light one hip cocked in anger her muscled leg set off by the high heels she turned away from him pried the bamboo window shades open with her fingers and looked out onto the street what did you want me to do solange asked starve live on the street i make no judgments how worldly of you she mocked how tolerant you are nicholai knew that this verbal slap was deserved he asked did haverford send you here no she said shaking her head a different one he called himself mr gold he arranged for me to meet bao dai i didnt know what to do i didnt know if you were alive or dead diamond nicholai thought is as unimaginative as he is brutal he has all the subtlety of a bull and yet bulls can be very dangerous when they turn hook and gore its all right he said it isnt she said they sent me here to lure you didnt they even if we get out they can use me to track you you should leave me nicholai walk away now and never come back no she looked back again toward the window and nicholai realized that she was afraid shed been followed from the cinema i need to get back before the film is over to learn how it ends he asked she shook her head ive seen it three times the first two times i cried and this time i will probably cry again he pulled her to him and kissed her her lips were soft and warm nicholai brushed the hair away from her neck kissed her there and was rewarded with a moan encouraged he unzipped her dress and ran his hand down the warm skin of her back we shouldnt be doing this she murmured this is crazy but she shrugged the dress off her shoulders and let it slide down her hips then she unsnapped her bra and pressed her breasts against him you feel so good nicholai picked her up and carried her into the bedroom setting her on the bed he peeled the dress down her legs revealing her black garter and stockings solange opened her legs nudged her panties to the side and said quickly he unzipped his trousers and fell on top of her entered her with one thrust and found her wet and ready she grabbed his buttocks and pulled him in deeper come in me what about you just come in me hard please she took control of their lovemaking pulling him into her until she felt him swell and then climax crying out nicholai lay on the bed watching her get dressed elegant even in her postcoital deshabille she sat on the edge of the bed as she rolled the stockings back up her legs breakfast tomorrow he asked i found a place la pagode that serves quite good croissants a date she asked wryly we can sit at separate tables nicholai said or will the emperor miss you hell be busy with affairs of state she answered trying to decide if hes run by the french or the americans and what will he decide he wont she said standing up and pulling the dress up over her hips she frowned as if she thought her hips were a bit too broad the americans will decide for him they will decide for everyone not for us no she smiled as a mother might smile at a small boys heroic fantasy no he answered she leaned down and kissed him and what will we decide to be together yes yes he had money now enough money for them to live happily in a safe place somewhere he told her all about voroshenin the connection to his mother and his familys fortune about the safety deposit box the bank accounts the passports we could go anywhere he said france perhaps i would like that yes maybe to the basque country he said did you know that i speak basque she laughed that is very odd nicholai i learned it in prison of course you did she said yes the basque country is very pretty we could buy a château we could live quietly her face turned more serious than he had ever seen it i love you i love you she broke from his embrace went into the living room found her purse and took out a lipstick coming back into the bedroom she sat in front of the mirror and redid her lips you smeared them im glad she checked her image in the mirror then satisfied stood up nicholai got up then held her tight she accepted the embrace then broke it and held him at arms length i have to get back the film nicholai said how does it end her laugh was enchanting the heroine watches them kill her lover she told him nicholai was embarrassed about sneaking back down the stairway but he understood solanges concern bao dai would not make a complacent cuckold and he would take it out on her not him he walked down the street to the sporting bar haverford was already there sipping on a cold beer a small paper shopping bag was set on the empty chair beside him nicholai sat down at the next table and both men looked out onto the street youre the talk of the town haverford said so i hear bad idea for a man in your position haverford said as a general rule by the way and understanding that youre relatively new at this sort of thing a secret agent should try to avoid celebrity ill try to keep that in mind he turned to look directly into haverfords eyes diamond brought solange here haverford didnt know surprise and perhaps anger showed in his eyes hes tracking you down haverford said because you went off the radar nicholai haverford said because you know things that would be extremely i wasnt intended to survive the temple of the green truth was i nicholai asked diamond arranged for me to be killed there nicholai would have thought it impossible but haverford actually looked ashamed it wasnt me nicholai but the chinese rescued me why you tell me haverford answered you brought the weapons down here didnt you you came to saigon before you even knew that solange was but you were here nicholai said you knew i surmised haverford corrected i didnt know if you were alive or dead odd youre the second person to say that to me today but i did my best to enter the very interesting mind of nicholai hel haverford said i sat at the gokang and played your side this was your only move nicholai haverford touched the bag sitting on the empty chair its in the bag so to speak he said a costa rican passport under the name of francisco duarte and the home addresses of your intended victims go now go quickly forget about solange youre full of advice today my parting gift haverford said standing up what about diamond ill take care of him haverford said i have to fight a little intraoffice battle but ill win you have your freedom nicholai enjoy it sayonara helsan he walked away down the street nicholai picked up the bag and looked inside as promised there was the passport and more important the home addresses of the men who had tortured him in tokyo including diamond in what seemed like a lifetime ago he ordered a beer and enjoyed it in the oppressive heat the temperature was in triple digits and it was as humid as a shower the air was heavy and the monsoon would break any day now he hoped not to see it that he and solange would be on a flight out by then perhaps to some sunny dry place it was tempting to think that they could go back to japan his deck of new identities might allow it but he knew that the country had sadly changed and would never again be what it was japan was americanized now and he didnt wish to experience it besides there was a little matter to settle three of them actually in america itself before he could decide on a place to settle but solange would want someplace to be while he was away maybe france maybe somewhere in the basque country after all he thought i speak the language nicholai finished his drink paid the tab and walked back out onto the street he had gone only a couple of blocks when he heard the car come up behind him the renault motor sputtered as the car slowed down to match his pace nicholai didnt glance back he knew they were coming for him and it wouldnt help to signal them that he was aware a quick glance into a shop window told him that it was a blue renault with a driver and two passengers nicholai kept walking would they really attempt to snatch him here in the late afternoon on rue catinat and would it be a beating an assassination or a kidnapping he brought the paris match up to his chest out of their view and flexing his forearms rolled it into a tight cylinder then he saw the two men coming toward him one of them made a crucial mistake he let his own eyes meet nicholais then his eyes shifted focus over nicholais shoulders and nicholai knew that the men in the renault were now on the sidewalk behind him so either its going to be knives if its an assassination or its a kidnapping because the car was still keeping pace instead of just letting the men out and roaring off nicholai didnt wait to find out he took care of the men behind him first swinging the rolledup magazine as if he was digging an oar into the water he struck the first assailant in the crotch then pivoted and swung the magazine like a cricket bat and struck the second man in the neck both went down the first in agony the second unconscious before he hit the sidewalk nicholai went into a deep squatting horsestance and thrust the magazine back over his shoulder striking the next man in the eye dislodging the orb from its socket the fourth man reached out and grabbed him by the shoulder nicholai dropped the magazine trapped the mans hand on top of his own shoulder and then spun breaking the arm and spinning him to the ground then he ran he sprinted onto a side street that went off to the right from catinat the car followed him bullets zipping as the driver attempted to steer through traffic and shoot at the same time pedestrians screamed fell to the ground and ducked into doorways trying to get out of harms way as bullets flew and nicholai pushed through the crowd racing ahead of him the car crashed onto the sidewalk in front of him the driver steadied his pistol on the bottom of the open window and lined up his shot nicholai dove to the ground and then rolled until he came up under the drivers door the shooter shifted the gun back and forth trying to relocate his target nicholai reached up grabbed the shooters wrist and yanked it down breaking the arm at the elbow then pushed up slamming the pistol butt into the mans face then he sprang up grabbed the stunned man by the hair and slammed his face down onto the window ledge he opened the door pulled the man out onto the sidewalk and got in himself a second car roared up the street a man leaned out the passenger window blasting a thompson nicholai flattened out on the seats as the bullets shattered the windshield and sprayed glass all over him grabbing the pistol in one hand he reached out with the other opened the passenger door and fell out onto the sidewalk with the riddled car as a screen he bellycrawled along the street then looked up to see a startled messenger on a motor scooter stopped in front of him sorry nicholai said as he lunged and knocked the man off the scooter he hopped on and raced off the driver saw him and came after him nicholai leaned as low as he could over the scooters handlebars as the bullets zipped over his head police klaxons howled over the shouts and cries of bystanders as he weaved in and out of traffic the pursuing car hot behind him he needed to create some space his mind flashed to the go board where two ways of creating space existed the traditional and expected move was to place a stone far from the opponent which in this case would mean accelerating the scooter to try to gain some ground the other was to eliminate the opponents nearest stone nicholai slowed down to let the car catch up a little and then cranked the handlebars turned and charged the car firing the pistol with one hand and twisting the throttle with the other he rode straight at the startled driver like a kamikaze pilot determined to sell his life at high price the shooter got off one more burst before he dived out the door the driver ducked behind the wheel at the last second nicholai swerved missed the car by an inch and drove out into the swirl of traffic on rue catinat melting into the chaos of rush hour he made it down to the harbor across the bridge and into cholon the tiger growled it startled nicholai at first because he was in a densely populated city not a remote jungle then he recalled that bay vien kept a private zoo on his large villa on the fringe of cholon nicholai froze for a moment then edged along the high stone wall of bay viens urban fortress he had spent the twilight hours hiding in the darkened corners of the quan am pagoda on lao tu street in the heart of cholon the few pilgrims who came in at dusk to worship the amithaba buddha bowed and chanted their namu amida butsu and took no notice of him when the sun went down and the district was lit only with lamps nicholai risked going out but he stuck to the narrow back streets and avoided the vicinity of le grand monde and le parc à buffles he had no way of knowing yet who had tried to kill or kidnap him it could have been bao dai or diamond or haverford the attack came ten minutes after haverford put him in place at the sporting bar and then left not wasting any time the everefficient ellis haverford still he couldnt be sure perhaps it was the sûreté or deuxième bureau it might even have been the viet minh if they had decided that he had betrayed them after all nicholai waited until dark and then made his way toward bay viens palatial estate what if it was bay vien who decided to have me killed nicholai wondered then his guards would doubtless have orders to shoot me on sight so best to approach him shall we say carefully at an outdoor kitchen he swiped a warm piece of charcoal and put it in his pocket now crouched beside the wall of bay viens villa he took out the charcoal used it to blacken his face and hands then tossed it into the bushes a double strand of barbed wire fringed the eightfoothigh wall and shards of glass mostly from cocacola bottles nicholai noticed had been mortared into the top of the stone a bulky watchtower stood to the side of the iron gate that guarded the main entrance and searchlights swung back and forth like a prison yard there is no choice nicholai thought but to go over the wall it was a shame to sacrifice the tailored jacket but nicholai shucked it off waiting for the searchlight to complete its arc and then tossed it onto the wire then he jumped grabbed on to the jacket which the barbs now held in place and swung himself onto the top he lay there balanced precariously until the spotlight finished its next swoop and then he dropped something moved beneath him nicholai suppressed a shout as the boa constrictor slithered out from under him its powerful muscles rippling against his ribs the snake was a good thirteen feet long shiny in the moonlight it turned its head regarded nicholai for a moment and then flicked its tongue out to determine if this creature might make a meal no nicholai murmured the snake moved off far more slowly than nicholai would have preferred a sensei would have called the snake an omen a chinese sifu would have told him to emulate the snake one of the five model animals of shaolin kungfu so nicholai became serpentine as he slithered across the clipped manicured lawn the grass wet with evening dew soaking his shirt he kept low to the ground freezing and pressing his face into the grass when the spotlight swung his way then he saw the tiger it was in a cage perhaps fifty feet off to his left it growled a deep threatening growl and nicholai felt a rush of primal fear an atavistic relic he thought from our species days in the trees the tigers eyes were beautiful to behold enchanting in the true sense of the word and nicholai felt himself being pulled into the creatures orbit is that how it happens he asked himself just before your death are you frozen to the sacrificial altar by sheer awe do you realize the magnificence of the world just before you leave it he met the tigers glare two predators he thought who meet in the night then he recalled the old chinese adage when tigers fight one is killed and the other is mortally wounded good to keep in mind nodding to the caged tiger nicholai resumed his slow crawl he stopped a hundred feet from the house and observed the guards patrolling the perimeter there were four of them walking interlocking routes around the house armed with american rifles they stepped softly and didnt speak as they passed each other just a brief nod to indicate that everything was in order the good thing about guards nicholai thought is that they point you toward your target each one of them straightened slightly and held his rifle at the ready when he passed outside a certain window on the villas second floor a light shone through the curtain the window itself was open although barred with an iron grille bay vien was home in his bedroom with infinite patience and gratitude toward his japanese masters who had taught him that virtue nicholai made a slow crawling circle around the entire villa searching for a weakness he found it in the back by the kitchen a whitejacketed cook sat on a stool outside the open door head down elbows on his thighs he smoked a cigarette crawling a bit closer nicholai could smell the distinct odor of nuoc mom the vietnamese fish soup that was a staple of the peasant diet nicholai put all his concentration into his sense of hearing and listened the cook was having a desultory conversation with someone inside luckily he spoke in chinese and nicholai learned that the boy inside was an underling a servant his name was cho and that the soup was almost ready so cho shouldnt disappear to take a nap someplace if he wanted to keep his nuts where they were nicholai waited and timed the guards orbits until he learned that there was a thirtysecond gap at the kitchen door nicholai closed his eyes and ordered his mind to allow him five minutes of rest aware that he was fatigued from the battle on the street and his flight to cholon he knew that he had to marshal his energies the next burst would have to be quick and certain when he woke up the cook had finished his smoke and was back in the kitchen nicholai pulled himself up on his forearms and waited for the next guard to come the sentry came by the kitchen door and then stopped as the cook came out and handed him what appeared to be a chunk of fish the guard slung his rifle over his shoulder thanked the cook and stood and ate damn the man nicholai thought he dropped back down and waited the guard ate quickly but it threw the rotation off and it took another half hour before the guards circuits were back in order then nicholai waited for a sentry to pass by the kitchen sprang up and rushed for the door the cook stirring his soup was unaware and nicholai hit him with a fist to the back of the neck then caught him before he could fall forward on the stove dragged him into a corner and then gently set him down it would have been easier to kill him but the man was an innocent and nicholai knew that bay vien would not easily forgive the killing of one of his people nicholai stood behind the door that opened into the house and shouted in chinese cho you lazy useless thing the soup is ready the young waiter scurried through the door straight into nicholais shuto strike and dropped in a heap nicholai pressed himself against the wall until the next sentry passed outside then found a slightly longer waiters jacket on a hook in the pantry put the waiters round black cap on his head put two bowls of the soup on a tray and headed upstairs the guard at the bottom of the stairway nodded brusquely then blinked when he noticed the waiters strange height it was too late nicholais leopard paw strike the fingers folded but not closed into a fist his second knuckles struck the guard straight in the nose hard enough to drive the bone into the brain but not forceful enough to kill nicholai caught him in one arm and guided him to the floor so the gun wouldnt clatter unburdening him of the he slipped the pistol inside his sleeve and walked up the stairs his proximity sense told him there was another guard outside bay viens door indeed the guard heard his footsteps and called cho i have masters dinner about time as nicholai feared the door was at the end of the hallway which would give the guard ample time to discern that it wasnt cho cursing his large western frame he tucked his chin into his chest hoping to buy a crucial moment looking back up nicholai took the spoon off the tray and threw it like a ninja star just as the guard was raising his pistol the spinning spoon caught the guard in the eye and drove his head back his shot fired high nicholai sprang forward grabbed his gun wrist and pushed it up as soon as he felt the guard pull back down he went with his flow and pulled with him sweeping the arm in a full circle backward until he heard the shoulder pop then he reversed the flow swept the guards foot took him to the ground and struck him in the throat he stepped over the prone guard pulled his pistol and kicked the unlocked door open bay sat up in bed a pistol of his own pointed straight at nicholais chest a beautiful asian woman pulled the sheet over herself my friends generally just ring the doorbell bay said i didnt know if i was still your friend you know bay said with one shout from me my guards will come and they will throw you to my tiger but you wont be alive to see it bay frowned i suppose from the clatter that you spilled my soup im afraid so you are a bother michel he elbowed the woman next to him get some clothes on darling and get out i need to have a private talk with my rude guest the woman leaned out of the bed grabbed a silk robe from the floor and put it on bay told her go down and tell the cook that we need more soup the cook is still alive michel yes go the woman eased past nicholai and then he heard her trot down the hallway the pistol is getting heavy bay complained shall we each put ours down were not going to shoot each other are we i hope not nicholai slowly lowered his gun bay did the same you look ridiculous in that jacket i feel ridiculous do you mind if i get dressed id prefer it actually bay got out of bed and went into the attached bathroom emerging a moment later in a black silk robe decorated with a redandgreen embroidered dragon he tied the knot around his waist and walked past nicholai as he said lets go to the dining room he stepped over the dazed guard who lay on the floor still rubbing his throat useless crap eater bay said i should feed you to beauty your tiger nicholai asked lovely isnt she nicholai followed him downstairs the soup was delicious served by a cowed cho and a rather resentful chef i told him if he spit in your bowl id cut his balls off bay reassured nicholai it arrived on the teak dining room table hot and steaming bay skillfully wended his chopsticks to pick out the delicate pieces of fish sleeping with the emperors woman he said shaking his head not good shes not his woman nicholai thought shes mine fiftyseven french whores at my brothel bay said but you have to have that one does bao dai know i dont know if he knows bay answered i know he asked me to keep an eye on her i didnt tell him if thats what you want to know who tried to kill me bay shrugged wasnt me bao dai didnt order it maybe he did bay answered just not through me i guess hes angry that i didnt stack the deck against you maybe he doesnt trust me anymore i need to ask a favor nicholai said bay shrugged and ate his soup finally setting his chopsticks down he picked up the bowl and slurped down the broth then he said you break into my home beat up my staff scare my evenings companion half to death point a gun at me and threaten to use it and then you ask for my help this after you take my most important partners money screw his woman and then commit mayhem and murder in the streets of saigon and that after you apparently killed some russian and have half the world baying for your blood you have balls of steel michel i should just throw you to beauty and let her break her teeth on you but you wont nicholai said what do you want my life nicholai thought more than that my honor sell me my weapons back he said i am prepared to offer you a small profit for your trouble are you prepared to die as well yes bay gazed at him for a long moment i believe you but tell me if i sell you back the weapons what do you intend to do with them deliver them to the original client bay looked surprised the viet minh why i gave my word thats why you should do it bay said why should i nicholai answered whatever else you are or arent you are a man of honor and you owe me your life the viet minh are the enemy today nicholai agreed four years ago they were your allies four years from now who knows bao dai is going to come after you eventually and if he doesnt the americans will besides the viet minh are going to win you think so so do you nicholai answered but that is all speculation the only real question is will you honor your debt have i mentioned that youre a difficult friend yes i owe you my life bay said but this is it were even thank you ill get you out of town bay said until we can get you on a ship or something nicholai shook his head i need to go back into saigon are you nuts bay asked half of saigon is looking to kill you the other half is looking to sell you to the people looking to kill you i have to get word to someone bay frowned is it the woman nicholai didnt answer the room in the brothel was small but adequate whores after all nicholai thought end up in a whorehouse nicholais room was down the end of a long narrow hallway it contained a fourposter bed and the walls and ceiling were made of mirrored glass our guests are narcissists momma explained for she ran this establishment as well as le parc her silence had been handsomely purchased and guaranteed with the promise of agonizing exfoliation should she as much as whisper of nicholais presence they like to admire the beauty of their own ecstasy and from a variety of angles nicholai found the constant inescapable selfreflection somewhat unsettling everywhere he looked he saw a slightly distorted view of himself nor could he leave he was imprisoned in the bedroom and the attached mirrored bathroom with its tub sink and bidet his meals would be brought in to him and fresh air was out of the question as for your other needs momma warbled lasciviously i have thought of everything i have no other needs nicholai said you will she shut the door behind her haverford gambled a few piastres at the roulette table lost grew bored and decided to make a night of it at le parc he walked out onto the street to hail a taxi and thought about nicholai hel the dramatic shootout on the street had made all the papers which printed that the attempted assassination and possible kidnapping of the respected french entrepreneur michel guibert had been an act of terror committed by the viet minh the businessman had survived the initial attack but was now nowhere to be found and french officials were very concerned that he was in the hands of the communist terrorists haverford knew it was diamond now hel was either dead or enduring interrogation in a tiger cage or perhaps he was alive and had gone into hiding if so he had pulled the earth up over him because haverford had all his sources out trying to locate hel or alternatively his corpse and they had turned up nothing nor had hel tried to contact him which meant that nicholai no longer trusted him perhaps that he thought the americans were responsible for the murder attempt growing fond of an asset was always a mistake but haverford had come to like or at least appreciate nicholai hel the blade flashed out of the darkness one more second and it would have slashed his throat to the neck bone but haverford saw it and leaned just out of the way the backslash was already coming at him he blocked it with his wrist felt the blade bite in and yelled in pain and anger the marines had taught him well he grabbed the knife hand turned and flipped the attacker over his shoulder onto the sidewalk the man landed hard on his back and haverford stomped hard on his throat then he pulled his pistol from the inside of his jacket one of the other robbers backed off but the second kept coming and haverford shot him square in the chest by this time the binh xuyen guards had come running out of le parc à buffles bandits one of them said you think so haverford asked he was breathing heavily blood was running down his sleeve the adrenaline was already dropping and he knew he would soon feel the pain he looked at the cut and said ill need to get some stitches one of the attackers was dead the other had run away and the binh xuyen were already taking their bamboo batons to the knife wielder alive haverford snapped i want him alive bandits bullshit no robber in his right mind would try to take a wallet outside le parc only a madman would try to rob one of bay viens customers the guards dragged the man away antonucci watched his girls play the club was busy for a thursday night full of harddrinking french paratroopers and foreign legionnaires and antonucci kept a careful eye lest they decide to brawl in his establishment so far the soldiers were behaving themselves and probably would continue to do so fearful of being banned from the joint and losing the right to stare at the pretty musicians later they would doubtless head to a brothel to douse the flame his girls had set alight and others would profit so be it antonucci thought its a sin to traffic in flesh he struck a match and rolled the end of his cigar around the flame cubans the good stuff he glanced at his watch the whoremongering american should be answering for his sins by now they had sent three of the best with instructions to make it look like a robbery bay vien wouldnt like it but to hell with him too sooner or later they would have to deal with that cholon street rat as well and hell be much harder to kill than the american haverford les amerloques antonucci contemplated as he inhaled the rich smoke such amateurs at intrigue so hamhanded so obvious it takes centuries to produce a conspiratorial culture generations of familial connection america with its youthful naiveté and mongrel bloodlines is a blunt tool that no steel can sharpen america in asia a deaf man at the symphony so now haverford lies in the street the french police will give their apologies along with their indifferent gallic shrugs and operation x will go forward the opium will flow through the french military instead of the viet minh be shipped to labs in marseille to be turned into heroin and will find its way to the streets of new york we will make our money and life will go on for some he allowed himself a lingering look at the long legs of the saxophone player lucky she can sit in her chair that one shell think three times before making eyes at a handsome stranger again and what happened to guibert antonucci wondered the newspaper story about the viet minh was an obvious french fiction the rumor was that guibert had made free and easy with bao dais new mistress compounding the error of embarrassing him at the gaming table and taking his money yes bao dai ordered guibert killed to get his balls back and then his boys botched it he should have come to us antonucci turned his attention back to the saxophone player yvette maybe ill throw her a fuck tonight he thought to show her there are no hard feelings shes sensitive gets her feelings hurt so easily thinskinned that one he saw mancini come through the door and search for him with his eyes then the boss of lunion corse found him and shook his head so subtle a gesture only an old friend would have known what it meant antonucci knew and it made him angry the attempt on the american had failed it had been a good payday for de lhandes so good that he bypassed le parc and went straight to the house of mirrors where he paid a good portion of his earnings for a sri lankan girl of such exquisite skill and beauty that it made him favorably reconsider the possibility of a benevolent deity he finished dressing kissed the girl on the cheek left a generous tip on the night table and headed out it was not too late for the pho soup at la bodega but that is me he thought wistfully as he closed the door behind him the aspirations of a gourmet with the wallet of a crustmunching peasant a large hand clasped itself over his mouth and he felt strong arms lift him and then he was in a room just be quiet for once he heard guibert say haverford squatted beside the surviving attacker put a cigarette in his mouth and lit it for him you speak french the terrified man nodded good haverford said look heres the thing mon ami i can pull you out of the shit youre in i have no hard feelings i know it was only business yes or i can just walk away let these binh xuyen boys have you its your choice what do i have to do you dont have to do anything haverford said just tell me something what who paid you haverford asked the corsicans the man rasped who haverford asked again because this was a surprise la corse the man said i have put my life in your hands nicholai said as he set de lhandes down he knew it was gross and offensive to have lifted the dwarf off his feet that way but there was no choice by the chancred twat of a marseille whore many people nicholai said would pay a good price to learn my whereabouts that is true de lhandes sputtered still angry at the rough handling why have you then put your life in my hands i need a useful ally that i can trust nicholai answered i agree that i am useful de lhandes replied extraordinarily so in fact but why do you think you can trust me nicholai knew that everything depended on his answer so he thought carefully before he spoke finally he said you and i are the same de lhandes looked up at the tall broadshouldered handsome man and nicholai saw his spine stiffen i hardly think so then think further nicholai replied having started this he couldnt go back both his life and de lhandess were on the line because the dwarf would leave here an ally or not at all nicholai would have to either befriend him or kill him look beyond the obvious differences and you will see that we are both outsiders nicholai saw this catch de lhandess imagination so he continued i am a westerner raised in the east and in the west you are he knew he had to choose his words carefully but then de lhandes finished the thought for him a small ugly man in a world of large beautiful people we are both forever on the outside looking in nicholai said so we can either stand on the periphery of their world always looking in or we can create our own create our own world de lhandes scoffed but nicholai could see that he was intrigued of course if youre happy with the one you currently have if you are content with the odd turn with a highclass whore or the occasional fine meal tossed to you like a bone to a dog very well but im talking about becoming rich the sort of wealth that allows you to live a dignified life with how shall i put it quality how de lhandes asked its risky what have i to lose nothing nicholai thought but i have everything to lose including my life if i let you walk away from here and am mistaken in you then i am a dead man but its too late for second thoughts now he said i need you to do something he gave voroshenins papers to de lhandes and asked him to contact solange bernard de lhandes left the brothel and hailed a cyclopousse to take him back to the city by the bloated buttocks of a bishop it was a difficult choice guiberts whereabouts would be worth a sri lankan girl perhaps even a woman from the seychelles renowned for their abilities and sexual secrets and a dinner with wine at le perroquet his mouth watered at the memory of the wine list that the sommelier had let him peruse that once magnificent of course one would have to be alive to enjoy it and from the look on guiberts face that seemed far less than a certainty all of saigon was jabbering about his escape from the assassins and how he had left several dead on the street this was not a man to betray still he thought if you broker this particular piece of information you neednt worry about his revenge the question really is who to approach and that really depends on who had made the futile attempt oh the rumors abounded some had it that bao dai himself had ordered the assassination in retribution for guiberts win at the gaming table better yet others said that guibert had succeeded in breaching the long white thighs of the emperors mistress and the attack was bao dais attempt to remove the horns from his head by the absent arms of the venus de milo it would have been worth dying to sample the charms of la solange he returned his thoughts to business if he were to sell guiberts location to whom would it be anyone would pay good money knowing that they could resell the information to the highest bidder but why should i sell wholesale when retail would be so much more lucrative in that sense guibert was right why should i settle for the crumbs off the table he sat back and thought it over the cyclopousse puttered across the bridge back into saigon antonucci watched the blonde woman sit on the stool and hook her stockings to her garter belt it almost made him hard again but he was sated the girl had indeed played a good saxophone then he had bent her over the desk and had his way with her and now she knew who was boss and didnt feel neglected waiting for her to finish dressing and leave he locked up the office and went out the back way antonucci didnt hear the man he did feel the pistol pressed hard against his back how are the kidneys old man the voice asked in french with a heavily american accent you still piss okay how would they feel if i pulled this trigger you dont know who youre playing with minet antonucci growled i eat punks like you for lunch the pistol butt came down hard on his back and doubled him over then the man pushed him hard into the wall spun him around and stuck the pistol barrel in his face why haverford asked why what why the hit on me haverford pressed was it your idea or did someone come to you antonucci spat on the ground youre a dead man maybe haverford said but not before you he pulled the hammer back antonucci looked into his eyes and saw that he meant it who cared anyway what les amerloques did to each other an oath of secrecy to another corsican he would die for that to these people forget it and he took some pleasure in answering one of your own people haverford knew the answer before he asked the question which one of my own people he used the name gold diamond thought haverford is a congenital dolt and what did gold tell you he said you were going to interfere with our business your dope business of course antonucci enjoyed the look of consternation on the americans face he laughed and said dont you get it mimi your man gold has a piece every kilo of heroin that goes into new york he gets his taste haverford felt a cold rage come over him the guibert contract he said cancel it stop it too late what do you mean antonucci lifted his hand and wiggled it in a waving motion the cobra he said is already loose solange sat on a stool in front of the mirror and carefully applied her eyeliner bao dai liked it a little thicker than she preferred the emperor went for that smoky cinema look fair enough she didnt care but in the light of morning she wondered how much longer would he find her intriguing attractive what would happen when she had no new tricks to show him and he grew bored with the old ones the same thing she knew that always happened he would start to find fault correct her grammar criticize small things about the way that she dressed and then he would say he was only teasing he would stop laughing at her quips grow impatient with the time she took to get ready his eye would wander to the next new thing cest lamour she didnt really care for saigon too humid and the air was always thick with intrigue it was a hothouse and she found it all rather suffocating sometimes it occurred to her to go back to france not to montpellier with its memories but to paris or maybe lyon the puppet prince kept talking about a trip to paris perhaps she could keep him on the hook until they were there and then let him grow bored with her and leave her with a stipend of course is nicholai hel really dead the thought struck like a punch to the stomach her hand quivered and she had to hold her right wrist with her left hand to steady the pencil but is he really dead and is it my fault was our indiscretion discovered did the emperor find out that his crown had horns and order nicholai killed out of jealousy no she thought if bao dai had done that he couldnt have resisted telling me or at least hinting at it and his ardor in the bedroom has certainly not diminished solange was familiar with the behavior of men who suspected theyd been cuckolded they were sullen and ridiculous wanting sex but not wanting to dip their pens in a contaminated inkwell they alternately sulked and strutted and then either went away or came into bed depending on how she manipulated them of course but bao dai had been his usual cheerful unabashedly lustful self tonight she would go with him again out to dinner somewhere and then doubtless to le grand monde for more gambling just as doubtless to bed where she had better devise some new treat to keep him interested that is unless he has found out and then he could just as well beat me or take me somewhere to be killed if nicholai isnt dead where is he she was thinking this when there was a soft knock on the door the maid finally bringing the hand cloth she had requested an hour ago come in she yelled from the bathroom in the mirror she saw the bearded dwarf de lhandes arrest her diamond said again for what bao dai asked if for nothing else diamond insisted disrespecting you that is a shame bao dai agreed but hardly a crime the argument in bao dais private office in the palace had gone on for quite some time and the emperor was starting to tire of it he did not like this american well he did not like any americans but they were now paying the bills would soon displace the french so he was obliged to listen this gold seemed to have a personal grudge against solange and guibert as to the former it was difficult to feel animosity as to the latter it was virtually unavoidable she knows where he is diamond pressed give me some men let me take her and get the truth out of her and what if she wont tell you bao dai asked she will despite his better instinct bao dai had to acknowledge that the idea had some appeal the woman had after all cuckolded him and he felt it keenly worse his humiliation would soon be the topic for dirty whispers and salacious chuckles all over saigon so the thought of solange under the tender care of the tiger was not without its pleasures there were more practical reasons for seeking her help in locating guibert the flow of opium brought with it a river of gold when added to the healthy inducements that the americans were now paying it all amounted to vast wealth but the amerloques might stop paying if it became public that he was profiting from the heroin that flooded their streets his position in the palace was tenuous the french might seek to replace him if not the americans then there was his ally and partner in crime bay vien who was helping him route money out of the country through lunion corse already he had massive bank accounts in switzerland and landholdings in france spain and morocco against the time that the europeans threw him out or more likely the viet minh won the war but his security would be threatened if operation x were exposed and it was certainly possible that solange was in league with guibert to do just that pick her up he said diamond smiled right away your excellency but hurt her as little as possible bao dai said more to soothe his own conscience than from any hope that this brutal man would calibrate his efforts well leave no scars diamond assured him and her end will look like suicide an overdose perhaps she wouldnt be the first french actress to i dont want to know bao dai said getting inside the house of mirrors unseen was as nothing even in the daylight of morning exhausted from the nights exertions whores sleep in the morning soundly and sweetly and the guards around the brothel were equally somnolent in the rising heat moisture masks sound as surely as dryness enhances it and in the wet morning the cobra was able to slip through the lax security it took time and patience but what didnt the preys room was at the end of the hallway the cobra already knew this but didnt need to know because the faint odor was discernible even behind the closed door a westerner simply smells different from an asian and there were no other europeans in the brothel in the early morning the cobra paused in the hallway and listened the prey was asleep so this would be easy there were no inside locks on whorehouse doors in case security needed to get in quickly to aid a beleaguered girl this would be a simple matter of quietly opening the door dispatching the deceased in his sleep and leaving out the window the cobra moved forward and pulled the knife his proximity sense alerted him nicholai was meditating trying to recover the longlost tranquil state of his boyhood when he became aware of the footfalls in the hallway so soft as to be almost undetectable the light gait of a tiny asian courtesan he wondered had momma sent someone despite his wishes to the contrary he lay still and listened allowed his proximity sense to focus on the target as he did so the steps stopped perfect silence but nicholai knew it wasnt a whore but a predator nicholai slid off the bed to the side opposite the door he flattened himself on the wooden floor and waited the slightest trace of a scent came from the hallway but the door never opened the hunter had sensed the preys awareness and backed off and nicholai realized that this was no ordinary hunter the cobra coiled in the bushes outside the window the prey had been flushed and if it fled would come this way but the prey didnt come the cobra waited for a while then sneaked away you wished to see me monsieur momma asked i wish to see bay vien nicholai answered he is hardly your butler momma said a tad annoyed and besides he has asked me to see to your every need very well nicholai answered i need to leave i have been discovered here impossible momma thundered deeply offended no one in my establishment would breathe a word i assure you more likely it was de lhandes nicholai thought and i played the wrong stone and misjudged his character i will deal with him another time but for now this place has been compromised and i have to find another madame i must depart it is not safe for you out there it is not safe for me in here nicholai said did you send a girl to me a little while ago no monsieur you said quite so nicholai answered did you send anyone no well someone came nicholai said with the intent i believe of killing me whoever had come was a professional nicholai knew who realized that he had been discovered and then laid a trap outside the window he could sense him out there and later when nicholai sensed that he had withdrawn he had looked out the window to see that the bushes were bent down and the slightest trace of footprints were still extant there was something else lingering something that his proximity sense warned him of momma drew in a breath of apparent shock i am devastated monsieur devastated désolée apologies are unnecessary madame nicholai answered but i need to leave right away i will telephone by the frothing jism of jove let me pass sir nicholai heard de lhandess indignant voice echo down the hallway i will have him let him through nicholai said a few moments later an even more than usually tousled de lhandes came into his room i thought you betrayed me nicholai said i thought about it believe me de lhandes answered why didnt you im not entirely certain de lhandes responded and were i you a tantalizing concept now that i think on it i wouldnt advance that query too much further less it impel me to change my mind a great flaw of mind by the way this dithering to and fro and market you like a hung hog in a boucherie but what made you suspect that i had played the judas nicholai told him about what he had sensed in the hallway de lhandes frowned the cobra while i usually find your non sequiturs charming there is a rumor de lhandes said more of a legend really although the distinction between those two qualities is vague at best when one considers for gods sake man of someone they call the cobra de lhandes said supposed to be absolutely deadly with a blade and this is not good news im afraid it is whispered in certain circles that the corsicans are collectively the cobras chief employer lunion corse just so by the cursed blood of bonaparte may it boil in hell de lhandes said so its the corsicans nicholai thought their first attempt turned into a bloody burlesque so they decided to hire their best talent for the next attempt but why realizing that this wasnt the time to ponder that question he asked did you see her she said she will come to you and the papers safely stored michel diamond left the hotel frustrated and angry the blonde bitch that had cuckolded the emperor wasnt in her room he put men out on the saigon streets himself he went to lead the search for nicholai hel bay vien walked into nicholais room at the brothel and said you have to leave now not until i hear from her the sûreté are coming bay argued dont just think of yourself youre endangering everyone in this house well keep looking for her well bring her to you its true nicholai thought he had no right to do that where are we going bay told him what about solange nicholai asked she thinks i will be here ill get word to her de lhandes offered and my men will bring her to you bay said appropriately nicholai thought to my hiding place the swamp of the assassins the rung sat lay southeast of saigon east of the mouth of the soirap river where it drained into the south china sea a wilderness of swamps mangrove forests bamboo and countless little tributaries formed an impenetrable maze to all who didnt know it well the binh xuyen knew it well this was their birthplace and sanctuary where their old pirate raids had originated and returned the place from which their famed assassins emerged to slip into the city kill and then slip back again nicholai lay in the bottom of the skiff as it came downriver then turned east on a small channel in the dense swamp the terrain was surprisingly varied now a flat sundrenched stretch of low vegetation and algae then a dark dense stand of mangroves then a wall of bamboo this pattern repeated itself for an hour and then the boat slowed onto narrower channels pressed hard by the mangroves that loomed beside and above and at times shut out the sky casting the boat into a diurnal darkness a man could get lost in here nicholai thought get lost and never find his way out finally the skiff pulled up alongside a houseboat anchored against a line of mangroves the boat was squat and wide with open decks fore and aft and a cabin in the center binh xuyen troopers machine pistols slung over their shoulders stood on guard bay vien emerged from the aft cabin door and stood on the deck as nicholai stood up you are nothing but trouble michel he said helping him onto the boat is she here yet nicholai asked no bay said impatiently he led nicholai into the cabin which had a small kitchen with a gas cooker a table and a couple of chairs a narrow set of stairs led down into the hull where there was a small hold and sleeping quarters youll be safe here bay said until we can get you on a ship out that was the plan hide him and solange here in the swamp until the next night then take them by boat to a freighter coming out of the saigon docks have you heard from her nicholai asked youre monotonous bay said answer my question no bay vien said im going back to look for her in the first place bay said no one will take you back in the second place you cant get back on your own in the third place even if you did you would only be killed her karma is her karma now nicholai knew that he was right you want tea bay asked he shook his head lit a cigarette instead and sat down in the bamboo chair at the small table relax bay said you relax a man in love bay said shaking his head he jutted his chin toward the hatchway go get some sleep im not tired i said go get some sleep nicholai went down the hatchway into the hold the crates were there crates of rocket launchers bay nodded ill go back to saigon and see whats happening besides there are pursers to bribe ill pay it yes you will he called for the skiff and left nicholai went down into the hold lay down on one of the beds and tried to rest his promise to yu was almost fulfilled he had money and papers now there was only one thing left to do get solange to safety de lhandes waddled down the aisle of the cinema michel had said that solange loved the films the screen was dim some film noir he thought of the type that he couldnt bear de lhandes preferred comedies or period pieces with low bodices and heaving bosoms then a daylight scene brightened the screen and he saw her in the third row he slipped into a seat behind her she was staring up at the screen and weeping as she dabbed a tissue to her eyes mademoiselle de lhandes whispered michel is waiting for you go out the back there are men to take you to him he saw her neck stiffen with doubt you have no reason to trust me he said only that i am an admirer of beauty and like all cynics a disappointed romantic and i am his friend go now mademoiselle solange before it is too late he waited as she decided what to do then she got up slid down the aisle and walked out the back door of the theater guibert wasnt at the house of mirrors nor at le parc nor the continental nor le grand monde he wasnt on rue catinat the central market he was gone diamond cruised the streets if he couldnt find hel hed find someone who would tell him where he could haver ford walked the narrow alleys of cholon if the corsicans had sent another killer it meant that nicholai was still alive and he figured that hel would most likely run to a neighborhood where he spoke the language and knew the customs but no one had seen a tall kweilo who fit hels description or at least no one was talking bernard de lhandes was looking for a decent meal reading the sidewalk boards that listed the evenings fixedprice menus when the men jumped out of the car grabbed him and shoved him onto the floor of the backseat where is your friend diamond asked iii dont know tell me before i hurt you very badly but de lhandes did make them hurt him very badly he made them bruise organs and break bones but in the end he couldnt stand the pain forgive me michel he wept by the sacred blood of saint joan forgive me he told them what they wanted to know the rung sat signavi questioned thats what the little bastard said diamond answered believe me he was telling the truth the french paratrooper found the information troubling the rung sat is binh xuyen country diamond didnt want to hear it hed already gotten the word that la corse had botched the hit on haverford and that the smartmouthed son of a bitch now knew about his connection to operation x and the heroin trade and now hel had made it out of saigon into the socalled swamp of the assassins which could only mean that he was under the protection of bay vien i dont care if hes in the popes living room diamond yelled you have troops send them signavi shook his head americans were so clumsy they would always use an axe when a stiletto would do the cobra will track him down we dont want to get in the way yeah is the cobra as good as the guys you sent to kill haverford diamond asked listen to me if guibert gets away he takes operation x with him its over were finished you think bao dai is going to sit around and watch all his money go down the chute he could see signavi wavering and pressed we know that the woman is on her way to guibert send a team get it done signavi nodded john singleton sat and contemplated the go board he had acquired an appreciation for the game during his days in china but could find no one in washington who could give him a decent match so he preferred to be alone and play both sides it was a good mental exercise disciplining him to see a situation from all perspectives now he looked at the gokang and pondered the whole nicholai hel scenario he reviewed it from all angles considering hels origins his killing of kang sheng as well as voroshenin the arms connection to liu haverfords beijing network of spies hels escape from china into laos his liaison with the binh xuyen he changed his perspective to consider the situation in vietnam the intense viet minh activity in the north the relative quiescence in the south since the last failed communist offensive the fact that the very dangerous ai quoc had been in hiding that hel had delivered the weapons to bay vien instead of to ai quoc the fact that haverford had served in vietnam during the war then there was diamond the allegedly secret operation x his connection to the corsican heroin trade and his visceral hatred for and fear of nicholai hel now both his agents were on the ground in saigon and it would be fascinating to see which of them emerged victorious he found it amusing that each stone on the gokang thought that it determined its own moves and never saw the hand that moved them toward their fates this hel on the other hand he did seem to move himself nicholai heard her footsteps on the hatchway steps solange nicholai her perfume was intoxicating nicholai rolled out of the bed and came to her thank god she said i was so afraid solange pressed herself tight against his chest he wrapped his arms around her trapped the knife against her back and whispered per tu amicu she stiffened ever so slightly and he knew and felt his heart break its you he whispered into her hair youre the cobra then he let her go and took a step back the light in the cabin was dim but he could see in her eyes that it was true lying in the bed waiting for her he had seen it and realized that he should have known sooner the cobra is deadly with a blade la corse had recruited her all the way back in montpellier to kill the german colonel they had taught her to use a knife and she slashed his throat they took her to their base in marseille and used her for other missions she kept her association with la corse but started to freelance both her sexuality and her other skills that night in tokyo after the attack in the garden she came in with a knife in her hand and murder in her eyes were you going to use that if i had to and you knew how didnt you he thought she might have killed him during their romantic rendezvous at the hotel but she knew that she was under observation and would be a suspect but the next day de lhandes had told her about the house of mirrors and she had come as the cobra to kill him his proximity sense had told him it was someone he had encountered before but now he truly realized it life as it really is satori is it picard he asked or picardi picardi she said the corsicans are the best assassins the story you told me nicholai asked how much of it was true most of it she replied the hurtful parts if its any consolation it wasnt how many men have you killed nicholai asked more than you perhaps she said the knife slid out from behind her back she held it low at her waist slightly back out of his reach i make money as i can as a courtesan as a killer tell me the difference in the latter case people die you are hardly in a position to look down at me from a position of moral superiority mon cher solange answered so very true he thought so very true you must have amassed quite a fortune he said i save it she acknowledged the lives of both my professions are quite short beauty and swiftness fade quickly when they fade i will need to retire young im afraid nicholai doubted that her beauty would ever fade not in his eyes at least nor for her eyes those amazing beautiful green eyes he saw her shift her right hip ever so slightly forward the muscles in her calf tightened la corse hired you to kill me he said i told you to walk away from me and not come back was that my unforgivable sin he asked loving you its the one thing a whore cannot abide the tendons in her right wrist tensed it was subtle but he saw it could he stop the lightning lunge he knew was coming perhaps perhaps not if he did block it could he counter with hoda korosu and kill the cobra again perhaps perhaps not nicholai stepped back then kill me her eyes flickered with doubt and suspicion he understood it her past gave her no reason to trust a man he said i would live for you and kill for you so dying for you she shook her head her golden hair shimmering in the lamplight please solange he said free me from my prison just as i freed kishikawasama he closed his eyes both to assure her and to summon his tranquility and breathed deeply this life was as a dream and when the dream ended there would be another and then another in an endless cycle until he realized perfect enlightenment satori he heard her foot turn on the wooden deck the preparatory move for the thrust and readied himself for death she burst forward into his arms i cant she cried god help me je taime je taime je taime je taime aussi over her sobs they heard footsteps crash heavily onto the deck there were eight of them and they were coming for the guns the blackclad troopers from signavis vietnamese special forces piled onto the deck and came down the hatchway solange whirled out of nicholais arms spun again and slashed the first troopers throat she yanked his body clear and then stabbed the second one in the stomach the third went to shoot his pistol but she slashed downward severing his wrist tendons and the pistol clattered down the stairs the shocked trooper grabbed his dangling wrist and stared at her she used the moment to plunge the knife into his throat another trooper vaulted the railing over him and went for her nicholai hit him in midair their momentum sending them crashing into the bulkhead grabbing him by the shirt he threw him scooped up the pistol shot him and pulled solange aside just before a burst of machinegun fire came down the stairs the bullets bounced crazily around the hold as he shoved her into the bulkhead and shielded her as he reached back with his gun hand and fired up the hatchway he could hear the survivors regrouping on the deck and then heard the metallic rattle and saw the grenade bounce down the hatchway pushing solange down he dove grabbed the grenade and tossed it back up the sharp crack of the explosion preceded the screams of gutted men then it was quiet stay here he ordered she shook her head claustrophobia i dont care for closed spaces ever since marseille they frighten me badly stay here anyway he went up onto the deck and saw the dead men a flatbottomed swamp boat bobbed alongside hearing footsteps behind him he whirled and saw solange the knife caked with dark congealing blood still in her hand i told you to you dont tell me what to do she said picking up one of the machine pistols from a dead trooper and slinging it over her shoulder now or in the basque country she stopped as they heard boat motors and the slaps of hulls on the water they were coming and coming fast stay low at least he said then he scrambled down the hatchway nicholai cracked open a crate took one of the rocket launchers found the solvent and quickly wiped the weapon clean of the protective grease even from the hold he could hear the motors getting closer he found a tripod took it and the launcher in either hand and hurried back up the hatchway mon dieu solange said and what do you intend to do with that screw the tripod into the barrel he said sil te plaît he trotted back down to the hold found the ammunition and came back up with two of the rockets eightpound highexplosive antitank rockets with a velocity of feet per second capable of penetrating eleven inches of armor plating at an effective range of a hundred yards or so im told men now he could make out the running lights of the first boat and troopers standing in the bow the boat looked loaded with men nicholai shoved the rocket down the back of the tube then lay down adjusted the tripod and sighted in waiting until the boat came inside the hundredyard range he took a deep breath and pulled the trigger on the exhale the rocket shot out whooshed through the night air and plunged into the water behind the speeding boat solange flipped the machine pistol onto full automatic nicholai sat up reloaded and settled back in again he adjusted the sight waited and fired the boat exploded in scarlet flame men on fire shrieked and leaped into the water solange winced the next boat was coming hard nicholai went for more ammunition came back and sighted in the boat was so close he could hardly miss now so close he could make out the face of bay vien bays men loaded the crates onto the swamp boat as he examined the carnage on and below the deck you killed these eight men he asked nicholai nodded the two of you nicholai nodded again mmmph how did they find us here nicholai asked de lhandes gave in under torture is he dead hell recover bay answered thats good nicholai answered he didnt begrudge his friend the betrayal under torture bay shouted for his men to hurry we dont have much time he explained theyll be coming with more men getting you on the freighter is out now police and soldiers are checking every boat theyre all over the harbor maybe we can get her on board but not you i wont leave without him solange said where are we going nicholai asked up the river bay said into the delta deliver the guns to the viet minh and then find a way to get you out of the country it might take some time we have time nicholai said but he wasnt entirely sure rocket launchers diamond asked signavi confirmed that rockets had sunk two boatloads of his men and sent them plunging into the swamp of the assassins god damn nicholai hel to a fiery death of his own diamond thought and god damn that traitor haverford who had to have had a hand in this do you know where he might be headed signavi asked hes taking them to the viet minh diamond said guibert is a chinese agent you told me he was an american narcotics agent grow up diamond said i lied either way the man had to be found and killed signavi took command of the military operation to sweep the delta and find guibert and the weapons a shipment of those weapons to the viet minh could change the course of the war im going with you diamond said he hated battles but this was his best chance to kill nicholai hel haverford looked at de lhandes in the hospital bed who did this to you he asked one of yours de lhandes murmured through the painkilling drugs thats why i asked to see you im hoping youre better than that he told haverford about giving up michel and solanges whereabouts then fell back into unconsciousness haverford left the hospital in a cold white rage he went back to his office checked out a service and went hunting for diamond they made it safely up the river navigating without running lights past naval patrols hiding in channels mangrove swamps and stands of bamboo then they took a tiny tributary little more than a stream north through the swamp until they came out on the dengnai river south of saigon safely crossing the stream they landed near a small village where the people helped them transfer the cargo to a canvascovered truck whats the name of this place nicholai asked binh xuyen bay vien chuckled were pretty safe here they took some tea and rice with pickled vegetables then got into the truck and drove the roadway inland then left the truck and the main road and set off on foot daylight found them carrying the crates along dikes built above the rice paddies steaming now in the cloying humidity that came just before the monsoon season nicholai and solange dressed unconvincingly in the black shirt and trousers and conical hats of vietnamese farmers walked in the center of the small column just enough binh xuyen to carry the load a handful of armed guards with bay vien in the lead it was treacherous country flat and open observable by french aerial surveillance vulnerable to the watchtowers and blockhouses that punctuated the landscape it was too risky so they decided to abandon the dikes for the low rice paddies trudging through sometimes waisthigh water was exhausting progress was excruciatingly slow and they had to stop and flatten themselves in the water every time they heard an airplane engine at this pace nicholai thought they would never make it to the rendezvous with the viet minh solange although stoic and uncomplaining was clearly played out her calves and ankles were cut from blade grass and her eyes showed a dunning fatigue are you all right he asked her splendid she said ive always enjoyed a stroll in the country she pushed ahead of him just before midday bay walked back to them its too dangerous he said we have to stop for the day nicholai agreed but asked where theres a bled just a kilometer or so from here bay answered the villagers owe their allegiance to me nicholai knew exactly what that meant if the people of the tiny hamlet betrayed them the binh xuyen would come back and kill them all it saddened him but he understood collective responsibility was an asian tradition when they made it to the bled nicholai and solange lay on the floor of a dark hut and tried to get a little sleep there wasnt much time to rest they would move out again as soon as it was dark and hope to make some progress before the moon rose solange fell asleep but nicholai lay awake listening to the sound of airplanes circling above them the tension in the village was palpable especially when in the late afternoon he heard whispers that a foreign legion patrol was just a half kilometer away the village collectively held its breath nicholai laid his hand on the warm metal of the machine pistol and waited he wasnt going to be captured he had seen all he wanted of the interrogation room and the cell if they took him they would take him as a corpse then he decided that was selfish if it looks as if were going to be discovered i will hand her the ivanov bankbooks then hold a gun on her and let them think we took her as a hostage then i will find a way to kill myself on the way to the prison that resolved nicholai watched through the bottom slats as a legion officer stood on the edge of the village and questioned its elder the man shrugged his shoulders and waved his finger in an arc indicating that the foreigners could be anywhere in any one of the dozens of villages nestled among the rice paddies the young lieutenant looked at him skeptically nicholai noticed that his finger had tightened on the trigger the lieutenant stared at the old man for a second the old man stared back and then the lieutenant ordered his men to move on nicholai lay back and looked at solange sleeping he drifted off himself and when he woke up it was dusk a few minutes later bay came in followed by a woman with bowls of rice and steamed fish solange woke up and they ate then got ready to resume the march they walked the dikes now shielded by the neat rows of mulberry trees staying in tight formation they literally walked in each others footsteps and made reasonably good time until the moon rose and lit them then they stretched apart and moved by twos and threes the scouts going ahead and whistling signals that it was safe for the next group to move the local militias were out walking the dikes themselves going from village to village several times its patrols came within eyesight and nicholais party flattened themselves to the ground and bellycrawled if they moved at all it was a deadly game of hideandseek in the moonlight a match of stealth and wits to nicholais surprise solange was very good at it she moved with a quicksilver grace and silence and he laughed at himself when he remembered that she was not only solange but the cobra she is more experienced at this he thought than i am the night seemed to go forever but they made about ten miles before the sky started to turn to the stony gray of predawn and they came to a long line of mulberries a half mile from a small hamlet bay signaled them to lie and wait a few minutes later nicholai heard the single sharp whistle to come ahead and he quickstepped in a slouch along the dike until he reached the relative safety of the tree line there was a small clearing among the trees and there he saw xue xin its good to see you again nicholai said and you xue xin answered he looked so different now in the light khaki jacket of a viet minh officer with a holstered pistol on his hip you knew wed meet again said nicholai i always knew it xue xin said i knew your true nature more than i did nicholai thought his name wasnt xue xin of course but ai quoc nicholai saw it clearly now quoc had controlled the operation and had counted on nicholai to honor his deal with colonel yu i knew quoc continued that you would realize the truth and see things for what they are and now i want a life nicholai said quoc looked past him to see solange and smiled we will do our best to get you out it might require some patience on your part i have become the personification of patience why do i have my doubts it must be your monklike wisdom nicholai answered all that clipping of vines and deep breathing the sky was turning a coral pink quoc said we should be going nicholai walked up to bay vien where are you going now back to saigon bay answered to curse your name to the heavens for stealing my weapons and getting away with it will they believe you yes or theyll pretend to bay said for a while longer anyway then he left it unfinished it was obvious no one knew the future no man could say what his karma held in store for him goodbye nicholai said i hope we see each other again in better times we will bay answered bay gathered his men and headed out we need to go quoc said his soldiers thirtyodd veterans started to heft the crates on bamboo poles and were already walking north quoc began to limp after them the airplane came out of the east wing guns blazing strafing the tree line it came in low and out of the sun three viet minh went down like toy soldiers knocked off a shelf the shells splintered trees spraying shards of wood like shrapnel nicholai tackled solange and lay on top of her the ground shook under them from the vibrations of the lowflying plane go now quoc yelled as the plane rose to come around for another strafing run nicholai got to his feet and pulled solange up behind him and hand in hand they ran for the next rice paddy racing to get over the exposed dike before the plane completed its turn its wings shone in the rising sun as it banked came back and dove a hawk on the hunt they made it over the dike but two more viet minh behind them werent as lucky and were picked off easily nicholai and solange slid down the slope into the muck of the rice paddy and plunged under the surface holding her hand as he held his breath nicholai tried to listen for the now muted popping of the guns and the sound of the planes engines as it climbed again when he heard a higherpitched whine he pushed up and together he and solange sloshed across the rice paddy looking around nicholai saw that quoc had survived the last attack and was waving them toward a copse of trees on the far side of the paddy ahead of them the men carrying one of the crates made it over the top of the dike and disappeared from sight another viet minh lay down on his back on the dike and started to fire his machine gun up at the plane which was now coming in behind them solange jerked him down and again they held their breath and felt the rounds zip into the water around them when they came back up the plane was climbing in front of them it waggled its wings and kept flying away apparently out of ammunition or low on fuel nicholai and solange made it across the paddy over the dike and into the copse of trees where the viet minh were regrouping wounded porters fell out as other men took their place loads were shifted weapons exchanged a soldier who was apparently a medic gave rudimentary aid with the scant supplies at hand other men were beyond help and lay dead or dying nicholai found a rifle and picked it up solange draped the sling of a burp gun around her neck they walked to the far edge of the trees in front of them stretched a long rectangle of tall sword grass bordered on the right and left by paddy dikes beyond the grass rose another stand of trees well be safe once we get there quoc said pointing to the trees why is that nicholai asked we disappear nicholai had no patience for zen metaphysics if quoc whether he was really a monk or not thought they were going to meditate themselves into thin air nicholai wanted a more mundane plan the plane had flown off but the pilot had certainly radioed their position to the patrols that were thick on the ground it wouldnt be long before troops arrived and they would run out of neither bullets nor fuel the french troops and native militia that had been crisscrossing the countryside would converge in a neat organized pattern and surround them the sheltering trees would become a death trap unless quoc had an actual plan for escape our motherland will swallow us quoc said poetic nicholai thought but hardly practical of course his mind went to a different metaphor the gokang and he saw it all too clearly their little pool of black stones would soon stretch into a thin line and progress toward quocs apparently magic trees there to group into a pool again the white stones and there were many more of them were even now gathering around them go players had a term for such an isolated surrounded group dead stones and nicholai recognized the flat gokang surface had become an anachronism the ancients never anticipated modern airpower which literally added another dimension to the game they couldnt have imagined stones floating above the board delivering death and destruction below nor he had to admit was go a model for battle the gokang was serene quiet perfect in its organization and form the modern battlefield was chaotic noisy hellish in the anarchy of its blood carnage and agony modernity he thought has destroyed so much he forced his mind back to the reality on the ground trap or no the copse on the far side of the grass was a better position than the one they now occupied its size created a larger defensive perimeter from which to make a last stand he made it to be a little less than a half mile away so it should take only minutes to reach but the sword grass would be a painful impediment although doubtless narrow foot and game trails had been cut through the chesthigh blades the burden of the weapons especially now that there were fewer porters would slow them down further perhaps no quoc would never think of abandoning the weapons and when nicholai looked at it honestly neither would he they had come at too high a cost the quiet behind told him that the viet minh were ready to move out he turned and saw that they would leave their dead comrades everything useful had been removed from their bodies it comes at a high cost your freedom nicholai said for every enemy we kill quoc answered they will kill ten of us and in the end it wont matter save perhaps to the ten the individual is nothing when compared to the whole quoc answered nicholai stared at him seeing his true nature and perhaps a bit of his own youre wrong he said you will come to see i hope not nicholai said i hope never if each individual became only part of the machine at the end of the day there would be only the machine the inexorable impersonal grinding machinery of the modern he turned away from quoc took solange by the arm and walked her away out of hearing i was thinking he said about the first meal well have when we get to wherever were going oh yes she said and what were you thinking you made a dish back in tokyo i made a number of dishes back in tokyo solange said her wide mouth opening into a smile nothing can dim the light in those green eyes he thought the coq au vin perhaps simple french country cooking simplicity sounds wonderful nicholai said with what wine then she speculated on a number of choices narrowing it down to a handful and then finding it impossible to choose then they discussed which vegetables they would have as side dishes how they should be prepared and then which dessert would be best a tarte tatin or perhaps a marquise au chocolat should we invite de lhandes nicholai asked yes of course solange answered but he must leave straight after coffee so we can make love out he goes then she kissed him long and lovingly they were only fifty yards into the sword grass when the shooting started turning to his left nicholai saw the line of legionnaires come onto the dike and to the far right of the troops he thought he saw a soldier with a vermilion beret directing their fire signavi nicholai lifted his rifle to his shoulder and returned fire shooting to his left but moving ahead the copse of trees was their only faint hope and they had to keep moving for getting bogged down in the grass was certain death quoc saw it and ordered a dozen men to form a screening line to their left to try to slow up the french advance and buy enough time to get the weapons into the trees the porters were amazingly disciplined not pausing to shoot or drop to the ground or even duck they just kept shouldering their loads and moving ahead at a slow trot signavi saw what they were doing directed fire on them and several of the porters dropped the others strained to carry the weight and a couple of viet minh lowered their rifles and took their places on the bamboo poles two legionnaires fell as the screening line came into action and nicholai saw signavi direct a squad to his left toward the copse to cut off the viet minh if the french got into the trees first it was over he shouted to solange can you run she nodded they took off the saw grass slicing their faces and chests as they ran toward the copse angling off to the left to block the french several viet minh joined them and they ran through the grass as bullets zipped around their heads one man dropped and then another and then it was as if they had disturbed an angry nest of hornets and the air buzzed around them but most of them made it to a tiny rise above a ripple of ground and from there they could lay down fire on the flanking legionnaires forcing them to stop drop to the ground and engage in a firefight behind him the porters moved toward the trees nicholai looked back to the dike and saw signavi talk into a radio attached to the backpack of one of his soldiers no nicholai thought please no he raised his rifle sighted in took a deep breath and fired the bullet hit signavi in the high spine and he clutched at his back and then fell but it was too late only a minute later nicholai heard the plane engine and then he saw it but this time it didnt drop low to strafe but stayed high until it was directly above the rectangle of grass and then it dropped its load napalm the grass caught fire immediately and a wall of flame rolled toward them men ignited like torches and spun madly around shrieking others seemed to simply melt nicholai took solanges hand and ran the wave of flame rolled behind them like a fiery red tsunami from a nightmare nicholai felt it scorch his back and singe his hair as the intense heat seemed to suck the air from his lungs he pushed solange into the trees quoc was thirty yards ahead of them waving them forward but leaves above him were inexplicably dropping leaves dont fall in the springtime nicholai thought weirdly then he saw that bullets were clipping them off the branches and at the far end of the copse he saw vietnamese militia coming toward them we are dead stones he thought the flames were fast coming up behind the french rapidly working their way to the left and the militia was in front and on the right if we run to the front right or left nicholai saw we will only run straight into the guns if we stay here we will burn surviving was not an option they had only a choice of death quoc waved violently here here nicholai looked more closely and saw a viet minh crouch at quocs feet and then disappear into the earth tunnels he thought our motherland will swallow us sure enough when he reached the middle of the copse nicholai saw small square openings the viet minh were taking the rocket launchers out of the crates and handing them down the tunnel entrances come on quoc said pointing to the little square hole at his feet it was narrow solange could squeeze through it maybe nicholai could you first he said she balked i told you im claustrophobic i cant you have to he helped solange get down into the square hole and watched as she wiggled her shoulder and made her way down then he looked forward to the far end of the copse he could make out individual soldiers they were advancing too quickly for the viet minh to get the rest of the weapons down the tunnel even if they did they wouldnt have time to cover up the entrances again or escape in what could only be a vast and complicated maze of tunnels they would be trapped and caught solange with them quoc misapprehended his hesitation you are also afraid of tight spaces nicholai smiled thinking of his blissful days exploring caves with his japanese friends no he pointed toward the advancing troops we need more time yes take care of her nicholai said she isnt one of your ten you have my word quoc quickly chose five of his best men and nicholai went with them toward the edge of the copse the gunfire increased branches dropped on them men fell when they got to the edge of the trees one of the viet minh bent over and opened a square of earth then they lay down and started to fire across the open ground nicholai felt a body fall beside him then he was facetoface with the blazing green eyes of angry solange i said i wasnt leaving without you im sorry dont ever do that again she laid the stock of the machine pistol against her cheek and started shooting diamond flattened himself onto the ground and peered through the grass at the copse of trees nicholai hel was trapped between the approaching flames and the rifles he hoped hel chose the fire a harsh roar came up as the fire hit the trees nicholai turned and saw them go the flames climbing up the trunks and then igniting in the leafy branches with a hideous whoosh a viet minh ran from the center of the trees and signaled the weapons were in the tunnels time to disappear nicholai said they crawled back to the tunnel entrance solange balked but nicholai helped her and she squeezed down when she was clear nicholai lowered himself into the hole his wide shoulders snug against the entrance it was a very tight fit and for a few seconds he thought he might not make it at all but his caving experience had taught him how to narrow his shoulders and he felt solange tug at his legs and then he slid down the entrance shaft four viet minh came behind them and the last one pulled the tunnel entrance shut behind him another one gave his life to replace the camouflage on top nicholai found himself in a small oval chamber that opened to a narrow horizontal shaft just high enough to crawl into on all fours lanterns apparently run off a generator were hung every twenty feet and although the light was dim they could see to move he eased solange into the next tunnel and crawled behind her a minute later nicholai heard the flames erupt above them it would have been a bad death are you all right he asked solange i hate this i know he paused then followed solange into the next chamber this one was larger high enough to stand up in three horizontal shafts came off it in different directions they rested for a moment then one of the viet minh led them into another shaft reached behind him and ripped a plug from a cable plunging the tunnels behind them into darkness diamond cursed when the tunnel went black he had found the hastily camouflaged entrance and led several of the vietnamese down the shaft into the first chamber they crawled until they came to the chamber with the three shafts then split up diamond took one of the men with him and was sure that he had the right tunnel as he could see recent scrape marks in the dirt below and could swear he heard the sound of movement like rodents ahead of him he was on the track and then darkness hit fighting off a momentary panic he felt for the flashlight on his belt turned it on and shone it in front of him the light in his left hand his in his right he crawled forward they crawled until they came to what seemed to be a dead end but another shaft ran sharply to the right and they took it and then repeated this process of seeming dead ends until this maze zigzagged at least three hundred yards and nicholai roughly reckoned that they must be literally out of the woods they came to a chamber that had a vertical shaft and they descended a wooden ladder another twenty feet down to a much larger chamber your home for the next couple of days quoc said it was an underground barracks of sorts woodenframed bunk beds lined the walls rudely constructed wooden chairs were placed about some medical supplies bottles of water and canned foods were neatly stacked and organized there was even a small shelf of books and relatively fresh air was being pumped from a narrow ventilator shaft its quite good nicholai said but i prefer the continental im sure mancini would be pleased to welcome you quoc answered shall i call for a reservation thats all right or the beijing hotel im growing fonder of this establishment by the second nicholai said assuming of course that the price is reasonable your bill has already been taken care of quoc said its a small city down here nicholai said how far does this complex go now quoc said almost all the way to the outreaches of saigon eventually all the way to the suburbs and then you pop out of the ground with rocket launchers and take the city nicholai said when the time is right quoc said hopefully before the americans blunder in you will stay down here for a few days then we will get you out i think through cambodia if that suits you that will be fine solange said she took a bottle of water sipped from it and handed it to nicholai we will leave you alone ai quoc said he and his men left the chamber to see to the rocket launchers diamond crawled to a dead end and realized that he must have chosen one of the false tunnels they were clever these communist rats he started to back out then paused and felt a small waft of air he shone the flashlight to his right saw the concealed shaft and headed into it soon he came to another dead end damn these bastards to hell he thought then he saw the next shaft he was halfway through the maze of zigzags when he heard a dull throb above him nicholai looked up so did solange they stared at the ceiling as if they actually thought that they could see what they were hearing a lowpitched hum and then a whining sound and then the bombs hit the bombers came in directly over the tunnel complex and laid their ordnance in a spread pattern over a rectangle of a thousand square yards the chamber shook dirt fell from the ceiling it all held for a moment and then there was a horrific bass thud and the bunk beds came down and the neat stacks of supplies and the walls quivered and more dirt came down and then the lights went out nicholai heard solange moan mon dieu mon dieu he reached for her hand found it and pulled her forward his mind reconstructing the chamber and locating the shaft he found it with his hand reached up for the rungs and pulled her behind him we have to get up he yelled and then he felt her find her feet and they climbed up the ladder to the next chamber they had to get up and out quickly or they would be buried alive a slow suffocating death in the dark nicholai were all right he said were all right stay with me he pulled her up into the next chamber it was pitch dark now a tight cloying blackness as he forced himself to remember the layout it was difficult in the noise of the explosions above them the falling dirt the concussive force of the blasts you have been here many times before he told himself in many caves in tighter spots than this so think he found the tunnel entrance first with his mind and then with his hands then he took off his shirt tied one sleeve to his belt and the other to solanges come on he said were going to be fine he led them into the entrance and they started back diamond spat the dirt out of his mouth and rubbed it from his eyes god damn the frogs he thought didnt they know he was down here or did they know and didnt care come on he said to the soldier behind him there was no answer the man was dead he plunged ahead the tunnel was fast coming in around them as nicholai pulled solange along they came to one false wall after another but nicholai had the route firmly in his head and he crawled quickly encouraging solange all the way almost there thats good oh thats very good diamond heard voices speaking french he stopped lay flat and held the pistol out in front of him nicholais proximity sense warned him someone was around the sharp right angle in front of them he stopped what ssshh a bomb blast rattled the walls dirt slid narrowing the tunnel his ears ringing nicholai couldnt hear he slid forward on his stomach and then a muzzle flash lit the tunnel and he saw diamond diamond crawled forward shooting in front of him nicholai reached his right hand as far as it would go clutched at the air and grabbed diamonds wrist solange your knife diamond ripped his arm backward and freed his hand he lowered the pistol again toward nicholais face nicholai felt the powder blast burn his cheek he reached again in the dark lunging out with a punch your knife solange coiled as much as she could in the narrowing confine of the tunnel she pushed out with her long legs and squeezed past nicholai her knife in front of her diamond pulled the trigger the muzzle flash blinded nicholai he crawled past solange and heard diamond crawling away he started to go after him but then he heard solange moan diamond would have to wait he stopped and turned to solange are you all right he asked her yes but then he felt the warm stickiness of her blood she was bleeding badly from the side he couldnt see in the stygian darkness but he could feel so could she please dont let me die down here i wont let you die anywhere he said another blast rocked the tunnel dirt fell into their faces their eyes their noses their mouths he felt for her face brushed the dirt away then turned onto his back and started to pull himself along the tunnel shaft pulling her behind him it was excruciatingly slow and he knew she was losing blood fast the tunnel was collapsing they were half buried and he could only feel his way along turn his head and try to smell the way to open air he had to do it he couldnt let her die after an eternity he turned saw a faint beam of sunlight and sensed a fleeting breath of fresh air he pulled until they reached the bottom of the tunnel entrance were there he gasped now he clawed his way up the shaft with one hand and pulled her with the other he climbed and fell four times before his hand gripped the surface with enough purchase to pull her weight up behind him he collapsed on the surface and pulled her into his arms were here my love he said we made it but solange was still limp and lifeless in his arms he wiped a strand of her golden hair from her green eyes and closed them then the next bomb hit he awoke in a bed clean crisp sheets tight around his legs haverford looked down at him good morning where youre in a saigon hospital haverford said a foreign legion patrol found you staggering around out in the delta you were severely concussed had some seconddegree burns shrapnel wounds and three broken ribs solange im sorry haverford said then nicholai remembered a deep sorrow came over him why arent i in a cell he asked looking around the room it was impossibly white and clean ah haverford said your name is rené dazin youre a french merchant that the viet minh kidnapped you were very lucky that the bombing raid happened to set you free my friend the same bombing raid that killed michel guibert who made up that story i did of course haverford said but you might want to get out of the country as soon as you can walk which should be when might be another month or so haverford answered i have a clean passport for you you recuperate then you disappear nicholai nodded and even that small move made his head throb but he was heartened that haverford thought he needed the passport even though he had voroshenins multiple identities safely stashed with de lhandes the american agent nicholai thought will believe he has me on a leash and he will be wrong then he asked diamond he made it out haverford said rats usually do good nicholai answered relieved that diamond hadnt been killed by an impersonal bomb he would visit diamond personally and hold him to account not only for himself but for solange haverford leaned closer and whispered ai quoc made it too so did the weapons you were working with him all the time nicholai said he saw it now all of it haverford had played a very deep game of go and played it well since we fought the japanese together haverford answered its a triple for me the soviets and the chinese at knifepoint mao weakened and a chance for quoc to take saigon and end this war before we can get into it do your bosses know i think so haverford answered my boss respects victory i get promoted diamond gets put out to graze who knows maybe you and i will get together again sometime for tea id like that me too chum haverford said sayonora helsan sayonara haverfordsan nicholai lay back and looked out the window at the pretty garden in the courtyard outside slashes of silver rain started to fall the beginning of the wet season the beginning of a lot of things he had a new identity the means to effect his revenge access to the ivanov fortune not to mention the money he won from bao dai after settling matters with diamond and his cohorts he could start a new life if indeed he thought there is such a thing as a new life without solange there is he thought there must be because you are alive and that is your karma and it is your karma also that you are free now truly free but to do what he asked himself how do you use your freedom you are a killer a warrior a samurai no not a samurai for you are not attached to any master you are a ronin a wanderer an individual so what does the ronin do now how do you spend this life that has been restored to you you begin by killing diamond he decided and then you go on to rid the world of as many diamonds as you can the men who kill the innocent who torture intimidate brutalize and terrorize in the name of some cause that they believe in more than their own humanity he heard kishikawas voice hai nikkosan it is a good way to spend a life he looked out the window and saw the hard rain shear a leaf from a branch the leaf fluttered to the ground shimmering gold and green in the rain satori acknowledgments first to richard pine and michael carlisle for emailing to ask if i knew the meaning of the word shibumi and for

word shibumi mean anything to you i thought what are these guys doing back in new york crossword puzzles but i wrote back helpfully it means understated elegance in japanese richard responded how did you know that i answered with what i thought was obvious back in the day there had been a famous book called shibumi which a bunch of my friends and i just gobbled up it featured an assassin named nicholai hel who was inter alia an expert in the japanese game of go we all took up the game i was terrible at it and played it well into many nights i also recalled that hel had a villa in the basque country that he tried to imbue with the spirit of shibumi the book i needlessly typed to richard was written by an author whose pen name was trevanian figuring that i had put this curious correspondence to bed i turned on the electric kettle to make myself a cup of nescafé it was a typical english summer day with the rain pelting against the window like the clacking of an old typewriter and i was looking to the coffee to keep the chill off as i searched for a pair of dry socks and a snorkel with which to venture out for my next lecture so in truth i was a little annoyed when i heard the bong of another email summons and thought that prominent literary agents that they are richard and his cohort michael carlisle at inkwell could probably figure out a tenletter word for total destruction without my help richards message read how would you like to be the next trevanian well im not and nobody will be rodney whitaker aka trevanian had such a unique and powerful voice that an attempt to imitate him would leave any writer looking like the second runnerup at a thirdrate comedy clubs open mike night so i approached the possibility of writing a prequel to shibumi with great trepidation first of all what would the whitaker family think and how would his legion of devoted fans respond to a pretender to the throne but more importantly could i find a way to be true to the substance and style of the mans work without falling into the trap of offensiveand ultimately futilemimicry but the temptation to try was overwhelming how could you not seize the opportunity to work with a character as complex and fascinating as nicholai hel how could you not accept the challenge to create within the parameters of the fascinating plot that trevanian merely hinted at in shibumia story that begins in japan proceeds to china and then finds its way to vietnam not only did i admire trevanians work but i also have a great love of asia its culture and history so the chance to combine those enthusiasms was irresistible i sat down and wrote a letter of introduction to the whitaker family they have been nothing short of wonderful alexandra whitaker has been pitchperfect in safeguarding her fathers legacy without coming even close to suffocating this nervous writer during his efforts to do the same she has offered discreet invaluable counsel and i truly hope that i have repaid her kindness with quality i usually work very much alonein almost reclusive solitudebut this was a very different experience in writing satori i quickly became aware that i was representing a group of people who were passionately excited and invested in the hel saga the aforementioned messrs pine and carlisle offered crucial critiques and suggestions mitch hoffman the editor at grand central was an amazingly thoughtful and perceptive contributor at first i was concerned that i would find all this close attention a bit much in fact the opposite was trueconspiring with this team to create a work worthy of trevanian has been more fun than a writer should be allowed to have the work was nevertheless daunting i had to recreate the asia of and a research task that was as rewarding as it was enormous more complex was the challenge of styling a nicholai hel that the reader would recognize as the fully formed man of shibumi while at the same time writing a character who was twentysix years oldand a neophyte in the world of espionageat the time of the story then there was the task of trying to blend my own voice into that of trevanians as well as writing to the corners of the story that he had left in place all of which is to say that i had a wonderful time writing this book what a gift i was given from a very brief email on a rainy day in oxford i hope that ive passed even a small part of that on to the reader don winslow don winslow
