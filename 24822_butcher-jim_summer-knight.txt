summer knight book of the dresden files jim butcher this book is for big sisters everywhere who have enough patience not to strangle their little brothersand particularly for my own sisters who had more than most i owe you both so much and for mom for reasons that are so obvious that they really dont need to be saidbut i thought i would make special mention of candy cane cookies and that rocking chair that creaked me to sleep acknowledgments the author thats me wishes to thank all the people who should have been thanked in other booksricia and aj obviously and the mighty jen thank you to all the folks who have been so supportive of my work all along including but not limited to wil and erin who fed me great chicago information and who i missed the first time around fred and chris martina and caroline and debra and cam and jess and monica and april thank you also to you mighty librarians who have tricked people into reading these books and to the bookstore personnel and lurkers who have gone out of their way to help me get noticed i admit to being somewhat baffled but im very grateful to you all i owe thanks to so many people that i probably am incapable of remembering everyone if i missed someone let shannon know she will club me on the head with a baseball bat and point out the mistake ps shannon and jj as always thank you id promise to be less of a weirdo but we all know how long that one would last chapter one it rained toads the day the white council came to town i got out of the blue beetle my beatup old volkswagen bug and squinted against the midsummer sunlight lake meadow park lies a bit south of chicagos loop a long sprint from lake michigans shores even in heat like wed had lately the park would normally be crowded with people today it was deserted but for an old lady with a shopping cart and a long coat tottering around the park it wasnt yet noon and my sweats and tshirt were too hot for the weather i squinted around the park for a moment took a couple of steps onto the grass and got hit on the head by something damp and squishy i flinched and slapped at my hair something small fell past my face and onto the ground at my feet a toad not a big one as toads goit could easily have sat in the palm of my hand it wobbled for a few moments upon hitting the ground then let out a bleary croak and started hopping drunkenly away i looked around me and saw other toads on the ground a lot of them the sound of their croaking grew louder as i walked further into the park even as i watched several more amphibians plopped out of the sky as though the almighty had dropped them down a laundry chute toads hopped around everywhere they didnt carpet the ground but you couldnt possibly miss them every moment or so you would hear the thump of another one landing their croaking sounded vaguely like the speechchatter of a crowded room weird huh said an eager voice i looked up to see a short young man with broad shoulders and a confident walk coming toward me billy the werewolf wore sweatpants and a plain dark tshirt a year or two ago the outfit would have concealed the forty or fifty extra pounds hed been carrying now they concealed all the muscle hed traded it in for he stuck out his hand smiling what did i tell you harry billy i responded he crunched down hard as i shook his hand or maybe he was just that much stronger hows the werewolf biz getting interesting he said weve run into a lot of odd things lately when weve been out patrolling like this he gestured at the park another toad fell from the sky several feet away thats why we called the wizard patrolling holy vigilantes batman any of the normals been here no except for some meteorological guys from the university they said that they were having tornadoes in louisiana or something that the storms must have thrown the toads here i snorted youd think its magic would be easier to swallow than that billy grinned dont worry im sure someone will come along and declare it a hoax before long uhhuh i turned back to the beetle and popped the hood to rummage in the forward storage compartment i came out with a nylon backpack and dragged a couple of small cloth sacks out of it i threw one to billy grab a couple of toads and pitch them in there for me he caught the bag and frowned why so i can make sure theyre real billy lifted his eyebrows you think theyre not i squinted at him look billy just do it i havent slept i cant remember the last time i ate a hot meal and ive got a lot to do before tonight but why wouldnt they be real they look real i blew out a breath and tried to keep my temper it had been short lately they could look real and feel real but its possible that theyre just constructs made out of the material of the nevernever and animated by magic i hope they are why because all that would mean is that some faerie got bored and played a trick they do that sometimes okay but if theyre real if theyre real then it means something is out of whack what kind of out of whack the serious kind holes in the fabric of reality and that would be bad i eyed him yeah billy that would be bad it would mean something big was going down but what if my temper flared i dont have the time or inclination to teach a class today shut the hell up he lifted a hand in a pacifying gesture okay man whatever he fell into step beside me and started picking up toads as we walked across the park so uh its good to see you harry me and the gang were wondering if you wanted to come by this weekend do some socializing i scooped up a toad of my own and eyed him dubiously doing what he grinned at me playing arcanos man the campaign is getting really fun roleplaying games i made a monosyllabic sound the old lady with the shopping cart wandered past us the wheels of the cart squeaking and wobbling seriously its great he insisted were storming the fortress of lord malocchio except we have to do it in disguise in the dead of night so that the council of truth wont know who the vigilantes who brought him down were theres spells and demons and dragons and everything interested sounds too much like work billy let out a snort harry look i know this whole vampire war thing has you jumpy and grouchy but youve been lurking in your basement way too much lately what vampire war billy rolled his eyes word gets around harry i know that the red court of the vampires declared war on the wizards after you burned down biancas place last fall i know that theyve tried to kill you a couple of times since then i even know that the wizards white council is coming to town sometime soon to figure out what to do i glowered at him what white council he sighed its not a good time for you to be turning into a hermit harry i mean look at you when was the last time you shaved had a shower a haircut got out to do your laundry i lifted a hand and scratched at the wiry growth of beard on my face ive been out ive been out plenty of times billy snagged another toad like when i went to that football game with you and the alphas he snorted yeah in january dresden its june billy glanced up at my face and frowned people are worried about you i mean i know youve been working on some project or something but this whole unwashed wild man look just isnt you i stooped and grabbed a toad you dont know what youre talking about i know better than you think he said its about susan right something happened to her last fall something youre trying to undo maybe something the vampires did thats why she left town i closed my eyes and tried not to crush the toad in my hand drop the subject billy planted his feet and thrust his chin out at me no harry dammit you vanish from the face of the earth youre hardly showing up at your office wont answer your phone dont often answer your door were your friends and were worried about you im fine i said youre a lousy liar word is that the reds are bringing more muscle into town that theyre offering their groupies full vampirehood if one of them brings you down hells bells i muttered my head started to ache it isnt a good time for you to be outside by yourself even during daylight i dont need a babysitter billy harry i know you better than most i know you can do stuff that other people cantbut that doesnt make you superman everyone needs help sometimes not me not now i stuffed the toad into my sack and picked up another i dont have time for it oh that reminds me billy drew a folded piece of paper out of the pocket of his sweats and read it youve got an appointment with a client at three i blinked at him what i dropped by your office and checked your messages a ms sommerset was trying to reach you so i called her and set up the appointment for you i felt my temper rising again you did what his expression turned annoyed i checked your mail too the landlord for the office dropped off your eviction notice if you dont have him paid off in a week hes booting you out what the hell gives you the right to go poking around in my office billy or calling my clients he took a step in front of me glaring i had to focus on his nose to avoid the risk of looking at his eyes get off the high horse harry im your freaking friend youve been spending all your time hiding in your apartment you should be happy im helping you save your business youre damned right its my business i spat the shopping cart lady circled past in my peripheral vision cart wheels squeaking as she walked behind me mine as in none of yours he thrust out his jaw fine how about you just crawl back into your cave until they evict you from that too he spread his hands good god man i dont need to be a wizard to see when someones in a downward spiral youre hurting you need help i jabbed a finger into his chest no billy i dont need more help i dont need to be babysitting a bunch of kids who think that because theyve learned one trick theyre ready to be the lone ranger with fangs and a tail i dont need to be worrying about the vamps targeting the people around me when they cant get to me i dont need to be secondguessing myself wondering who else is going to get hurt because i dropped the ball i reached down and snatched up a toad jerking the cloth bag from billys hands on the way back up i dont need you naturally the hit went down right then it wasnt subtle as attempted assassinations go an engine roared and a black compact pickup truck jumped the curb into the park fifty yards away it jounced and slewed to one side tires digging up furrows in the sunbaked grass a pair of men clung to a roll bar in the back of the truck they were dressed all in black complete with black sunglasses over black ski masks and their guns matchedautomatic weapons in the miniuzi tradition get back i shouted with my right hand i grabbed at billy and shoved him behind me with my left i shook out the bracelet on my wrist hung with a row of tiny medievalstyle shields i lifted my left hand toward the truck and drew in my will focusing it with the bracelet into a sudden transparent shimmering halfglobe that spread out between me and the oncoming truck the truck ground to a halt the two gunmen didnt wait for it to settle with all the fire discipline of an actionmovie extra they pointed their guns more or less at me and emptied their clips in one roaring burst sparks flew from the shield in front of me and bullets whined and hissed in every direction as they ricocheted my bracelet grew uncomfortably warm within a second or two the energy of the shield taxing the focus to its limit i tried to angle the shield to deflect the shots up into the air as much as possible god only knew where all those bullets were goingi just hoped that they wouldnt bounce through a nearby car or some other passerby the guns clicked empty with jerky unprofessional motions both gunmen began to reload harry billy shouted not now but i lowered the shield and lifted my right handthe side that projects energy the silver ring i wore on my index finger had been enchanted to save back a little kinetic energy whenever my arm moved i hadnt used the ring in months and it had a whale of a kick to itone i hardly dared to use on the gunmen that much force could kill one of them and that would be basically the same as letting them fill me full of bullets it would just take a little longer to set in the white council did not take kindly to anyone violating the first law of magic thou shalt not kill id slipped it once on a technicality but it wouldnt happen again i gritted my teeth focused my shot just to one side of the gunmen and triggered the ring raw force unseen but tangible lashed through the air and caught the first gunman with a glancing blow across his upper body his automatic slammed against his chest and the impact tore the sunglasses off his head and shredded bits of his clothes even as it flung him back and out of the pickup to land somewhere on the ground on the other side the second gunman got less of the blast what did hit him struck against his shoulder and head he held on to his gun but lost the sunglasses and they took the ski mask with them revealing him to be a plainlooking boy who couldnt have been old enough to vote he blinked against the sudden light and then resumed his fumbling reload kids i snarled lifting my shield again theyre sending kids after me hells bells and then something made the hairs on the back of my neck try to lift me off the ground as the kid with the gun started shooting again i glanced back over my shoulder the old lady with her shopping basket had stopped maybe fifteen feet behind me i saw now that she wasnt as old as i had thought i caught a flicker of cool dark eyes beneath age makeup her hands were young and smooth from the depths of the shopping basket she pulled out a sawedoff shotgun and swung it toward me bullets from the chattering automatic slammed against my shield and it was all i could do to hold it in place if i brought any magic to bear against the third attacker i would lose my concentration and the shield with itand inexpert or not the gunman on the truck was spraying around enough lead that sooner or later he wouldnt miss on the other hand if the disguised assassin got a chance to fire that shotgun from five yards away no one would bother taking me to the hospital id go straight to the morgue bullets hammered into my shield and i couldnt do anything but watch the third attacker bring the shotgun to bear i was screwed and probably billy was along with me billy moved he had already gotten out of his tshirt and he had enough muscle to rippleflat hard muscle athletes muscle not the carefully sculpted build of weight lifters he dove forward toward the woman with the shotgun and stripped out of his sweatpants on the fly he was naked beneath i felt the surge of magic that billy used thensharp precise focused there was no sense of ritual in what he did no slow gathering of power building to release he blurred as he moved and between one breath and the next billythenaked was gone and billythewolf slammed into the assailant a darkfurred beast the size of a great dane fangs slashing at the hand that gripped the forward stock of the shotgun the woman cried out jerking her hand back scarlet blood on her fingers and swept the gun at billy like a club he twisted and caught the blow on his shoulders a snarl exploding from him he went after the womans other hand faster than i could easily see and the shotgun tumbled to the ground the woman screamed again and drew back her hand she wasnt human her hands distended lengthening as did her shoulders and her jaw her nails became ugly ragged talons and she raked them down at billy striking him across the jaw this time eliciting a pained yelp mixed with a snarl he rolled to one side and came up on his feet circling in order to force the womanthings back to me the gunman in the truck clicked on empty again i dropped the shield and hurled myself forward diving to grip the shotgun i came up with it and shouted billy move the wolf darted to one side and the woman whipped around to face me her distorted features furious mouth drooling around tusklike fangs i pointed the gun at her belly and pulled the trigger the gun roared and bucked slamming hard against my shoulder tengauge maybe or slug rounds the woman doubled over letting out a shriek and stumbled backward and to the ground she wasnt down long she almost bounced back to her feet scarlet splashed all over her rag of a dress her face wholly inhuman now she sprinted past me to the truck and leapt up into the back the gunman hauled his partner back into the truck with him and the driver gunned the engine the truck threw out some turf before it dug in jounced back onto the street and whipped away into traffic i stared after it for a second panting i lowered the shotgun realizing as i did that i had somehow managed to keep hold of the toad i had picked up in my left hand it wriggled and struggled in a fashion that suggested i had been close to crushing it and i tried to ease up on my grip without losing it i turned to look for billy the wolf paced back over to his discarded sweatpants shimmered for a second and became once more the naked young man there were two long cuts on his face parallel with his jaw blood ran down over his throat in a fine sheet he carried himself tensely but it was the only indication he gave of the pain you all right i asked him he nodded and jerked on his pants his shirt yeah what the hell was that ghoul i told him probably one of the lachaise clan theyre working with the red court and they dont much like me why dont they like you ive given them headaches a few times billy lifted a corner of his shirt to hold against the cuts on his face i didnt expect the claws theyre sneaky that way ghoul huh is it dead i shook my head theyre like cockroaches they recover from just about anything can you walk yeah good lets get out of here we headed toward the beetle i picked up the cloth sack of toads on the way and started shaking them back out onto the ground i put the toad id nearly squished down with them then wiped my hand off on the grass billy squinted at me why are you letting them go because theyre real how do you know the one i was holding crapped on my hand i let billy into the blue beetle and got in the other side i fetched the first aid kit from under my seat and passed it over to him billy pressed a cloth against his face looking out at the toads so that means things are in a bad way yeah i confirmed things are in a bad way i was silent for a minute then said you saved my life he shrugged he didnt look at me so you set up the appointment for three oclock right what was the name sommerset he glanced at me and kept the smile from his mouthbut not from his eyes yeah i scratched at my beard and nodded ive been distracted lately maybe i should clean up first might be good billy agreed i sighed im an ass sometimes billy laughed sometimes youre human like the rest of us i started up the beetle it wheezed a little but i coaxed it to life just then something hit my hood with a hard heavy thump then again another heavy blow on the roof a feeling of dizziness swept over me a nausea that came so suddenly and violently that i clutched the steering wheel in a simple effort not to collapse distantly i could hear billy asking me if i was all right i wasnt power moved and stirred in the air outsidehectic disruption the forces of magic usually moving in smooth and quiet patterns suddenly cast into tumult disruptive maddening chaos i tried to push the sensations away from me and labored to open my eyes toads were raining down not occasionally plopping but raining down so thick and hard that they darkened the sky no gentle laundrychute drop for these poor things either they fell like hailstones splattering on concrete on the hood of the beetle one of them fell hard enough to send a spiderweb of cracks through my windshield and i dropped into gear and scooted down the street after a few hundred yards we got away from the otherworldly rain both of us were breathing too fast billy had been right the rain of toads meant something serious was going on magically speaking the white council was coming to town tonight to discuss the war i had a client to meet and the vampires had evidently upped the stakes no pun intended striking at me more openly than they had dared to before i flipped on the windshield wipers amphibian blood left scarlet streaks on the cracked glass good lord billy breathed yeah i said it never rains it pours chapter two i dropped billy off at his apartment near campus i didnt think the ghoul would be filing a police report but i wiped down the shotgun anyway billy wrapped it in a towel i had in the backseat of the beetle and took it with him promising to dispose of the weapon his girlfriend georgia a willowy girl a foot taller than him waited on the apartments balcony in dark shorts and a scarlet bikini top displaying a generous amount of impressively sunbronzed skin in a manner far more confident and appealing than i would have guessed from her a year before my how the kids had grown the moment billy got out of the car georgia looked up sharply from her book and her nostrils flared she headed into the house and met him at the door with a first aid kit she glanced at the car her expression worried and nodded to me i waved back trying to look friendly from georgias expression i hadnt managed better than surly they went into the apartment and i pulled away before anyone could come out to socialize with me after a minute i pulled over killed the engine and squinted up at myself in the rearview mirror of the beetle it came as a shock to me i know that sounds stupid but i dont keep mirrors in my home too many things can use mirrors as windows even doors and it was a risk i preferred to skip entirely i hadnt glanced at a mirror in weeks i looked like a train wreck more so than usual i mean my features are usually kind of long lean all sharp angles ive got almostblack hair to go with the dark eyes now i had grey and purplish circles under them deep ones the lines of my face where they werent covered by several months of untrimmed beard looked as sharp as the edges of a business card my hair had grown out long and shaggynot in that sexyyoungrockstar kind of way but in that timetotakerovertothegroomer kind of way it didnt even have the advantage of being symmetrical since a big chunk had been burned short in one spot when a small incendiary had been smuggled to me in a pizza delivery box back when i could still afford to order pizza my skin was pale pasty even i looked like death warmed over provided someone had made death run the boston marathon i looked tired burned out used up i sat back in my seat i hate it when im wrong but it looked like maybe billy and the werewolves stars and stones they sounded like a bad rock band had a point i tried to think of the last time id gotten a haircut a shave id had a shower last week hadnt i i mopped at my face with my shaking hands the days and nights had been blurring lately i spent my time in the lab under my apartment researching twentyfour seven the lab was in the subbasement all damp stone and no windows circadian rhythms bah id pretty much dispensed with day and night there was too much to think about to pay attention to such trivial details about nine months before id gotten my girlfriend nearly killed maybe more than killed susan rodriguez had been a reporter for a yellow journal called the midwestern arcane when we met she was one of the few people around who were willing to accept the idea of the supernatural as a factual reality shed clawed for every detail every story every ounce of proof she could dig up so that she could try to raise the public consciousness on the matter to that end shed followed me to a vampire shindig and the monsters got her billy had been right about that too the vampires the red court had changed her or maybe it would be more accurate to say that they infected her though she was still human technically shed been given their macabre thirst if she ever sated it she would turn all the way into one of them some part of her would die and she would be one of the monsters body and soul thats why the research id been looking for some way to help her to create a vaccine or to purge her body something anything id asked her to marry me she told me no then she left town i read her syndicated column in the arcane she must have been mailing them in to her editor so at least i knew she was alive shed asked me not to follow her and i hadnt i wouldnt until i could figure out a way to get her out of the mess id gotten her into there had to be something i could do had to be there had to be i bowed my head suddenly grimacing so hard that the muscles of my face cramped ached and smoldered my chest felt tight and my body seemed to burn with useless impotent flame im a wizard i should have been able to protect susan should have been able to save her should have been able to help her should have been smarter should have been faster should have been better should have told her you loved her before it was too late right harry i tried not to cry i willed myself not to with all of my years of training and experience and selfdiscipline it would accomplish nothing it wouldnt put me anywhere closer to finding a cure for susan i was so damned tired i left my face in my hands i didnt want someone walking by to see me bawling it took a long time to get myself back under control im not sure how long it was but the shadows had changed and i was baking in the car even with the windows down it occurred to me that it was stupid to be sitting there on the street for more vampire thugs to come find plain as day i was tired and dirty and hungry but i didnt have the cash to get anything to eat and by the sun i didnt have the time to go back to the apartment for soup not if i was to keep my appointment with ms sommerset and i needed that appointment billy had been right about that too if i didnt start earning my keep again i would lose the office and the apartment i wouldnt get much magical research done from a cardboard box in an alley time to get moving then i raked my fingers uselessly through my mop of hair and headed for my office a passing clock told me that i was already a couple of minutes late for the appointment between that and my appearance boy was i going to wow the client this day just kept getting better my office is in a building in midtown it isnt much of a building but it still looked too good for me that day i got a glare from the aging security guard downstairs and felt lucky that he recognized me from previous encounters a new guy probably would have given me the bums rush without blinking i nodded at the guard and smiled and tried to look businesslike heh i walked past the elevator on my way to the stairs there was a sign on it that said it was under repair the elevator hadnt ever been quite the same since a giant scorpion had torn into one of the cars and someone had thrown the elevator up to the top of its chute with a torrent of wind in order to smash the big bug against the roof the resulting fall sent the car plummeting all the way back to the ground floor and wreaked havoc with the building in general raising everyones rents or thats what i heard anyway dont look at me like that it could have been someone else okay maybe not the orthodontist on four or the psychiatrist on six probably not the insurance office on seven or the accountant on nine either maybe not the lawyers on the top floor maybe but it isnt always me when something goes catastrophically wrong anyway no one can prove anything i opened the door to the stairwell and headed up the stairs to my office on the fifth floor i went down the hall past the quiet buzz of the consulting firm that took up most of the space on the floor to my office door the lettering on the frosted glass read harry dresdenwizard i reached out to open the door a spark jumped to my finger when my hand got within an inch or three of the doorknob popping against my skin with a sharp little snap of discomfort i paused even with the buildings ac laboring and wheezing it wasnt that cool and dry call me paranoid but theres nothing like a murder attempt in broad daylight to make a man cautious i focused on my bracelet again drawing on my apprehension to ready a shield should i need it with the other hand i pushed open the door to my office my office is usually pretty tidy or in any case i didnt remember it being quite as sloppy as it looked now given how little id been there lately it seemed unfair that it should have gotten quite that bad the table by the door where i kept a bunch of flyers with titles like magic for dummies and im a wizardask me how sat crookedly against the wall the flyers were scattered carelessly over its surface and onto the floor i could smell the faintest stink of longburnt coffee i must have left it on oops my desk had a similar fungus coating of loose papers and several drawers in my filing cabinets stood open with files stacked on top of the cabinets or thrust sideways into their places so that they stood up out of the drawers my ceiling fan whirled woozily clicking on every rotation someone had evidently tried to straighten things up my mail sat neatly stacked in three different piles both metal trash cans were suspiciously empty billy and company then in the ruins of my office stood a woman with the kind of beauty that makes men murder friends and start wars she stood by my desk with her arms folded facing the door hips cocked to one side her expression skeptical she had white hair not whiteblond not platinum white as snow white as the finest marble bound up like a captured cloud to bare the lines of her slender throat i dont know how her skin managed to look pale beside that hair but it did her lips were the color of frozen mulberries almost shocking in a smooth and lovely face and her oblique eyes were a deep green that tinted to blue when she tilted her head and looked me over she wasnt old wasnt young wasnt anything but stunning i tried to keep my jaw from hitting the floor and forced my brain to start doing something by taking stock of her wardrobe she wore a womans suit of charcoal grey the cut immaculate the skirt showed exactly enough leg to make it hard not to look and her dark pumps had heels just high enough to give you ideas she wore a bonewhite vneck beneath her jacket the neckline dipping just low enough to make me want to be watching if she took a deep breath opals set in silver flashed on her ears at her throat glittering through an array of colors i wouldnt have expected from opalstoo many scarlets and violets and deep blues her nails had somehow been lacquered in the same opalescence i caught the scent of her perfume something wild and rich heavy and sweet like orchids my heart sped up and the testosteroneoriented part of my brain wished that id been able to bathe or shave or at least that i hadnt worn sweatpants her mouth quirked into a smile and she arched one pale brow saying nothing letting me gawk one thing was certainno woman like that would have anything less than money lots of money money i could use to pay the rent buy groceries maybe even splurge a little and get a wheelbarrow to help with cleaning my apartment i only hesitated for a heartbeat wondering if it was proper for a fullfledged wizard of the white council to be that interested in cash i made up my mind fast phenomenal cosmic powers be damned i have a lease uh ms sommerset i presume i managed finally no one can do suave like me if i was careful i should be able to trip over something and complete the image im harry dresden i believe you are late she replied sommerset had a voice like her outfitrich suggestive cultured her english had an accent i couldnt place maybe european definitely interesting your assistant informed me when to arrive i dont like to be kept waiting so i let myself in she glanced at my desk then back at me i almost wish i hadnt yeah i didnt hear you were coming until uh i looked around at my office dismayed and shut the door behind me i know this looks pretty unprofessional quite correct i moved to one of the chairs i keep for clients facing my desk and hurriedly cleared it off please sit down would you like a cup of coffee or anything sounds less than sanitary why should i take the risk she sat her back straight on the edge of the chair following me with her eyes as i walked around the desk they were a cool noticeable weight on me as i moved and i sat down at my desk frowning are you the kind who takes chances i like to hedge my bets she murmured you for example mister dresden i have come here today to decide whether or not i shall gamble a great deal upon your abilities she paused and then added thus far you have made less than a sterling impression i rested my elbows on my desk and steepled my fingers yeah i know that all this probably makes me look like a desperate man she suggested someone who is clearly obsessed with other matters she nodded toward the stacks of envelopes on my desk one who is shortly to lose his place of business if he does not pay his debts i think you need the work she began to rise and if you lack the ability to take care of such minor matters i doubt you will be of any use to me wait i said rising please at least let me hear you out if it turns out that i think i can help you she lifted her chin and interrupted me effortlessly but that isnt the question is it she asked the question is whether or not i think you can help me you have shown me nothing to make me think that you could she paused sitting back down again and yet i sat back down across from her yet i have heard things mister dresden about people with your abilities about the ability to look into their eyes i tilted my head i wouldnt call it an ability it just happens yet you are able to see within them you call it a soulgaze do you not i nodded warily and started adding together lots of small bits and pieces yes revealing their true nature seeing the truth about the person upon whom you look and they see me back yes she smiled cool and lovely then let us look upon one another mister dresden you and i then i will know if you can be of any use to me surely it will cost me nothing i wouldnt be so sure its the sort of thing that stays with you like an appendectomy scar or baldness when you look on someones soul you dont forget it not ever i didnt like the direction this was going i dont think it would be a good idea but why not she pressed it wont take long will it mister dresden thats really not the issue her mouth firmed into a line i see then if you will excuse me this time i interrupted her ms sommerset i think you may have made a mistake in your estimations her eyes glittered anger showing for a moment cool and far away oh i nodded i opened the drawer to my desk and took out a pad of paper yeah ive had a rough time of things lately you cant possibly know how little that matters to me i drew out a pen took off the lid and set it down beside the pad uhhuh then you come in here rich gorgeouskind of too good to be true and she inquired too good to be true i repeated i drew thecaliber revolver from the desk drawer leveled it at her and thumbed back the hammer call me crazy but lately ive been thinking that if somethings too good to be true then it probably isnt put your hands on the desk please her eyebrows arched those gorgeous eyes widened enough to show the whites all the way around them she moved her hands swallowing as she did and laid her palms on the desk what do you think you are doing she demanded im testing a theory i said i kept the gun and my eyes on her and opened another drawer see lately ive been getting nasty visitors so its made me do some thinking about what kind of trouble to expect and i think ive got you pegged i dont know what you are talking about mister dresden but i am certain save it i rummaged in a drawer and found what i needed a moment later i lifted a plain old nail of simple metal out of the drawer and put it on the desk whats that she all but whispered litmus test i said then i flicked the nail gently with one finger and sent it rolling across the surface of my desk and toward her perfectly manicured hands she didnt move until a split second before the nail touched herbut then she did a blur of motion that took her two long strides back from my desk and knocked over the chair shed been sitting on the nail rolled off the edge of the desk and fell to the floor with a clink iron i said cold iron faeries dont like it the expression drained from her face one moment there had been arrogant conceit haughty superiority blithe confidence but that simply vanished leaving her features cold and lovely and remote and empty of all emotion of anything recognizably human the bargain with my godmother has months yet to go i said a year and a day she had to leave me alone that was the deal if shes trying to weasel out of it im going to be upset she regarded me in that empty silence for long moments more it was unsettling to see a face so lovely look so wholly alien as though something lurked behind those features that had little in common with me and did not care to make the effort to understand that blank mask made my throat tighten and i had to work not to let the gun in my hand shake but then she did something that made her look even more alien more frightening she smiled a slow smile cruel as a barbed knife when she spoke her voice sounded just as beautiful as it had before but it was empty quiet haunting she spoke and it made me want to lean closer to her to hear her more clearly clever she murmured yes not too distracted to think just what i need a cold shiver danced down my spine i dont want any trouble i said just go and we can both pretend nothing happened but it has she murmured just the sound of her voice made the room feel colder you have seen through this veil proven your worth how did you do it static on the doorknob i said it should have been locked you shouldnt have been able to get in here so you must have gone through it and you danced around my questions rather than simply answering them still smiling she nodded go on you dont have a purse not many women go out in a threethousanddollar suit and no purse mmmm she said yes youll do perfectly mister dresden i dont know what youre talking about i said im having nothing more to do with faeries i dont like being called that mister dresden youll get over it get out of my office you should know mister dresden that my kind from great to small are bound to speak the truth that hasnt slowed your ability to deceive her eyes glittered and i saw her pupils change slipping from round mortal orbs to slow feline lengths cateyed she regarded me unblinking yet have i spoken i plan to gamble and i will gamble upon you uh what i require your service something precious has been stolen i wish you to recover it let me get this straight i said you want me to recover stolen goods for you not for me she murmured for the rightful owners i wish you to discover and catch the thief and to vindicate me do it yourself i said in this matter i cannot act wholly alone she murmured that is why i have chosen you to be my emissary my agent i laughed at her that made something else come into those perfect pale featuresanger anger cold and terrible flashed in her eyes and all but froze the laugh in my throat i dont think so i said im not making any more bargains with your folk i dont even know who you are dear child she murmured a slow edge to her voice the bargain has already been made you gave your life your fortune your future in exchange for power yeah with my godmother and thats still being contested no longer she said even in this world of mortals the concept of debt passes from one hand to the next selling mortgages yes my belly went cold what are you saying her teeth showed sharp and white it wasnt a smile your mortgage mortal child has been sold i have purchased it you are mine and you will assist me in this matter i set the gun down on my desk and opened the top drawer i took out my letter opener one of the standard machined jobs with a heavy flat blade and a screwgrip handle youre wrong i said and the denial in my voice sounded patently obvious even to me my godmother would never do that for all i know youre trying to trick me she smiled watching me her eyes bright then by all means let me reassure you of the truth my left palm slammed down onto the table i watched startled as i gripped the letter opener in my right hand slashermovie style in a panic i tried to hold back my hand to drop the opener but my arms were running on automatic like they were someone elses wait i shouted she regarded me cold and distant and interested i slammed the letter opener down onto the back of my own hand hard my desk is a cheap one the steel bit cleanly through the meat between my thumb and forefinger and sank into the desk pinning me there pain washed up my arm even as blood started oozing out of the wound i tried to fight it down but i was panicked in no condition to exert a lot of control a whimper slipped out of me i tried to pull the steel away to get it out of my hand but my arm simply twisted wrenching the letter opener counterclockwise the pain flattened me i wasnt even able to get enough breath to scream the woman the faerie reached down and took my fingers away from the letter opener she withdrew it with a sharp decisive gesture and laid it flat on the desk my blood gleaming all over it wizard you know as well as i were you not bound to me i would have no such power over you at that moment most of what i knew was that my hand hurt but some dim part of me realized she was telling the truth faeries dont just get to ride in and play puppet master you have to let them in id let my godmother lea in years before when i was younger dumber id given her the slip last year forced an abeyance of her claim that should have protected me for a year and a day but now shed passed the reins to someone else someone who hadnt been in on the second bargain i looked up at her pain and sudden anger making my voice into a low harsh growl who are you the woman ran an opalescent fingernail through the blood on my desk she lifted it to her lips and idly touched it to her tongue she smiled slower more sensual and every bit as alien i have many names she murmured but you may call me mab queen of air and darkness monarch of the winter court of the sidhe chapter three the bottom fell out of my stomach a faerie queen a faerie queen was standing in my office i was looking at a faerie queen talking to a faerie queen and she had me by the short hairs boy and id thought my life was on the critical list already fear can literally feel like ice water it can be a cold feeling that you swallow that rolls down your throat and spreads into your chest it steals your breath and makes your heart labor when it shouldnt before expanding into your belly and hips leaving quivers behind then it heads for the thighs the knees occasionally with an embarrassing stop on the way stealing the strength from the long muscles that think you should be using them to run the hell away i swallowed a mouthful of fear my eyes on the poisonously lovely faerie standing on the other side of my desk it made mab smile yes she murmured wise enough to be afraid to understand at least in part how does it feel to know what you know child my voice came out unsteady and more quiet than i would have liked sort of like tokyo when godzilla comes up on the beach mab tilted her head watching me with that same smile maybe she didnt get the reference or maybe she didnt like being compared to a thirtystory lizard or maybe she did like it i mean how should i know i have enough trouble figuring out human women i didnt meet mabs eyes i wasnt worried about a soulgaze any longer both parties had to have a soul for that to happen but plenty of things can get to you if you make eye contact too long it carries all sorts of emotions and metaphors i stared at mabs chin my hand burning with pain and said nothing because i was afraid i hate being afraid i hate it more than anything in the whole world i hate being made to feel helpless i hate being bullied too and mab might as well have been ramming her fist down my throat and demanding my lunch money the faerie queens were bad news big bad news short of calling up some hoary old god or squaring off against the white council itself i wasnt likely to run into anything else with as much raw power as mab i could have thrown a magical sucker punch at her could have tried to take her out but even if wed been on even footing i doubt i would have ruffled her hair and she had a bond on me a magical conduit she could send just about anything right past my defenses and there wouldnt be anything i could do about it bullies make me madand ive been known to do some foolish things when im angry forget it i said my voice hot no deal get it over with and blast me lock the door on your way out my response didnt seem to ruffle her she folded her arms and murmured such anger such fire yes i watched you stalemate your godmother the leanansidhe autumn last few mortals ever have done as much bold impertinent i admire that kind of strength wizard i need that kind of strength i fumbled around on my desk until i found the tissue dispenser and started packing the wound with the flimsy fabric i dont really care what you need i told her im not going to be your emissary or anything else unless you want to force me and i doubt id be much good to you then so do whatever youre going to do or get out of my office you should care mister dresden mab told me it concerns you explicitly i purchased your debt in order to make you an offer to give you the chance to win free of your obligations yeah right save it im not interested you may serve wizard or you may be served as a meal do you not wish to be free i looked up at her warily visions of barbecued me on a table with an apple in my mouth dancing in my head what do you mean by free free she said wrapping those frozenberry lips around the word so that i couldnt help but notice free of sidhe influence of the bonds of your obligation first to the leanansidhe and now to me the whole thing a wash we go our separate ways precisely i looked down at my hurting hand and scowled i didnt think you were much into freedom as a concept mab you should not presume wizard i adore freedom anyone who doesnt have it wants it i took a deep breath and tried to get my heart rate under control i couldnt let either fear or anger do my thinking for me my instincts screamed at me to go for the gun again and give it a shot but i had to think it was the only thing that could get you clear of the fae mab was on the level about her offer i could feel that sense it in a way so primal so visceral that there was no room left for doubt she would cut me loose if i agreed to her bargain of course her price might be too high she hadnt gotten to that yet and the fae have a way of making sure that further bargains only get you in deeper instead of into the clear just like credit card companies or those student loan people now theres evil for you i could feel mab watching me sylvester to my tweetie bird that thought kind of cheered me up generally speaking tweetie kicks sylvesters ass in the end okay i told her im listening three tasks mab murmured holding up three fingers by way of visual aid from time to time i will make a request of you when you have fulfilled three requests your obligation to me ceases silence lay on the room for a moment and i blinked what thats it mab nodded any three tasks any three requests mab nodded just as simple as that i mean you say it like that and i could pass you the salt three times and that would be that her eyes greenblue like glacial ice remained on my face unblinking do you accept i rubbed at my mouth slowly mulling it over in my head it was a simple bargain as these things went they could get really complicated with contracts and everything mab had offered me a great package sweet neat and tidy as a halloween candy which meant that id be an idiot not to check for razor blades and cyanide i decide which requests i fulfill and which i dont even so and if i refuse a request there will be no reprisals or punishments from you she tilted her head and blinked her eyes slowly agreed you not i will choose which requests you fulfill there was one land mine id found at least and no more selling my mortgage either or whistling up the lackeys to chastise or harass me by proxy this remains between the two of us she laughed and it sounded as merry clear and lovely as bellsif someone pressed them against my teeth while they were still ringing as your godmother did fool me twice shame on me wizard agreed i licked my lips thinking hard had i left her any openings could she get to me any other way well wizard mab asked have we a bargain i gave myself a second to wish id been less tired or less in pain the events of the day and the impending council meeting this evening hadnt exactly left my head in worldclass negotiating condition but i knew one thing for certain if i didnt get out from under mabs bond i would be dead or worse than dead in short order better to act and be mistaken than not to act and get casually crushed all right i said we have a bargain when i said the words a little frisson prickled over the nape of my neck down the length of my spine my wounded hand twitched in an aching painful pang mab closed her eyes smiling a feline smile with those dark lips and inclined her head good yes you know that look on wile e coyotes face when he runs at full steam off the cliff and then realizes what hes done he doesnt look down but he feels around with one toe and right then right before he falls his face becomes drawn with a primal dread thats what i must have looked like i know it was pretty much what i felt like but there was no help for it maybe if i didnt stop to check for the ground underneath my feet id keep going indefinitely i looked away from mab and tried to tend to my hand as best i could it still throbbed and disinfecting the wound was going to hurt a lot more i doubted it would need sutures a small blessing i guess a manila envelope hit my desk i looked up to see mab drawing a pair of gloves onto her hands whats this i asked my request she replied within are the details of a mans death i wish you to vindicate me of it by discovering the identity of his killer and returning what was stolen from him i opened the envelope inside was an eightbyten glossy blackandwhite of a body an old man lay at the bottom of a flight of stairs his neck at a sharp angle to his shoulders he had frizzy white hair a tweed jacket accompanying the picture was an article from the tribune headlined local artist dies in midnight accident ronald reuel i said glancing over the article ive heard of him has a studio in bucktown i think mab nodded hailed as a visionary of the american artistic culture though i assume they use the term lightly creator of worlds of imagination it says i guess now that hes dead theyll say all kinds of nice things i read over the rest of the article the police called it an accident it was not mab responded i looked up at her how do you know she smiled and why should you care i asked it isnt like the cops are after you there are powers of judgement other than mortal law it is enough for you to know that i wish to see justice done she said simply that uhhuh i said frowning you said something was stolen from him what youll know it i put the picture back in the envelope and left it on my desk ill think about it mab assured me you will accept this request wizard dresden i scowled at her and set my jaw i said ill think about it mabs cateyes glittered and i saw a few white white teeth in her smile she took a pair of dark sunglasses from the pocket of her jacket is it not polite to show a client to the door i glowered but i got up out of the chair and walked to the door the faerie queens heady perfume the narcotic scent of her enough to make me a little dizzy i fought it away and tried to keep my scowl in place opening the door for her with a jerky motion your hand yet pains you she asked what do you think mab placed her gloved hand on my wounded one and a sudden spike of sheer vicious cold shot up through the injury like a frozen scalpel before lancing up my arm straight toward my heart it took my breath and i felt my heart skip a beat two before it labored into rhythm again i gasped and swayed and only leaning against the door kept me from falling down completely dammit i muttered trying to keep my voice down we had a deal i agreed not to punish you for refusing me wizard i agreed not to punish or harass you by proxy mab smiled i did that just for spite i growled that isnt going to make it more likely that i take this case you will take it emissary mab said her voice confident expect to meet your counterpart this evening what counterpart as you are winters emissary in this matter summer too has sought out one to represent her interests i got plans tonight i growled and i havent taken the case mab tilted her dark glasses down cat eyes on mine wizard do you know the story of the fox and scorpion i shook my head looking away fox and scorpion came to a brook mab murmured her voice low sweet wide was the water scorpion asked fox for a ride on his back fox said scorpion will you not sting me scorpion said if i did it would mean the death of us both fox agreed and scorpion climbed onto his back fox swam but halfway over scorpion struck with his deadly sting fox gasped fool you have doomed us both why i am a scorpion said scorpion it is my nature thats the story i said dont quit your day job mab laughed velvet ice and it sent another shiver through me you will accept this case wizard it is what you are it is your nature then she turned and walked down the hall aloof reserved cold i glowered after her for a minute before i shut the door maybe id been shut away in my lab too long but spenser never mentions that the faerie queen has a great ass so i notice these things so sue me chapter four i leaned against my door with my eyes closed trying to think i was scared not in that halfpleasant adrenalinecharged way but quietly scared waitontheresultsofmedicaltests scared its a rational sort of fear that puts a lawn chair down in the front of your thoughts and brings a cooler of drinks along with it i was working for the queen of wicked faerieswell queen of winter of the unseelie faeries at any rate the unseelie werent universally vicious and evil any more than the seelie the summer fae were all kind and wise they were much like the season for which they had been namedcold beautiful pitiless and entirely without remorse only a fool would willingly associate with them not that mab had given me much of a choice but technically speaking there had been one i could have turned her down flat and accepted whatever came i chewed on my lip given the kind of business i was in i hadnt felt the need to spend too much time hunting for a good retirement plan wizards can live a long long time but most of the ones that do tend to be the kind that stick at home in their study not many tossed their gauntlets into as many faces as i had id been clever a couple of times lucky a couple of times and id come out ahead of the game so farbut sooner or later the dice were going to come up snake eyes it was as simple as that and i knew it fear maybe that was why id agreed to mabs bargain susans life had been twisted horribly and that was my fault i wanted to help her before i went down swinging but some little voice in the back of my head told me that i was being awfully noble for someone who had flinched when push had come to shove the little voice told me that i was making excuses some part of me that doesnt trust much and believes in even less whispered that i had simply been afraid to say no to a being who could probably make me long for death if i denied her either way it was too late for questions now id made the bargain for better or worse if i didnt want it to end badly id better start figuring out how to get out of it without getting swallowed up in faerie politics i wouldnt do that by taking the case of ronald reuel i was pretty damn sure mab wouldnt have offered it if she hadnt thought it would get me further entangled than i already was maybe she had me in a metaphysical armlock but that didnt mean i was going to jump every time she said frog i could figure out something else and besides i had other problems on my mind there wasnt much time to spare before the council meeting that evening so i got my things together and got ready to leave i paused at the door with that nagging feeling i get when im forgetting something my eyes settled on my stack of unpaid bills and i remembered money id come here to get a case to make some cash to pay my bills now i was hipdeep in trouble and heading straight out to sea and i hadnt gotten a retainer or made one red cent i swore at myself and pulled the door shut behind me youd think as long as i was gambling with my soul i would have thought to get mab to throw in fifty bucks an hour plus expenses i headed out to start taking care of business traffic in chicago can be the usual nightmare of traffic in any large american city but that afternoons was particularly bad stuck behind a wreck up ahead the beetle turned into an oven and i spent a while sweating and wishing that i wasnt too much of a wizard for a decent modern air conditioner to survive that was one of the hazards of magical talent technology doesnt get along so well when there is a lot of magic flying around anything manufactured after world war ii or so seemed prone to failure whenever a wizard was nearby stuff with microcircuits and electrical components and that kind of paraphernalia seemed to have the most trouble but even simpler things like the beetles air conditioner usually couldnt last long running late i dropped by my apartment and waded through the wreckage looking for my gear for the meeting i couldnt find everything and i didnt have time to get a shower the refrigerator was empty and all i could find to eat was a halfwrapped candy bar id started and never finished i stuffed it into my pocket then headed for the meeting of the white council of wizardry where i was sure to cut a devastating swath with my couth hygiene and natural grace i pulled into the parking lot across the street from mccormick place complex one of the largest convention centers in the world the white council had rented one of the smaller buildings for the meeting the sun hung low in the sky growing larger and redder as it dropped toward the horizon i parked the beetle in the relative cool of the lowest level of the parking garage got out of the car and walked around to the front to open the trunk i was shrugging into my robe when i heard a car coming in engine rumbling and rattling a black ford pickup complete with rounded fenders and woodenslat sides on the bed pulled into the empty space next to mine there wasnt any rust on the old machine and it gleamed with fresh wax a weathered shotgun rode on top of a wooden rack against the rear wall of the passenger compartment and in the slot beneath it sat a worn old wizards staff the ford crunched to a halt with a kind of dinosaur solidity and a moment later the engine died the driver a short stocky man in a white tshirt and blue denim overalls opened the door and hopped down from the truck with the brisk motions of a busy man his head was bald except for a fringe of downy white tufts and a bristling white beard covered his mouth and jowls he slammed the door shut with thoughtless strength grinned and boomed hoss good to see you again ebenezar i responded if without the same earringing volume i felt myself answer his grin with my own and stepped over to him to shake his offered hand i squeezed hard purely out of selfdefense he had a grip that could crush a can of spinach youd better take the shotgun down chicago pd is picky about people with guns ebenezar snorted and said im too old to go worrying about every fool thing what are you doing out of missouri sir i didnt think you came to council meetings he let out a barking laugh the last time i didnt they saddled me with this useless teenage apprentice now i dont hardly dare miss one they might make him move in again i laughed i wasnt that bad was i he snorted you burned down my barn hoss and i never did see that cat again he just lit out and didnt come back after what you did with the laundry i grinned way back when id been a stupid sixteenyearold orphan who had killed his former teacher in what amounted to a magical duel id gotten lucky or it would have been me that had been burned to a briquette instead of old justin the council has seven laws of magic and the first one is thou shalt not kill when you break it they execute you no questions asked but some of the other wizards had thought i deserved lenience and there was a precedent for using lethal magic in selfdefense against the black arts id been put on a kind of horrible probation instead with any further infraction against the laws punishable by immediate summary judgement but id also been sixteen and legally a minor which meant i had to go someplacepreferably where the council could keep an eye on me and where i could learn better control of my powers ebenezar mccoy had lived in hog hollow missouri for as long as anyone could remembera couple of centuries at least after my trial the council packed me off to his farm and put him in charge of the remainder of my education education to ebenezar meant a lot of hard work on the farm during the day studying in the evening and getting a good nights sleep i didnt learn much magic from him but id gotten some more important stuff id learned more about patience about creating something making something worthwhile out of my labor and id found as much peace as a teenager could expect it had been a good place for me then and hed given me the kind of respect and distance id needed i would always be grateful ebenezar frowned past me squinting at the beetle i followed his gaze and realized that my car looked like it had been pounded with bloody hailstones the toad blood had dried to dark caramel brown except where my windshield wipers had swept it away ebenezar looked back at me lifting his eyebrows rain of toads i explained ah he rubbed his jaw and squinted at me and then at the cloth wrapped around my hand and that accident in the office its been a long day uhhuh you know you dont look so good hoss he looked up at me his eyes steady frowning i didnt meet the look wed traded a soulgaze years ago so i wasnt afraid of it happening again i just didnt want to look at the old man and see disappointment there i hear you been getting into some trouble up here some i admitted you all right ill make it uhhuh im told the senior council is pretty upset he said could mean trouble for you hoss yeah i figured he sighed and shook his head looking me up and down nose wrinkling you dont exactly look like a shining example of young wizardry and youre not going to make much of an impression wearing that i scowled defensive and draped the stole of rich blue silk over my head hey im supposed to wear a robe we all are ebenezar gave me a wry look and turned to the pickup he dragged a suit carrier out of the back and pulled out a robe of opulent dark fabric folding it over one arm somehow i dont think a plaid flannel bathrobe is what they had in mind i tied the belt of my old bathrobe and tried to make the stole look like it should go with it my cat used my good robe as a litter box like i said its been a long day sir he grunted and took his stumpy old wizards staff off the gun rack then he drew out his scarlet stole and draped it over the robe too hot to wear this damn thing out here ill put it on inside he looked up pale blue eyes glittering as he swept his gaze around the parking garage i frowned at him and tilted my head were late shouldnt we be getting to the meeting in a minute some people want to talk before we close the circle he glanced aside at me and said more quietly senior council i drew in a sharp breath why do they want to talk to us not us you because i asked them to boy people are scared if the senior council allows things to come to an open vote of the entire council it could go badly for you so i wanted some of them to get a chance to meet you for themselves before they started making choices that could get you hurt ebenezar leaned back against his truck and folded his arms across his belly bowing his head with his eyes squinted almost completely shut he said nothing more nothing about him betrayed any tension from the set of his bull neck and solid shoulders to the stillness of his gnarled workhardened hands but i felt it in him somewhere i said quietly youre going out on a limb for me arent you he shrugged some maybe i felt the anger run hot in my belly and i tightened the muscles of my jaw but i made an effort to keep my voice even ebenezar had been more than my teacher hed been my mentor at a time when i hadnt had anything else left to me hed helped me when a lot of other people wanted to kick me while i was downor more accurately decapitate me while i was down i owed him my life in more than one sense it would be wrong for me to lose my temper no matter how tired or hurt i was besides the old man could probably kick my ass so i managed to tone my answer down to what the hell do you think youre doing sir i am not your apprentice anymore i can look out for myself he didnt miss the anger guess im not much of a poker player he looked up at me and said im trying to help you boy ive got all the help i can stand already i told him ive got vampires breathing down my neck toads falling from the sky im about to get evicted from everywhere im late to the council meeting and i am not going to stand around out here and suck up to members of the senior council to lobby their vote ebenezar thrust out his jaw rapping his staff against the ground to emphasize his sentences harry this is not a game the wardens and the merlin are dead set against you they will move without support in the senior council youre in trouble hoss i shook my head and thought of mabs glacial gaze it cant be much more than im in already the hell it cant they could make a sacrificial lamb of you they will or they wont either way im not going to start brownnosing the council now senior or otherwise harry im not saying you need to get on your knees and beg but if you would just i rolled my eyes what offer a couple of favors sell my vote to one of the blocs fuck that pardon my french ive got enough problems without i broke off abruptly narrowing my eyes youre the last one i would expect to be telling me to get involved in council politics ebenezar scowled at me oh yeah in fact the last time i checked you told me the whole swillspouting pack of lollygagging skunkwallows could transform one another into clams for all you cared i did not say that did so ebenezars face turned red boy i ought to save it i told him go ahead and punch me or whatever but threats just arent hitting me like they used to ebenezar snorted at me and slammed his staff on the concrete once more before turning and stalking several paces away he stood there for a minute muttering to himself or i thought he was muttering after a minute the sound resolved itself into swallowed laughter i scowled at his back what i demanded why are you laughing at me ebenezar turned out to an open parking space across the row and said there are you satisfied i never felt a whisper of power not a breath of magic stirring against me whatever veil had been used it was beyond anything i could have even attempted im not exactly a neurosurgeon when it comes to magic ive had my moments but mostly i muddle through by shoving a lot of energy into my spells until it doesnt matter if half of it is slopping out magically speaking im a brawny thug and noisy as hell this veil was good almost perfect completely silent way better than i would be able to do anytime in the next couple of decades i stared in abrupt shock as it fell and two people i hadnt sensed at all simply flickered into existence in front of me the first was a woman better than six feet tall she wore her grey hair coiled in a net at the base of her neck she had already put on her robes of office black silk nearly the same color as her skin and her purple stole echoed the gems at her throat her eyebrows were still dark and she had one of them arched as she regarded ebenezar then me with a completely unamused expression when she spoke her voice was a low rich alto lollygagging skunkwallows matty ebenezar began laughter still flavoring his words you know how i get when im talking about council politics dont you matty me ebenezar mccoy she snapped she looked past my old mentor to focus on me wizard dresden i am less than amused with your lack of respect toward the white council i lifted my chin and glared down at the woman without meeting her eyes its a tough trick to learn but if youre motivated enough you can do it thats a coincidence im not terribly amused with you spying on me the black womans eyes flashed but ebenezar cut in before either of us could gather any more steam harry dresden he said dryly meet martha liberty she shot him a look and said pointedly hes arrogant ebenezar dangerous i snorted thats every wizard ever martha continued as if i hadnt spoken bitter angry obsessive ebenezar frowned seems to me he has good reason to be you and the rest of the senior council saw to that martha shook her head you know what he was meant to be hes too great a risk i snapped my fingers twice and hooked a thumb at my own chest hey lady hes also right here her eyes flashed at me look at him ebenezar hes a wreck look at the destruction he has caused ebenezar took two quick angry steps toward martha by challenging the red court when they were going to kill that young woman no matty hoss didnt cause whats happened since they did ive read his report he stood up to them when they damn well needed standing up to martha folded her arms strong and brown against the front of her robes the merlin says i know what he says ebenezar muttered by now i dont even need to hear him say it and as usual hes half right half wrong and all gutless martha frowned at him for a long and silent moment then she looked at me and asked do you remember me mister dresden i shook my head they had a hood on me all through the trial and i missed the meeting warden morgan called a couple years back they were taking a bullet out of my hip i know i never saw your face before today she moved then lifting a slender staff of some dark reddish wood and walked toward me the staff clicking with each step i faced her bracing myself but she didnt try to meet my gaze she studied my features for a long moment and then said very quietly you have your mothers eyes an old pain rolled through me i barely managed more than a whisper in response i never knew her no you didnt she lifted one wide heavy hand and passed it through the air on either side of my head as though smoothing my hair without touching it then she raked her eyes over me staring intently at my bandaged hand you hurt youre in great pain it isnt bad it should heal in a few days im not talking about your hand boy she closed her eyes and bowed her head her voice came heavily slowly as though her lips were reluctant to let the words pass them very well ebenezar i will support you she stepped back and away from me back to the side of the second person who had appeared id almost forgotten about him and looking at him now i began to see why he contained a quality of stillness i could all but feel around himeasy to sense but difficult to define his features his bearing everything about him blended into his background swallowed by that stillness patient and quiet as a stone beneath moon and sun he was of innocuous height five eight maybe five nine his dark hair was plaited in a long braid despite age that seamed his features like bronzed leather under a scarlet sun warm and worn his eyes beneath silver brows were dark inscrutable intense eagle feathers adorned his braid a necklace of bits of bone circled his throat and he had a beaded bracelet wrapped around one forearm which poked out from beneath his black robe one weathered hand gripped a simple uncarved staff hoss ebenezar said this here is listens to wind but thats always been too much of a mouthful for me even for a genuine illinois medicine man i just call him injun joe how i began maybe some kind of irony could be found in the first part of asking how did he do but something scratched at my foot and i left off the rest i let out a yelp and jumped away from a flash of fur near my feet without stopping to see what it was it had been that kind of day i tripped over my own staff and fell down i scrambled over on my back to put my legs between my face and whatever snarling thing might be coming for me drawing back one foot to kick i neednt have bothered a raccoon and a fairly young one at that stood up on its hind legs and chittered at me in annoyance soft grey fur bristling wildly as though it had been fit for an animal several sizes larger the raccoon gave me what i swore was an irritated look eyes glittering within the dark mask of fur around them then ran over to injun joes feet and neatly scaled the old mans wooden staff it swarmed up injun joes arm to perch on his shoulder still chittering and squeaking uh i managed how do you do the raccoon chirruped again and injun joe tilted his head to one side then nodded good but little brother is irritated with you he thinks anyone with that much food should share it i frowned then i remembered the halfeaten stale candy bar in my pocket oh right i pulled it out broke it in half and held it out to the raccoon peace little brother let out a pleased squeak and darted back down injun joes arm and staff to my hand he snatched the candy and then retired a few feet away to eat it when i looked up injun joe stood over me offering his hand little brother thanks you he likes you too how do you do wizard dresden i took his hand and got to my feet thanks uh listens to wind ebenezar interjected injun joe injun joe winked one grave eye at me the redneck hillbilly doesnt read otherwise hed know that he cant call me that anymore now im native american joe i wasnt sure i was supposed to laugh but i did injun joe nodded dark eyes sparkling then he murmured the one you knew as tera west sends her respects i blinked at him injun joe turned to ebenezar and nodded then walked slowly back to marthas side ebenezar let out a satisfied grunt fine now where is the russian we havent got all day marthas expression became remote injun joes face didnt change but he moved his eyes to the tall wizard beside him no one spoke and the silence grew thick enough to choke on ebenezars face went very pale and he suddenly leaned hard on his staff simon he whispered oh no i stepped up beside ebenezar what happened martha shook her head simon pietrovich senior council member our vampire expert he was killed less than two days ago the whole compound in archangel ebenezar all of them im sorry ebenezar shook his head slowly his voice was a pale shadow of its usual self ive been to his tower it was a fortress how did they do it the wardens said that they couldnt be sure but it looked like someone let the killers in past the defenses they didnt get away unscathed there were the remains of half a dozen nobles of the red court many of their warriors but they killed simon and the rest let them in ebenezar breathed treachery but even if it was true it would have to be someone who knew his defenses inside and out martha glanced at me then back at ebenezar something passed between them in that look but i couldnt tell what no ebenezar said thats insane master to student you know what the wardens will say its buffalo chips it wouldnt ever get past the senior council eben martha said gently joseph and i are only two votes now simon is gone ebenezar took a blue bandanna from the pocket of his overalls and rubbed it over his pate damnation he muttered guts and damnation i looked at ebenezar and then at martha what i asked what does this mean she said it means wizard dresden that the merlin and others on the council are preparing to bring allegations against you accusing you of precipitating the war with the red court and placing the responsibility for a number of deaths on your head and because joseph and i no longer have the support of simon on the senior council it means that we cannot block the merlin from laying it to general vote injun joe nodded fingers absently resting on little brothers fur many of the council are frightened hoss dresden your enemies will use this opportunity to strike through them fear will drive them to vote against you i shot ebenezar a glance my old mentor traded a long look with me and i saw his eyes stir with uncertainty hells bells i whispered im in trouble chapter five a heavy silence followed until ebenezar flexed the fingers of one hand and his knuckles popped who is up for simons place martha shook her head i suspect the merlin will want one of the germans ebenezar growled ive got fifty years seniority on every mothers son of them it wont matter martha said there are too many americans on the senior council already for the merlins tastes injun joe scratched little brothers chest and said typical only real american on the senior council is me not like the rest of you johnnycomelatelies ebenezar gave injun joe a tired smile martha said the merlin wont be happy if you decide to press a claim now ebenezar snorted aye and i cant tell you how that breaks my heart martha frowned pressing her lips together wed best get inside ebenezar ill tell them to wait for you fine my old teacher said his words clipped go on in without a further word martha and injun joe departed black robes whispering ebenezar slipped into his robe and put on his scarlet stole then he took up his staff again and strode determinedly toward the convention center i kept pace silently and worried ebenezar surprised me by speaking hows your latin coming hoss you need me to translate i coughed no i think i can manage all right when we get inside hang on to your temper youve got a reputation as a hothead for some reason i scowled at him i do not and for being stubborn and contrary i am not ebenezars worn smile appeared for a moment but by then we had reached the building where the council was to meet i stopped walking and ebenezar paused looking back at me i dont want to go in with you i said if this goes bad maybe its better if you have some distance from me ebenezar frowned at me and for a second i thought he was going to argue then he shook his head and went into the building i gave him a couple of minutes and then walked up the steps and went in the building had the look of an oldtime theaterhigh arched ceilings floors of polished stone laid with strips of carpet and several sets of double doors leading into the theater itself the air conditioning had probably been running full blast earlier but now there was no sound of fan or vent and the building inside felt warmer than it probably should have none of the lights were on you couldnt really expect even basic things like lights and air conditioning to keep running in a building full of wizards all the doors leading into what was apparently an actual theater were closed except for one pair and two men wearing dark council robes scarlet stoles and the grey cloak of the wardens stood before them i didnt recognize one of the men but the other was morgan morgan stood nearly as tall as i did only with maybe another hundred pounds of solid workingman muscle he had a short beard patchy with brown and grey and he wore his hair in a long ponytail his face was still narrow sour and he had a voice to match it finally he muttered upon seeing me ive been waiting for this dresden finally youre going to face justice i see someone had a nice big bowl of fanaticos this morning i said i know you dont like it morgan but i was cleared of all those charges thanks to you actually his sour face screwed up even more i only reported your actions to the council i did not think they would be so he spat the word like a curselenient i stopped in front of the two wardens and held out my staff morgans partner lifted a crystal pendant from around his neck and ran the crystal over the staff and then over my head temples and down the front of my body the crystal pulsed with a gentle glow of light as it passed over each chakra point the second warden nodded to morgan and i started to step past him and into the theater he put out one broad hand to stop me no he said not yet get the dogs the other warden frowned but that was all the protest he made he turned and slipped into the theater and a moment later emerged leading a pair of wardhounds behind him in spite of myself i swallowed and took a half step back from them give me a break morgan im not enspelled and im not toting in a bomb im not the suicidal type then you wont mind a quick check morgan said he gave me a humorless smile and stepped forward the wardhounds came with him they werent actual dogs i like dogs they were statues made of some kind of dark greygreen stone their shoulders as high as my own belt they had the gaping mouth and toobig eyes of chinese temple dogs complete with curling beards and manes though they werent flesh they moved with a kind of ponderous liquid grace stone muscles shifting beneath the surface of their skins as if they had been living beings morgan touched each on the head and muttered something too vague for me to make out upon hearing it both wardhounds focused upon me and began to prowl in a circle around me heads down the floor quivering beneath their weight i knew theyd been enchanted to detect any of countless threats that might attempt to approach a council meeting but they werent thinking beingsonly devices programmed with a simple set of responses to predetermined stimuli though wardhounds had saved lives often before there had also been accidentsand i didnt know if my runin with mab would leave a residual signature that might set the wardhounds off the dogs stopped and one of them let out a growl that sounded soothingly akin to bedrock being ripped apart by a backhoe i tensed and looked down at the dog standing to my right its lips had peeled back from gleaming dark fangs and its empty eyes were focused on my left handthe one mab had wounded by way of demonstration i swallowed and held still and tried to think innocent thoughts they dont like something about you dresden morgan said i thought i heard an almost eager undertone to his voice maybe i should turn you away just to be careful the other warden stepped forward one hand on a short heavy rod worn on his belt he murmured could be the injury if hes hurt wizard blood can be pretty potent moody too dog could be reacting to anger or fear through the blood maybe morgan said testily or it could be contraband hes trying to sneak in take off the bandage dresden i dont want to start bleeding again i said fine im denying you entrance then in accordance with dammit morgan i muttered i all but tossed my staff at him he caught it and held it while i tore at the makeshift bandages id put on my hand it hurt like hell but i pulled them off and showed him the swollen and oozing wound the wardhound growled again and then appeared to lose interest pacing back over to sit down beside its mate suddenly inanimate again i turned my eyes to morgan and stared at him hard satisfied i asked him for a second i thought he would meet my gaze then he shoved my staff back at me as he turned away youre a disgrace dresden look at yourself because of you good men and women have died today you will be called to answer for it i tied the bandage back on as best i could and gritted my teeth to keep from telling morgan to take a long walk off a short cliff then i brushed past the wardens and stalked into the theater morgan watched me go then said to his partner close the circle he followed me into the theater shutting the door behind him even as i felt the sudden silent tension of the wardens closing the circle around the building shutting it off from any supernatural access i hadnt ever actually seen a meeting of the councilnot like this the sheer variety of it all was staggering and i stood staring for several moments taking it in the space was a dinner theater of only moderate size lit by nothing more than a few candles on each table the room wouldnt have been crowded for a matinee but as a gathering place for wizards it was positively swamped the tables on the floor of the theater were almost completely filled with blackrobed wizards variously sporting stoles of blue gold and scarlet apprentices in their muddybrown robes lurked at the fringes of the crowd standing along the walls or crouching on the floor beside their mentors chairs the variety of humanity represented in the theater was startling canted oriental eyes dark rich skins of africa pale europeans men and women ancient and young long and short hair beards long enough to tuck into belts beards wispy enough to be stirred by a passing breeze the theater buzzed in dozens of languages of which i could identify only a fraction wizards laughed and scowled smiled and stared blankly sipped from flasks and soda cans and cups or sat with eyes closed in meditation the scents of spices and perfumes and chemicals all blended together into something pervasive always changing and the auras of so many practitioners of the art seemed to be feeling just as social reaching out around the room to touch upon other auras to echo or strike dissonance with their energies tangible enough to feel without even trying it was like walking through drifting cobwebs that were constantly brushing against my cheeks and eyelashesnot dangerous but disconcerting each one wildly unique utterly different from the next the only thing the wizards had in common was that none of them looked as scruffy as me a ropedoff section at the far right of the hall held the envoys of various organizations of allies and supernatural interests most of whom i had only a vague idea about wardens stood here and there where they could overlook the crowd grey cloaks conspicuous amid the black and scattered brown onesbut somehow i doubted they were as obtrusive as my own faded blueandwhite flannel i garnered offended looks from nearly everyone i walked pastmostly whitehaired old wizard folk one or two apprentices nearer my own age covered their mouths as i went past hiding grins i looked around for an open chair but i didnt spot one until i saw ebenezar wave at me from a table in the front row of the theater nearest the stage he nodded at the seat next to him it was the only place available and i joined him on the theater stage stood seven podiums and at six of them stood members of the senior council in dark robes with purple stoles injun joe listens to wind and martha liberty stood at two at the center podium stood the merlin of the white council a tall man broad of shoulder and blue of eye with hair falling past his shoulders in shining pale waves and a flowing silver beard the merlin spoke in a rolling basso voice latin phrases gliding as smoothly from his mouth as from any roman senators et quae cum ita sint censeo iam nos dimittere rees cottidianas et de magna re gravi deliberareid est illud bellum contra comitatum rubrum and given the circumstances i move to dispense with the usual formalities in order to discuss the most pertinent issue before usthe war with the red court consensum habemus all in favor there was a general murmur of consent from the wizards in the room i didnt feel any need to add to it i tried to slip unnoticed into the seat beside ebenezar but the merlins bright blue eyes spotted me and grew shades colder the merlin spoke and though i knew he spoke perfectly intelligible english he addressed me in latin quick and liquidbut his own perfect command of the speech worked against him he was easy to understand ahhh magus dresdenus prudenter ades nobis dum de bello quod inceperis diceamus ex omni parte ratio tua pro hoc comitatu nobis placet ah wizard dresden how thoughtful of you to join us in discussions of the war you started it is good to know that you have such respect for this council he delivered that last while giving my battered old bathrobe a pointed look making sure that anyone in the room who hadnt noticed would now jerk he let silence fall afterward and it was left to me to answer him also in latin big fat jerk still it was my first council meeting as a full wizard and he was the merlin after all and i did look pretty bad plus ebenezar shot me a warning glance i swallowed a hot answer and took a stab at diplomacy uh i said ego sum miser magus merlinus dolor diei longi me tenet opus es mihi altera uh vestiplicia sorry merlin its been a very long day i meant to have my other robe or thats what i tried to say i must have conjugated something wrong because when i finished the merlin blinked at me expression mild quod est ebenezar winced and asked me in a whisper hoss you sure you dont want me to translate for you i waved a hand at him i can do it i scowled as i tried to put together the right words and spoke again excusationem vobis pro vestitu meo atque etiam tarditate facio please excuse my lateness and appearance the merlin regarded me with passionless distant features evidently well content to let my mouth run ebenezar put his hand over his eyes what i demanded of him in a fierce whisper ebenezar squinted up at me well first you said i am a sorry excuse merlin a sad long day held me i need me a different laundress i blinked what thats what the merlin said then you said excuses to you for my being dressed and i also make lately i felt my face heat up most of the room was still staring at me as though i was some sort of raving lunatic and it dawned on me that many of the wizards in the room probably did not speak english as far as they were concerned i probably sounded like one goddamned correspondence course maybe you should translate for me i said ebenezars eyes sparkled but he nodded with a grave expression happy to i slipped into my seat while ebenezar stood up and made an apology for me his latin terse and precise his voice carrying easily throughout the hall i saw the gathered wizards expressions grow more or less mollified as he spoke the merlin nodded and continued in his textbookperfect latin thank you wizard mccoy for your assistance the first order of business in addressing the crisis before us is to restore the senior council to its full membership as some of you have doubtless learned by now senior council member pietrovich was killed in an attack by the red court two days past a gasp and a low murmur ran through the theater the merlin allowed a moment to pass past conflicts with the red court have not moved with this kind of alacrity and this may indicate a shift in their usual strategy as a result we need to be able to react quickly to further developmentswhich will require the leadership provided by a full membership on the senior council the merlin continued speaking but i leaned over to ebenezar let me guess i whispered he wants to fill the opening on the senior council so that hell be able to control the vote ebenezar nodded hell have three votes for sure then and most times four what are we going to do about it you arent going to do anything not yet he looked intently at me keep your temper hoss i mean it the merlin will have three plans to take you down i shook my head what how do you know that he always does things that way ebenezar muttered his eyes glittered with something ugly a plan a backup plan and an ace in the hole ill shoot down the first one and ill help you with the second the third is all yours though what do you mean what plan hush hoss im paying attention a balding wizard with bristling white eyebrows and a bushy blue beard his scalp covered in flowing blue tattoos leaned forward from the far side of the table and glared at me shhhhh ebenezar nodded at the man and we both turned back to face the stage and it is for this reason the merlin continued that i now ask klaus schneider as a longstanding senior wizard of impeccable reputation to take on the responsibility of membership in the senior council all in favor martha glanced at ebenezar and murmured a moment honored merlin i believe protocol requires that we open the floor to debate the merlin sighed under normal circumstances wizard liberty of course but we have little time for the niceties of our usual procedures time is of the essence so all in injun joe interrupted wizard schneider is a fine enchanter and he has a reputation for skill and honesty but he is young for such a responsibility there are wizards present who are his senior in experience and the art they deserve the consideration of the council the merlin shot injun joe a frown thank you for your perspective wizard listens to wind but though your commentary is welcome it was not asked for there is no one present senior to wizard schneider who has not already declined a seat upon the senior council and rather than run through meaningless nominations and repeated declinations i had intended ebenezar cut in sotto voce but loud enough for the merlin to hear him in english you had intended to shove your favorite down everyones throats while they were too worried to notice the merlin fell abruptly quiet his eyes falling on ebenezar in a sudden pointed silence he spoke in a low voice his english carrying a rich british accent go back to your mountain ebenezar back to your sheep you are not welcome here and never have been ebenezar looked up at the merlin with a toothy smile scots creeping back into his vowels aye alfred laddie i know he switched back to latin and raised his voice again every member of the council has a right to speak his mind on these matters you all know how important the appointment of one senior council member is how many of you believe this matter too serious to leave to a consensus speak now the theater rumbled with a general aye to which i added my own voice ebenezar looked around the room and then raised an eyebrow at the merlin i could see frustration not quite hidden on the old mans face i could almost taste his desire to slam his fist down on the podium but he controlled himself and nodded very well then in accordance with procedure we will offer the position to the seniormost wizards present he looked to one side where a slimfaced primlooking wizard sat with a quill a bottle of ink and pages and pages of parchment wizard peabody will you consult the registry peabody reached under his table and came out with a bulging satchel he muttered something to himself and rubbed some ink onto his nose with one finger then he opened the satchel which held what looked like a couple of reams of parchment his eyes glazed over slightly and he reached into the papers seemingly at random he drew out a single page put it on the desk before him nodded in satisfaction then read in a reedy voice wizard montjoy research trip in the yucatán martha liberty said peabody nodded wizard gomez still sleeping off that potion provided a greycloaked warden standing by the wall peabody nodded wizard luciozzi sabbatical said the bluebearded and tattooed wizard behind me ebenezar frowned and one of his cheeks twitched in a nervous tic it went on like that for close to a quarter hour some of the more interesting reasons for absence included he got real married living under the polar ice cap and pyramid sitting whatever that was peabody finally read with a glance up at the merlin wizard mccoy ebenezar grunted and stood peabody read another halfdozen names before stating wizard schneider a small roundcheeked man with a fringe of gauzy white down over his scalp and a round belly stretching his robes stood up and gave ebenezar a brief nod then he looked up at the merlin and said in latin with a heavy germanic accent while i am grateful for the offer honored merlin i must respectfully decline your nomination in favor of wizard mccoy he will serve the council more ably than i the merlin looked as though someone had grated slices of lemon against his gums very well he said do any other senior wizards here wish to present themselves for consideration over wizard mccoy i was betting no one would especially given the looks on the faces of the wizards nearby ebenezar himself never moved his eyes from the merlin he just stood with his feet spread wide apart and planted his eyes steady confident silence fell over the hall the merlin looked around the hall his lips pressed tightly together finally he gave his head a very slight shake all in favor the room rumbled with a second more affirmative aye very well the merlin said his upper lip twisting and giving the words an acid edge wizard mccoy take your place upon the senior council there was a murmur of what sounded a bit like relief from those in the hall ebenezar glanced back and winked at me one down two to go he murmured stay sharp then he hitched up his robes and stumped onto the stage to the empty podium between martha liberty and injun joe less talking more doing he said loudly enough to be heard by the whole hall theres a war on precisely what i was thinking the merlin said and nodded to one side let us address the war warden morgan would you please stand forward and give the council the wardens tactical assessment of the red court an oppressive silence settled over the room so that i heard every sound of morgans boots as he stepped up onto the stage the merlin moved aside and morgan placed a glittering gem or crystal of some kind upon the podium behind that he set a candle which he lit with a muttered incantation then he framed the candle with his hands and murmured again light streaked from the candle into the crystal in a glowing stream and sprang up out of the crystal again in a large cone stretching up above the stage several yards across at the top within the cone of light appeared a spinning globe of the earth its continents vaguely misshapen like something drawn from a couple of centuries past a murmur ran through the room and bluebeard at my table muttered in latin impressive bah i said in english he stole that from return of the jedi bluebeard blinked at me uncomprehending i briefly debated trying to translate star wars into latin and decided against it see i can have common sense too morgans low voice rumbled out in latin phrases rough but understandable which meant he spoke it better than me jerk the flashing red spots on the map are the locations of known attacks of the red court and their allies most of them resulted in casualties of one form or another as he spoke widely scattered motes of red color began to form on the globe like the glowing lights of a christmas tree as you can see most of the activity has taken place in western europe a mutter went through the room the old world was the domain of the old school of wizardrythe maintain secrecy and dont attract attention way of thinking i guess they have a point given the inquisition and all i dont belong to the old school i have an ad in the yellow pages under wizards big shockerim the only one there i have to pay the bills somehow dont i morgan droned on dispassionately we have known for a long time that the main power center of the red court is somewhere in south america our sources there are under pressure and it has become difficult to get any information out of the area we have had advance warning of several attacks and the wardens have managed to intercede with minimal losses of life with the exception of the attack at archangel the globe paused in its spinning and my eyes fastened on the glowing point of light on the northwest coast of russia though it is presumed that wizard pietrovichs death curse took a heavy toll on his attackers no one in his household survived the attack we dont know how they got past his defenses it would appear that the red court may have access to information or aspects of the art that they have not before had the merlin stepped back to the podium and morgan collected his crystal the globe vanished thank you warden the merlin said as we expected from council records our various retreats and paths through the nevernever are threatened frankly speaking ladies and gentlemen the red court holds us at a disadvantage within the mortal world modern technology so often disagrees with us that it makes travel difficult under the best of circumstances and unreliable in a time of conflict we vitally need to secure safe paths through the nevernever or else risk being engaged and overwhelmed in detail by an opponent who can move more rapidly than we to that end we have dispatched missives to both queens of the sidhe ancient mai my eyes flickered to the podium to the merlins left where stood another of the senior council members apparently the ancient mai she was a tiny woman of oriental extraction her skin fine and pale her granitecolored hair worn in a long braid curled up at the back of her head and held with a pair of jade combs she had delicate features only lightly touched by the passage of years though her dark eyes were rheumy she unfolded a letter written upon parchment and addressed the council in a creaky but firm voice from summer we received this answer queen titania does not now nor will she ever choose sides in the disputes of mortal and anthrophage she bids both council and court alike to keep their war well away from the realms of summer she will remain neutral ebenezar frowned and leaned forward to ask and from winter i twitched the ancient tilted her head and regarded ebenezar in perfect silence for a moment somehow implying her annoyance at his interruption our courier did not return upon consulting records of former conflicts we may confidently assume that queen mab will involve herself if at all in a time and manner of her own choosing i twitched more there was a pitcher of water on the table along with some glasses i poured a drink the pitcher only rattled against the cup a little i glanced back at bluebeard and saw him regarding me with a pensive gaze ebenezar scowled now what is that supposed to mean the merlin stepped in smoothly it means that we must continue whatever diplomacy we may with winter at all costs we must secure the cooperation of one of the sidhe queensor at least prevent the red court from accomplishing an alliance of its own until this conflict can be resolved martha liberty lifted both eyebrows resolved she said her tone pointed i would have chosen a word like finished myself the merlin shook his head wizard liberty there is no need for this dispute to devolve into an even more destructive conflict if there exists even a small chance that an armistice can be attained the black womans voice lashed out at the merlin harsh and cold ask simon pietrovich how interested the vampires are in reaching a peaceable settlement contain your emotions wizard the merlin replied his voice calm the loss of pietrovich strikes each of us deeply but we cannot allow that loss to blind us to potential solutions simon knew them merlin martha said her tone flat he knew them better than any of us and they killed him do you really think that they will be inclined to seek a reasonable peace with us when they have already destroyed the wizard best able to protect himself against them why should they seek a peace merlin theyre winning the merlin waved a hand your anger clouds your judgement they will seek a peace because even in victory they would pay too high a cost dont be a fool martha said they will never sue for peace in point of fact said the merlin they already have he gestured to the second podium on his left wizard lafortier lafortier was an emaciated man of medium height and build his cheekbones stood out grotesquely from his sunken face and his bulging eyes looked a couple of sizes too large he had no hair at all not even eyebrows and on the whole it gave him a skeletal look when he spoke his voice came out in a resonant basso deep and warm and smooth thank you merlin he held up an envelope in one thinfingered hand i have here a missive from duke ortega the war leader of the red court received this morning in it he details the red courts motivations in this matter and the terms they desire for peace he also offers by token of goodwill a temporary cessation of hostilities in order to give the council time to consider effective this morning bullshit the word burst out of my mouth before my brain realized i had said it a round of snickers mostly from brownrobed apprentices echoed through the theater and i heard fabric rustle as every wizard in the place turned to look at me i felt my face heat again and cleared my throat well it is i said to the room ebenezar translated for me i was attacked by a red court hit squad only a few hours ago lafortier smiled at me it stretched his lips out to show his teeth like the dried face of a thousandyearold mummy even if you are not lying wizard dresden i would hardly expect perfect control of all red court forces given your role in precipitating this war precipitating it i exclaimed do you have any idea what they did lafortier shrugged they defended an assault upon their sovereignty wizard you acting in the role of representative of this council attacked a noble of their court damaged her property and killed members of said nobles household and her as well in addition the records of local newspapers and authorities reveal that during the altercation several young men and women were also killedburned up in a fire i think does that sound familiar to you wizard dresden i clenched my jaw the sudden rush of rage spilling through me in such a torrent that i could scarcely see much less trust myself to speak id been brought before the council for the first time when i had been put on trial for violating the first law of magic thou shalt not kill id burned my old mentor justin to death when id clashed with bianca lately of the red court the previous year id called up a firestorm when it looked as if my companions and i were going to buy it anyway a lot of vampires burned the bodies of some people had been found afterward too there was no way to tell which of them had been victims of the vampires and already dead when the fire got to them and which if any had been alive before i came along i still have nightmares about it im a lot of things but im not a willing murderer to my shock i felt myself gathering in power getting ready to unleash it at lafortier with his skeletal smirk ebenezar caught my eye his own a little wide and shook his head quickly i clenched my hands into tight fists instead of blasting anybody with magic and forced myself to sit down again before i spoke selfdisciplined thats me i have already detailed my recollection of the events in my report to the council i stand by them anyone who tells you differently than what you read there is lying lafortier rolled his eyes how comfortable it must be to live in such a clearcut world wizard dresden but we are not counting the cost of your actions in coins or hours wastedwe are counting it in blood wizards are dying because of what you did while acting in this councils name lafortier swept his gaze to the rest of the theater his expression stern controlled frankly i think it may be wise for the council to consider that we may indeed stand in the wrong in this matter and that it might be prudent to give careful considerations to the red courts terms for peace what do they want i snarled at the man ebenezar providing the latin for the rest of the council a pint of blood a month from each of us rights to hunt freely wherever they choose amulets to shield them from the light of the sun lafortier smiled at me and folded his hands atop his podium nothing so dramatic dresden they simply want what any of us would want in this situation they want justice he leaned toward me bulging eyes glittering they want you chapter six gulp me i said et la lafortier feel the bite of my rapier wit yes duke ortega writes that you wizard dresden are considered a criminal by the red court in order to end this conflict they wish to extradite you to an area of their designation for trial a resolution that is perhaps distasteful but may also be only just he didnt get the last word out of his mouth before several dozen wizards around the auditorium rose to their feet with outraged shouts others stood up to cry out against them and still more against them the room descended into a cacophony of shouts threats and cussing among wizards cursing is a different matter altogether in dozens of languages the merlin let people shout for a moment before he called out in a ringing voice order no one paid him any attention he tried once more then lifted his staff and slammed it down hard on the stage beside him there was a flash of light a roar of sound and a concussion that slopped the water in my glass up over the brim spilling it on my flannel bathrobe a couple of the wispier wizards were knocked down by the force of itbut in any case the shouting ceased order the merlin demanded again in exactly the same tone i am well aware of the implications of this situation but lives are at stake your lives and my own we must consider our options with the utmost gravity what options ebenezar demanded we are wizards not a herd of frightened sheep will we give one of our own to the vampires now and pretend that none of this has happened lafortier snapped you read dresdens report by his own admission what the red court accuses him of is true they have a just grievance the situation was clearly a manipulation a scheme to force dresden to those actions in hopes of killing him then he should have been smarter lafortier said his tone flat politics is not a game for children dresden played and was beaten it is time for him to pay the price so that the rest of us may live in peace injun joe put a hand on ebenezars arm and spoke quietly peace cannot be bought aleron he murmured to lafortier history teaches that lesson i learned it you should have too lafortier sneered at injun joe i dont know what you are babbling about but i rolled my eyes and stood up again hes talking about the american tribes losing their land to white settlers dolt i figured ebenezar would leave the insult out of the translation but there were more stifled snorts from brown robes around the room and about europes attempts to appease hitler before the second world war both attempted to purchase peace with compromise and both got swallowed up bit by bit the merlin glared at me i did not recognize you wizard dresden until you have the floor you will refrain from such outbursts or i will have you removed from this meeting i clenched my jaw and sat down sorry here i was figuring we had a responsibility to protect people what was i thinking we will protect no one wizard dresden if we are dead the merlin snapped be silent or be removed martha liberty shook her head merlin it seems clear that we cannot simply hand one of our own over to the red court because of their demands despite past differences with council policy dresden is a fully ranked wizardand given his performance in recent years he seems well deserving of the title i do not question his ability with the art lafortier put in i question his judgement his choices he has played loose and reckless with his status as a wizard since justins death the bald man turned his bulging eyes to the wizards in the theater wizard harry dresden apprentice to the wizard justin dumorne apprentice to the wizard simon pietrovich i wonder how the red court learned enough of pietrovichs defenses to bypass them so completely dresden i stared at lafortier for a second shocked did the man actually believe that i had learned about this pietrovichs defenses through justin then sold a senior council member of the white council to the vampires justin hadnt exactly taken me around much before id been put on trial i hadnt even known that there was a white councilor other wizards at all for that matter i gave him the only answer i could i laughed at him wheezy quiet laughter i shook my head lafortiers expression grew outraged you see he demanded to the room you see in what contempt he holds this council his position as a wizard dresden has constantly endangered us all with his obtuse indiscretion his reckless disregard for secrecy and security even if it was someone else who betrayed pietrovich and his students to the red court dresden is as guilty of their murder as if he himself had cut their throats let the consequences of his decisions fall upon him i rose and faced lafortier but glanced at the merlin for permission to speak he gave the floor to me with a grudging nod impossible i said or at least impractical i have violated none of the laws of magic in this matter which rules out a summary trial i am a full wizard by council law i am therefore entitled to an indepth investigation and trialneither of which would provide any kind of workable solution anytime soon the room rumbled with agreement when ebenezar finished translating for me that was hardly a surprise if the council jammed a trial down my throat and then threw me to the wolves it would set a deadly precedentone that could haunt any wizard in the room and they knew it lafortier jabbed a forefinger at me and said quite true provided that you are in fact a full wizard i move that the council vote immediately to determine whether or not dresdens status as a wizard is valid i remind the council that his appointment to his stole was a de facto decision based upon circumstantial evidence he has never stood trial never been judged worthy by his peers like hell i havent i answered him i beat justin dumorne in a duel to the death is that not trial enough for you wizard dumorne died yes lafortier said whether he was defeated in an open duel or burned in his sleep is another matter entirely merlin you have heard my motion let the council vote upon the status of this madman let us end this foolishness and return to our lives ouch an angle i hadnt thought of if i was stripped of my stole it would be like a medieval noble having his title taken away i would no longer be a wizard politically speaking and according to council law and to the accords between the various supernatural factions the council would be obligated to turn over a fugitive murderer to the red court which would mean if i was fortunate a horrible death if i wasnt fortunate it could be considerably worse given the kind of day id been having my heart started skittering in my chest the merlin frowned and nodded very well then we vote upon the issue of the status of one harry dresden let those who would have him keep his stole vote for and those who favor that his status be restored to that of apprentice vote against all those in fav wait ebenezar interjected i invoke my right as a member of the senior council to reduce the vote to the senior council alone the merlin glared at ebenezar on what grounds on the grounds that there exists a great deal of information about this matter of which the council at large is unaware it would be impractical to attempt to explain it all seconded injun joe murmured accord martha liberty added three votes yea honored merlin let the senior council make this decision my heart started beating again ebenezar had made the right call in a room full of frightened men and women i wouldnt have had a prayer of keeping my stole with the vote reduced to the senior council maybe i had a fighting chance i could almost see the merlin trying to figure a way out of it but council law is pretty clear on that point the senior council members can always take a matter to a closed vote with three supporters very well the merlin said the room rustled with whispers my interests lie in preserving the health and safety of those upon this council and of the communities of mankind in general i vote against dresdens validity as an initiate wizard of this council lafortier jumped in bulging eyes narrowed as do i and for the same reasons ebenezar spoke next ive lived with this young man i know him hes a wizard i vote to preserve his status little brother chittered from his perch on injun joes shoulder and the old wizard stroked the raccoons tail with one hand my instincts about this man tell me that he comports himself as a wizard should he gave a very mild glance to lafortier i vote in favor of his status as do i martha liberty added this is not a solution it is merely an action harry three bad guys two i turned my eyes to ancient mai the tiny woman stood with her eyes closed for a moment her head bowed then she murmured no wizard should so blatantly misuse his status as a member of this council nor should he be as irresponsible as harry dresden has been with his use of the art i vote against his retention of wizard status three to three i licked my lips and realized at just that moment that i had been too nervous and involved with events to take note of the seventh member of the senior council he was standing at the far left of the stage like the other wizards he wore a black robe but his dark purple almost black stole had a deep cowl upon it as well which covered his face entirely the candlelit dimness masked in shadow whatever the cowl didnt cover he was tall taller than me seven feet and thin his arms were folded hands hidden inside the voluminous sleeves of his robe every eye in the place turned to the seventh member of the council and a silence deeper than that of the nearby great lake enveloped the room it lasted for long moments then the merlin prompted quietly gatekeeper what say you i leaned forward in my chair my mouth dry if he voted against me i was betting a warden would zap me unconscious before the sound of his voice died away after several of my frantic heartbeats the gatekeeper spoke in a resonant gentle voice it rained toads this morning a baffled silence followed it became a moment later a baffled mutter gatekeeper the merlin said his voice more urgent how do you vote with deliberation the gatekeeper said it rained toads this morning that bears consideration and for that i must hear what word returns with the messenger lafortier eyed the gatekeeper and said impatiently what messenger what are you talking about the back doors of the theater burst open hard and a pair of greycloaked wardens entered the theater they each had a shoulder under one of the arms of a brownrobed young man his face was puffy and swollen and his hands looked like rotten sausages about to burst frost clung to his hair in a thick coating and his robe looked like it had been dipped in water and then dragged behind a sled team from anchorage to nome his lips were blue and his eyes fluttered and rolled semicoherently the wardens dragged him to the foot of the stage and the senior council gathered at its edge looking down this is my courier to the winter queen ancient mai stated he insisted one of the wardens said we tried to take him for treatment but he got so worked up about it i was afraid he would hurt himself so we brought him to you ancient where did you find him the merlin asked outside someone drove up in a car and pushed him out of it we didnt see who it was you get the license number i asked both wardens turned to eye me then they both turned back to the merlin neither of them had gotten it maybe license plates were too new a concept they werent yet a whole century old after all hells bells i muttered i would have gotten it ancient mai carefully descended from the stage and moved to the young man she touched his forehead and spoke to him gently in what i presumed to be chinese the boy opened his eyes and babbled something broken and halting back at her ancient mai frowned she asked something else which the boy struggled to answer but it was apparently too much for him he sagged his eyes rolling back and went completely limp the ancient touched his hair and said in latin take him care for him the wardens laid the boy on a cloak and then four of them carried him out moving quickly what did he say ebenezar asked he beat me to it he said that queen mab bade him tell the council she will permit them travel through her realm provided one request is fulfilled the merlin arched a brow fingers touching his beard thoughtfully what does she request ancient mai murmured she did not tell him she said only that she had already made her desires known to one of the council the senior council withdrew together to one side speaking in low voices i didnt pay them any mind the ancients translation of the messengers words shocked me enough to keep me from so much as breathing much less speaking when i could move i turned back to my table leaned forward and banged my head gently on the wooden surface several times dammit i muttered in time with the thumps dammit dammit dammit a hand touched my shoulder and i looked up to see the shadowed cowl of the gatekeeper standing apart from the rest of the senior council his hand was covered by a black leather glove i couldnt see any skin showing on him anywhere you know what the rain of toads means he said his voice very quiet his english had a gentle accent something part british and part something else indian middle eastern i nodded trouble trouble though i could not see his face i suspected a very slight smile had colored the word the cowl turned toward the other senior council members and he whispered there isnt much time will you answer me one question honestly dresden i checked bluebeard to see if he was listening in he had leaned way over toward a roundfaced grandmalooking wizardess at another table and appeared to be listening intently to her i nodded to the gatekeeper he waved his hand no words no pause to prepare nothing he waved his hand and the sounds of the room suddenly seemed to blur together robbed of any coherence at all i understand you know how to listen too i would rather no one else heard us the sound of his voice came to me warped parts pitched high and others low oddly reverberating i gave him a wary nod what is the question he reached up to his cowl black leather against twilight purple and drew back the hood a little enough that i could see the gleam of one dark eye and a rough thin grey beard against bronzed skin i couldnt see his other eye his face seemed to ripple and contort in the shadows and i had an idea that he was disfigured maybe burned in the socket of the missing eye i saw something silver and reflective he leaned down closer and whispered near my ear has mab chosen an emissary i struggled not to let the surprise show in my face but im not always good at hiding my feelings i saw comprehension flicker in the gatekeepers shadowed eye dammit now i understood why mab had been so confident shed known all along that she had set me up for a deal i couldnt refuse shed done it without breaking our bargain either mab wanted me to take up her case and she seemed perfectly happy to meddle in a supernatural war to get what she wanted shed just been toying with me in my office and id fallen for it i wanted to kick myself somewhere out there was a village id deprived of its idiot in any case there was no sense lying to the guy whose vote would decide my fate i nodded to him yes he shook his head precarious balance the council can afford neither to keep you nor to cast you out i dont understand you will he drew the cowl back down and murmured i cannot prevent your fate wizard i can only give you a chance to avoid it on your own what do you mean cannot you see what is happening i frowned at him a dangerous imbalance of forces the white council in town mab meddling in our affairs or perhaps we are meddling in hers why has she appointed a mortal emissary young wizard because someone up there takes a malevolent amusement in my suffering balance the gatekeeper corrected me it is all about balance redress the imbalance young wizard resolve the situation prove your worth beyond doubt are you telling me i should work for mab my voice sounded hollow tinny as though it was trapped in a coffee can what is the date the gatekeeper asked june eighteenth i said ah of course the gatekeeper turned away and sounds returned to normal the gatekeeper joined the rest of the senior council and they trooped back up to their podiums podii podia whatever goddamned correspondence course order called the merlin again and the room grew quiet after a reluctant moment gatekeeper the merlin said what is your vote the silent figure of the gatekeeper silently lifted one hand we have set our feet upon a darkling path he murmured a road that will only grow more dangerous our first steps are critical we must make them with caution the cowl turned toward ebenezar and the gatekeeper said you love the boy wizard mccoy you would fight to defend him your own dedication to our cause is not inconsiderable i respect your choice he turned toward lafortier you question dresdens loyalty and his ability you imply that only a bad seed can grow from bad soil your concerns are understandableand if correct then dresden poses a major threat to the council he turned to ancient mai and inclined the cowl forward a few degrees the ancient responded with a slight bow of her own ancient mai the gatekeeper said you question his ability to use his power wisely to judge between right and wrong you fear that dumornes teaching may have twisted him in ways even he cannot yet see your fears too are justified he turned to the merlin honored merlin you know that dresden has drawn death and danger down upon the council you believe that if he is removed so will be that danger your fears are understandable but not reasonable regardless of what happens to dresden the red court has struck a blow against the council too deep to be ignored a cessation of current hostilities would only be the calm before the storm enough man ebenezar demanded vote for or against i choose to base my vote upon a trial a test that will lay to rest the fears of one side of the issue or prove falsely placed the faith of the other what trial the merlin asked mab the gatekeeper said let dresden address queen mabs request let him secure the assistance of winter if he does that should lay to rest your concerns regarding his ability lafortier lafortier frowned but then nodded at the gatekeeper he turned next to ancient mai should he accomplish this it should show that he is willing to accept responsibility for his mistake and to work against his own best interests for the greater good of the council it should satisfy your concerns as to his judgementto make the mistakes of youth is no crime but not to learn from them is agreed ancient mai narrowed her rheumy eyes but gave the gatekeeper a precise nod and you honored merlin such a success may do much to alleviate the pressure of the coming war if securing routes through the nevernever places the red court at a severe enough disadvantage it may even enable us to avoid it entirely surely it would prove dresdens dedication to the council beyond a doubt thats all well and good ebenezar said but what happens if he fails the gatekeeper shrugged then perhaps their fears are more justified than your affection wizard mccoy we may indeed conclude that his appointment to full wizard initiate may have been premature all or nothing ebenezar demanded is that it you expect the youngest wizard in the council to get the best of queen mab somehow mab thats not a trial its a goddamned execution how is he even supposed to know what her request was to begin with i stood up my legs shaking a little ebenezar i said how the hell is the boy supposed to know what she wants ebenezar im not going to stand by while you he abruptly blinked and looked at me so did everyone else i know what mab wants i said she approached me earlier today sir she asked me to investigate something for her i turned her down hells bells ebenezar breathed he took the blue bandanna from his pocket and mopped at his gleaming forehead hoss this is out of your depth looks like its sink or swim then i said the gatekeeper murmured to me in english will you accept this wizard dresden i nodded my head my throat had gone dry i swallowed and tried to remind myself that there wasnt much choice if i didnt play with the faeries and come out on top the council would serve me up to the vampires on a silver platter the former might get me really really killed the latter would certainly kill me as welland probably more than that as deals went it blew but some little part of me that hadnt let me forget all the destruction maybe even the deaths id caused last year danced gleefully at my apparent comeuppance besides it was the only game in town i tightened my grip on my staff and spoke as clearly as i could manage yeah i accept chapter seven the rest of the council meeting was somewhat anticlimacticfor me anyway the merlin ordered the wizards to disperse immediately after the meeting via preplanned secure routes he also distributed a list to everyone noting the wardens near them to call upon if help was needed and told them to check in with the wardens every few days as a safety precaution next a grizzled old dame warden went over the theories to a couple of newly developed wards meant to work especially well against vampires representatives of the white councils alliessecret occult brotherhoods mostlyeach gave a brief speech declaring his or her groups support of the council in the war toward the end of the meeting wardens showed up in force to escort wizards to the beginnings of their routes home the senior council i presumed would loiter around for a few days in order to see if i got killed trying to prove that i was one of the good guys sometimes i feel like no one appreciates me i stood up about three seconds before the merlin said meeting adjourned and headed for the door ebenezar tried to catch my eye but i didnt feel like talking to anyone i slammed the doors open a little harder than i needed to stalked out to the blue beetle and drove away with all the raging power the ancient fourcylinder engine could muster behold the angry wizard puttputtputting away my brain felt like something made out of stale cereal coffee grounds and cold pizza thoughts trudged around in aimless depression mostly about how i was going to get myself killed playing private eye for mab if things got really bad i might even drag down a few innocent bystanders with me i growled at myself stop whining harry i said in a firm loud voice so what if youre tired so what if youre hurt so what if you smell like youre already dead youre a wizard youve got a job to do this war is mostly your own fault and if you dont stay on the ball more people are going to get hurt so stiff upper lip chin up whatever get your ass in gear i nodded at that advice and glanced aside to the envelope mab had given me which lay on the passenger seat i had a name an address a crime i needed to get on the trail of the killer that meant i would need informationand the people who would have the most information a couple of days after the fact would be the chicago pd i drove to murphys place lieutenant karrin murphy was the head of chicago pds special investigations team si was the citys answer to weirdness in general they got all of the unusual crimes the ones that didnt fall neatly into the departments other categories si has handled everything from sightings of sewer alligators to grave robbing in one of the citys many cemeteries what fun they also got to take care of the genuine supernatural stuff the things that no one talks about in official reports but that manage to happen anyway trolls vampires demonsummoning sorcerersyou name it the city had appointed si to make sure the paperwork stayed nice and neat with no mention of preposterous fantasies that could not possibly exist it was a thankless job and the directors of si typically blew it after about a month by refusing to believe that they were dealing with genuine weirdness then they got shuffled out of chicago pd murphy hadnt shed lasted shed taken things seriously and employed the services of chicagos only professional wizard guess who as a consultant on the tougher jobs murphy and i have seen some very upsetting things together were friends she would help murphy lives in a house in bucktown near a lot of other cops its a tiny place but she owns it grandma murphy left it to her the house is surrounded by a neat little lawn i pulled up in the beetle sometime well after summertime dark but before midnight i knew shed be home though i wasnt certain shed be awake i made sure that i didnt sound like i was trying to sneak up anywhere i shut the door of the beetle hard and walked with firm footsteps to her door then knocked lightly a moment later the curtains on the barred windows beside the door twitched and then fell back into place a lock disengaged then another then a door chain i noted as i waited that murphy had a steelreinforced door just like i did though i doubted shed had as many demons or assassins showing up at it murphy opened the door partway and peered out at me the woman didnt look like the chief of chicago pds monster hunters her bright blue eyes were heavy weary and underscored with dark bags she stood five feet nothing in her bare feet her golden hair was longer on top than in back with bangs hanging down to her eyes she wore a pale peach terrycloth bathrobe that fell most of the way to her feet in her right hand she held her automatic and a small crucifix dangled on a chain wrapped around her wrist she looked at me heya murph i said i looked at the gun and the holy symbol and kept my voice calm sorry to drop in on you this late i need your help murphy regarded me in silence for more than a minute then she said wait here she shut the door returned a minute later and opened it again all the way then gun still in hand she stepped back from the doorway and faced me uh i said murph are you all right she nodded okay i said can i come in well know in a minute murphy said i got it then murphy wasnt going to ask me in there are plenty of monsters running around in the dark that cant violate the threshold of a home if they arent invited in one of them had caught up to murphy last year nearly killing her and it had been wearing my face when it did it no wonder she didnt look exactly overjoyed to see me murph i said relax its me hells bells there isnt anything that i can think of that would mimic me looking like this even demonic fiends from the nether regions of hell have some taste i stepped across her threshold something tugged at me as i did an intangible invisible energy it slowed me down a little and i had to make an effort to push through it thats what a threshold is like one like it surrounds every home a field of energy that keeps out unwanted magical forces some places have more of a threshold than others my apartment for example didnt have much of a thresholdits a bachelor pad and whatever domestic energy is responsible for such things doesnt seem to settle down as well in rental spaces and lone dwellings murphys house had a heavy field surrounding it it had a life of its own it had history it was a home not just a place to live i crossed her threshold uninvited and i left a lot of my power at the door as i did i would have to really push to make even the simplest of spells work within i stepped inside and spread my hands do i pass inspection murphy didnt say anything she crossed the room and put her gun back into its holster setting it down on an end table murphys place was dare i say it cute the room was done in soft yellows and greens and there were ruffles the curtains had ruffles and the couch had more plus those little knitted things arent they called doilies were draped over the arms of the two recliners the couch the coffee table and just about every other surface that seemed capable of supporting lacy bits of froofra they looked old and beautiful and well cared for i was betting murphys grandma had picked them out murphys own decorating was limited to the guncleaning kit sitting on the end table beside the holster for her automatic and a wooden rack over the fireplace that bore a pair of japanese swords long and short one over the other that was the murphy i knew and loved practical violence ready at hand next to the swords was a small row of photographs in holdersmaybe her family a thick picture album with what looked like a real leather cover sat open on the coffee table next to a prescription bottle and a decanter of some kind of liquorgin the decanter was half empty the glass next to it was completely empty i watched her settle down in the corner of the couch in her oversized bathrobe her expression remote she didnt look at me i got more worried by the moment murphy wasnt acting like murphy shed never passed up a chance to trade banter with me id never seen her this silent and withdrawn dammit just when i needed some quick and decisive help something was wrong with murphy and i hardly had time to play dimestore psychologist trying to help her i needed whatever information she could get me i also needed to help her with whatever it was that had hurt her so badly i was fairly sure i wouldnt be able to do either if i didnt get her talking nice place murph i told her i havent seen it before she twitched one shoulder in what might have been a shrug i frowned you know if conversation is too much for you we could play charades ill go first i held up my hand with my fingers spread murphy didnt say anything so i provided her end of the dialogue five words i tugged on my ear sounds like what is wrong with you she shook her head i saw her eyes flicker toward the album i leaned forward and turned the album toward me it had been opened on a cluster of wedding pictures the girl in them must have been murphy back when she had longer sunnier hair and a kind of adolescent slenderness that showed around her neck and wrists she wore a white wedding gown and stood next to a tuxedoclad man who had to have been ten years older than she was in other pictures she was shoving cake into his mouth drinking through linked arms the usual wedding fare he had carried her to the getaway car and the photomurphys face had been caught in a moment of laughter and joy first husband i asked that got through to her she glanced up at me for just a second then nodded you were a kid in this maybe eighteen she shook her head seventeen she nodded at least i was getting some kind of response out of her how long were you married to him silence i frowned murph im not like a genius about this stuff or anything but if youre feeling guilty about something maybe youre being a little hard on yourself without a word she leaned forward and picked up the album moving it aside to reveal a copy of the tribune it had been folded open to the obituaries page she picked it up and handed it to me i read the first one out loud gregory taggart age fortythree died last night after a long bout with cancer i paused and looked at the photograph of the deceased and then at murphys album it was the same man give or take several years of wear and tear i winced and lowered the paper oh god murph im sorry im so sorry she blinked her eyes several times her voice came out thready quiet he didnt even tell me that he was sick talk about your nasty surprises murph look im sure that that things will work out i know how youre hurting how you must feel but do you she said still very quiet do you know how i feel did you lose your first love i sat quietly for a full minute before i said yeah i did what was her name it hurt to think the name much less to say it but if it helped me get through to murphy i couldnt afford to be touchy elaine we were both of us were orphans we got adopted by the same man when we were ten murphy blinked and looked up at me she was your sister i dont have any relatives we were both adopted by the same guy thats all we lived together drove one another nuts hit puberty together do the math she nodded how long were you together oh until we were about sixteen what happened how did she i shrugged my adoptive father tried to get me into black magic human sacrifice murphy frowned he was a wizard i nodded strong one so was she didnt he try to get elaine too did get her i said she was helping him what happened she asked quietly i tried to keep my voice even and calm but i wasnt sure how well i managed it i ran away he sent a demon after me i beat it then went back to save elaine she hit me with a binding spell when i wasnt looking and he tried a spell that would break into my head make me do what he wanted i slipped out of the spell elaine had on me and took on justin i got lucky he lost everything burned murphy swallowed what happened to elaine burned i said quietly my throat tightening shes dead god harry murphy was quiet for a moment greg left me we tried to talk a few times but it always ended in a fight her eyes welled up with tears dammit i should have at least gotten to tell him goodbye i put the paper back on the table and closed the album studiously not looking at murphy i knew she wouldnt want me to see her crying she inhaled sharply im sorry harry she said im flaking out on you here i shouldnt i dont know why this is getting to me so hard i glanced at the booze and the pills on the table its okay everyone has an off day sometimes i cant afford it she drew the bathrobe a little closer around herself and said sorry harry about the gun her words sounded heavy maybe a little slurred i had to be sure it was really you i understand i said she looked at me and something like gratitude touched her eyes she got up from the couch abruptly and walked down a hallway out of the living room and said over her shoulder let me put something else on sure okay i said after her frowning i leaned over to the table and picked up the prescription bottle behind the booze next to the empty tumbler a mediumsized dose of valium no wonder murphy had been slurring her words valium and gin hells bells i was still holding the pills when she came back in wearing baggy shorts and a tshirt shed raked a brush through her hair and splashed water on her face so that i could barely tell that shed been crying she stopped short and looked at me i didnt say anything she chewed on her lip murph i said finally are you okay is there i mean do you need relax dresden she said folding her arms im not suicidal funny you say that mixing drinks with drugs is a great way to get it done she walked over to me jerked the pill bottle out of my hands and picked up the bottle of booze it isnt any of your business she said she walked into the kitchen dropped things off and came back out again im fine ill be fine murph ive never seen you with a drink in your life and valium it makes me worry about you dresden if you came over here to lecture me you can leave right now i shoved my fingers through my shaggy hair karrin i swear im not lecturing im just trying to understand she looked away from me for a minute one foot rubbing at the opposite calf it hit me how small she looked how frail her eyes were not only weary i saw now they were haunted i walked over to her and put a hand on her shoulder her skin was warm underneath the cotton of her tshirt talk to me murph please she pulled her shoulder out from under my hand it isnt a big deal its the only way i can get any sleep what do you mean she took a deep breath i mean i cant sleep without help the drinks didnt help the drugs didnt either i have to use both or i wont get any rest i still dont get it why cant you sleep is it because of greg murphy shook her head then moved over to the couch away from me and curled up in the corner of it clasping her hands over her knees ive been having nightmares night terrors the doctors say they say its different from just bad dreams i felt my cheek twitch with tension and you cant stay asleep she shook her head i wake myself up screaming i saw her clench her fists god dammit dresden theres no reason for it i shouldnt get rattled by a few bad dreams i shouldnt fall to pieces hearing about a man i havent spoken to in years i dont know what the fuck is wrong with me i closed my eyes youre dreaming about last year arent you about what kravos did to you she shivered at the mention of the name and nodded i couldnt stop thinking about it for a long time trying to figure out what i did wrong why he was able to get to me i ached inside murph there wasnt anything you could have done dont you think i know that she said her voice quiet i couldnt have known that it wasnt you i couldnt have stopped him even if i had i couldnt have done anything to defend myself to stop whwhat he did to me once he was inside my head her eyes clouded with tears but she blinked them away her jaw setting there wasnt anything i could have done thats what scares me harry thats why im afraid murph hes dead hes dead and gone we watched them put him in the ground murphy snarled i know that i know it harry i know hes gone i know he cant hurt me anymore i know hes never going to hurt anyone again she looked up at me for a moment chancing a look at my eyes hers were clouded with tears but i still have the dreams i know it but it doesnt make any difference god poor murphy shed taken a spiritual mauling before id shown up to save her the thing that attacked her had been a spirit being and it had torn her apart on the inside without leaving a mark on her skin in a way shed been raped all of her power had been taken away and shed been used for the amusement of another no wonder it had left her with scars adding an unpleasant shock of bad news had been like tossing a spark onto a pile of tinder soaked in jet fuel harry she continued her voice quiet soft you know me god im not a whiner i hate that but what that thing did to me the things it made me see made me feel she looked up at me pain in the lines at the corners of her eyes which threatened tears it wont go away i try to leave it behind me but it wont go and its eating up every part of my life she turned away grabbing irritably at a box of tissues i walked over to the fireplace and studied the swords on the mantel so she wouldnt feel my eyes on her after a moment she spoke her tone changing growing more focused what are you doing here so late i turned back to face her i need a favor information i passed over the envelope mab had given me murphy opened it looked at the pair of pictures and frowned these are shots from the report of ronald reuels death how did you get them i didnt i said a client gave them to me i dont know where she got them she rubbed her eyes and asked what did she want from you she wants me to find the person who killed him murphy shook her head i thought this was an accidental death i hear it isnt whered you hear that i sighed a magic faerie told me that got me a suspicious glare which dissolved into a frown god youre being literal arent you yeah murphy shook her head a tired smile at the corners of her mouth how can i help id like to look at the file on ronald reuels death i cant look at the scene but maybe cpd caught something they didnt know was a clue it would give me a place to start at least murphy nodded without looking at me all right one condition sure what if this is a murder you bring me in on it murph i protested come on i dont want to pull you into anything that dammit harry murphy snapped if someones killing people in chicago im going to deal with them its my job whats been happening to me doesnt change that its your job to stop the bad guys i said but this might not be a guy maybe not even human i just think youd be safer if fuck safe murphy muttered my job harry if you turn up a killing you will bring me in i hesitated trying not to let my frustration show i didnt want murphy involved with mab and company murphy had earned too many scars already the faeries had a way of insinuating themselves into your life i didnt want murphy exposed to that especially as vulnerable as she was but at the same time i couldnt lie to her i owed her a lot more than that bottom line murphy had been hurt she was afraid and if she didnt force herself to face that fear it might swallow her whole she knew it as terrified as she was she knew that she had to keep going or she would never recover as much as i wanted to keep her safe especially now it wouldnt help her not in the long run in a sense her life was at stake deal i said quietly she nodded and rose stay out here i need to get on the computer see what i can pull up for you i can wait if its better she shook her head ive already taken the valium if i wait any longer ill be too zonked to think straight just sit down have a drink try not to blow up anything she padded out of the room on silent feet i sat down in one of the armchairs stretched out my legs let my head fall forward and dropped into a light doze it had been a long day and it looked like it was just going to get longer i woke up when murphy came back into the room her eyes heavy she had a manila folder with her okay she said this is everything i could print out the pictures arent as clear as they could be but they arent horrible i sat up took the folder from her and opened it murphy sat down in an armchair facing me her legs tucked beneath her i started going over the details in the folder though my brain felt like some kind of gelatin dessert topped with mush what happened to your hand she asked magic faerie i said magic faerie with a letter opener it doesnt look good the dressing isnt right either you have anyone look at it i shook my head no time harry you idiot she got up disappeared into the kitchen and came back out with a first aid kit i decided not to argue with her she pulled up a chair from the kitchen next to mine and rested my arm in her lap im trying to read here murph youre still bleeding puncture wounds will ooze forever if you dont keep them covered yeah i tried to explain that but they made me take the bandage off anyway who did long story so the security guard on the building didnt see anyone come in she peeled off the bandage with brisk motions it hurt she fished out some disinfectant cameras didnt pick up anything either and there arent any bursts of static to indicate someone using magic i checked i whistled not bad murph yeah sometimes i use my head instead of my gun this will hurt she sprayed disinfectant liberally on my hand it stung ow wimp any other ways in and out of the building not unless they could fly and walk through walls the other doors are all fire exits with alarms that would trip if someone opened them i kept paging through the file broken neck due to fall it says they found him at the bottom of the stairs right murphy used a wipe to clean both sides of my hand and then she put more disinfectant on it hurt a bit less he had contusions consistent with a fall and he was an old man no one seen entering or leaving an apartment building with a highsecurity system so naturally no one looked for a killer i finished or reported anything that might have indicated one or wait did they says here that the first officer on the scene found slippery goo on the landing above where reuel fell but none of the detectives on the scene later found any such thing murphy said she pressed a gauze pad against the wound from either side and began wrapping medical tape around to hold the pads on the first officer was a rookie they figured he was seeing a killing where there wasnt one so he could get in on a murder investigation i frowned turning the printouts of the photographs around see here the sleeves of reuels coat are wet you can see the discoloration she looked and admitted maybe theres no mention of it though slippery goo it could have been ectoplasm is that too tight ectowhat i flexed my fingers a little testing the bandage its fine ectoplasm matter from the nevernever thats the spirit world right faerieland among other things and stuff from there is goo it turns into goo when theres not any magic animating it as long as the magic is there its as good as real like when kravos made a body that looked like mine and came gunning for you murphy shivered and started putting things back into her kit so when whatever it is that has made this ecto goo into matter has gone it turns back into slime i said its clear and slippery and it evaporates in a few minutes so something from the nevernever could have killed reuel murphy said yeah i said or someone could have opened up a portal into the apartment building theres usually some gunk left when you open a portal dust drifting out from the nevernever so they could have opened a portal then gotten out the same way whoa hold it i thought faerieland was monsters only people can go into the nevernever if you know the right magic yeah its full of things that are fairly dangerous though you dont just cruise through on a sunday stroll jesus christ murphy muttered so someone or something i interjected or something could have gotten into the building and out again just like that past all the locks and guards and cameras how scary is that could have yeah stepped in pitched grampa down the stairs stepped out again god that poor old man i dont think he was helpless murph reuel was mixed up with the faeries i kind of doubt his hands were squeaky clean she nodded okay had he made any supernatural enemies i held up the picture of the body looks like it murphy shook her head she swayed a little bit and then sat down next to me leaning her head against the corner of the couch so whats the next step i go digging pound the proverbial pavement you dont look so good get some rest first a shower some food maybe a haircut i rubbed my eyes with my good hand yeah i said and you tell me when you know something murph if this was something from the nevernever its going to be out of your i almost said league jurisdiction she shrugged if it came into my town and hurt someone im responsible for protecting i want to make it answer for that she closed her eyes same as you besides you promised well she had me there yeah okay murph when i find something out ill call all right she said she curled up in the corner of the couch again heavy eyes closing she leaned her head back baring the lines of her throat after a moment she asked have you heard from susan i shook my head no but her articles are still coming into the arcane shes all right i nodded i guess so have you found anything that will help her yet i sighed and shook my head no not yet its like pounding my head against a wall she halfway smiled with your head the wall breaks first youre the most stubborn man ive ever met you say the sweetest things murphy nodded youre a good man harry if anyone can help her its you i looked down so she wouldnt see the tears that made my eyes swim a little and started putting the file back together thanks murph that means a lot to me she didnt answer i looked up and saw that her mouth had fallen slightly open and her body was totally relaxed a cheek resting on the arm of the couch murph i asked she didnt stir i got up and left the file on the chair i found a blanket and draped it lightly over her tucking it in around her she made a soft sound in the back of her throat and nuzzled her cheek closer to the couch sleep well murph i said then i headed for the door i locked what i could behind me made my way back to the beetle and drove toward home i ached everywhere not from sore muscles but from simple exhaustion my wounded hand felt like a big throbbing knot of cramping muscle doused in gasoline and set on fire i hurt even more on the inside poor murph had been torn up badly she was terrified of the things she might have to face but that made her no less determined to face them that was courage and more than i had i at least was sure that i could hit back if one of the monsters came after me murphy didnt have any such certainty murphy was my friend shed saved my life before wed fought side by side she needed my help again she had to face her fear i understood that she needed me to help make it happen but i didnt have to like it in her condition she would be extra vulnerable to any kind of attack like the one by kravos the year before and if she got hit again before she had a chance to piece herself back together it might not simply wound herit might break her entirely i wasnt sure i could live with myself if that happened dammit i muttered so help me murph im going to make sure you come out of this okay i shoved my worries about murphy to the back of my mind the best way to protect her would be to focus on this case to get cracking but my brain felt like something had crawled into it and died the only cracking it was going to be doing was the kind that would land me in a rubber room and a sleeveless coat i wanted food sleep a shower if i didnt take some time to put myself back together i might walk right into something that would kill me and not notice it until it was too late i drove back to my apartment which is the basement of a rooming house more than a century old i parked the beetle outside and got my rod and staff out of the car to take with me it wasnt much of a walk between my apartment and the car but id been accosted before vampires can be really inconsiderate that way i thumped down the stairs to my apartment unlocked the door and murmured the phrase that would disarm my wards long enough to let me get inside i slipped in and my instincts screamed at me that i was not alone i lifted the blasting rod gathering my power and sending it humming through the focus so that the tip burst into brilliant crimson light that flooded my apartment and then there she was a slender woman standing by my cold fireplace all graceful curves and poised reserve she wore a pair of blue jeans over long coltish legs with a simple scarlet cotton tshirt a silver pentacle hung outside the shirt resting on the curve of modest breasts and it gleamed in the light from my readied blasting rod her skin was pale like the inner bark of an oak the living part of the tree her hair the browngold of ripe wheat her eyes the grey of storm clouds her fine mouth twitched first into a smile and then into a frown and she lifted elegant longfingered hands to show me empty palms i let myself in she murmured i hope you dont mind you should change your wards more often i lowered the blasting rod too stunned to speak my heart lurching in my chest she lowered her hands and closed the distance between us she lifted herself onto her toes but she was tall enough that it wasnt much of an effort for her to kiss my cheek she smelled like wildflowers and sundrenched summer afternoons she drew back enough to focus on my face and my eyes her own expression gentle and concerned hello harry and i said in a bare whisper fighting through the shock hello elaine chapter eight elaine walked past me making a circuit around my apartment it wasnt much of a tour the place consists of a living room and a tiny bedroom the kitchen is pretty much just an alcove with a sink and a fridge the floor is smooth grey stone but id covered a lot of it with a few dozen rugs my furniture is all secondhand and comfortable it doesnt even come close to matching bookshelves fill up most of the wall space and where they dont i have several tapestries plus a star wars movie poster billy gave me for christmas its the old poster the one with princess leia clinging to lukes leg anyway that was my apartment on a normal day lately it had suffered from disrepair it didnt smell so great and pizza boxes and empty coke cans had overflowed the trash can and spilled over a significant portion of the kitchen floor you could barely walk without stepping on clothing that needed to be washed my furniture was covered with scribbledon papers and discarded pens and pencils elaine walked through it all like a red cross worker through a war zone and shook her head i know you werent expecting me harry but i didnt think id be overdressed you live in this elaine i choked out youre alive a little less of a compliment than i would have hoped for but i guess it could have been worse she regarded me from near the kitchen im alive harry her face flickered with a trace of apprehension how are you feeling i lowered myself onto the couch papers crunching beneath me i released the power held ready to strike and the glowing tip of the blasting rod went out leaving the apartment in darkness i kept staring at her afterimage on my vision shocked i said finally this isnt happening hells bells this has got to be some sort of trick no its me if i was something out of the nevernever could i have crossed your threshold uninvited do you know anyone else who knows how you set up your wards anyone could figure it out eventually i said all right does anyone else know that you failed your drivers test five times in one week or that you sprained your shoulder trying to impress me going out for football our freshman year that we soulgazed on our first night together i think i can still remember our locker combination if you like my god elaine i shook my head elaine alive my brain could not wrap itself around the idea why didnt you contact me i saw her dimly lean against the wall she was quiet for a while as though she had to shape her words carefully at first because i didnt even know if you had survived and after that she shook her head i wasnt sure i wanted to wasnt sure youd want me to so much happened my shock and disbelief faded before a sudden aching pain and an old old anger thats putting it mildly i said you tried to destroy me no she said god no harry you dont understand i never wanted that my voice gained a hard edge which is why you hit me with that binding why you held me down while justin tried to destroy me he never wanted you dead no he just wanted to break into my head wanted to control me make me into some kind of of words failed me in the face of my frustration thrall elaine said quietly hed have wrapped you in enough spells to guarantee your loyalty to make you his thrall and thats worse than dead and you helped him her voice crackled with anger of its own yes harry i helped him thats what thralls do my rising ire abruptly quieted what what are you saying i saw her dim shape bow its head justin caught me about two weeks before he sent that demon to capture you that day i stayed home sick remember by the time you got home from school he had me i tried to fight him but i was a child i didnt have enough experience to resist him and after he had enthralled me i didnt see why i should fight anymore i stared at her for a long minute so youre telling me that you didnt have any choice i breathed he forced you to do it he made you help him yes why the hell should i believe you i dont expect you to i rose and paced back and forth restlessly i cant believe youre trying to tell me that the devil made you do it do you have any idea how lame that excuse sounds elaine watched me carefully her grey eyes pensive and sad it wasnt an excuse harry nothing can excuse the kind of pain i put you through i stopped and frowned at her then why are you telling me because it needs to be said she murmured because thats what happened you deserve to know that it was quiet for a long time then i asked he really had enthralled you elaine shivered and nodded what was it like she fretted at her lower lip i didnt know it was happening not at the time i didnt have the ability to think clearly justin told me that you just needed to be shown what to do and that if i would hold you still long enough to let him explain things to you it would all work out i believed him trusted him she shook her head i never wanted to hurt you harry never im sorry i sat down and rubbed my face with my hands my emotions running high and out of control again without the anger to support me all that was left inside was pain i thought i had gotten over elaines loss her betrayal i thought i had forgotten it and moved on i was wrong the wounds burst open again as painful as they had ever been maybe more so i had to fight to control my breathing my tone i had loved her i wanted very badly to believe her i i looked for you i said quietly in fire and water i had spirits combing the earth for any trace of you hoping that youd survived she pushed away from the wall and walked to the fireplace i heard her putting in wood and then she murmured something soft and low flame licked up over the logs easily smoothly low and blue then settled into a dark golden light i watched her profile as she stared down at the fire i got out of the house before you and justin were finished she said finally his spells had begun to unravel and i was struggling against them confused terrified i must have run i dont even remember doing it but where have you been i asked elaine i looked for you for years years where you couldnt have found me harry you or anyone else i found sanctuary a place to hide but there was a price and thats why im here she looked up at me and though her features were calm and smooth i could see the fear in her eyes hear it coloring her voice im in trouble my answer came out at once for me chivalry isnt dead its an involuntary reflex it could have been any woman asking for help and id have said the same thing it might have taken me a second or two longer but i would have for elaine there was no need to think about it for even that long ill help her shoulders sagged and she nodded pressing her lips together and bowing her head thank you thank you harry i hate doing this i hate bringing this to you after all this time but i dont know where else to turn no i said its all right really whats going on why do you think youre in trouble what do you mean youre paying a price its complicated she said but the short version is that i was granted asylum by the summer court of the sidhe my stomach dropped about twenty feet i built up a debt to titania the summer queen in exchange for her protection and now its time to pay it off she took a deep breath theres been a murder within the realms of the sidhe i rubbed at my eyes and titania wants you to be her emissary she wants you to find the killer and prove that the winter court is to blame she told you that you would be contacted tonight by mabs emissary but she didnt tell you who it was going to be elaines eyes widened in shock and she fell silent we stared at one another for a long moment before she whispered stars and stones she pushed her hair back from her face with one hand in what i knew to be a nervous gesture even if it didnt look it harry if i dont succeed if i dont fulfill my debt to her im its going to be very bad for me hooboy i muttered tell me about it mabs more or less got me over the same barrel elaine swore quietly what are we going to do uh i said she looked at me expectantly i scowled im thinking im thinking uh she rose and took a few longlegged strides across the living room and back agitated there must be something some way out of this god sometimes their sense of humor makes me sick mab and titania are laughing right now if id had the energy id have been pacing too i closed my eyes and tried to think if i didnt succeed on mabs behalf she wouldnt grant rights of passage to the council the council would judge that i had failed my trial and theyd wrap me up and deliver me to the vampires i didnt know the specifics of elaines situation but i doubted she had a deal that was any less fatal my head hurt elaine continued pacing exasperated come on harry what are you thinking im thinking that if this dilemma grows any more horns im going to shoot it and put it up on the wall i know this will never sink into your head but this isnt a time for jokes we need to come up with something okay ive got it i said get your stuff and come with me elaine reached back to the shadows beside the fireplace and withdrew a slender staff of pale wood carved with swirling abstract shapes where are we going i pushed myself up to talk to the council and get their help elaine lifted her eyebrows dont take this the wrong way harry but are you crazy hear me out she pressed her lips together but gave me a quick nod its simple were in way over our heads we need help youve got to come out to the council in any case says who oh come on youre human elaine and a wizard thats what is really important to them theyll side with us against the faeries help us figure a way out of this mess elaine twitched at my use of the word flicking a look around her as if by reflex that doesnt sound like the council ive heard of could be that youve heard a skewed point of view i said elaine nodded could be the council ive heard of nearly executed you for defending yourself against justin well yeah but they put you on probation under threat of summary execution and you all but had to kill yourself to get cleared well i was all but killing myself anyway i mean i didnt do it so that the council would she shook her head god harry you just cant see it can you the council doesnt care about you they dont want to protect you they will only put up with you as long as you toe the line and dont become an inconvenience im already inconvenient a liability then elaine said look some of the council have their heads up their rear ends sure but there are good people there too elaine folded her arms and shook her head and how many of those good people dont want a thing to do with the council elaine no harry i mean it i dont want anything to do with them ive lived this long without the councils socalled protection i think i can muddle through a little longer elaine when they find out about you it needs to be from you if you come forward its going to cut down on any uneasiness or suspicion they might feel suspicion elaine exclaimed harry i am not a criminal youre just asking for trouble elaine and how are they going to find out about me hmmm were you planning on running off to tattle of course not i said but i was thinking how much trouble i was going to be in if one of the wardens heard i was associating with someone who might be a violator of the first law and one of justin dumornes apprentices at that with the cloud of disfavor i was already under adding that kind of suspicion to it might be enough to sink me regardless of how the investigation turned out do i have a great life or what i wont say anything i said finally it has to be your choice elaine but please believe me trust me i have friends in the council too theyll help elaines expression softened and became less certain youre sure yeah i said cross my heart she leaned on her oddly carved staff and frowned she was opening her mouth to speak when my reinforced door rattled under the rapping of a heavy fist dresden morgan growled from the other side of the door open up traitor there are questions i need you to answer chapter nine elaine shot me a wideeyed look and mouthed the word council i nodded and pointed to my staff in the corner along with my sword cane elaine picked it up without a word and tossed it to me then she moved silently through the door of my darkened bedroom and vanished inside the door rattled again dresden morgan growled i know youre in there open the door i swung it open before he could go on or youll huff and youll puff and so on morgan glowered at me tall sour and dour as ever hed traded his robes and cloak for dark slacks a grey silk shirt and a sport coat he carried a golf bag on one shoulder and most people wouldnt have noticed the hilt of a sword nestled among the golf clubs he leaned forward cool eyes looking past me and into my apartment dresden am i interrupting anything well i was going to settle down with a porn video and a bottle of baby oil but i really dont have enough for two morgans expression twisted in revulsion and i felt an absurd little burst of vindictive satisfaction you disgust me dresden yeah im bad im a bad bad bad man im glad we got that settled goodbye morgan i started to shut my door in his face he slammed his palm against it morgan was a lot stronger than me the door stayed open im not finished dresden i am its been one hell of a day if youve got something to say say it morgans mouth set in a hard smile normally i appreciate that kind of directness not with you gee you dont appreciate me ill cry myself to sleep morgan stroked his thumb over the strap to the golf bag i want to know how it is dresden that mab just happened to come to you about this problem the one thing that can preserve your status with the council and it just happened to fall to you clean living i said plus my mondo wheels and killer bachelor pad morgan looked at me with flat eyes you think youre funny oh i know im funny unappreciated but funny morgan shook his head do you know what i think dresden you think morgan didnt smile like i said unappreciated i think that youve planned all of this i think you are in with the vampires and the winter court i think this is part of a deeper scheme i just stared at him i tried not to laugh i really did well maybe i didnt try all that hard the laughter must have gotten to morgan he balled up his fist and slammed a stiff jab into my belly that took the wind out of my sails and half dropped me to my knees no he said you arent going to laugh this off traitor he stepped into my apartment the threshold didnt make him blink the wards i had up caught him six inches later but they werent designed to be too much of an impediment to human beings morgan grunted spoke a harsh word in a guttural tongue maybe old german and slashed his hand in front of him the air hissed and popped with static electricity sparks flashing from his fingertips he shook his fingers briefly then walked in he looked around the place and shook his head again dresden you might not be a bad person all in all but i think that youre compromised if you arent working with the red court then i am certain that they are using you either way the threat to the council is the same and its best removed by removing you i tried to suck in a breath and finally managed to say what the hell are you talking about susan rodriguez morgan said your lover the vampire anger made bright lights flash behind my eyes shes not a vampire i snarled they turned her dresden no one goes back thats all there is to it they havent shes not morgan shrugged thats what you would say if shed addicted you to the venom youd say or do just about anything for them by now i looked up at him teeth bared get the fuck out of my house he walked over to the fireplace and picked up a dustcovered gift card id left sitting on the mantel he read it and snorted then he picked up a picture i had of susan pretty he said but thats easy to come by odds are she was their pawn from the first day she met you i clenched my hands into fists you shut your mouth i said you just shut your mouth about her thats not how it was youre a fool dresden a young fool do you really think that a normal mortal woman would want anything to do with you or your life you cant accept that she was just a tool one of their whores i spun to the corner letting go of my staff and picked up my sword cane i drew the blade free with a steely rasp and turned toward morgan he saw it coming and had already drawn the bright silver blade of the wardens from the golf bag every tired aching angry bone in my body wanted to lunge at him im not heavy with muscle but im not slow and ive got arms and legs miles long my lunge is quick and i can do it from a long way back morgan was a seasoned soldier but in such close quarters it would be a question of reflexes advantage to the guy with the sword weighed in ounces instead of stones in that moment i was sure that i could have killed him he might have taken me with him but i could have done it and i wanted to badly not in any sort of intellectual sense but in the part of the brain that does all of its thinking after the fact my temper had frayed to bloody tatters and i wanted to vent it on morgan but a thought snuck in past the testosterone and spoiled my rage i stopped myself shaking and with my knuckles white on my sword cane i drew myself up straight and i said very quietly thats number three morgans brow furrowed and he stared at me his own weapon steadily extended toward me what are you talking about dresden the third plan the merlins ace in the hole he sent you here to pick a fight with me with my door still standing open theres another warden outside listening isnt there a witness so that you have a clean kill hand the body over to the vampires end of problem right morgans eyes widened he stammered over the first word i dont know what youre talking about i picked up the sheath half of the sword cane and slipped the blade back into it sure you dont get out morgan unless youd prefer to stab an unarmed man who isnt offering you violence morgan stared at me for a moment more then he shoved the sword back into the golf bag swung it onto his shoulder and headed for the door he was almost out when there was a clunk from my bedroom i shot a look at the doorway morgan stopped he looked at me and then at my bedroom something ugly sparkled in his gaze who is in the bedroom dresden the vampire girl perhaps no one i said get out well see morgan said he turned and walked to my bedroom door one hand still on the sword you and those who consort with your like will be brought to task very soon im looking forward to it my heart started pounding again if morgan found elaine there were about a million things that might happen and none of them were good there seemed little i could do though i couldnt warn her and i couldnt think of a way to get morgan out of my apartment any faster morgan peered through the doorway and looked around then abruptly let out a hoarse cry and jumped back at the same time there was a harsh feline yowl and mister my bobtailed grey cat came zooming out of the bedroom he darted between morgans legs and then streaked past him out of the apartment and up the stairs into the summer evening gosh morgan i said my cat might be a dangerous subversive maybe youd better interrogate him morgan straightened his face slightly red he coughed and then stalked to the door the senior council members wish me to tell you that they will be nearby but that they will not interfere in this trial or aid you in any way he took a business card out of his shirt pocket and let it fall to the floor thats the contact number for the senior council use it when you have failed the trial dont let the door hit you on the brain on the way out i responded morgan glared at me as he left he slammed the door behind him and stomped up the stairs i started trembling maybe half a minute after he leftreaction to the stress at least i hadnt done it in front of him i turned around leaned back against the door with my eyes closed and folded my arms over my chest it was easier not to feel myself shaking that way another minute or two passed before i heard elaine move quietly out of my bedroom the fire popped and crackled are they gone elaine asked her voice was very carefully steady yeah though i wouldnt put it past them to watch my place i felt her fingers touch my shoulder youre shaking harry ill be all right you could have killed him elaine said when you first drew yeah was he really setting you up like you said i looked at her her expression was worried yeah i said god harry she shook her head thats way past paranoia and you want me to give myself to those people i covered her hand with mine not to them i said not everyone on the council is like that she looked at my eyes for a moment then carefully she drew her hand out from under mine no im not going to make myself vulnerable to men like that not again elaine i protested she shook her head im leaving harry she brushed her hair back from her face are you going to tell them i took a deep breath if the wardens found out that elaine was still alive and avoiding them there would be a literal witchhunt the wardens werent exactly known for their tolerance and understanding morgan was walking talking proof of that anyone who helped shield her from the wardens would get the same treatment didnt i already have enough problems no i said of course not elaine gave me a strained smile thank you harry she lifted her staff closer to her holding it with both hands can you get the door for me theyre going to be out there watching ill veil they wont see me theyre good she shrugged and said without emphasis im better ive had practice i shook my head what are we going to do about the faeries i dont know she said ill be in touch how can i contact you she nodded toward the door i opened it she stepped up beside me and kissed my cheek again her lips warm youre the one with the office and the answering service ill contact you then she stepped to the door murmuring quietly under her breath there was a glitter of sudden silver light around her that made me blink when i opened my eyes again she was gone i left the door open for a moment and it was just as well that i did mister came padding back down the stairs a moment later and looked up at me with a plaintive meow he prowled back into the apartment curling around my legs and purring like a diesel engine mister is thirty pounds or so of tomcat i figure one of his parents must have been a sabertoothed tiger good timing by the way i told him and shut the door locking it i stood in the dim warm firelight of the room my cheek still tingled where elaine had kissed it i could smell her lingering perfume and it brought with it a pang of almost tangible memories a flood of things i thought i had forgotten it made me feel old and tired and very alone i walked to the mantel and straightened the card susan had sent me the previous christmas i looked at her picture next to the card shed been in a park that weekend wearing a blue tank top and cutoff shorts her teeth were impossibly white against her darkly tanned skin and coalblack hair id taken the picture while she was laughing and her dark eyes shone i shook my head i am tired mister i said i am ridiculously tired mister meowed at me well resting would be the sane thing to do but who am i to throw stones right i mean im talking to my cat i scratched at my beard and nodded to myself just a minute on the couch then to work i remember sitting down on the couch and after that everything went blissfully black which was just as well the next day things got complicated chapter ten i wasnt too tired to dream evidently my subconsciousweve met and hes kind of a jerkhad something on his mind because the dream was a variation on the theme that had taken up most of my sleeping hours since id last seen susan the dream began with a kiss susan has a gorgeous mouth not too thin and not too full always soft always warm when she kissed me it was like the world went away nothing mattered but the touch of her lips on mine i kissed the dreamsusan and she melted against me with a soft sound the length of her body pliant eager her fingers reached up and trailed over my chest nails lightly raking i leaned back from the kiss after a long moment and my eyes felt almost too heavy to open my lips quivered and tingled with sensation a feeling that begged for more kisses to make it cease she looked up at me dark eyes smoldering her hair had been pulled back into a long silken tail that fell between her shoulder blades it had grown longer in the dreams her lovely aquiline face tilted up toward mine are you all right i asked her i always did and as always she gave me a small sad smile and did not answer i bit my lip im still looking i havent given up she shook her head and drew back from me i had the presence of mind to look around a dark alley this time with the heavy pounding music of a dance club making the nearest wall vibrate susan wore dark tights and a sleeveless blouse and my blackleather duster had been draped over her shoulders and fell to brush her feet she looked at me intently and then turned toward the entrance to the club wait i said she walked to the door and turned back to me extending her hand the door opened and dim reddish light flooded out over her doing odd things to the shadows over her face her dark eyes grew larger no that wasnt right the black of her pupils simply expanded until the whites were gone until there was nothing but darkness where her eyes should have been they were vampire eyes huge and inhuman i cant i said we cant go in there susan her features grew frustrated angry she extended her hand to me again more forcefully hands came out of the darkness in the doorway slim pale androgynous they slipped over susan slowly caressingly tugging at her clothing her hair her eyes fluttered closed for a moment her body growing stiff before her weight shifted slowly toward the doorway longing shot through me sudden mindless and sharp as a scalpels blade hunger a simple and nearly violent need to touch to be touched followed it into me and i suddenly could not think dont i said and stepped toward her i felt her hand take mine i felt her press herself to me with another moan and her lips her mouth devoured mine with ravenous kisses kisses i answered with my own harder and more demanding as my doubts faded i felt it when her kiss turned poisonous when the sudden narcotic numbness swept through my mouth and began to spread through my body it didnt make any difference i kissed her tore at her clothes and she tore at mine the hands helped but i didnt pay any attention to them anymore they were an unimportant background sensation in comparison to susans mouth her hands her skin velvet and warm beneath my fingers there was no romance nothing but need animal carnal i pushed her against a wall in the dim scarlet light and she wrapped herself around me frantic her body urging me on i pressed into her sudden sensation of silk and honey and had to fight for control throwing my head back she quivered then and as always she struck her mouth closed on my throat a flash of heat and agony that melted into a narcotic bliss like that of her kissbut more complete languid delight spread through me and i felt my body reacting all traces of control gone thrusting against her into her the motion slowly died as sheer shivering ecstasy spread through me i began to lose control of my limbs muscles turning to gelatin i sank slowly to the floor susan rode me down her mouth hot and eager on my throat her body her hips moving now taking over the rhythm the pleasure of the venom melted my thoughts and they slid free of my flesh floating over the ground i looked down on my body beneath susan pale and still on the floor eyes empty i saw the change take her i saw her body twist and buck saw her skin split and rip open i saw something dark and horrible tear its way out all gaping dark eyes and slippery black hide blood my blood smeared its mouth the creature froze in shock staring down at my corpse and as i began to drift away the creature threw back its head its body rubbery and sinuous as a snakes and let out an inhuman screeching yowl full of rage pain and need i bolted up out of sleep with a short cry my skin sheathed in a cold sweat my muscles aching and stiff i panted for a moment looking around my apartment my lips tingled with remembered kisses my skin with dreamed caresses i forced myself to my feet with a groan and staggered toward my shower there were times when it was just as well that i had disconnected the water heater to head off magically inspired mishaps it made bathing sheer torture in the winter but sometimes theres no substitute for a cold shower i stripped and stood under chilly water for a while shaking not necessarily from cold either i shook with a lot of things first with raw and mindless lust the shower took the edge off of that in a few moments dont get me wrong i didnt have any particular deathsex fixation but i had been used to a certain amount of friendly tension relieving with susan her absence had killed that for me completelyexcept for rare moments during the damned dreams when my hormones came raging back to the front of my thoughts again as though making up for lost time second i trembled with fear my nightmares might be one part lusty dream but they were also a warning susans curse could kill me and destroy her i couldnt forget that and finally i shook with guilt if i hadnt let her down maybe she wouldnt be in this mess she was gone and i didnt have the vaguest idea where she was i should have been doing more i stuck my head in the water and shoved those thoughts away washing myself off with a ton of soap and the last shampoo in the bottle i scrubbed at my beard and finally reached out and got my straight razor then spent a few minutes and a lot of care removing it dark wiry black hair fell in clumps to the shower floor and my face tingled as it breathed its first air for a couple of months but it felt good and as i went through the routine of grooming my thoughts cleared i dug some clean clothes out of my closet padded out into the living room and pulled back the rug that covered the trapdoor leading to the subbasement i swung the door open lit a candle and descended the stepladder staircase into my lab my lab in contrast to the havoc upstairs looked like something run by a particularly analretentive military clerk a long table ran down the middle of the room between a pair of other tables one on either wall leaving only narrow walkways white steel wire shelves on the walls held the host of magical components i used in research they resided in a variety of jars bottles boxes and plastic containers most with labels listing the contents how much was left and when i had acquired the item the tables were clean except for stacks of notes a jar of pens and pencils and myriad candles i lit a few of them and walked down to the other end of the lab checking the copper summoning circle set into the floor and making sure that nothing lay across it you never knew when a magic circle would come in handy one area of the lab had retained the casual chaos that had been its major theme before id taken up nearly fulltime residence last year one shelf still battered old wood hadnt been changed or updated candleholders covered in multiple shades of melted wax that had spilled down over them sat at either end of the shelf between them was a scattering of various articlesa number of battered paperback romances several victorias secret catalogs a scarlet scrap of a silk ribbon that had been tied into a bow on a naked young woman named justine one bracelet from a broken set of handcuffs and a bleached old human skull bob wake up i said lighting candles i need to pick your brain lights orange and nebulous kindled deep in the shadows of the skulls eye sockets the skull quivered a little bit on its shelf and then stretched its toothy mouth open in an approximation of a yawn so was the kid right was there some portenttype action going on rain of toads i said real ones yeah ouch said bob the skull bob wasnt really a skull the skull was just a vessel for the spirit of intellect that resided inside and helped me keep track of the constantly evolving metaphysical laws that govern the use of magic but bob the skull is a lot easier to say than bob the spirit of intellect and lab assistant i nodded breaking out my bunsen burners and beakers tell me about it look bob ive got kind of a difficult situation here and harry you arent going to be able to do this there is no cure for vampirism i like susan too but it cant be done you think people havent looked for a cure before now i havent looked for one before now i said and ive had a couple of ideas i want to look at aye capn ahab arr har har har well get that white devil sir damn right we will but weve got something else to do first bobs eyelights brightened you mean something other than hopeless pointless vampire research im already interested does it have to do with the rain of toads i frowned got out a pad of paper and a pencil and started scratching things down sometimes that helped me sort things out maybe its a murder investigation gotcha whos the corpse artist ronald reuel bobs eyelights burned down to twin points ah who is asking you to find the killer we dont know he was killed cops say it was an accident but you think differently i shook my head i dont know a thing about it but mab says he was killed she wants me to find the killer and prove that it wasnt her bob fell into a shocked silence nearly a minute long my pen scratched on the paper until bob blurted mab the mab harry yeah queen of air and darkness that mab yeah i said impatient and shes your client yes bob heres where i ask why dont you spend your time doing something safer and more boring like maybe administering suppositories to rabid gorillas i live for challenge i said or you dont as the case may be bob said brightly harry if ive told you once ive told you a thousand times you dont get tangled up with the sidhe its always more complicated than you thought it would be thanks for the advice skull boy it wasnt like i had a choice lea sold her my debt then you should have traded her something for your freedom bob said you know stolen an extra baby or something and given it to her stolen a baby im in enough trouble already well if you werent such a goody twoshoes all the time i pushed at the bridge of my nose with my thumb this was going to be one of those conversations that gave me a headache i could tell already look bob can we stick to the subject please time is important so lets get to work i need to know why reuel would have been knocked off gee whiz harry bob said maybe because he was the summer knight my pencil fell out of my fingers and rolled on the table whoa i said are you sure what do you think bob replied somehow putting a sneer into the words uh i said this means trouble it means it means that things with the sidhe are more complicated than you thought gee if only someone had warned you at some point not to be an idiot and go making deals i gave the skull a sour look and recovered my pencil how much trouble am i in a lot bob said the knights are entrusted with power by the sidhe courts theyre tough i dont know much about them i confessed theyre some kind of representative of the faeries right dont call them that to their faces harry they dont like it any more than youd like being called an ape just tell me what im dealing with bobs eyelights narrowed until they almost went out then brightened again after a moment as the skull began to speak a sidhe knight is mortal bob said a champion of one of the sidhe courts he gets powers in line with his court and hes the only one who is allowed to act in affairs not directly related to the sidhe meaning meaning that if one of the queens wants an outsider dead her knight is the trigger man i frowned hang on a minute you mean that the queens cant personally gun down anyone who isnt in their court not unless the target does something stupid like make an openended bargain without even trying to trade a baby for off topic bob do i or dont i have to worry about getting killed this time around of course you do bob said in a cheerful tone it just means that the queen isnt allowed to actually personally end your life they could however trick you into walking into quicksand and watch you drown turn you into a stag and set the hounds after you bind you into an enchanted sleep for a few hundred years that kind of thing i guess it was too good to be true but my point is that if reuel was the summer knight mab couldnt have killed him right so why should she be under suspicion because she could have done it indirectly and harry odds are the sidhe dont really care about reuels murder knights come and go like paper cups id guess that they were upset about something else the only thing they really care about power i guessed see you can use your brain when you want to i shook my head mab said something had been taken and that id know what it was i muttered i guess thats it how much power are we talking about a knight of the sidhe is no pushover harry bob said his tone earnest so were talking about a lot of magic going awol grand theft mojo i drummed my pen on the table where does the power come from originally the queens i frowned tell me if im off track here if it comes from the queens its a part of them right if a knight dies the power should snap back to the queen like it was on a rubber band exactly but this time it didnt so the summer queen is missing a load of power shes been weakened if everything youve told me is true yes bob said theres no more balance between summer and winter hell that could explain the toads thats a serious play of forces isnt it bob rolled his eyelights the turning of the seasons duh harry the sidhe are closer to the mortal world than any other beings of the nevernever summers had a slight edge for a while now but it looks like theyve lost it and here i thought global warming was due to cow farts i shook my head so titania loses a bunch of juice and naturally suspicion falls on her archenemy mab yeah it is kind of an archenemyish thing to do you have to admit i guess i frowned down at my notes bob what happens if this imbalance between the courts continues bad things bob said it will mess around with weather patterns cause aberrant behavior in plants and animals and sooner or later the sidhe courts will go to war with one another why because harry when the balance is destroyed the only thing the queens can do is to blow everything to flinders and let it settle out into a natural distribution again what does that mean to me i asked depends on who has the edge when everything is settled bob said a war could start the next ice age or set off an era of rampant growth that last one doesnt sound so bad no not if youre an ebola virus youll have lots of friends oh bad then yeah bob said keep in mind that this is theory though ive never seen it happen i havent existed that long but its something the queens will want to avoid if they can which explains mabs interest in this if she didnt do it even if she did bob corrected me did she ever actually tell you she was innocent i mulled it over for a moment no i said finally she twisted things around a lot so its possible that she did do it or had it done at any rate right i said so to find out if it was one of the queens wed need to find her hitter how tough would it be to kill one of these knights a flight of stairs wouldnt do it a couple of flights of stairs wouldnt do it maybe if he went on an elevator ride with you very funny i frowned drumming my pen on the table so it would have taken that little something extra to take out reuel who could manage it regular folks could do it but they wouldnt be able to do it without burning buildings and smoking craters and so on to kill him so that it looked like an accident maybe another knight could among the sidhe it was either the winter knight or one of the queens could a wizard do it that goes without saying but youd have to be a pretty brawny wizard have plenty of preparation and a good channel to him even then smoking craters would be easier than an accident the wizards have all been in duckandcover mode lately and there are too many of them to make a practical suspect pool lets assume that it was probably internal faerie stuff that cuts it down to three suspects three the three people who could have managed it summer queen winter queen winter knight one two three harry i said it could have been one of the queens i blinked up at the skull there are more than two yeah technically there are three three in each court three queens in each court six thats just silly not if you think about it each court has three queens the queen who was the queen who is and the queen who is to come great which one does the knight work for all of them its kind of a group thing he has different duties to each queen i felt the headache start at the base of my neck and creep toward the crown of my head okay bob i need to know about these queens which ones the ones who are who were or who are to come i stared at the skull for a second while the headache settled comfortably in theres got to be a simpler parlance than that thats so typical you wont steal a baby but youre too lazy to conjugate hey i said my sex life has nothing to do with conjugate harry conjuoh why do i even bother the queen is just the queen queen titania queen mab the queen who was is called the mother the queen who is to come is known as the lady right now the winter lady is maeve the summer lady is aurora lady queen mother gotcha i got a pencil and wrote it down just to help me keep it straight including the names so six people who might have managed it plus the winter knight bob said in theory right i said seven i wrote down the titles and then tapped the notebook thoughtfully and said eight eight bob asked i took a deep breath and said elaines alive shes on the investigation for summer wow bob said wow and i told you so i know i know you think she might have gacked reuel no i said but i never saw it coming when she and justin came after me either i only need to think about if she had the means to do it i mean if you think it would have been tough for me maybe she wasnt capable of taking down reuel i was always a lot stronger than her yeah bob said but she was better than you she had a lot going for her that you didnt grace style elegance breasts i rolled my eyes so shes on the list until i find some reason she shouldnt be how jaded and logical of you harry im almost proud i turned to the folder mab had given me and went through the newspaper clippings inside any idea who the winter knight is nope sorry bob said my contacts on the winter side are kinda sketchy okay then i sighed and picked up the notebook i know what i need to do this should be good bob said dryly bite me i have to find out more about reuel who was close to him maybe someone saw something if the police assumed an accident i doubt there was an investigation bob nodded somehow managing to look thoughtful so are you going to take out an ad in the paper or what i went around the lab and started snuffing candles i thought id try a little breaking and entering then ill go to his funeral see who shows gosh can i do fun things like you when i grow up i snorted and turned to the stepladder taking my last lit candle with me harry bob said just before i left i stopped and looked back at him for what its worth be careful if i hadnt known any better id have said bob the skull was almost shaking youre an idiot about women and you have no idea what mab is capable of i looked at him for a moment his orange eyes the only light in the dimness of my frenetically neat lab it sent a little shiver through me then i clomped back up the stepladder and went out to borrow trouble chapter eleven i made a couple of phone calls slapped a few things into a nylon backpack and sallied forth to break into ronald reuels apartment reuel had lived at the south edge of the loop in a building that looked like it had once been a theater the lobby yawned up to a high ceiling and was spacious and pretty enough but it left me looking for the velvet ropes and listening for the disorganized squawking of an orchestra warming up its instruments i walked in wearing a hat with an ftd logo and carrying a long white flower box under one arm i nodded to an aging security guard at a desk and went on past him to the stairs my steps purposeful youd be surprised how far a hat a box and a confident stride can get you i took the stairs up to reuels apartment on the third floor i went up them slowly my wizards senses open on the lookout for any energies that might yet be lingering around the site of the old mans death i paused for a moment over the spot where reuels body had been found to be sure but there was nothing if a lot of magic had been put to use in reuels murder someone had covered its tracks impressively i went the rest of the way up to the third floor but it wasnt until i opened the door to the thirdfloor hallway that my instincts warned me i was not alone i froze with the door from the stairway only half open and listened listening isnt particularly hard im not even sure its all that magical i cant explain it well other than to say that im able to block out everything but what i hear and to pick up things i would normally miss its a skill that not many people have these days and one that has been useful to me more than once this time i was able to listen to a halfwhispered basso curse and the rustle of papers from somewhere down the hall i opened the flower box and drew out my blasting rod then checked my shield bracelet all in all in close quarters like this i would have preferred a gun to my blasting rod but id have a hell of a time explaining it to security or the police if they caught me snooping around a dead mans apartment i tightened my grip on the rod and slid quietly down the hall hoping i wouldnt need to use it believe it or not my first instinct isnt always to set things on fire the door to reuels apartment stood half open and its pale wood glared where it had been freshly splintered my heart sped up it looked like someone had beaten me to reuels place it meant that i must have been on the right track it also meant that whoever it was would probably not be thrilled to see me i crept to the door and peered inside what i could see of the apartment could have been imported from b baker street dark woods fancy scrollwork and patterns of cloth busier than the makeup girl at a kiss concert filled every available inch of space with victorian splendor or rather it once had now the place looked wrecked a sideboard stood denuded of its drawers which lay upturned on the floor an old steamer chest lay on its side its lid torn off its contents scattered onto the carpet an open door showed me that the bedroom hadnt been spared the rough stuff either clothes and broken bits of finery lay strewn about everywhere the man inside reuels apartment looked like a catalog model for thugsrus he stood a hand taller than me and i couldnt tell where his shoulders left off and his neck began he wore old frayed breeches a sweater with worn elbows and a hat that looked like an import from the depressionera bowery a round bowler decorated with a dark grey band he carried a worn leather satchel in one meatslab hand and with the other he scooped up pieces of paper maybe index cards from a shoe box on an old writing desk depositing them in the bag the satchel bulged but he kept adding more to it with rapid sharp motions he muttered something else emitted a low rumble and snatched up a rolodex from the desk cramming it into the satchel i drew back from the door and put my back against the wall there wasnt any time to waste but i had to figure out what to do if someone had shown up at reuels place to start swiping papers it meant that reuel had been hiding evidence of one kind or another therefore i needed to see whatever it was kong had in that satchel somehow i doubted he would show me if i asked him pretty please but i didnt like my other option either in such tight quarters and with other residents nearby i didnt dare resort to any of my kaboom magic kaboom magic or evocation is difficult to master and im not very good at it even with my blasting rod as a focus i had accidentally dealt out structural damage to a number of buildings so far id been lucky enough not to kill myself i didnt want to push it if i didnt have to of course i could always just jump the thug and try to take his bag away i had a feeling id be introduced to whole new realms of physical discomfort but i could try it i took another peek at the thug with one hand he casually lifted a sofa that had to weigh a couple of hundred pounds and peered under it i drew back from the door again fisticuffs bad idea definitely a bad idea i chewed on my lip a moment more then i slipped the blasting rod back into the flower box squared up my ftd hat stepped around the corner and knocked on the halfopen door the thugs head snapped around toward me along with most of his shoulders he bared his teeth anger in his eyes ftd i said trying to keep my voice bland i got a delivery here for a mr reuel you want to sign for it the thug glowered at me from beneath the shelter of his overhanging brow flowers he rumbled a minute later yeah buddy i said flowers i came into the apartment and thrust the clipboard at him idly wishing i had some gum to chomp sign there at the bottom he glowered at me for a moment longer before accepting the clipboard reuel aint here like i care i pushed a pen at him with the other hand just sign it and ill get going this time he glared at the pen then at me then he set the satchel on the coffee table whatever great i stepped past him and put the flower box down on the table he clutched the pen in his fist and scrawled on the bottom of the paper i reached down with one hand as he did plucked a piece of paper a little bigger than a playing card from the satchel and palmed it i got my hand back to my side just before he finished growled and shoved the clipboard at me now he said leave you bet i told him thanks i turned to go but his hand shot out and his fingers clamped on to my arm like a steel band i looked back he narrowed his eyes nostrils flared and then growled i dont smell flowers the bottom fell out of my stomach but i tried to keep the bluff going what are you talking about mr uh i glanced down at the clipboardgrum mr grum he leaned down closer to me and his nostrils flared again this time with a low snuffling sound i smell magic smell wizard my smile must have turned green to go with my face uh grum took my throat in one hand and lifted me straight up off the ground with a strength no human could duplicate my vision reduced itself to a hazy tunnel and the clipboard fell from my fingers i struggled against him uselessly his eyes narrowed and he bared more teeth in a slow smile should have minded your own business whoever you are his fingers started tightening and i thought i heard something crackle and pop i had to hope it was his knuckles instead of my trachea whoever you were it was too late by far to use my shield bracelet and my blasting rod lay out of reach on the coffee table i fumbled in my pocket as my vision started to go black for the only weapon i had left i had to pray that i was right in my guess i found the old iron nail gripped it as best i could and shoved it hard at grums beefy forearm the nail bit into his flesh he screamed a throaty basso bellow that shook the walls he flinched and spun hurling me away from him i hit the door to reuels bedroom slamming it all the way open and got lucky i landed on the bed rather than on one of the wooden pillars at its corners if id hit one of those id have broken my back instead i hit the bed bounced fetched up hard against the wall then tumbled back to the bed again i glanced up to see that grum looked very different than he had a moment before rather than the film noir toughguy getup he wore a loincloth of some kind of pale leatherand nothing more his skin was a dark russet layered with muscle and curling dark hair his ears stood out from the sides of his head like satellite dishes and his features had flattened becoming more bestial nearly like those of a gorilla he was also better than twelve feet tall he had to hunch over to stand and even so his shoulders pressed against the tenfoot ceiling with another roar grum tore the nail from his arm and flung it to one side it went completely through the wall leaving a hole the size of my thumb then he spun back to me baring teeth now huge and jagged and took a stalking step toward me the floor creaking beneath his feet ogre i wheezed crap i extended my hand toward the blasting rod and focused my will ventas servitas a sharp and sudden torrent of air caught up the flower box and hurled it straight toward me it hit me in the chest hard enough to hurt but i snatched it brought out my blasting rod and trained it on grum as he closed on me i slammed more will through the rod its tip bursting into scarlet incandescence fuego i barked as i released the energy fire in a column the size of my clenched fist flashed out at grum and splashed against his chest it didnt slow him down not by a second his skin didnt burnhis hair didnt even singe the fire of my magic spilled over him and did absolutely nothing grum shouldered his way through the bedroom door cracking the frame as he did and raised his fist he slammed it down at the bed but i didnt wait around to meet it i flopped over to the far side of the bed and tumbled down to the space between the bed and the wall he reached for me but i rolled underneath the bed bumped against his feet and scrambled toward the door i almost made it but something heavy and hard slammed against my legs taking them out from under me and knocking me down i only had time to realize dimly that grum had picked up an antique victorian chair that resembled more than anything else a throne and hurled it at me the pain kicked in a second later but i crawled toward the door the ogres feet pounded in rapid succession and the floor shook as he grew closer and closer to me from the hall a querulous female voice demanded whats all that racket i have already called the police i have you fruits get out of our hall or theyll lock you away grum stopped i saw frustration and rage flicker over his apelike features then he snarled stepped over me and picked up the satchel when he headed for the door i rolled out of his way he was big enough to simply crush my chest if he stepped on me and i didnt want to make it easy for him you got lucky the ogre growled but this is not over then his form blurred and shifted growing smaller until he wore the same appearance he had a few moments before he settled his bowler with one hand then stalked out the door aiming a kick at me in passing i cringed away from it and he was gone well demanded that same voice whats it going to be you fruit get out police sirens wailed somewhere outside i got up wobbled for a moment and put my hand against the wall to help myself stay up i turned the other hand over to look at the piece of paper id stolen from grums satchel it wasnt paper it was a photograph nothing fancyjust an instantcamera shot it showed old whitehaired reuel standing in front of the magic castle at one of the disney parks several young people stood beside him and around him smiling sunburned and apparently happy one was a tall bullnecked young woman in faded jeans with her hair dyed a shade of muddy green she had a wide smile and a blunt ugly face standing beside her was a girl who should have been in a lingerie catalog all curves and long limbs in her brief shorts and bikini top her hair also green but the color of summer grass rather than that of pond scum on the other side of reuel was a pair of young men one of them a short stocky fellow with a goatee and sunglasses had his fingers lifted into a v behind the head of his companion a small slender man with his skin sunburned to the color of copper and his blond hair bleached out to nearly white who were they why had reuel been with them and why had grum seemed so intent on removing their picture from reuels apartment the sirens grew closer and if i didnt want to get locked up by some wellmeaning member of chicagos finest i needed to leave i rubbed at my aching throat winced at the wrenching cramping pain in my back wondered about the photograph and stumbled out of the building chapter twelve i got out of the old apartment building and back to the blue beetle without being mugged by any attackers inhuman or otherwise as i pulled out a patrol car rolled up blue bubbles flashing i drove away at a sedate pace and tried to keep my shaking hands from making the car bob or swerve no one pulled me over so i must have done all right score one for the good guys i had time to think though i wasnt sure i wanted to id gone to reuels apartment on a simple snoop not really expecting to find much if anything but id gotten lucky not only had i shown up at the right place id done it at the right time someone obviously wanted to hide something thereeither more pictures like the one id found or other papers from somewhere in the place what i needed to determine now was what grum had been trying to collect ornearly as goodwhy he was trying to make some kind of evidence vanish failing that knowing who he was working for would do almost as wellogres arent exactly known for their independent initiative and given what was going on it would be ludicrous to assume that one of the heavyweight thugs of the lands of faerie just happened to be doing an independent contract in the home of the recently deceased ogres were wyldfaethey could work for either winter or summer and they could have a range of personalities and temperaments running the gamut from jovially violent to maliciously violent grum hadnt seemed to be on the cheerful end of that particular scale but he had been both decisive and restrained the average walking mountain of muscle from faerie wouldnt have held back from beating me to a pulp regardless of what the neighbors shouted that meant that grum had more savvy than the average bear that he was dangerouseven if i didnt take into account how easily he had ignored the spells id hurled at him all ogres have an innate capacity for neutralizing magical forces to one degree or another grum had grounded out my spells like id been scuffing my feet on the carpet to give him a little static electricity zap that meant that he was an old faerie and a strong one the quick and thorough shapeshifting supported that assessment as well your average clubswinging thewmonger couldnt have taken human form complete with clothing so ably smart plus strong plus quick equals badass most likely he was a trusted personal guard or a highly placed enforcer but for whom at a stop light i stared at the photograph id taken from grum damn i muttered who are these people i added it to the list of questions still growing like fungus in a locker room ronald reuels funeral had already begun by the time i arrived flannerys funeral home in the river north area had been a familyrun business until a few years before it was an old place but had always been well kept now the carefully landscaped shrubbery had been replaced with big rocks which were no doubt easier to maintain the parking lot had a lot of cracks in it and only about half of the outdoor lights were burning the sign an illuminated glassandplastic number that read quiet acres funeral home glared in garish green and blue above the front door i parked the beetle tucked the photo into my pocket and got out of the car i couldnt casually take my staff or my blasting rod into the funeral home people who dont believe in magic look at you oddly when you walk in toting a big stick covered with carvings of runes and sigils the people who know what i am would react in much the same way as if i had walked in draped in belts of ammo and carrying a heavycaliber machine gun in each hand john waynestyle there could be plenty of each sort inside so i carried only the lowprofile stuff my ring mostly depleted my shield bracelet and my mothers silver pentacle amulet my reflection in the glass door reminded me that i had underdressed for the evening but i wasnt there to make the social column i slipped into the building and headed for the room where theyd laid out ronald reuel the old man had been dressed up in a grey silk suit with a metallic sheen to it it was a younger mans suit and it looked too big for him he would have looked more comfortable in tweed the mortician had done only a soso job of fixing reuel up his cheeks were too red and his lips too blue you could see the dimples on his lips where thin lines of thread had been stitched through them to hold his mouth closed no one would have mistaken this for an old man in the midst of his napit was a corpse plain and simple the room was about half full people standing in little knots talking and passing back and forth in front of the casket no one was standing in the shadows smoking a cigarette or looking about with a shiftyeyed gaze i couldnt see anyone quickly hiding a bloody knife behind his back or twirling a moustache either that ruled out the dudley doright approach to finding the killer maybe he she or they werent here of course i supposed it would be possible for faeries to throw a veil or a glamour over themselves before they came in but even experienced faeries have trouble passing for mortal mab had looked good sure but she hadnt really looked normal grum had been much the same i mean hed looked human sure but also like an extra on the set of the untouchables faeries can do a lot of things really well but blending in with a crowd generally isnt one of them in any case the crowd struck me as mostly relatives and business associates no one matched the pictures no one seemed to be a faerie in a bad mortal costume and either my instincts had the night off or no one was using any kind of veil or glamour bad guys one harry zero i slipped out of the viewing room and back into the hallway in time to hear a low whisper somewhere down the hall that grabbed my attention i made the effort to move quietly and crept a bit closer listening as i went i dont know hissed a male voice i looked for her all day shes never been gone this long just my point growled a female voice she doesnt stay gone this long you know how she gets by herself god said a third voice the light tenor of a young man he did it he really did it this time we dont know that the first man said maybe she finally used her head and got out of town the womans voice sounded tired no ace she wouldnt just leave not on her own we have to do something what can we do the second male said something the woman said anything wow thats specific the first male apparently ace said with his voice dry and edgy whatever youre going to do youd better do it fast the wizard is here i felt the muscles in my neck grow tense there was a short perhaps shocked silence in the room down the hall here the second male echoed in a panicky tone now why didnt you tell us i just did dimwit ace said what do we do the second male asked what do we do what do we do shut up snapped the female voice shut up fix hes in mabs pocket said ace you know he is she crossed over from faerie today no way said the second voice presumably fix hes supposed to be a decent sort right depends on who you hear it from said ace people who get in his way have had a habit of getting real dead god said fix panting oh god oh god look said the woman if hes here we shouldnt be not until we know what it means furniture maybe a wooden chair creaked come on i slipped back down the hall and around the corner into the lobby as i heard footsteps leaving the small side room they didnt come toward me instead they moved further down the hall away from the lobby they had to be heading for a back door i chewed on my lip and weighed my options three very apprehensive folks maybe human maybe not heading down a darkened hall toward a back door that doubtless led into an equally dark alley it sounded like a recipe for more trouble but i didnt think i had any options i counted to five and then followed the footsteps i saw only a retreating shadow at the far end of the hall i looked into the room the three had been in as i went past it and found a small lounge with several upholstered chairs i hesitated for a moment at the corner and heard the soft click of a metal door opening then closing again as i rounded the corner i saw a door with a faded sticker spelling exit i went to the door and opened it as quietly as i could then poked my head out into the alley it opened into and rubbernecked around they were standing not five feet awaythree of the young people from reuels photo the small skinny man with the blondwhite hair and dark tan was facing me he was dressed in what looked like a secondhand brown suit and a yellow polyester clipon tie his eyes widened almost comically and his mouth dropped open in shock he squeaked and it was enough to let me identify him as fix beside him was the other young man ace he was the one with the dark curly hair and goatee wearing a grey sport coat with a white shirt and dark slacks he still had his sunglasses on when he turned to look at me and he clawed at the pocket of his jacket upon seeing me the third was the brawny homely young woman with the muddy green hair and heavy brow she had on a pair of jeans tight enough to show the muscles in her thighs and a khaki blouse she didnt hesitate she didnt even look she just turned her arm sweeping out as she did and fetched me a blow to my cheek with the back of one shovelsize hand i managed to move with it a bit at the last second but even so the impact threw me out of the doorway and into the alley stars and cartoon birdies danced in my vision and i rolled trying to get clear before she could hit me again ace pulled a smallcaliber semiautomatic from his jacket pocket but the woman growled at him dont be stupid theyd kill us all hebbity bedda i said by way of attempting a greeting my mouth had gone rather numb and my tongue felt like a lead weight jussa hangonna sayke hee fix jumped up and down pointing at me his voice shrill hes casting on us the woman kicked me in the ribs hard enough to knock the wind out of me then she picked me up by the back of my pants grunting with the effort and threw me into the air i came down ten feet away in an open dumpster and crunched down amid cardboard boxes and stinking refuse go the woman barked go go go i lay in the garbage for a minute trying to catch my breath the sound of three sets of running feet receded down the alley i had just sat up when a head popped into view over me vague in the shadows i flinched and threw up my left arm willing power through the shield bracelet i accidentally made the shield too big and sparks kicked up where the shield intersected the metal of the dumpster but by their light i saw whose head it was harry billy the werewolf asked what are you doing in there i let the shield drop and extended a hand to him looking for suspects he frowned and hauled me out of the trash i wobbled for a second or two until my head stopped spinning quite so quickly billy steadied me with one hand you find any id say so yeah billy nodded and peered up at me did you decide that before or after they hit you in the face and threw you in the garbage i brushed coffee grounds off my jeans do i tell you how to do your job actually yeah all the time okay okay i muttered did you bring the pizza yeah billy said got it back in the car why i brushed at my shaggy hair what i hoped were more coffee grounds fell out i started walking down the alley toward the front of the building because i need to make a few bribes i said looking back over my shoulder at billy do you believe in faeries chapter thirteen billy held the pizza while i drew the chalk circle on the ground back in the alley harry he said how is this supposed to work exactly hang on i said i didnt quite complete the circle but took the pizza box from him i opened it took out one piece and put it down in the middle of the circle on a napkin then i dabbed a bit of blood from the corner of my mouth where the girl had slugged me onto the bottom of the piece of pizza stepped back and completed the circle without willing it closed pretty simple i said ill call the faerie in close to the pizza there hell smell it jump on it eat it when he does hell get the bit of my blood and it will be enough energy to close the circle around him uhhuh billy said his expression skeptical he took out a second piece and started to take a bite and then you beat the information out of him i took the piece out of his hand put it back in the box and closed it and then i bribe the information out of him save the pizza billy scowled at me but he left the pizza alone so what do i do sit tight and make sure no one else tries to pop me while im talking to toottoot toottoot billy asked lifting an eyebrow hells bells billy i didnt pick the name just be quiet if he thinks there are mortals around hell get nervous and leave before i can snare him if you say so billy said i was just hoping to do more good than to deliver pizza i raked my fingers through my hair i dont know what you could do yet i could track those three in the picture you showed me i shook my head odds are they just got into a car and left yeah he said some forced patience in his voice but if i get their scent now it might help me find them later on oh i said feeling a bit stupid okay so i hadnt considered the whole shapeshifting angle fine if you want to just be careful all right i dont know what all might be prowling around okay mom billy said he set the pizza box on top of a closed trash can fell back down the alley and vanished i waited until billy had gone to find a nice patch of shadows to step into then i closed my eyes for a moment drawing up my concentration and began to whisper the faeries name every intelligent being has a name a specific series of spoken sounds linked to its very being if a practitioner knows the name of something knows it in every nuance and detail of pronunciation then he can use that name to open a magical conduit to that being thats how demons get summoned to the mortal world call somethings name and you make contact with itand if youre a wizard that means that you can then exercise power over it no matter where in the world it is controlling an inhuman being via its name is a shady area of magic only one step removed from taking over the will of another mortal according to the white councils seven laws of magic thats a capital crimeand they make zerotolerance policies look positively lenient given how much the council loves me im a tad paranoid about breaking any of the laws of magic so while i was calling the faeries name i put only the tiniest trickle of compulsion into it just enough to attract his unconscious attention to make him curious about what might be down this particular alley i whispered the faeries name and stood in the shadows waiting maybe ten minutes later something made from a hummingbird and a falling star spiraled down from overhead a flickering ball of bluewhite light it alighted on the ground the light dimming to a luminous sheen over the form of a tiny faerie toottoot toot stood about six inches tall he had a mane of dandelionfluff hair the color of lilacs and a pair of translucent dragonfly wings rising from his shoulders otherwise he looked almost human his beauty a distant echo of the lords of faerie the sidhe on his head he wore what looked like a plastic coke bottle cap it was tied into place with a piece of string that ran under his chin and his lilac hair squeezed out from beneath it all the way around all but hiding his eyes in one hand he carried a spear fashioned from a battered old yellow number pencil some twine and what must have been a straight pin and he wore a little blue plastic cocktail sword through another piece of twine on his belt toot landed in a cautious crouch near the pizza as though streaking in like an errant shot from a roman candle might not have alerted anyone watching to his presence he tiptoed in a big circle around the piece of pizza and made a show of looking all around one hand lifted to shade his eyes then he raised his arm into the air balled up a tiny fist and pumped it up and down a few times immediately half a dozen similar streaks of glowing color darted down out of the air each one a different color each one containing a tiny faerie at its center they alighted more or less together and every one of them was armed with a weapon that might have been cobbled together from the contents of a childs school box caption toottoot piped in a shrill voice report a greenlit faerie beside toot snapped to attention and slapped herself on the forehead with one hand then turned sharply to her left and barked loo tender report a purplehued faerie came to attention as well and smacked himself in the head with one hand then turned to the next faerie beside him and snapped star jump report and so it went down the line through the corpse oral the first class privy and finally to the second class privy who marched up to toottoot and said everyones here generous and were hungry all right toottoot barked everyone fall apart for messy and with that the faeries let out shrill hoots of glee tossed aside their weapons and armaments and threw themselves upon the piece of pizza as soon as the little faeries started eating the magic circle snapped closed around them with a hardly audible pop as it sprang into place the effect was immediate the faeries let out half a dozen piercing shrieks of alarm and buzzed into the air smacking into the invisible wall of the circle here and there sending out puffs of glowing dust motes when they did they fell into a panicked spiral around the inside of the circle until toottoot landed on the ground looked up at the other faeries and started shouting ten huts ten huts the other faeries abruptly came to a complete stop in the air standing rigidly straight evidently they couldnt do that and keep their little wings going at the same time because they promptly fell to the alley floor landing with a halfdozen separate ouches and as many puffs of glowing faerie dust toottoot recovered his pencil spear and stood at the very edge of the closed circle peering out at the alley harry dresden is that you i stepped out from my hiding spot and nodded its me how you doing toot i expected a torrent of outraged but empty threats that was toottoots usual procedure instead he let out a hiss and crouched down in the circle spear at the ready the other tiny faeries took up their own weapons and rushed to toottoots side you cant make us toot said we havent been called and until we are we belong to ourselves i blinked down at them called toot what are you talking about were not stupid emissary toottoot said i know what you are i can smell the cold queen all over you i wondered if they made a deodorant for that i lifted my hand in a placating gesture toot im working for mab right now but its just another client okay im not here to take you anywhere or make you do anything toot planted the eraser end of his spear on the ground scowling suspiciously up at me really he demanded really i said promise promise super duper double dog promise spit swear i nodded super duper double dog promise spit swear i repeated gravely spit toot demanded i spat on the ground oh well then toot said he dropped his spear and darted over to the pizza much to the consternation of the other little faeries who let out piping shrills of protest and then followed him the piece of pizza didnt last long it was like watching one of those nature shows where the piranha devour some luckless thing that falls in the waterexcept here there were glittering wings and motes and puffs of glowing colorful dust everywhere i watched frowning until toottoot flopped onto his back his tummy slightly distended he let out a contented sigh and the other faeries followed suit so harry toot said who do you think is going to win the war the white council i said the red courts got no depth on the bench and nothing in the bullpen toot snorted and flipped his plastic bottlecap helm off his head his hair waved around in the breeze just because they dont have any cows doesnt mean that they wont win but i dont mean that war i frowned you mean between the courts toot nodded yeah okay whats with the armor and weapons toot the faerie beamed neat huh highly scary i said gravely but why do you have them toot folded his arms and said with all the gravity that six inches of fluff and pixie dust can muster troubles coming uhhuh i hear the courts are upset more than just upset harry dresden the drawing of the wyldfae is beginning i saw some dryads walking with a sidhe knight from summer and a canal nereid climbed up out of the water a couple of blocks over and went into a winter building drawing of the wyldfae like you guys toot nodded and propped his feet up on the legs of the star jump who let out a surprisingly basso belch not everyone plays with the courts we mostly just do our jobs and dont pay much attention but when theres a war on the wyldfae get called to one side or another who picks which way you go toot shrugged mostly the nice wyldfae go to the warm queen and the mean ones go to cold i think its got something to do with what youve been doing uhhuh so have you been doing warm or cold things toot let out a sparkling laugh how should i remember all those things he patted his stomach and then rose to his feet again eyes calculating is that a pizza box you have there harry i held the box out and opened it showing the rest of the pizza there was a collective ooooo from the faeries and they all pressed to the very edge of the circle until it flattened their little noses staring at the pizza in fascinated lust youve sure given us a lot of pizza the past couple of years harry toot said with a swallow he didnt look away from the box in my hands hey you gave me a hand when i needed it i said its only fair right only fair toot spat outraged its its its pizza harry im wanting some more work done i said i need information and youre paying in pizza toot asked his tone hopeful yes i said wahhoo toot shouted and buzzed into the air in an excited spiral the other faeries followed him with similar carols of happiness and the blur of colors was dizzying give us the pizza toot shouted pizza pizza pizza the other faeries shrilled first i said i want some questions answered right right right toot screamed ask already i need to talk to the winter lady i said where can i find her toot toot tore at his lavender hair is that all you need to know down in the city down where the shops are underground and the sidewalks i frowned in the commuter tunnels yes yes yes back in the part the mortals cant see you can find your way into undertown the cold lady came to undertown her court is in undertown what i sputtered since when toot whirled around in impatient loops in the air since the last autumn i scratched at my hair it made sense i supposed last autumn a vengeful vampire and her allies had stirred up all sorts of supernatural mischief creating turbulence in the border between the real world and the nevernever the world of spirit shortly after the war between the wizards and the vampires had begun those events had probably attracted the attention of all sorts of things i shook my head and what about the summer lady is she in town toot put his fists on his hips well obviously harry if winter came here summer had to come too didnt it obviously i said feeling a little slow on the uptake man was i off my game where can i find her shes on top of one of those big buildings i sighed toot this is chicago there are a lot of big buildings toot blinked at me then frowned for a minute before brightening its the one with the pizza shop right by it my head hurt some more tell you what how about you guide me to it toot thrust out his little chin and scowled and miss pizza no way i gritted my teeth then get me someone else to guide me youve got to know someone toot scrunched up his face he tugged at one earlobe but it evidently didnt help him remember because he had to rub one foot against the opposite calf and spin around in vacant circles for ten whole seconds before he whirled back to face me the nimbus of light around him brightening aha he sang yes i can give you a guide he jabbed a finger at me but only if thats all the questions harry pizza pizza pizza guide first i insisted then pizza toot shook his arms and legs as though he would fly apart yes yes yes done i said i opened the pizza box and set it on top of a discarded crate nearby then i stepped over to the circle leaned down and with a smudge of my hand and an effort of will broke it freeing the energies inside the faeries chorused several pitches and variants of yahoo and streaked past me so quickly that they left a cone of wild air behind them tossing my unruly hair and scattering lighter pieces of garbage around the alley they tore into the pizza with much the same gusto theyd used on the one piece earlier but there was enough of it now to keep them from mangling it in mere seconds toot zipped over to hover in front of my face and held out his little palm a moment later something that looked like an errant spark from a campfire whirled down and lighted on his palm toot said something in a language i couldnt understand and the tiny light pulsed and flickered as though in response right toot said nodding to the light i peered more closely at it and could just barely make out a tiny tiny form inside no larger than an ant another faerie the light pulsed and flickered and toot nodded to it before turning to me harry dresden toottoot said holding out his palm this is elidee shes going to pay me back a favor and guide you to the winter lady and then to the summer lady good enough i frowned at the tiny faerie does she understand me i barely saw elidee stamp a tiny foot the scarlet light around her flickered sharply twice yes toottoot translated two lights for yes and one light for no two for yes one for no i muttered toot frowned or is that one for yes and two for no i can never keep it straight and with that the little faerie blurred and zipped past me and away to join the swarm of softly flashing lights demolishing the pizza elidee for her part recovered from the miniature cyclone that toottoot left in his wake whirled around dizzily for a few moments then spiraled down to me and settled on the bridge of my nose my eyes crossed trying to look at her hey i said do i look like a couch to you two flashes i sighed okay elidee do you want any pizza before we go two flashes again brighter the tiny faerie leapt up into the air again and zoomed over to the cloud around the pizza footsteps came down the alley then billy stepped out of the shadows pulling his sweatshirt down over his muscular stomach i felt a brief and irrational surge of jealousy i dont have a muscular stomach im not overlapping my belt or anything but i dont have abs of steel i dont even have abs of bronze maybe abs of plastic billy blinked at the pizza for a moment and said wow thats sort of pretty in a jaws kind of way yeah i said dont look at it for too long faerie lights can be disorienting to mortals gotcha billy said he glanced back at me howd it go you get what you needed yeah i said you he shrugged alley isnt the best place to pick up scents but i should be able to recognize them again if im in my other suit they didnt smell quite normal gee what are the odds billys teeth showed in the dark heh so what are we waiting for elidee picked just then to glide back over to me and settle once more on the bridge of my nose billy blinked at her and said what the hell this is our guide i said elidee this is billy elidee flashed twice billy blinked again uh charmed he shook his head so whats the plan we go confront the winter lady in her underground lair i do the talking you stay alert and watch my back he nodded okay you got it i looked over to see the last piece of pizza lifted up into the air by greedy faerie hands they clustered around it tearing and ripping and it was gone in seconds with that the faeries swarmed away like a squadron of potbellied comets and vanished from view elidee fluttered off my nose and started drifting down the alley in the other direction i followed her harry billy asked his voice a touch hopeful are you expecting trouble i sighed and rubbed at the space between my eyebrows definitely getting a headache it was going to be a long night chapter fourteen elidee led billy and me through alleys up a fire escape to the roof of a building and then down on the other side and through a junkcluttered abandoned lot on the way to the pedway it took us better than half an hour of scrambling after the tiny faerie through the muggy heat and by the end of it i wished id told toottoot that we wanted someone who could read a street map and guide us there in a car chicagos commuter tunnels are fairly recent construction compared to much of the rest of the city the tunnels are a maze if you dont know themlong stretches of identical overhead lights drab clean walls dotted with advertising posters and intersections bearing plain and not always helpful directional signs the tunnels closed after the workday and wouldnt open up again until around six the next morning but elidee led us to an unfinished building at randolph and wabash she flitted around in front of a service access door that proved to be unlocked and that led down to a similar door that opened onto a darkened section of the pedway that looked as though it had been under construction but was abandoned when the building had shut down it was completely dark so i slipped the silver pentacle off my neck lifting it in my hand and focusing a quiet effort of will upon it the fivepointed star has been a symbol of magic for centuries representing the four elements and the power of spirit bound within the circle of willprimal power under the control of human thought i held the pentacle before me and as i concentrated it began to glow with a gentle blue light illuminating enough of our surroundings that we could navigate through the dark silent tunnels the little faerie drifted in front of us down the tunnel and we followed her without speaking she took us to the intersection with the main tunnels of the pedway and on a brief walk down another tunnel to a section shut behind a rusting metal gate with a sign that read danger keep out the gate proved to be unlocked and we went down the tunnel into a damper section of tunnels rife with the smell of mold that was clearly not a part of the pedway proper after another fifty or sixty feet we reached a place where the walls became rough and uneven and shadows lay thick and heavy despite the glow of my wizards light elidee drifted over to an especially dark section of wall and flew in a little circle in front of it okay i said i guess this is where we get in what is where we get in billy asked his voice skeptical get into where undertown i said i ran my hands over the wall to the casual touch it appeared to be bare unfinished concrete but i felt a slight unsteadiness when i pressed against it it couldnt have been solid stone must be a panel here somewhere trigger of some kind what do you mean undertown ive never heard of it before i was probably working here for five or six years before i did i said you have to understand the history of chicago how they did things here billy folded his arms im listening the city is a swamp i said still searching for a means of opening the door with my fingertips were darn near level with lake michigan when they first built the place the town kept sinking into the muck i mean every year it sank lower they used to build streets then build a latticework of wood over them and then another street on top of that planning on them slowly sinking they planned houses the same way built the front door on the second floor and called it a chicago entry so when the house sank the front door would be at ground level what about when the street sank built another one on top of it so you wound up with a whole city existing under the street level they used to have a huge problem with rats and criminals holing up under the streets but not anymore billy asked the rats and thugs mostly got crowded out by other things became a whole miniature civilization down here and it was out of sight of the sun which made it friendly space for all the nightcrawling critters around hence undertown billy said i nodded undertown there are a lot of tunnels around chicago the manhattan project was housed in them for a while during world war two did all that atomic bomb research thats cheerful you come down here a lot i shook my head hell no all kinds of nastiness lives down here billy frowned at me like what lots of things stuff you dont often see on the surface things even wizards know almost nothing about goblins spirits of the earth wyrms things that have no name plus the usual riffraff vampires sometimes find lairs down here during the day trolls can hide here too molds and fungi you dont get in most of the natural world you name it billy pursed his lips thoughtfully so youre taking us into a maze of lightless rotting precarious tunnels full of evil faeries and monsters i nodded maybe leftover radiation too god youre a fun guy harry youre the one who wanted in on the action my fingers found a tiny groove in the wall and when i pressed against it a small flat section of stone clicked and retracted the switch had to have triggered some kind of release because the section of wall pivoted in the center turning outward and forming a door that led into still more dank darkness hah i said with some satisfaction there we go billy pressed forward and tried to step through the door but i put a hand on his shoulder and stopped him hang on there are some things you need to know billy frowned but he stopped listening these are faeries well probably run into a lot of the sidhe their nobles hanging out with the winter lady that means that theyre going to be dangerous and will probably try to entrap you what do you mean entrap me billy said bargains i said deals theyll try to offer you things get you to trade one thing for another why i shook my head i dont know its in their nature the concept of debt and obligation is a huge factor in how they behave billy lifted his eyebrows thats why that little guy worked for you right because he owed you for the pizza and he had a debt to you right i said but it can work both ways if you owe them something they have a conduit to you and can use magic against you the basic rule is not to accept any gifts from themand for gods sake dont offer them any gifts they find anything other than an equal exchange to be either enticing or insulting it isnt a big deal with little guys like toot but if you get into it with a sidhe lord you might not live through it billy shrugged okay no gifts dangerous faeries got it im not finished they arent going to be offering you wrapped packages man these are the sidhe theyre some of the most beautiful creatures there are and theyll try to put you off balance and tempt you tempt me like with sex is that what youre saying like any kind of sensual indulgence sex food beauty music perfume when they offer dont accept it or youll be opening yourself up to a world of hurt billy nodded okay got it lets go already i eyed the younger man and he gave me an impatient look i shook my head i dont think i could have adequately conveyed the kind of danger we might be walking into with mere words in any case i took a deep breath and then nodded to elidee all right tinkerbell lets go the tiny scarlet light gave an irritated bob and then darted through the concealed doorway and into the darkness beyond billy narrowed his eyes and followed it and i went after him we found ourselves in a tunnel where one wall seemed to be made of ancient moldering brick and the other of a mixture of rotting wooden beams loose earth and winding roots the tunnel ran on out of the circle of light from my amulet our guide drifted forward and we set out to follow her walking close together the tunnel gave way to a sort of lowroofed cavern supported here and there by pillars mounds of collapsed earth and beams that looked like theyd been added in afterward by the dwellers in undertown elidee circled in place a bit uncertainly then started floating to the right i hadnt been following the little faerie for five seconds before the skin on the back of my neck tried to crawl up over my head and hide in my mouth i drew up short and i must have made some kind of noise because billy shot a look back at me and asked harry what is it i lifted a hand to silence him and peered at the darkness around me keep your eyes open i said i dont think we are alone from the shadows outside the light came a low hissing sound the rest of my skin erupted in gooseflesh and i shook my shield bracelet clear i lifted my voice and said clearly i am the wizard dresden emissary of the winter court bound to pay a call upon the winter lady ive no time or desire for a fight stand clear and let me pass a voicea voice that sounded like a tortured cat might if some demented being gave it the gift of speechmewled out of the shadows grating on my ears we know who you are wizard the voice said its inflections were all wrong and the tone seemed to come from not far above the ground somewhere off to my right elidee let out a highpitched shriek of terror and zipped back to me diving into my hair i felt the warmth of the light around the tiny faerie like a patch of sunlight on my scalp i traded a look with billy and turned toward the source of the voice who are you a servant of the winter lady the voice replied from directly behind me sent here to guide you safely through this realm and to her court i turned in the other direction and peered more closely toward the sound of the voice the werelight from my amulet suddenly gleamed off a pair of animal eyes twenty feet away and a few inches from the floor i looked back at billy hed already noted the eyes and turned to put his back to mine watching the darkness behind us i turned back to the speaker and said i ask again who are you the eyes shifted in place the voice letting out an angry growling sound many names am i called and many paths have i trod hunter i have been and watcher and guide my lady sent me to bring you thither safe and whole and well dont get mad at me charlie i snapped you know the drill as well as i do thrice i ask and done who are you the voice came out harsh and sullen barely intelligible grimalkin am i called by the cold lady who bids me guide her mothers emissary with safe conduct to her court and her throne i let out a breath all right i said so lead us the eyes bobbed in place as though in a small bow and grimalkin mewled again there was a faint motion in the shadows outside my light and then a dull greenish glow appeared upon the ground i stepped toward it and found a faint luminous footprint upon the ground a vague paw feline but too spread out and too thin to be an actual cats just as i reached it another light appeared on the floor several feet away make haste wizard mewled grimalkins voice make haste the lady waits the season passes time is short i moved toward the second footprint and as i reached it a third appeared before us in the dark and so on what was that all about billy murmured asking it the same thing three times i mean its a binding i murmured in reply faeries arent allowed to speak a lie and if a faerie says something three times it has to make sure that it is true its bound to fulfill a promise spoken thrice ah billy said so even if this thing hadnt actually been sent to guide us safely you made him say so three times would mean that hed be obligated to do it got it i shook my head i wanted to make sure grimalkin was on the level but they hate being bound like that from ahead of us the faintly glowing eyes appeared briefly accompanied by another mewling growl that sent a chill down my spine oh billy said he didnt look any too calm himself his face had gone a little pale and he walked with his hands clenched into fists so if grimalkin had good intentions to begin with wouldnt that make him angry that you needlessly bound him i shrugged im not here to make friends billy im here to find a killer youve never even heard of diplomacy have you we followed the trail of footprints on the ground for another twenty minutes or so through damp tunnels sometimes only a few feet high more sections of the tunnel showed evidence of recent constructionif you could call swirling layers of stone that seemed to have been smoothed into place like softserve ice cream construction we passed several tunnels that seemed entirely new whatever beings lived down here they didnt seem too shy about expanding how much further i asked grimalkin let out a mrowling sound from somewhere nearbynot in the direction of the next footprint either very near noble emissary very near now the unseen faerie guide was good to its word at the next glowing footprint no other appeared instead we came to a large elaborately carved double doorway made of some black wood i could not identify the doors were eight or nine feet high and carved in rich basrelief at first i thought the carvings were of a garden themeleaves vines flowers fruit that kind of thing but as i walked closer to the door i could see more detail in the light of my glowing amulet the forms of people lay among the vines some sprawled amorously together while others were nothing more than skeletons wrapped in creeping roses or corpses staring with sightless eyes from within a bed of poppies here and there in the garden one could see evidence of the sidhea pair of eyes a veiled figure and their hangerson little faeries like toottoot leafclad dryads pipewielding satyrs and many many others hiding from the mortals views dancing nice digs billy commented is this the place i glanced around for our guide but i didnt see any more footprints or any feline eyes i guess it must be they arent exactly subtle are they summers better at it than winter but they all can be when it suits them uhhuh you know what bothers me harry what grimalkin never said hed guide us out again i glanced back at billy quiet hissing laughter came out of the darkness directionless i took a deep breath steady harry dont let the kid see you get nervous then i turned to the door and struck it solidly with my fist three times the blows rang out hollow and booming silence fell on the tunnels for a long moment until the doors split down the middle and let out from behind them a flood of light and sound and color i dont know what id expected from the winter court but it wasnt bigband music a large brass section blared from somewhere behind the doors and drums rattled and pounded with the rough genuine sound of actual skins the lights were colored and muted as if the whole place was lit by christmas strands and i could see shadows whirling and moving insidedancers careful i muttered dont let the music get to you i stepped up to the great doors and passed through them the room could have come from a roaring twenties hotel hell it might have been if the hotel had sunk into the earth turned slightly upon its side and been decorated by things with no concept of human values whatever it had once been it had always been meant for dancing the dance floor was made of blocks of rosecolored marble and even though the floor was tilted the blocks had been slipped to the level here and there creating something that looked almost like a flight of low shallow stairs over the treacherous blocks danced the winter sidhe beautiful didnt come close it didnt start to come close men and women danced together dressed in regalia of the s stockings kneelength skirts dress uniforms of both the army and the navy that looked authentic to the month and year the hairstyles in evidence corresponded as well though the color didnt always match the setting one sidhe girl i saw wore hers dyed sapphireblue and others wore braids of silver and gold or of other colors here and there light gleamed from metal or gems set into ears brows or lips and the riot of subtle colors gathered around each and every dancer in its own distinct fascinating nimbus a corona of energy of power manifesting itself as the sidhe danced even without the whirling auras the way they moved was something hypnotic in itself and i had to force my eyes away from it after only a few seconds of lovely legs being displayed as a woman spun body arched back underneath a strong mans hands throats bared and breasts offered out as hair caught the gleam of the colored lights and threw it back in waves of color i couldnt look anywhere on the dance floor without seeing someone who should have been making fun of people on the covers of magazines for being too ugly billy hadnt been as paranoid as me and he stood staring at the dance floor his eyes wide i nudged him with my hip hard enough to make his teeth clack together and he jerked and gave me a guilty look i forced my eyes away from the dancers maybe twenty couples all told to check out the rest of the ballroom to one side of the room stood a bandstand and the musicians on it all wore tuxes they were mortals human they looked normal which was to say almost deformed in comparison to the dancers they performed for both men and women played and none of them looked well rested or well fed their tuxes were stained with sweat their hair hung lank and unwashed and a closer look showed a silver manacle bound around the ankle of each of them attached to a chain that ran through the bandstand winding back and forth among them they didnt look upset thoughfar from it every one of them was bent to the music faces locked in intensity and concentration and they were good playing with the unity of tone and timing that you only see from bands who have really honed their art that didnt change the fact that they were prisoners of the fae but they evidently had no particular problems with the notion the music rattled the great stone room shaking dust from the ceiling hidden in the darkness overhead while the sidhe danced opposite the bandstand the dance floor descended directly into a pool of wateror what i presumed was water at any rate it looked black and unnaturally still even as i watched the waters stirred moved by something out of sight beneath the surface color rolled and rippled over the dark surface and i got the distinct impression that the pool wasnt water or not just water i fought down another shiver beyond the dance floor on the side of the room opposite me stood raised tiers of platforms each one set with a separate little table one that could sit three or four at the most each one with its own dim greenshaded lamp the tables all stood at different relative heights to one another staggered back and forthuntil the tiers reached a pinnacle a single chair made out of what looked like silver its flaring back carved into a sigil a snowflake the size of a dinner table the great chair stood empty the drummer on the bandstand went into a brief solo and then the instruments cut off altogetherbut for one the other band members sagged into their seats a couple of them simply collapsing onto the floor but the lead trumpet stayed standing belting out a solo while the winter lords danced he was a middleaged man a little overweight and his face flushed scarlet then purple as his trumpet rang out through the solo then all at once the sidhe stopped dancing dozens of beautiful faces turned to watch the soloist eyes glittering in the muted light the man continued to play but i could see that something was wrong the flush of his face deepened even more and veins began to throb in his forehead and throat his eyes widened and began to bulge and he started shaking a moment later the music began to falter the man tore his face away from the trumpet and i could see him gasping for breath he couldnt get it a second later he jerked then stiffened and his eyes rolled up in his head the trumpet slipped from his fingers and he fell first to his knees and then limply over onto his side to the floor of the bandstand he hit with finality his eyes open but not focused he twitched once more and then his throat rattled and he was still a murmur went through the sidhe and i looked back to see them parting stepping aside with deep bows and curtseys for someone emerging from their midst a tall girl walked slowly toward the fallen musician her features were pale radiant perfectand looked like an adolescent copy of mabs that was where the resemblance ended she looked young young enough to make a man feel guilty for thinking the wrong thoughts but old enough to make it difficult not to her hair had been bound into long dreadlocks each of them dyed a different shade ranging from a deep lavender to pale blues and greens to pure white so that it almost seemed that her hair had been formed from glacial ice she wore leather pants of dark dark blue laced and open up the outside seams from calf to hip her boots matched the pants she wore a white tshirt tight enough to show the tips of her breasts straining against the fabric framing the words off with his head she had hacked the shirt off at the top of her rib cage leaving pale flesh exposed along with a glitter of silver flashing at her navel she moved to the downed musician with a liquid grace a thoughtless casual sensuality that made a quiver of arousal slip down my spine she settled down over him throwing a leg over his hips straddling him and idly raked long opalescent fingernails over his chest he didnt move didnt breathe the girl licked her lips her mouth spreading into a lazy smile before she leaned down and kissed the corpses dead lips i saw her shiver with what was unmistakably pleasure there she murmured there you see never let it be said the lady maeve does not fulfill her promises you said youd die to play that well poor creature and now you have a collective sigh went up from the assembled sidhe and then they began applauding enthusiastically maeve looked back over her shoulder at them all with a lifted chin and a lazy smile before she stood up and bowed left and right to the sound of applause the applause died off when maeve stalked away from the corpse and to the rising tiers of dinner seats stepping lithely up them until she reached the great silver throne at the top she dropped into it turned sideways and idly threw her legs over one arm arching her back and stretching with that same lazy smile my lords and ladies let us give our poor musical brutes a little time to recover their strength we have a visitor the sidhe began drifting toward the tables on the tiers stepping into place one by one i stood where i was and said nothing though as they settled down i became increasingly conscious of their attention of the glittering intensity of immortal eyes upon me once they were all settled in i stepped forward and walked across the dance floor until i stood at the foot of the tier i looked up at maeve and inclined my head to her lady winter i presume maeve smiled at me showing a dimple and gave one foot a girlish bounce indeed you know in what capacity i am here lady naturally i nodded nothing like a frontal assault then did you arrange the murder of the summer knight silence fell on the room the regard of the winter sidhe grew more intent more uncomfortable maeves mouth spread into a slow smile which in turn became a quiet rolling laugh she let her head fall back with it and the sidhe joined in with her they sat there laughing at me for a good thirty seconds and i felt my face begin to heat up with irrational embarrassment before maeve waved one hand in a negligent gesture and the laughter obediently died away stars she murmured i adore mortals i clenched my jaw thats swell i said did you arrange the murder of the summer knight if i had do you really think i would tell you youre evading i growled answer the question maeve lifted a fingertip to her lips as though she needed it to hold in more laughter then she smiled and said i cant just give you that kind of information wizard dresden its too powerful what is that supposed to mean she sat up crossing her legs with a squeak of leather and settled back on the throne it means that if you want me to answer that question youre going to have to pay for it what is the answer worth to you i folded my arms i assume you have something in mind thats why you sent someone to give us safe passage here quick she murmured i like that yes i do wizard she extended a hand to me and gestured to an open seat at the table to the right and a little beneath the level of her throne please sit down she said her teeth shone white lets make a deal chapter fifteen you want me to cut another deal with the sidhe i said i didnt bother to hide my disbelief when i burst out laughing at you do you think youll be offended and why should you find the notion amusing i rolled my eyes christ lady thats what got me into this crap to begin with maeves lips slithered into a quiet smile and she left her hand extended toward the seat beside her remember wizard that you came to seek something from me surely it would not harm you to listen to my offer ive heard that before usually right before i get screwed maeve touched the tip of her tongue to her lips one thing at a time mister dresden i snorted suppose i dont want to listen something in her eyes suddenly made her face cold and unpleasant i think it might be wise for you to indulge me i simply go mad when someone ruins a good party mood harry billy muttered these people are giving me the creeps if shes playing games with you maybe we should go i grimaced yeah that would be the smart thing but it wouldnt get me any answers come on i stepped forward and started climbing up to the table maeve had indicated billy followed closely maeve watched me the whole time her eyes sparkling there she said once id been seated not so untamable as he claimed i felt my jaw get a little tighter as billy took a seat beside me a trio of brightly colored lights zipped in bearing a silver tray holding a crystalline ewer of water and two glasses as who said maeve waved a hand airily no matter i glared at her but she didnt seem bothered all right lady i said talk maeve idly stretched out a hand a goblet of some golden liquid appeared in her fingers and rimed over with frost as i watched she took a sip of the drink whatever it was and then said first i will name my price thered better be a blue light special i dont have much to trade all things considered true i cannot ask for a claim over you because queen mab has that already but let me see she tapped a fingernail to her lips again and then said your issue eh i said glibly your issue wizard she said toying with a violet dreadlock your offspring your firstborn and in exchange i will give you the knowledge you seek news flash goldilocks i dont have any children maeve laughed naturally not but the details could be arranged evidently that was a cue the dark pool of maybewater stirred drawing my eye ripples whispered as they lapped at the edges of the pool whats that billy whispered to me the waters parted and a sidhe girl rose out of the pool she was tall slender water sliding down over pale naked supple curves her hair was a deep shade of emerald green and as she kept on coming up out of the water walking up what were apparently submerged stairs i could tell that it wasnt dyed her face was sweetly angelic sort of girlnextdoor pretty her hair clung to her head her throat her shoulders as did beads of water that glistened and threw back the faelights in dozens of colors she extended her arms and immediately half a dozen little lights pixies zipped out of nowhere bearing a swath of emerald silk they draped it over her extended arms but the cloth served to emphasize rather than conceal her nakedness she looked up at the tables with her feline faeeyes and inclined her head to maeve then she focused upon me there was an abrupt pulling sensation something as simple and as difficult to resist as gravity i felt a sudden urge to get up and go down to her to remove the silk cloth and to carry her into the water i wanted to see her hair fan out beneath the surface feel her naked limbs sliding around me i wanted to feel that slender waist beneath my hands twist and writhe with her in the warm weightless darkness of the pool beside me billy gulped is it just me or is it getting a little warm in here shes pushing it on you i said quietly my lips felt a little numb its glamour it isnt real okay billy said without conviction it isnt real he reached for a glass and the ewer of water but i grabbed his hand no no food no drink its dangerous billy cleared his throat and settled back in his seat oh right sorry the girl glided up the tiers of tables glittering pixies in darting attendance around her gathering her hair back with ornate combs fastening gleaming jewels to her ears lacing more about her throat wrist ankle i couldnt help but follow the motion of the lights which took my eyes on a thorough tour of her body the urge to go to her became even stronger as she neared as i smelled her perfume a scent like that of the mist hovering over a still lake beneath a harvest moon the greenhaired woman smiled lips closed then drew up in a deep curtsey to maeve and murmured my lady maeve reached out and took her hand warmly jen she murmured are you acquainted with the infamous harry dresden jen smiled and her teeth gleamed between her lips they were as green as seaweed spinach and freshsteamed broccoli only by reputation she turned to me and extended her hand arching one verdant brow i gave billy a selfconscious glance and rose to take the sidheladys hand i nudged billys foot with mine and he stood up too i bowed politely over jens hand her fingers were cool damp i got the impression that her flawless skin should have been prunewrinkled but it wasnt i had to fight an urge to kiss the back of her hand to taste her cool flesh i managed to keep a neutral tone to my voice and said good evening the sidhelady smiled at me showing her green teeth again and said something of a gentleman i wouldnt have expected it she withdrew her hand and said and tall her eyes roamed over me in idle speculation i like tall men i felt my cheeks flush and grow warmer other parts suffered from similar inflammation maeve asked is she lovely enough to suit you wizard youve no idea how many mortal men have longed for her and how few have known her embrace jen let out a quiet laugh for more than about three minutes at any rate maeve drew jen down until the nearly nude sidhe lady knelt beside the throne maeve toyed with a strand of her curling leafgreen hair with one hand why not agree to my offer wizard spend a night in the company of my maiden is it not a pleasant price my voice came out more quietly than id intended you want me to get a child on her a child you would keep maeves eyes glittered she leaned toward me and said very quietly do not let that concern you i can feel your hunger mortal man the needs in you hot as a fever let go for a time no mortal could sate you as she will i felt my eyes drawn to the sidhe woman trailing down the length of pale flesh left bared between the idle drapes of emerald silk following the length of her legs that hunger rose again in me a raw and unthinking need scent flooded over mea perfume of wind and mist of heated flesh scent evoked more phantom sensations of the silken caress of delicate faehands sweetly hot rake of nails winding strength of limbs tangled with mine maeves eyes brightened perhaps she is not enough for you perhaps you would wish another even myself as i watched jen leaned her cheek against maeves thigh and placed a soft kiss upon the tight leather maeve shifted a slow sensual motion of her hips and back and murmured mmmm or more if your thirst runs deep enough drive a hard bargain wizard all of us would enjoy that the longing an aching force of naked need redoubled the two faeries were lovely more than lovely sensuous willing perfectly unrestrained perfectly passionate i could feel that in them radiating from them if i made the bargain they would make the evening one of nothing but indulgence sensation satiation delight maeve and her handmaiden would do things to me that you only read about in magazines dear penthouse i muttered i never thought something like this would happen to me wizard maeve murmured i see you weighing the consequences in your eyes you think too much it weakens you stop thinking come down into the earth with us some mathematical and uncaring part of my brain way the hell in the back of my head reminded me that i did need that information a simple statement from maeve would tell me if she was the killer or not go ahead it told me it isnt as though its going to be painful for you to pay her price dont you deserve to have something pleasant happen to you for a change make the bargain get the information get wasted on kisses and pleasure and soft skin live a littlebefore that borrowed time youre on runs out i reached out with a shaking hand to the crystal ewer on the table i clenched it it clinked and rattled against the glass as i poured cool sparkling water into it maeves smile grew sharper harry billy said his voice uncertain didnt you just say something bad aboutyou know taking food or drink from fauh from these people i put the pitcher down and picked up the glass of water jen rubbed her cheek against maeves thigh and murmured they never really change do they no maeve said the males all fall to the same thing isnt it delicious i unbuttoned the fly in my jeans undid the zipper a little and dumped the cold water directly down my pants some shocks of sensation are pleasant this one wasnt the water was so cold that tiny chips of ice had formed in it as though it was trying to freeze itself from the inside out that cold went right down where i had intended it to go and everything in my jeans tried to contract into my abdomen in sheer hypothermic horror i let out a little yelp and my skin promptly crawled with gooseflesh the gesture had its intended effect that overwhelming almost feral hunger withered and vanished i was able to take my eyes off the winter lady and her handmaiden to clear my thoughts into something resembling a sane line of reason i shook my head a bit to be sure and then looked up at maeve anger surged through me and my jaw clenched tight but i made an effort to keep my words at least marginally polite sorry sweetie but i have a couple problems with that offer maeves lips tightened and those would be one im not handing over a child to you not mine not anyones not now and not ever if you had a brain in your head youd have known that maeves already pale face blanched even more and she sat bolt upright on her throne you dare shut up i snarled and it came out loud enough to ring off the walls of the ballroom im not finished maeve jerked as though id slapped her her mouth dropped open and she blinked at me i came here under your invitation and protection i am your guest but in spite of that youve thrown glamour at me anyway i stood up my hands spread on the table leaning toward her for emphasis i dont have time for this crap you dont scare me lady i said i only came here for answersbut if you keep pushing me im going to push back hard maeves evident anger evaporated she leaned back on her throne lips pursed her expression placid and enigmatic well well well not so easily captured it would seem a new voice a relaxed masculine drawl slid into the silence i told you maeve you should have been polite anyone who declares war on the red court isnt going to be the sort to take kindly to pressure the speaker stepped into the ballroom through the double doors and walked casually to the banquet tables and toward maeves throne it was a man maybe in his early thirties medium build maybe half an inch shy of six feet tall he wore dark jeans a white tee and a leather jacket droplets of dark reddish brown stained the shirt and one side of his face his scalp was bald but for a stubble of dark hair as he approached i picked out more details he had a brand on his throat a snowflake made of white scar tissue stood out sharply against his skin the skin on one side of his face was red and a little swollen and he was missing half of the eyebrow and a crescent of the stubble on his scalp on that sidehed been burned and recently he reached the throne and dropped to one knee before it somehow conveying a certain relaxed insolence with the gesture and extended the box to maeve it is done maeve asked an almost childlike eagerness in her voice what took you so long it wasnt as easy as you said it would be but i did it the winter lady all but snatched the carved box from his hands avarice lighting her eyes wizard this is my knight lloyd of the family slate slate nodded to me how are you impatient i responded but i nodded back to him warily youre the winter knight so far yeah i guess youre the winter emissary asking questions and investigating and so on yep did you kill ronald reuel slate burst out laughing christ dresden you dont waste time do you ive filled my insincere courtesy quota for the day i said did you kill him slate shrugged and said no to be honest with you im not sure i could have killed him hes been at this a lot longer than me he was an old man i said so are a lot of wizards slate pointed out i could have benchpressed him sure killing him is something else altogether maeve let out a sudden hiss of anger the sound eerily loud she lifted her foot and kicked slate in the shoulder something popped when she did and the force of the kick drove the winter knight down a tier into the table and the sidhe seated there the table toppled and sidhe chairs and knight went sprawling maeve rose to her feet sending the greentoothed jen scooting away from her she drew what looked like a militaryissue combat knife from the carved box it was crusted with some kind of black gelatinous substance like burned barbecue sauce you stupid animal she snarled useless this is useless to me she hurled the knife at slate the handle hit him in the biceps of his left arm just as he sat up again his face twisted in sudden fury he took up the knife rose to his feet and stalked toward maeve with murder in his eye maeve drew herself up her face shining with a sudden terrible beauty she lifted her right hand ring finger and thumb both bent and murmured something in a liquid alien tongue sudden blue light gathered around her fingers and the temperature in the room dropped by about forty degrees she spoke again and flicked her wrist sending glowing motes of azure flickering toward slate the snowflake brand flared into sudden light and slates advance halted his body going rigid the skin around the brand turned blue then purple then black spreading like a stopmotion enhanced film of gangrene a quiet snarl slipped from slates lips and i could see his body trembling with the effort to continue toward maeve he shuddered and took another step forward maeve lifted her other hand her index finger extended while the others curled and a sudden wind whipped past me cold enough that it stole the breath from my lungs the wind whipped madly around slate making his leather coat flap bits of white frost started forming on his eyelashes and eyebrows his expression now anguished as well as full of rage faltered and his advance halted again calm him maeve murmured jen slipped behind slate wrapping her arms around his neck leaning her mouth down close to his ear slates eyes flickered with hot violent hate for a moment and then began to grow heavier jen ran her hand slowly down the sleeve of his jacket fingers caressing his wrist his arm lowered as i watched a moment later jen slid the jacket from his shoulders the tee was sleeveless and slates arms were hard with muscleand tracked with needle marks jen held out a hand and another darting pixie handed her a hypodermic needle jen slipped it into the bend of his arm still whispering to him sliding the plunger slowly down slates eyes rolled back in his head and he sank to his knees jen went down with him wrapped around him like kelp on a swimmer her mouth next to his ear maeve lowered her hands and the wind and the cold died away she lifted a shaking hand to her face and stepped back to the throne settling stiffly onto it narrowed eyes locked on slates increasingly malleable form her cheekbones stood out more sharply than before her eyes looked more sunken she gripped the arms of the throne her fingers twitching what the hell was that billy whispered probably what passes for a polite disagreement i muttered get up were leaving i stood up maeves eyes darted to me her voice came out dry harsh our bargain is not complete wizard this talk is but i have not answered your question keep your answer i dont need it anymore you dont maeve asked we dont billy said i nodded toward slate and jen you had to push yourself to make him stand still look at you youre just about out of gas right now from going up against your own knight i started down the tiers billy coming with me besides that youre sloppy sweetheart reckless a clean killing like reuels takes a plan and that isnt you i could feel her eyes pressing against my back like frozen thorns i ignored her i did not give you leave to go wizard she said her voice chilly i didnt ask i wont forget this insolence i probably will i said its nothing special come on billy i walked to the double doors and out as soon as we were both outside the doors swung shut with a huge hollow boom that made me jump darkness fell sudden and complete and i fumbled for my amulet as my heart lurched in panic the spectral light from my amulet showed me billys strained face first and then the area immediately around us the double doors were gone only a blank stone wall remained where they had been gulp billy said he shook his head for a moment dazed where did they go i rested my fingers against the stone wall reaching out for it with my wizards senses nothing it was rock not illusion beats the hell out of me the doors here must have been a way to some other location like some kind of teleport more like a temporary entrance into the nevernever i said or a shortcut through the nevernever to another place on earth kind of intense in there when she made it get all cold ive never seen anything like that before sloppy i said she was laying a binding on slate her power was sloshing over into changing the temperature a child could do better billy let out a short quiet laugh after what we just saw anyone else would still be shaking youre giving her the rating from the russian judge so sue me i shrugged shes strong strong isnt everything billy glanced up at me could you do what she did id probably use fire his eyebrows went up his expression impressed do you really think maeves not the killer i do i said this murder was clean enough to look like an accident maeves obviously got impulsecontrol issues doesnt make for much of a methodical murderer what about slate i shook my head my brow tightening not sure about him hes mortal theres nothing that says he couldnt lie to us but i got what i was looking for and i found out a couple of things on top of that so why are you frowning because all i got was more questions everyones been telling me to hurry faeries dont do that theyre practically immortal and theyre not in a rush but mab and grimalkin both have tried to rush me now maeve went for the highpressure sales tactic too like she didnt have time for anything more subtle why would they do that i sighed somethings in motion if i dont run down the killer the courts could go to war with one another that would explain the whole world war two dress motif back there yeah but not why time would be so pressing i shook my head if we could have stayed longer i might have been able to work out more but it was getting too nervous in there discretion valor billy said by way of agreement we leave now right elidee i asked i felt a stirring in my hair and then the tiny pixie popped out to hover in the air in front of me can you lead us back to my car the pixie flashed in the affirmative and zipped away i lifted my amulet and followed billy and i didnt speak until our guide had led us out of the underground complex not far from where id parked the blue beetle we cut through an alley about halfway down it billy grabbed my arm and jerked me bodily behind him snapping harry get back in the same motion he swung out one foot and kicked a metal trash can it went flying crashing into something i hadnt seen behind it someone let out a short harsh gasp of pain billy stepped forward and picked up the metal lid that had fallen to the ground he swung it down at the shape it struck with a noisy crash i took a couple of steps back to make sure i was clear of the action and reached for my amulet again billy i said what the hell i felt the sudden presence at my back half a second too late to get out of the way a hand the size of a dinner plate closed on the back of my neck like a vice and lifted i felt my heels rise until my toes were just barely touching the ground a voice a feminine contralto growled let go of the amulet and call him off wizard call him off before i break your neck chapter sixteen being held up by your neck hurts trust me on this one i lifted my hands by way of attempting to convey compliance and said billy get off him billy took a step back from the palehaired young man hed knocked down fix whimpered and scuttled away on his hands and butt his borrowed brown suit was soiled and torn and his yellow polyester tie hung from his collar by only one of its clips he put his back against the alley wall eyes wide beneath his shock of white dandelion hair billys eyes flicked from my assailant to fix and back he squinted at her for a moment then set his jaw in an expression of casual determination harry you want me to take her wait a minute i managed to say okay hes off put me down the grip on the back of my neck relaxed and as i touched ground again i took a step toward billy turning to face the woman who had held me as i expected it was the tall muscular young woman from the funeral home her muddy green hair hanging lankly over her eyes and one cheek she folded her arms and shifted her weight from one foot to the other fix are you okay the smaller man panted my lip is cut it isnt bad the woman nodded and faced me again all right i said who the hell are you my names meryl she said her voice was surprisingly quiet contrasting with her size i wanted to apologize to you mr dresden for hitting you and throwing you into the dumpster i raised my eyebrows are you sure you got the right guy meryl no one ever apologizes to me for anything she pushed at her hair with one hand it fell right back over her face im sorry i was scared earlier and i acted without thinking i traded a glance with billy uh okay im pretty sure lurking in a dark alley to mug me with your apology isnt the usual way to go about saying youre sorry but i didnt read that marsvenus book so who knows her mouth twitched and she relaxed her stance by a tiny degree i didnt know how else to find you so i was just waiting near your car okay i said my neck still throbbed where her fingers had clamped on five to one i would have wonderful stripy bruises the next day i nodded and turned away apology accepted now if youll excuse me i have things i need to do a note of panic crept into her voice wait please i stopped and looked back at her i need to talk to you just for a minute she took a deep breath i need your help of course she did its very important of course it was the headache started coming back look meryl ive got a lot on my plate already i know she said investigating rons death i think i can help you i pursed my lips you were close to reuel she nodded me fix ace and lily i flashed back on the photo of reuel and the four young people greenhaired girl very cute yes wheres ace he had to go to work right after the funeral but lilys why i need to talk to you shes missing i think shes in trouble i started filling in context on the conversation id overheard between them who are you i told you my name is meryl okay fine what are you meryl she flinched at the question oh im sorry i didnt know what you meant she raked at her hair again im a changeling we all are a what billy asked i nodded getting it changeling i said to billy shes half mortal and half fae aha billy said which means what i shrugged it means that she has to choose whether to remain a mortal or become wholly fae yes she said and until then im under the rule of the court of my fae father winter the others too thats why the four of us stuck together it was safer billy nodded oh meryl i said what makes you think your friend is in trouble shes not very independent mister dresden we share an apartment she doesnt have a very good idea of how to take care of herself and she gets nervous if shes out of the apartment for too long and what do you think happened to her the winter knight billy frowned why would he hurt people in his own court meryl let out a brief hard laugh because he can he had a thing for lily he would hurt her frighten her he got off on it he was furious when maeve told him to back off and once ron was gone her voice trailed off and she turned her head to one side how does reuel fit into this i asked he was protecting us maeve had been torturing us for fun and we didnt know where to turn ron took us in he put us under his protection and no one in winter was willing to cross him what about your fae dad billy asked didnt he do anything to look out for you meryl gave billy a flat look my mother was raped by a troll even if hed been strong enough to do anything about maeve hurting us he wouldnt have he thinks hes already done enough by not devouring my mom on the spot oh billy said sorry i frowned and with the summer knight gone you think slate grabbed the girl meryl said someone broke into the apartment it looked like there had been a struggle i let out a sigh have you contacted the police she eyed me oh yeah of course i called them and told them that a mortal champion of the fae came and spirited away a halfmortal halfnixie professional nude model to faerieland they were all over it i had to admire the wellplaced sarcasm it doesnt take a supernatural studmuffin to cause something very bad to happen to a cute girl in this town your plain old mortal kidnappers and murderers can manage just fine she shook her head either way shes still in trouble i lifted a hand what do you want from me help me find her please mister dresden i closed my eyes i didnt have time energy or brainpower to spare for this the smart thing would be to blow her off entirely or to promise her id do it and promptly forget about it this just isnt a good time i felt like crap the second i said it i didnt look at the changelings face i couldnt theres too much trouble already and i dont even know if i can help myself much less your friend im sorry i turned to go but meryl stepped in front of me wait i told you i said theres nothing i can ill pay you meryl said oh right money i was about to lose the office and the apartment and this faerie work only paid in misery i needed to pay some bills go to the grocery store my mouth didnt actually water but it was close i shook my head again look meryl i wish i could double your fee she said her voice urgent double my fee i hesitated some more triple she said she reached for her back pocket and produced an envelope plus one thousand cash up front right now i looked back at fix still trembling and leaning against the alley wall a handkerchief pressed to his mouth meryl continued to rock from one foot to the other her eyes on the ground waiting i tried to look at things objectively a thousand bucks wouldnt spend if i got myself killed while distracted by the additional workload on the other hand if i lived through this thing the money would be necessary my stomach growled and a sharp pang of hunger made me clench the muscles of my belly i needed the workbut more to the point i needed to be able to live with myself i wasnt sure i was comfortable with the idea of looking back on this particular patch of memory and seeing myself leave some helpless girl changeling or not to the metaphoric wolves people dont ask me for help if theyre anything less than desperate the changelings had been terrified of me only a few hours before if they had turned to me for help now it was because they were out of options and they also had money dammit dammit dammit i muttered i snatched the envelope all right ill look into it and do what i canbut i cant make you any promises meryl let out a shuddering breath thank you thank you mr dresden yeah i sighed i reached into my pocket and pulled out a slightly crumpled business card heres my office number call and leave a message to let me know how i can reach you she took the card and nodded i dont know if i can pay your fees all at once but ill be good for it even if it takes a while we can worry about that later when were all safe and sound i said i nodded to her then to fix and started walking down the alley again billy kept an eye on the pair of them and followed me we reached the parking lot of the funeral home a few minutes later the lights were all out and the blue beetle was the only car left in the lot no one had bothered to steal it what a shock so whats next billy asked ill call murphy see what she can tell me about lloyd slate billy nodded anything i can do to help actually yeah i said get out the phone book and call the hospitals see if the morgues have a greenhaired jane doe you think shes dead then i think it would be a lot simpler if she was he grimaced calling morgues there must be about a million of them in chicagoland isnt there anything else i could do welcome to the glamorous world of private investigation you want to help or not okay okay billy said my cars a block over ill get back to you as soon as im done making calls all right ill probably be at my place but if not you know the drill billy nodded be careful then he walked quickly down the street without looking back i fumbled my keys out and walked to the beetle i didnt smell the blood until i was close enough to touch the car through the window i saw a form more or less humanshaped curled up on my passenger seat i circled cautiously to the other side of the car then abruptly opened the door elaine fell out of the car onto the pavement of the parking lot she was drenched in blood that had soaked through her tshirt matted her goldenbrown hair on one side and run down her flanks to saturate her jeans to mid thigh her silver pentacle shone with liquid scarlet the bare skin of her forearms was covered with long slashes and blood and her face looked white dead my heart hammered in my chest and i leaned down to her fumbling at her throat she still had a very slow pulse but her skin felt cool and waxy she started shuddering and whispered harry im here im here elaine please she whispered oh god please help me chapter seventeen i laid elaine out first thing and tried to determine the extent of her injuries her forearms had been laced open in several places but the worst injury was on her back just inside of her left claviclea nasty puncture wound the edges of it had puckered closed but it hadnt stopped the bleeding completely and if she was bleeding internally she could be done for i would need both hands to put pressure on the wound no help was on the way there was little i could do for her so i picked her up and put her back into the beetle then jumped in myself and started the ignition hang in there elaine i said im getting you to a hospital youre going to be all right she shook her head no no too dangerous youre hurt too badly for me to take care of it i said relax ill be with you she opened her eyes and said with sudden surprising insistence no hospitals theyll find me there i started up the car dammit elaine what else am i supposed to do she closed her eyes again her voice grew fainter by the word aurora summer rothchild hotel theres an elevator in back shell help the summer lady i demanded youre joking right she didnt answer me i looked over at her and my heart all but stopped as i saw her head lolling her body slumped i jammed the beetle into gear and jounced out onto the road rothchild hotel i muttered more faeries keen i got us to the hotel one of the nice places along the shores of lake michigan i skipped the huge valetlittered front drive and zipped the beetle into the back parking lot looking for some kind of service drive or freight elevator or maybe just a door with a sign on it that said summer court of the faeries this way i felt a slight warmth on my ear and then elidee zoomed out in front of my face and bumped up against the window i rolled the window down a bit and the tiny faerie streaked out ahead of my car guiding me to the back of the lot she stopped circling an unobtrusive unlit breezeway then she sped away her task evidently completed i quickly parked the car and set the brake elaine may have been slender but she had too much muscle to be light shed always had the build of a longdistance runner long and lean and strong she was only just conscious enough to make it a little easier for me to carry her wrapping her arms around my neck and leaning her head on my shoulder she trembled and felt cold doubt gnawed at me as i took her down the breezeway maybe i should have ignored her and gone to the hospital i kept going until it became too dark to see and i started to put elaine down so that i could take out my amulet to make some light just as i did a pair of elevator doors swept open spilling light and canned music onto the breezeway a girl stood in the doors she was five nothing a hundred and nothing her sunny hair pulled back into a braid she wore a blue tshirt with white painters overalls and she was liberally splattered with flecks of what looked like clay her rosy mouth opened in dismay as she saw me standing there with elaine oh no she exclaimed she beckoned me urgently come on get her inside the lady can see to her my arms and shoulders had begun to burn with the effort of supporting elaine so i didnt waste time talking i shuffled forward into the elevator and leaned against the back wall with a wheeze the girl closed the elevator doors took a key from her overalls pocket and inserted it into a solitary keyhole where you would expect a bunch of buttons to be the elevator gave a little lurch and started up what happened to ela the girl asked me she looked from me to elaine and chewed on one lip ela beats me i found her like this in my car she told me to bring her here oh oh god the girl said she looked at me again youre with winter arent you i frowned how did you know she shrugged it shows im with winter for now but its a oneshot deal think of me as a free agent perhaps but an agent of winter all the same are you sure you want to be here no i said but im sure im not leaving elaine until im convinced shes in good hands the girl frowned oh cant this thing go any faster my shoulders burned my back ached my bruises were complaining and i could feel elaines breathing growing weaker i had to fight not to scream in sheer frustration i wished there had been a bank of buttons to push just so that i could have slammed the right button a bunch of times in a senseless effort to speed up the elevator the doors opened a geological epoch later onto a scene as incongruous as a gorilla in a garter belt the elevator had taken us to what could only have been the roof of the hotel assuming the roof opened up onto a section of rain forest in borneo trees and greenery grew so thick that i couldnt see the edge of the roof and though i could hear the nighttime noises of chicago the sounds were vague in the distance and could almost not be heard over the buzz of locusts and the chittering of some kind of animal i did not recognize wind rustled the forest around me and silver moonlight brighter than i would have thought possible gave everything an eerie surreal beauty im so glad i was going out for more clay just then this way the girl said and started off on a trail through the forest i followed as quickly as i could puffing hard to keep holding elaine it wasnt a long walk the trail wound back and forth and then opened onto a grassy glade i stopped and looked around no not a glade more like a garden a pool rested at its center still water reflecting the moon overhead benches and stones of a good size for sitting on were strewn around the landscape statuary most of it marble and of human subjects stood here and there often framed by flowers or placed between young trees on the far side of the pool stood what at first glance i took to be a gnarled tree it wasnt it was a throne a throne of living wood its trunk grown into the correct shape branches and leaves spreading above it in stately elegance roots spreading and anchoring it in the earth people stood here and there a paintspattered young man worked furiously on some sort of portrait his face set in concentration a tall man his ageless beauty and pale hair marking him as one of the sidhe stood in the posture of a teacher beside a slender girl who was drawing back a bow aiming at a target of bundled branches on the far side of the glade smoke rose from stones piled into the shape of an oven or a forge and a broadchested man shirtless bearded heavybrowed and fiercelooking stood on the other side of it wielding a smiths hammer in regular rhythm he stepped away from the forge a glowinghot blade gripped in a set of tongs and dunked it into a trough of silvery water when i got a better look at him i understood what he was steam rose in a cloud over his heavy equine forelegs then over his human belly and broad chest and the centaur stamped a rear hoof impatiently muttering under his breath while colored lights played back and forth in the water of the trough haunting pipe music sad and lovely drifted through the glade from a young woman mortal sitting with a set of reed pipes playing with her eyes closed where is she i demanded where is the lady the centaurs head snapped around and he snarled in a sudden harsh basso he took up his hammer again whipped it in a quick circle and started toward me at a slow canter clydesdalesized hooves striking the ground with dull thumps winterbound here it cannot be borne i tensed holding elaine a little closer and my heart lurched into a higher gear the centaur was huge and looked ready to kill whoa there big fella im not looking for trouble the centaur bared his teeth at me and spoke his deep voice filled with outrage there you stand with our emissarys blood on your hands and expect us to believe you the tall sidhe man barked korrick hold the centaur drew up short rearing onto his hind legs and kicking at the air with heavy hooves my lord talos he growled in frustration this arrogance cannot be tolerated peace the sidhe lord said but my lord the sidhe lord stepped between me and the centaur his back to me he wore closefit trousers of dark green and a loose shirt of white linen the sidhe lord said nothing and i couldnt see his expression but the centaurs face reddened then blanched he bowed his head a stiff gesture and then walked back over to his forge hooves striking the ground in sharp angry motions the sidhetalos i presumedturned back to me and regarded me with calm feline eyes the color of a summer sky he had the pale hair of the sidhe hanging in a straight fine sheet to brush his shoulders there was a quality of quiet confidence in his features of relaxed strength and the sense of him was somehow less alien than that of most of the sidhe i had encountered i hope you will not judge korrick too harshly sir you are i take it harry dresden if im not hes going to be upset with me when he catches me running around in his underpants talos smiled the expression came easily to his features then i grant you passport and license in agreement with the accords i am talos lord marshal of the summer court yeah thats great nice to meet you i said hey do you think you could help me save this womans life now the sidhes smile faded i will do what i can he glanced to the side and gestured with a roll of his wrist the garden flew into activity a cloud of pixies darted through the air bearing stalks of green plants and broad soft leaves they piled them into a softlooking mound near the side of the pool talos looked at me for permission and then gently took elaines weight into his arms my shoulders and biceps all but screamed in relief the sidhe lord carried elaine to the bed of leaves and laid her down upon it he touched her throat and then her brow with one hand his eyes closing weak he said quietly and cold but she has strength left in her she will be all right for a little while no offense but your people have some odd notions about time go get your lady she needs to see to elaine now talos regarded me with that same quiet opaque expression she will be here when she will be here i cannot hurry the sunrise nor the lady i started to tell him where he could stick his sunrise but i bit back the words and tried to take out some frustration by clenching my fists my knuckles popped a hand touched my arm and the girl the sculptor from the elevator said please sir let me get you something to drink or some food mortal food i mean i wouldnt offer the other kind like hell i said not until elaine is taken care of from where he knelt beside elaine talos lifted both eyebrows but he shrugged his shoulders as you wish he rested his fingertips lightly on either side of her face and bowed his head my skills are rather limited i can at least assure that she loses no ground there was a quiet surge of energy something as gentle and strong as the weight of a wave lifting you off your feet elaine suddenly took a deep breath and color came back into her cheeks she blinked her eyes open for a moment then sighed and closed them again talos can sustain her for a time the girl said until the lady decides he has been elas guardian and friend for several years she tugged at my arm please take something to eat youll make us poor hosts if you do not my stomach growled again and my throat started to complain after all the hard breathing id been doing i exhaled through my nose and nodded to the girl who led me to one of the benches not far away and pulled a plastic coleman cooler from underneath it she rummaged inside then tossed me a cold can of coke a small bag of potato chips and a long hoagie none of them held any of the subtle quivering lure of faerie fare best i can do for now she said turkey sub sound all right marry me i responded tore into the food with fervor and spent a couple of minutes indulging in one of the purest primal pleasures eating food never tastes so good as when you are starving and talos had granted me safe passport under the accords so i wasnt worried about any drugs in it while i ate the girl drew a short stand over to her on which was a clay bust of a young woman parts of it still rough still marked with the tracks of her fingers she dipped them into a bowl of water attached to the stand and started working on the bust what happened to her she asked hell if i know i said between bites she was in my car like that wanted me to bring her here why did you she flushed i mean youre working for summers enemies right yeah but it doesnt mean im friendly with them i shook my head washed down a halfchewed bite with a long drink of coke heaven i ate for a moment more and then frowned at the bust she was working on the face seemed familiar i studied it a bit then asked is that lily the girl blinked at me you know her of her i said shes a changeling isnt she the girl nodded winter but she hasnt chosen to go over to them she was under ronalds protection and she models for us sometimes she gestured vaguely toward the young man who was painting intently see there are a few other pieces she modeled for around here i looked around the garden and picked out a pair of statues among all the rest both were nudes of white marble one of them depicted the girl in a tiptoe stretch arms over her head body arched prettily the other showed her kneeling looking at something cupped in her hands her expression one of quiet sadness seems like shes well liked the girl nodded shes very gentle very sweet very missing i said she frowned missing yeah her roommate asked me to see if i could find her have you seen her in the past couple of days she hasnt been here to model and ive never seen her anywhere but here im sorry worth a shot i said why are you looking for her i told you her roommate asked for my help i gave it which was mostly true technically i suppose id sold it i got the uneasy feeling that i might start feeling too guilty over the cash meryl had given me to spend it im a tad busy this week but ill do what i can the girls brow furrowed as she worked at the bust youre not like anyone else ive ever met who was working for winter mab usually likes her agents colder i think hungrier more cruel i shrugged she wanted someone to find a killer ive had some experience she nodded still you seem like a decent enough person it makes me sad to think that youve gotten entangled in winters snares i stopped chewing and looked up at her hard oh hells bells she looked at me and lifted an eyebrow hmm i put the sandwich down and said youre her youre the summer lady the shadow of a smile touched the girls lips and she bowed her head toward me her blond hair cleared out to sidhe white her fingers and limbs suddenly seemed slightly longer and her features became almost identical to maeves eyes vertically slitted and almost violently green she still wore the coveralls and blue tshirt and was still liberally covered in flecks of clay though they stood out in sharp contrast to her fair skin and pale hair call me aurora she said its a little easier for everyone uh right i said i finished the bite i was on and said so are you going to stop playing games with me and help elaine aurora she glanced over at elaine lying on the ground and her expression grew troubled that depends my teeth clenched and i said in a falsely pleasant voice on what she turned her calm inhuman eyes to me on you dont go getting specific on me now i said i wouldnt know how to handle it do you think this is a joke mr dresden a game i know damn well it isnt a game she shook her head and that is where you are wrong it is a game but unlike the ones you know you arent allowed to know the rules to this game and it was never intended to be fair do you know why mab chose you wizard i glared at her no neither do i she said and that is my part of the game why choose you it must be because she expects something of you that she would get from no one else perhaps bringing ela here is what she expected whats the difference i demanded elaine is hurt your emissary has been wounded in the line of duty dont you think you should get her moving again but if that is what winter expects it could be used against me i am the least queen of summer but even so i must be cautious in the use of my power i snorted maeve sure as hell doesnt think that way of course not she said shes winter shes violent vicious merciless and your centaur is just the soul of gentleness and understanding aurora sighed and lowered her claycrusted fingers i hope you will forgive korricks temper he is usually a merrier sort everyones been edgy because of matters here uhhuh i said just so were clear that was really mortal food wasnt it yes she said i have no desire to threaten your freedom mister dresden or to bind you in any way good i knew she couldnt lie to me so i took another bite of the sandwich and some more chips look im not here to try to undermine your power or sabotage summer aurora i just want you to help elaine i know she said i believe you but i dont trust you what reason do you have not to trust me ive watched you she responded youre a mercenary you work for hire yeah to pay the bills and she lifted a hand youve made bargains with demons nickelanddime stuff nothing huge or you traded yourself to the leanansidhe for power when i was younger and a hell of a lot stupider and in trouble her inhuman eyes met mine penetrating youve killed i looked away from her there wasnt much to say to that my stomach turned and i pushed the food a bit away from me aurora nodded slowly from the beginning you have been meant to be a destroyer a killer do you know the original purpose of a godparent mr dresden yeah i said i felt tired a godparent was chosen to ensure that a child had religious and moral guidance and teaching indeed she said and your godmother your teacher and guide is the most vicious creature of mabs court more than maeves equal second in strength only to mab herself i let out a harsh laugh teacher guide is that what you think lea is to me isnt she lea barely noticed me except when she thought she could get something from me i spat the rest of the time she couldnt care less the only thing she taught me was that if i didnt want to get walked on i had to be smarter than her stronger than her and willing to do something about it aurora turned her lovely face fully toward me and regarded me with deep quiet eyes yes unease gnawed at my belly as she continued the strong conquer and the weak are conquered that is winter that is what you have learned she leaned closer and said quietly emphatic that is what makes you dangerous do you see i stood up and walked a few paces away aurora didnt say anything i heard drips of water as she washed her hands in the little bowl if you arent going to help elaine tell me ill take her to the hospital do you think i should help her i dont give a damn if you do or not i said but one way or another im going to make sure shes taken care of make up your mind i already have what remains is for you to make up yours i took a wary breath before asking meaning of the two people who entered this garden mister dresden elaine is not the most grievously wounded you are like hell ive just got some cuts and bruises she rose and walked toward me those arent the wounds i mean she reached out and laid a slender hand over my heart her skin was warm even through my shirt and the simple fact of her touch brought me a small but noticeable sense of comfort susan had been gone for months and with the exception of the occasional assault no one had actually touched me she looked up at me and nodded you see youve been badly wounded mister dresden and you have found neither rest nor respite from your pains ill live true she said but this is where it always begins monsters are born of pain and grief and loss and anger your heart is full of them i shrugged and and it makes you vulnerable vulnerable to mabs influence to temptations that would normally be unthinkable im handling temptation pretty damned well thank you but for how long you need to heal wizard let me help you i frowned at her and at her hand how aurora gave me a small sad smile ill show you here her palm pressed a bit closer to me and somewhere inside me a dam broke open emotions welled up like a riotous rainbow scarlet rage indigo fear pale blue sadness aching yellow loneliness putrid green guilt the tide flooded through me coursed over me like a bolt of lightning searing and painful and beautiful all at once and after the tide receded a deep quiet stillness followed a sensation of warmth suffused me gently easing away my aches and bruises it spread over my skin like sunlight on a lazy afternoon outside and with the warmth my cares began to evaporate my fear vanished and i began to relax muscles i hadnt realized were stretched tight as the warmth spread i floated in warmth for a time the release from pain an ecstasy in itself when i came back to my senses i was lying on my back on the grass staring up at leaves and silverstarred sky my head lay in auroras lap she knelt behind me and her hands rested lightly warm and soft along the sides of my face the pain began to return to my body thoughts and heart like some quiet and odious tide washing in garbage from a polluted sea i heard myself make a small sound of protest aurora looked down at me her eyes concerned worse even than i suspected you didnt even realize how much pain you were in did you my chest heaved and i let out a quiet sob the warmth faded entirely and the sheer weight of the difficulties i had to face pressed down on me suffocating me aurora said please let me help you well make it a bargain mr dresden desist relax your efforts to help winter stay here for a time and let me grant you a measure of peace real tears formed making my vision blur i mopped at my face with my hands struggling to think clearly if i took the deal it would probably mean my ass backing off from mabs offer would mean that i didnt get a good outcome for the white council which meant that they would buy peace with the red court of vampires for the low low price of one harry dresden slightly damaged forget it i said my voice weak ive got a job to do aurora closed her eyes for a moment and nodded at least you are true to your word mister dresden your honor is admirable even if it is misguided i forced myself to sit up away from aurora go on i said help elaine i will she assured me but she is in no danger for the moment and it will take me some time there is something i wish to say to you first okay talk how much did mab tell you about ronalds death i shook my head that he was dead that the mantle of power he wore went missing that the killer had to be found did she tell you why i frowned not exactly aurora nodded and folded her hands in her lap summer readies to go to war against winter i frowned you mean its not just a theoretical possibility anymore its real i know no other kind of war the loss of the summer knight has forced summers hand im not sure i follow her pale brow knit into a soft frown the power of our knights is considerable it carries a sort of weight that only a free mortal will can possess that power that influence is a critical element of the balance between our courts except now yours is gone exactly which makes summer weaker yes i nodded then why the hell are you planning an attack the seasons are changing aurora said in two days time midsummer will be upon us the height of summers strength she said nothing more letting me do the math you think winter has taken away your knight i said and if you wait youre only going to grow more and more weak while winter gets stronger right correct if we are to have any chance of victory we must strike while at the peak of our strength it will be the only time when our court might be near equal to winters strength otherwise the seasons will change and at midwinter mab and her creatures will come for us and they will destroy us and with us the balances of the mortal world she lifted her green eyes from her hands to my face winter mister dresden endless winter unending and vicious cycles of predator and prey such a world would not be kind to mortals i shook my head why would winter pull this now i mean if they had waited another couple of days they could have held all the cards why leave you enough space to wriggle out i cannot even pretend to know the mind of winter aurora said but i know that they must not be allowed to destroy us for your sake as well as ours boy everybodys looking out for my best interests wizard please promise me that you will do what you can to stop them im finished making promises i stood up and started for the path that led back to the elevator and out but part of me wanted to do nothing but return to the comfort aurora had offered i paused and squeezed my eyes shut focusing my resolve but i will say this im going to find the killer and straighten this out and im going to do it before midsummer i didnt bother to add because im as good as dead if i dont no need to belabor the obvious chapter eighteen i got the hell away from the rothchild and found a pay phone murphy picked up on the first ring dresden yeah finally you all right i need to talk to you there was a short pause then her voice softened where i rubbed at my head with the heel of one hand trying to nudge my brain into gear my thoughts stumbled around sluggishly and in no particular order dunno someplace public bunch of people quiet enough to talk in chicago at this time of night yeah okay murph said i guess i know a place she told me we agreed to meet in twenty minutes and hung up as i pulled into the parking lot i reflected that odds were that not a lot of clandestine meetings involving mystical assassination theft of arcane power and the balance of power in the realms of the supernatural had taken place in a walmart super center but then again maybe they had hell for all i knew the mole men used the changing rooms as a place to discuss plans for world domination with the psychic jellyfish from planet x and the disembodied brainsinajar from the klaatuu nebula i know i wouldnt have looked for them there after midnight the walmart wasnt crowded but it wasnt the usual deserted parking lot youd expect after hours around wrigleyville either the store was open all night and there were plenty of people in a town like chicago who would do their shopping late i had to park about halfway down a row and walk through the cool of the evening before stepping into the refrigeratorcold of the enormous store whose massive air conditioners had too much momentum to slow down for a few paltry hours of darkness a greeter nodded sleepily to me as i came in and i passed up his offer of a shopping cart before id gotten all the way into the store murphy fell into step beside me she was wearing a cubs jacket jeans and sneakers and she had her blond hair tucked up underneath an undecorated black ball cap she walked with her hands in her pockets and her expression one of belligerent annoyance didnt seem to fit on someone that short wordlessly we walked past all the little holeinthewall franchise businesses closed and locked up behind their grills and settled down at the generic cafe near the deli section of the grocery store murphy chose a booth where she could watch the door and i sat across from her where i could watch her back she picked up a couple of cups of coffee bless her noble heart i dumped sugar and creamer into mine until bits floated on the surface stirred it up and took a slow sip that nearly scalded my tongue you dont look so good murphy said i nodded you want to talk about it to my own surprise i did i set the coffee down and said without preamble im furious murph i cant think straight im so mad why because im screwed thats why no matter what i do im going to take it up the ass lines appeared between her eyebrows what do you mean its this job i said investigating reuels death theres a lot of resistance and i dont know if i can beat it and if i dont beat it before tomorrow night things are really going to go to hell the client isnt being helpful i let out a bitter laugh hell for all i know the client is doing this to me just so i can get myself horribly killed you dont trust them then not as far as i could kick her and the people who are supposed to be working with me are driving me nuts i shook my head i feel like some guy in a magicians box just before he starts pushing all those swords through it only its not a trick and the swords are real and theyre going to start skewering me any second the bad guys are doing their best to get me wiped out or screwed up the good guys think im some kind of ticking psycho just waiting to go off and its like pulling teeth to try to get a straight answer out of any of them you think youre in danger i know it i said and its just too damned big i fell quiet for a moment and sipped my coffee so murph said why did you want to see me because the people who should be backing me up are about to throw me to the wolves and because the only person actually helping me is green enough to get himself killed without a babysitter i set the empty cup down and because when i asked myself who i could trust i came up with a damned short list youre it she settled back in her seat with a slow long exhalation youre going to tell me whats going on if youre willing i said i know ive kept things from you but ive done it because i thought it was how i could protect you best because i didnt want you to get hurt yeah she said i know its annoying as hell i tried to smile in this case ignorance is bliss if i tell you this stuff its going to be serious just knowing it could be dangerous for you and you arent going to be able to get away from it murph not ever she regarded me soberly then why tell me now because you deserve to know long since because youve risked your life for me and to protect people from all the supernatural crud thats out there because being around me has bought you trouble and knowing more about it might help you if it comes your way again my cheeks flushed and i admitted and because i need your help this is a bad one im afraid im not going anywhere harry i gave her a tired smile one last thing if you come in on this you have to understand something you have to promise me that you wont haul si and the rest of the police in on everything you can dig up information use them discretely but you cant round up a posse and go gunning for demons her eyes narrowed why the hell not because bringing mortal authorities into a conflict is the nuclear assault of the supernatural world no one wants to see it happen and if they thought you might do it theyd kill you or theyd pull strings higher up and get you fired or framed for something they would never allow it to pass youd get yourself ruined or hurt or killed and its likely a lot of people would go down with you i paused to let the words sink in then asked still want me to tell you she closed her eyes for a moment and then nodded once hit me youre sure yeah all right i said and i told murphy all of it it took a while i told her about justin and about elaine i told her about the supernatural forces and politics at play in and around the city i told her about the war id started because of what the red court had done to susan i told her about the faeries and reuels murder and most of all i told her about the white council those spineless arrogant egomaniacal sons of bitches murphy growled who the hell do they think they are selling out their own people like that some silent delighted part of me let out a mental cheer at her reaction she made a disgusted noise and shook her head so let me get this straight she said you started a war between the council and the red court the council needs the support of the faeries in order to have a chance at victory but they cant get that support unless you find this killer and restore the stolen magical power thingie mantle i interjected whatever murphy said and if you dont get the magic whatsit the council fixes you up in a carryout box for the vampires yeah i said and if you dont find the killer before midsummer the faeries slug it out with each other which could be bad no matter who won it would make el nino look as mild as an early spring thaw and you want my help youve worked homicide before youre better at it than me that goes without saying she said a trace of a smile on her mouth look harry if you want to find out who did the killing the best way to start is to figure out why why what why the murder why reuel got bumped off oh right i said and why would someone try to take you out in the park yesterday it could have been almost anyone i said it wasnt like it was a brilliant attempt as far as they go wrong murphy said not neat but not stupid either after you called earlier tonight i snooped around i frowned at her you found something yeah turns out that there have been two armed robberies in the past three days first outside of cleveland and then at a gas station just this side of indianapolis coming toward chicago that doesnt sound out of the ordinary no murphy said not unless you throw in that in both cases someone was grabbed at the scene and abducted and both times the video security broke down just as the robbery started eyewitnesses in indiana identified the perpetrator as a woman i whistled sounds like our ghoul then murph nodded her lips pressed together any chance those people she grabbed are alive i shook my head not likely she probably ate them a ghoul can go through forty or fifty pounds of meat a day shell put whatevers left someplace where animals can get to it cover her tracks she nodded i figured the pattern matches several incidents over the past twenty years it took me a while to piece it together but something similar has happened three times in connection with the operations of a contract killer who calls herself the tigress a friend at the fbi told me that they suspect her of a number of killings in the new orleans area and that interpol thinks shes pulled jobs in europe and africa too hired gun i said so who did the hiring from what youve said my moneys on the vampires theyre the ones who benefit most from you being dead if they punch your ticket the council will probably sue for peace right maybe i said but i doubted it if thats what they had in mind its stupid timing they pearlharbored a bunch of wizards somewhere in russia two nights ago and the council was pretty angry about it okay so maybe they figure that if your investigation finds reuels killer and gets the council brownie points with the faeries theyre in for a real fight killing you before that happens makes sense except that when it went down i wasnt involved in the investigation yet murphy shook her head i wish we could get you together with a sketch artist describe her doubt it would help much she was in makeup at first and i didnt give her a second look by the time i was paying attention she mostly looked like something out of a japanese horror cartoon she glanced down at her now cold coffee not much we can do but wait then ive got a couple of sources trying to turn up more but i wouldnt bet anything on them ill let you know i nodded even if we find her it might not help with the faerie stuff right she said mind if i ask you a few questions maybe ill see something you dont okay this dreadlock chick maeve you said her name was yeah how sure are you in your instinct about her that she couldnt have done the murder i mean pretty close to certain but not completely i frowned thoughtfully no faeries are tricky that way not completely murphy nodded what about mab i rubbed at my chin feeling the beginnings of stubble she never out and out denied responsibility for reuels death but i dont think shes the killer what makes you say that i dont know i do she could have picked anyone she wanted to represent her interests and she chose you if she wanted to cover her tracks it would make more sense for her to choose someone less capable and with less experience she wouldnt have picked someone as stupidly stubborn as you i scowled not stupidly i said i just dont like to leave things undone murphy snorted you dont know the meaning of give up dolt you see my point yeah i guess its reasonable so what about this summer girl i blew out a breath it doesnt seem to hang on her very well she was kinder than any faerie i ever met she could have been pretty darned unpleasant to me but she wasnt how about the other mortal then the winter knight hes a violent vicious heroin addict i could see him tossing reuel down those stairs sure but im not sure hes savvy enough to have worked enough magic to steal the mantle he was more of a plundernowandthinklater sort of guy i shook my head ive got three more faeries to talk to though summer queen and both mothers murphy nodded when will you see them as soon as i can work out how the ladies are the closest to the mortal world they arent hard to find the queens and the mothers though will live in faerie proper ill have to go there to find a guide murphy lifted her eyebrows a guide i grimaced yeah i dont want to but its looking like im going to have to pay my godmother a visit murphy quirked an eyebrow seriously you have a faerie godmother long story i said okay i want to get moving if you could the store lights went out all at once my heart all but stopped a second later batterypowered emergency lights came up and revealed a roiling cloud of silvergrey mist spreading into the store from the doors the mist rolled over a startled cashier and the woman slumped her mouth slightly open and her eyes unfocused staring good lord murphy said softly harry whats happening i had already gotten out of the booth and grabbed the salt shaker from our table and the one next to it trouble come with me chapter nineteen at first i tried to circle around to the exit doors but the mist proved to be flowing in through them as well curse it we cant get out that way murphys face went more pale as a young man flung himself at the exit doors the moment he hit the mist his running steps faltered he came to a halt a puzzled expression on his face and stared around him blankly as his shoulders slumped dear god she whispered harry what is that come on to the back of the store i said and started running that way i think its a mind fog you think i scowled over my shoulder at murphy ive never seen one before just heard about them they shut down your head flatline your ability to remember things scramble your thoughts theyre illegal illegal murphy yelled says who says the laws of magic i muttered you didnt say anything about any laws of magic murphy said if we get out of here alive ill explain it to you sometime we ran down a long aisle toward the back of the store passing housewares then seasonal goods on our left while grocery aisles stretched out on our right murphy stopped abruptly broke open the covering over a fire alarm and jerked it down i looked around hopefully but nothing happened damn murphy muttered worth a try look the people in the fog should be all right once its gone and whoever this is they wont have any reason to hurt them once were not around well get out the back door and get away from here where are we going to go i dont know i confessed as i started moving again but anywhere is better than where the bad guys chose to attack and have their pick of a hundred hostages right okay murphy said getting out of here is good i bet the bad guys are counting on that trying to flush us out into a dark alley you carrying murphy was already drawing her gun from under her jacket a wellused militaryissue colt are you kidding i noticed that her hands were shaking new gun old reliable she said you told me magic can jam a flaky gun revolver would be even better why dont i just throw rocks and sharp sticks while im at it tex auto bigot i spotted an employees only sign there i said and went that way out the back we headed for the swinging doors under the sign i hit them first shoving them open a grey wall of mist lay in front of me and i leaned back trying to stumble to a halt if i let myself touch the mist i might not have enough of my wits left to regret it i stumbled a foot short of it and almost fell forward but murphy grabbed my shirt and jerked me sharply back we both backed out into the store cant get out that way murphy said maybe they dont want to herd you anywhere maybe they just want to gas you and kill you while youre down i swept my gaze around the store cold grey mist rolled forward slow and steady in every direction looks like i said i nodded down a tall narrow aisle containing auto parts down there quick whats down here murphy asked cover i have to get us a defense against that mist we reached the open space at the end of the aisle and i nodded to murphy here stop here and stand close to me she did it but i could still see her shaking as she asked why i looked up the mist had reached the far end of the aisle and was gliding slowly down it im going to put up a circle that should keep it off us dont step out of it or let any part of you cross outside murphys voice took on a higher more tense pitch harry its coming i twisted open both salt shakers and started pouring them out in a circle around us maybe three feet across as i finished the circle i invested it with the slightest effort of will of intent and it closed with a sudden snap of silent invisible energies i stood up again holding my breath until the mist touched it a moment later it roiled up against the circle and stopped as though a cylinder of plexiglas stood between it and us murphy and i both let out our breath in slow exhalations wow she said quietly is that like a force field or something only against magical energies i said squinting around us if someone comes along with a gun were in trouble what do we do i think i can protect myself if im ready to do it i said but i need to set up a charm on you a what charm shortterm magic i fumbled at my shirt until i found a frayed thread and started pulling it out i need a hair murphy gave me a suspicious frown but she reached under her hat and unceremoniously jerked out several dark gold hairs i plucked them up and twisted them together with the strand of thread give me your left hand she did her fingers shook so hard that i could feel it when i put my own around them murph i said she kept looking up and down the aisle her eyes a little wild karrin she looked up at me she looked very young somehow remember what i said yesterday i said youre hurt but youll get through it youll be okay she closed her eyes tightly im scared so scared im sick youll get through it what if i dont i squeezed her fingers then i will personally make fun of you every day for the rest of your life i said i will call you a sissy girl in front of everyone you know tie frilly aprons on your car and lurk in the parking lot at cpd and whistle and tell you to shake it baby every single day murphys breath escaped in something like a hiccup she opened her eyes a mix of anger and wary amusement easing into them in place of the fear you do realize im holding a gun right youre fine hold your hand still though her fingers still trembled a little the wild panicked spasms had ceased i wrapped the twist of hair and thread around her finger murphy kept on peering through the mist her gun steady what are you doing enchantment like that mist is invasive i said it touches you gets inside you so im setting you up with a defense left side is the side that takes in energy im going to block that mists spell from going into you tie a string around your finger so you wont forget i tied the string in an almost complete knot so that it would need only a single tug to finish then i fumbled my penknife out of my pocket and pricked the pad of my right thumb i looked up at murphy trying to clear my thoughts for the spell she regarded me her face pale and uncertain ive never really seen you you know do it before its okay i told her i met her eyes for a dangerous second i wont hurt you i know what im doing she lifted the corner of her mouth in a quick smile that made her eyes sparkle she nodded and returned to peering out through the mist i closed my eyes for a moment and then began gathering my focus for the spell we were already within a circle so it happened fast the air tightened on my skin and i felt the hairs along my arms rise as the power grew memoratum i murmured i tied off the improvised string and touched the bead of blood on my thumb to the knot defendre memorarius the energy rushed out of me and into the spell wrapping tight around the string and pressing against murphy a wave of goose bumps rippled up her arm and she drew in a sudden sharp breath whoa i looked at her sharply murph you okay she blinked down at her hand and then up at me wow yeah i nodded and took my pentacle out of my shirt i wrapped it around my left hand leaving the fivepointed star lying against my knuckles okay were pushing our luck enough lets hope this works and get the hell out of here wait you dont know if it will work it should work it ought to in theory great would it be better to stay here heh thats a joke right murphy nodded okay how will we know if it works we step outside the circle and if we dont drift into lala land i said well know it worked she braced her charmed hand on the butt of her gun thats what i love about working with you dresden the certainty i broke the circle with a shuffle of my foot and an effort of will it scattered with a pressured sigh and the grey mist slid forward and over us it glided over my skin like a cold and greasy oil something foul and cloying and vaguely familiar that made me want to start brushing it off it writhed up over my arms prickles of distraction and disorientation crawling over my limbs i focused on the pentacle on my left hand the solid cool weight of it the years of discipline and practice that it represented i pushed the clinging mist away from my sensations deliberately excluded it from my perception by sheer determination a ripple of azure static flickered along the chain of my amulet flashed around the pentacle then faded taking with it the distraction of the mind fog murphy glanced back at me and said voice low you okay you looked shaky for a second i nodded i got it now you okay yeah doesnt feel like anything damn im goodsometimes go out through the garden center murphy had the gunshe walked in front i kept my eyes open on our flanks as she headed down an aisle we passed a customer and an employee down a side aisle pressed against a wall where theyd apparently tried to avoid the mist now they stood with faintly puzzled expressions on their faces eyes not focused another shopper an old man stood in an aisle swaying precariously on his feet i stopped beside him and said quietly sir here sit down for a minute and helped him sit down before he fell we went past another slackly staring employee her blue smock marked with dirt stains and smelling of fertilizer and headed for the doors leading out to the garden center my memory screamed a sudden alarm at me and i lurched forward diving past murphy and out into the mistshrouded evening within the chainlink boundaries of the garden center a hard sudden weight hit me driving my thighs and hips down to the floor my head whiplashed against it a moment later complete with a burst of phantom light and very real pain i rolled as the employee wed just passed reversed her grip on a wickedly sharp set of pruners and stabbed them down at me i oozed to one side in a sluggish dodge the steel tips of the tool tore through my shirt and some of my skin before biting into the concrete i kept rolling and kicked at the womans ankles she avoided me with a kind of liquid agility and i looked up into the human face of the ghoul assassin from the rain of toads the tigress she didnt look particularly pretty or particularly exotic or particularly anything she looked like no one in particularmedium height medium build no flattering curves no outrageous flaws no nothing mediumbrown hair of unremarkable cut and length she wore jeans a polo top the walmart smock all very normal the gun she started drawing from under the smock commanded attention thougha revolver snubnosed but it moved with the kind of weight that made me think highcaliber i started trying to pull a shield together but the defense id been holding against the mist and the blow to my head tangled up the process slowed me downnot much but enough to get me really dead murphy saved me as the tigress brought the gun to bear on me murphy closed with her trapping the ghouls gun arm with her own and doing something with her left hand as she twisted her body at the hips her strong legs spread wide murphy was a faithful practitioner of aikido and she knew about grappling the tigress let out a shriek not a girly wowdoesthathurt shriek but the kind of furious almost whistling sound you expect from a bird of prey there was a snapping popping sound then a clap of thunder the roar of a discharged gun at close quarters the sudden sharp smell of burnt powder and the revolver went skittering free the ghoul stabbed the pruners at murphy but she was already on the way out grunting with effort her entire attack one circle that sent the tigress stumbling away into a stand of large potted ferns murphy spun to face the ghoul she took a shooting stance and snarled get on your face on the floor you are under arrest you have the right to remain silent the ghoul changed skin tore at the corners of her mouth as it dropped open and gaped nightmarishly wide canines lengthening as her lips peeled away from her teeth her shoulders jerked and twisted hunching up and growing wider at the same time her clothes stretching out while her body grew more hunched her fingers lengthened talons extending from the tips until her hands were spread as wide as the lawn rakes on a display behind her and a fetid smell of decay and worse flooded out murphys face went bloodless as she stared at the transformation if shed been dealing with an armed thug i think she would have been fine but the ghoul wasnt and she wasnt i saw the fear come surging up through her winding its way into her through the scars a maddened ghost had left on her spirit the year before panic hit her and her breath came in strangled gasps as a demon from a madmans nightmare clawed its way free of the bushes spread its talons and let out a rasping quivering hiss murphys gun started quivering the barrel jerking erratically left and right i struggled to get on my feet and back into the game but my ears still rang and the constant pressure of the mist slowed me down the tigress must have seen the terror that held murphy a cop eh the ghoul rasped drool foaming between its teeth dribbling down its chin it started slowly toward murphy claw tips dragging along the floor arent you going to tell me that i have the right to an attorney murphy let out a small terrified sound frozen in place her eyes wide it laughed at her such a big gun for a sweet girl you smell sweet it makes me hungry it continued forward laughter still kissing every word its distorted inhuman voice continuing in a steady murmur maybe i should let you arrest me wait until were in the car if you smell that good i wonder how good you taste i guess the ghoul shouldnt have laughed murphys eyes cleared and hardened the gun steadied and she said taste this bitch murphy started shooting the ghoul let out another shriek this one full of surprise and pain the bullets didnt drive her back thats for comic books and tv real bullets just rip through you like lead weights through cheesecloth no gaping bloody holes appeared in the ghouls chest but sudden flowers of scarlet sprayed out from her back covering the potted ferns with bloody dewdrops the ghoul threw her arms up and recoiled turning screaming and threw herself at the ferns murphy kept shooting the ghoul stumbled and dropped down amid the ferns still kicking and struggling wildly knocking pots over breaking others scattering vegetable matter and dirt all over the floor murphy kept shooting the gun clicked empty and the ghoul halfrolled onto her ruined back the stolen blue smock now ripped with huge holes and soaked through with blood the ghoul choked and gagged scarlet trickling out of her mouth she let out another hiss this one bubbling and held up her hands in supplication wait she rasped wait please you win i give up murphy ejected the clip put in a fresh one and worked the slide on the gun then she took a shooting stance again and sighted down the barrel her blue eyes calculating passionless merciless she didnt see the sudden shadow against the mist to her right huge and hulking backlit by emergency lights at the other end of the garden center i did and finally shoved my dazed self back to my feet murph i shouted to your right murphys head snapped around and she darted to her left even as a garden hoe swept down and shattered against the concrete where shed been standing the ghoul scrambled back through the ferns and vanished into the mist leaving blood smeared everywhere murphy backpedaled and shot at the form in the mist then ducked as another arm swept a shovel in a scything arc that just missed her head grum the ogre rolled forward out of the mist in his scarletskinned twelvefoottall hulking form a shovel clenched in one fist without slowing a step he scooped up a twentygallon ceramic pot and threw it at murphy like a snowball she scooted behind a stack of empty loading palettes and the pot exploded against them magic would be useless against the ogre i looked wildly around me then seized a jumbosized plastic bag of round tintedglass potting marbles hey i shouted tall red and ugly grums head spun around further than i would have thought possible with a neck that thick and his already beady eyes narrowed even more he let out a bellowing roar and turned toward me his huge feet slamming down on the concrete i tore open the bag and dumped it out toward him bluegreen marbles spread over the floor in a wave grums foot slammed down on several as he advanced and i hoped for the best grum continued toward me unslowed and when his great foot lifted i saw small circles of powdered glass on the ground i snarled a curse and ran deeper into the garden center grums footsteps heavy behind me i heard murphy shoot again a pair of shots and tried to keep a mental count of her rounds four in the new clip did she have another reload and how many rounds did that colt hold anyway a sharper more piercing report cracked through the arearifle fire murphys colt barked twice more and she called harry someones covering the exit with gunfire kinda busy here murph i shouted what the hell is that thing faerie i shouted grum was already trying to kill me so there was no point in being diplomatic its a big ugly faerie i started swiping things off of shelves to crash in the aisle behind me id gained some distance on grum but it could be that he just needed time to gather momentum i heard him snarl again and he took a swing with the shovel in his hand he was short of me but it whooshed loudly enough to make me flinch i looked wildly for something made of steel to throw at the ogre or to defend myself with the mist kept me from seeing more than a couple of yards ahead of me and from what i could see i was just heading deeper and deeper into the plantvending area the smell of summerheated greenery of fertilizer and mild rot filled my nose and mouth i rounded the end of the aisle and ducked through a narrow gate and out from under the canopy top that gave shade to this part of the garden center into a roofless area bounded by a high chainlink fence and filled with young trees and greenery standing in silent rows i looked around wildly for a way out into the parking lot at large and checked how close the ogre was flicking a glance back over my shoulder grum stopped at the gate to the fenced area and with a small smile on his lips swung the gate shut as i watched he covered his hand with a plastic trash bag and bent the latch like soft clay metal squealed and the gate fastened shut with no more effort than i would need to close a twisttie my heart fell down through my stomach and i looked around me the chainlink fence was at least nine feet high with a strand of barbed wire at the top meant to stop incursions of babytree nappers i guessed a second gate much bigger stood closedand the latch had been twisted exactly like the other warped closed it was a neat little trap and id been chased right into it dammit i said grum let out a grating laugh though i could barely see anything but his outline several yards away in the mist you lose wizard why are you doing this i demanded who the hell are you working for you got no guess grum said there was a note of casual arrogance to his voice gee thats too bad guess you go to your grave not knowing if i had a nickel for every time id heard that i muttered looking around me i had a few options none of them were good i could open a way into the nevernever and try to find my way through the spirit realm and back into the real world somewhere elsebut if i did that not only might i run into something even worse than i already had in front of me but if i got unlucky i might hit a patch of slower time and not emerge back into my chicago for hours even days i might also be able to melt myself a hole in the fence with conjured flame providing i didnt burn myself to a cinder doing it i didnt have my blasting rod with me and without it my control could be shaky enough to manage just that i could probably pile a bunch of baby trees loading palettes sacks of potting soil and so on against the outer wall of chainlink fence and climb out i might get cut up on the barbed wire but hell that would be better than staying here either way there was no time to waste standing around deciding i turned toward the nearest set of young trees picked up a couple and tossed them against the fence murphy im stuck but i think i can get clear get out of here now murphys voice floated to me directionless in the fog where are you hells bells murph get out her gun barked twice more not without you i threw more stuff on the pile im a big boy i can take care of myself i took a long step up onto the pile and tested my grip it was enough to let me reach the top i figured i could pull myself up and worry about the barbed wire when i got there i started climbing out i was looking at a faceful of barbed wire and pushing at the fence with my toes when i felt something wrap around my ankles i looked down and saw a branch wrapped around my legs i kicked at it irritably and then as i watched another branch lifted from the pile and joined the first then a third and a fourth the branches beneath my feet heaved and i suddenly found myself hauled up into the air swinging upside down from my heels it was an awkward vantage point but i watched as the trees and plants and soil id thrown into a pile surged and writhed together the young trees tangled their limbs together growing before my eyes as they did lengthening and growing thicker to become part of a larger whole other bits of greenery clumps of dirt and writhing vines and leaves joined the trees whipping through the air apparently of their own volition and adding to the mass of the thing that held me it took shape and stood up an enormous creature of vaguely human shape made all of earth and root and bough twin points of brilliant emeraldgreen light burning in its vinewrithing leafstrewn head it had to have been nine or ten feet tall and nearly that far across its legs were thicker than me and branches spread out above its head like vast horns against the background of luminous mind fog the creature lifted its head and screamed a sound of tortured wood and creaking limb and howling wind stars and stones harry i muttered my heart pounding when will you learn to keep your mouth shut chapter twenty murphy i screamed get clear the plant monsterno wait i couldnt possibly refer to that thing as a plant monster id be a laughingstock its hard to give a monster a cool name on the spur of the moment but i used a name id heard bob throw out before the chlorofiend lifted me up and shook me like a set of maracas i focused on my shield bracelet running my will bolstered by sudden fear through the focus my skin tingled as the shield formed around me and i shaped it into a full sphere i was barely in time the chlorofiend threw me at a post in the chainlink fence without the shield it would have broken my back i slammed into it feeling the energy of the shield tighten around me spreading the impact over the whole of my body instead of solely at the point of impact the shield transferred a portion of the kinetic energy of impact into heat and light while the rest came through as an abrupt pressure the result was like a sudden suit of ovenwarmed elastic closing on me and it felt about three sizes too small it knocked the wind out of my lungs azure and argent light flashed in a vague sphere around me i didnt bounce much just fell to the concrete the shield gave out a more feeble flash when i hit i got up off the ground and dodged away from the chlorofiend but it followed me slapping aside a stand of wooden tomato stakes with one leafy arm its glowing green eyes blazed as it came i ran up against the fence at the back end of the lot and the chlorofiends huge fist smashed down at me again i lifted my shield bracelet against it but the blow tossed me a dozen feet down the length of fence and into a set of huge steel partitioned shelves holding hundreds of fiftypound bags of mulch potting soil and fertilizer i lay there dazed for a second staring at an empty aisle display proclaiming in huge scarlet letters weedbgone only i clutched at the display and got to my feet again in time to duck under the chlorofiends fist as it punched at my head it hit one of the metal shelves instead of me and there was a shriek of warping metal a creaking yowl of pain from the fiend and a burst of sizzling smoke the creature drew its smoking fist back and screeched again eyes blazing even brighter angrier steel i muttered so youre a faerie somethingorother too i looked up at the enormous shelves as i ran down the length of them and a second later i heard the chlorofiend turn and begin pacing after me i started gathering in my will as i ran and i allowed the physical shield to fall leaving me only enough defense to keep the mist from blitzing my head i would need every bit of strength i could muster to pull off my sudden and desperate planand if it didnt work my shield wouldnt protect me for long in any case sooner or later the chlorofiend would batter its way through my defenses and pound me into plant food i pulled ahead of it but it started gaining momentum catching up to me as i reached the end of the row the end of the steel shelves i turned to face it hells bells that thing was big bigger than grum i could see through it in places where twists of branches and leaves were not too closely clumped with earth but that didnt make it seem any less massive or dangerous if this didnt work i wasnt going to last long enough to regret it most magic is pretty timeconsuming what with drawing circles and gathering energies and aligning forces quick and dirty magic evocation is drawn directly from a wizards will and turned loose without benefit of guide or limit its difficult and its dangerous i suck at evocation i only knew a couple that i could do reliably and even they required a focus such as my shield bracelet or blasting rod to be properly controlled but for doing big dumb things that require a lot of energy and not much finesse im usually fine i lifted my arms and the mist was stirred by a sudden rush of moving air the chlorofiend pounded closer and i closed my eyes pouring more energy out reaching for the wind vento i muttered feeling more power stir the chlorofiend bellowed again sending a jolt of fear through me and the winds rose even more vento vento ventas servitas power magic coursed through my outstretched arms and lashed out at the night the wind rose in a sudden roar a screaming cyclone that whirled into being just in front of me and then whirled out toward the heavy metal shelving the chlorofiend screamed again nearly drowned out by the windstorm id called only a few yards away the enormous heavy shelves loaded with tons of materials let out a groan of protest and then fell toppled over onto the chlorofiend with a deafening din that ripped at my ears and shook the concrete floor the chlorofiend was strong but it wasnt that strong it went down like a bush under a bulldozer shrieking again as the steel shelves crushed it and burned into its substance a foul greyish smoke rose from the wreckage and the chlorofiend continued to scream and thrash the shelves jerking and moving exhaustion swept over me with the effort of the spell and i glowered down at the fallen shelves down i panted but not out dammit i watched the shelves for a moment and decided that the chlorofiend probably wouldnt shrug it off for a few minutes i shook my head and headed for the gate into the enclosure hopefully grum hadnt twisted things up so badly that i couldnt get out he had the metal latch on the gate had been pinched into a mess by his talons they had scored the metal in sharp notches like an industrial cutter note to self dont think steel can stop grums fingernails i checked above and decided to risk climbing the fence and getting through the barbed wire i had gotten maybe halfway up the chainlink fence when murphy limped out of the mist on the other side her gun pointed right at me whoa whoa murph i said i showed her my hands and promptly fell off the fence its me she lowered the gun and let out her breath christ harry what are you doing texas cage match i won from behind me the chlorofiend let out another shriek and the shelving groaned as it shifted i gulped and looked back rematch doesnt look promising though where have you been she rolled her eyes shopping wheres grum and the ghoul dont know the ghouls blood trail went out but someone shot at me when i followed it havent seen the ogre she blinked at the gates latch damn guess he shut you in here huh pretty much you get shot no why youre limping murphy grimaced yeah one of those bastards must have thrown a bunch of marbles on the floor i slipped on one its my knee oh i said uh murphy blinked at me you did that well it was a plan at the time harry thats not a plan its a looney tune kill me later help me out of here now i squinted up at the barbed wire maybe if you get a rake you can push it up for me so that i can slide between it and the fence were twenty feet from the hardware department genius murphy said she limped back into the mist and returned half a minute later carrying a pair of bolt cutters she cut a slit in the chain link fence and i squeezed through it while the chlorofiend thrashed still pinned i could kiss you i said murphy grinned you smell like manure harry the smile faded what now the trapped monsters thrashing sent several smaller shelves toppling over and i rubbernecked nervously getting out is still first priority that thing is down but itll be coming before long what is it chlorofiend i said a what plant monster oh right we need to get out murphy shook her head whoever was covering the exit out front can probably see the other doors too a silhouette in a doorway is a great target its just like a shooting range how the blazes did they see you through the mist is that really important right now they can and it means we cant go out the front yeah i said youre right the main exits are covered that thing is in the garden center and ten to one ogre grum is watching the back ogre check whats his deal bullets bounce off him and he shakes off magic like a duck does water hes strong and pretty quick and smarter than he looks murphy let out a soft curse you cant blast him like you did the loupgarou i shook my head i gave him a hard shot once already i may as well have been spitting on him doesnt look like we have much choice for getting out and even if we do grum or that plant thing could run us down so well need wheels we have to go through one of them i know i said and headed back into the store where are you going murphy demanded i have a plan she limped after me better than the looney tune one i hope i grunted in reply no need to agree with her we both realized that if this plan wasnt better than the last one then as porky pig would say thats all folks chapter twentyone three minutes later murphy and i went out the back door and grum was waiting for us he rose up out of the shadows by the large trash bins with a bull elephants bellow and stomped toward us murphy dragging a leg and wrapped somewhat desperately in a plaid auto blanket let out a shrill cry and turned to run but tripped and fell to the ground before the ogre i kept my left hand behind my back and lifted my right flame danced up from my cupped fingers and i thundered grum the ogres beady eyes turned to me glittering he let out another rumbling snarl stand thee from my path i called in that same overdramatic voice lest i grow weary of thee and bereft thee of thy life the ogre focused wholly on me now striding forward past the whimpering form of murphy i do not fear thy power mortal he snarled i lifted my chin and waved my fireholding hand around a bit this is thy last warning faerie dog grums beady eyes grew angrier he let out a harsh laugh and did not slow down feeble mortal trickster thy spellfire means nothing to me do thy worst behind grum murphy threw the auto blanket off of her shoulders and with one rip of the starting cord fired up her shiny new coleman chain saw she engaged the blade with a hissing whirr of air and without preamble swung it in an arc that ended precisely at the back of grums thick hairy knee the steel blade chewed through the ogres hide as if it was made of styrofoam blood and bits of meat flew up in a gruesome cloud the ogre screamed his body contorting in agony the scarlet skin around the injury immediately swelled darkening to black and tendrils of infectiouslooking darkness spread from the wound up over the ogres leg and hip within the space of a breath he swept one huge fist at murphy but she was already getting out of his reach the ogres weight came down on the injured leg and grum fell to earth with a heavy thud i started forward to help but everything was happening fast and my movements felt nightmarishly slow the ogre rolled to his belly at once maddened at the touch of the iron in the chain saws blade and started dragging himself toward murphy faster than i would have believed with just his arms talons gouging into the concrete she hurried away from him limping but grum slammed one fist down on the concrete so hard that half a dozen feet away she was jarred off balance and fell grum got hold of murphys foot and started dragging her back toward him she let out a hollow gasp then twisted and wriggled she slipped out of her sneaker and hauled herself away from the ogre her face gone white and drawn i ran up behind grum pulling my left hand out from behind my back the fingers of my right hand still curled around the flickering flame id shown the ogre a large yellowandgreen pumppressure water gun sloshed a little in my left fist i lowered it and squeezed the trigger a stream of gasoline sprayed out all over grums back soaking the ogres skin grum whirled toward me halfway through and i shot the gasoline into his eyes and nose eliciting another scream he bared his fangs and glared at me through eyes swollen almost shut wizard he said hardly understandable through the fangs and the drool your spellflame will not stop me i turned my right hand slowly and showed grum the burning can of sterno id been palming good thing ive got this plain old vanilla fire then huh and i tossed the lit can of sterno onto the gasolinesoaked ogre hamstrung and blazing like a birthday candle grum screamed and thrashed i skipped back and around him helping murphy up to her feet as the ogre slammed himself against the ground and then against the back wall of the walmart he did that in a frenzy for maybe twenty seconds before uttering an odd ululating cry and hurling himself at a deep shadow behind a trash binand vanished the light from the flames simply disappearing murphy got up only with my help her face pale with pain she could put no weight at all on her wounded leg what happened we whipped him i said he packed up and headed back to faerie for good i shook my head for now hows your leg hurts think i broke something i can hop on the other one lean on me i said we went a few paces and she swayed dangerously i caught her before she toppled murph sorry sorry she gasped hopping bad idea i helped her back down to the ground look stay here against the wall ill get the beetle and pull it around here to you murphy was in enough pain to keep her from arguing she did draw her gun switch the safety on and offer it to me i shook my head keep it you might need it dresden murphy said my gun has been about as useful as fabric softener in a steel mill tonight but someone out there has a rifle if theyre using one its because theyre a human and you dont have most of your magic stuff with you take the gun she was right but i argued anyway i cant leave you defenseless murph murphy hauled up the leg of her jeans and pulled a tiny automatic from an ankle holster she worked the slide checked the safety and said im covered i took the colt checked the chamber and the safety more or less by reflex thats a cute little gun there murph she scowled at me i have small ankles its the only one i can hide there i chanted teasing murphys got a girl gun murphys got a girl gun murphy glowered at me and hauled the chain saw to within easy reach come a little closer and say that i snorted at her give me a couple minutes i said ill tell you its me some of these bad guys can play dress upso if you arent sure who it is murphy nodded pale and resolved and rested her hand on the gun i drew a deep breath and walked through the mist around the side of the building and toward the front parking lot i kept close to the wall and moved as quietly as i could listening as i went i gathered up energy for the shield bracelet and held my left hand ready i held the gun in my right holding a pair of defenses focused around my left hand i would have to do all my shooting with my right im not a very good shot even when i can use both hands so i just had to hope that no sharpshooting would be required i got to the front of the building before i heard something click in the fenced area of the garden center i swallowed and pointed the colt at it noting that i wasnt sure how many rounds the gun had left as i came closer through the mist i saw the chain fence around the ruined area where id been trapped with the chlorofiend it had been torn down in a swath ten feet wide and from what i could see of the inside the treething wasnt there anymore great i took a few steps closer to the break in the fence to stare at the ruined chain link id expected bent and stretched wire still hot enough to burn where it had torn instead i found edges cut off as neatly as with a set of clippers and coated with frost i checked around on the ground and found sections of wire none of them longer than two or three inches steam curled up from them and the cold in the air near the fence made me shiver the fence had been frozen chilled until the steel had become brittle and then shattered winter i muttered i guess that wasnt much of a stretch i swept my eyes around through the mist left my ears open and paced as quietly as i could toward the dim flickering lights that lay somewhere ahead in the parking lot id parked the beetle in an aisle almost even with the front doors but i didnt have a reference point through the mist i just headed out picked the first row of cars and started prowling silently along them looking for the beetle my car wasnt in the first row but a thin stream of some kind of yellowish fluid was i traced it to the next row and found the beetle sitting there in its motley colors another leak they werent exactly unheard of in a wizards car but this would be a hell of a time for the beetle to get hospitalized i got in and set the gun down long enough to shove my keys in the ignition my trusty steed wheezed and groaned a few times but the engine turned over with an apologetic cough and the car rattled to life i put it in gear pulled through the empty space in front of me and headed for the back of the building to get murphy i had just passed the garden center with its ruined fence when my windows abruptly frosted over it happened in the space of a breath ice crystals forming and growing like plants on a stopmotion film until my view was completely cut off the temperature dropped maybe fifty degrees and the car sputtered if i hadnt given it a bunch of gas it would have stalled the beetle lurched forward and i rolled down the window sticking my head out the side in an effort to see what was going on the chlorofiend loomed up out of the mist and brought one huge knobby fist down on the beetle like an organic wrecking ball the force of it crumpled the hood like tin foil and drove the shocks down so that the frame smushed up against the tires the impact threw me forward against the steering wheel and drove the breath out of me with a shock of pain the impact would have rolled any car with an engine under the hood most of the mass of the car would have been driven down the lighter rear end would have flipped up and me without my seat belt would have been bounced around like a piece of popcorn the old volkswagens though have their engine in the back most of the weight of the car got bounced up a little in the air then came back down to the ground with a jolt i slammed my foot on the gas harder and the beetles engine sputtered gamely in response as big and strong as the chlorofiend might be it wasnt solid and it wasnt as heavy as a living mass of the same size the beetle bounced up from the blow that had crumpled the empty storage compartment under the hood and slammed into the chlorofiend without losing much of its momentum the beast let out a shriek of what might have been surprise and was definitely pain my car hammered into it with a flickering of scarlet static and a cloud of smoke from the substance of the faerie creature swept under its legs and drove the chlorofiend atop its hood i kept my foot on the gas held the wheel as steadily as i could with one hand and stuck my head out the window so i could see the chlorofiend screamed again the magic around it gathering in a cloud that made the hairs on my neck stand up but the beetle rattled through the attempt to hex it down carrying the chlorofiend the length of the walmart garden center and to the back of the building think of it as payback for all those telephone poles i muttered to the beetle and slammed on the brakes the chlorofiend rolled off of my car skidded on the asphalt and slammed into the side of a metal trash bin with a yowl of pain and an exploding cloud of dirt clods only one of my headlights appeared to have survived the attack and even it flickered woozily through the mist and the cloud of dust and dirt rising from the chlorofiend i slammed the car into reverse backed up a few more feet then put it back into neutral i raced the engine then popped the clutch and sent the beetle hurtling at the monster i braced myself for the impact this time and pulled my head in before i hit the impact felt violent shockingly loud and viscerally satisfying the chlorofiend let out a brokensounding creak but until i backed the car up and whipped the wheel around so that i could see out the side window i couldnt tell what had happened id torn the thing in half at about the middle pinching it between the battered frostcoated beetle and the metal trash bin thank the stars it hadnt been a fiberglas job the legs lay against the trash bin now only a pile of twisted saplings and earth while the arms flailed toward me a dozen long paces away uselessly pounding the asphalt i spat out my window put the car into gear again and went to get murphy i jumped out of the car and had to wrench the passenger door hard to get it to open murphy pushed herself up using the wall for support and stared at the frostcovered beetle with wide eyes what the hell happened the plant monster a plant monster and frosty the snowman i got on her wounded side to support her i took care of it lets go murphy let out another small sound of pain but she didnt let it stop her from hobbling along toward the car i was just about to help her in when she shouted harry and threw her weight against me the chlorofiend the upper half had somehow clawed its way out of the mist and one long viny limb was reaching for me i fell back away from it and tried to shield murphy with my body it got me i felt fingers the size of young tree trunks wrap around my throat and jerk me away from murphy like i was a puppy more branchfingers got one of my thighs and i felt myself suspended in the air and pulled slowly apart meddler hissed an alien voice from somewhere near the chlorofiends glowing green eyes you should never have involved yourself in these affairs you have no concept of what is at stake die for your arrogance i tried for a witty riposte but my vision blacked out and my head felt like it was trapped in a slowly tightening vise i tried gathering forces attempting to push them through my shield bracelet but the moment i did there was a rustle of wood and leaves and the bracelet snapped off of my wrist broken i tried to gather another spelland realized as i did that my concentration had wavered too much and that my defense against the insidious enchantment of the mist had begun to fail my thoughts broke apart into irregular pieces and i struggled to reach for them and put them together again as the pressure on my body increased became a redhot agony i only dimly heard the chain saw start up again and murphys scream of challenge the charm she wore wasnt relying on my concentration it wouldnt last long but it would keep the mist away from her for a few more minutes the chlorofiend let out a shriek and i heard the saw biting into wood felt wood chips hitting my face i tumbled free sapling branches tangled all around my head and shoulders leaves and dirt scratching my face my leg was still in the chlorofiends grip but i could breathe again the mist pressed close to me giving me a sense of detachment and disinterest it was hard to make any sense of what happened next murphy hopped closer her weight on the one leg and swept the chain saw through the chlorofiends other arm i fell to the ground more inert tree parts around me the chlorofiend waved its arms at murphy but they didnt have the crippling force id seen it use before they merely jostled her and knocked her down murphy snarled crawling on her hands and knees dragging the chain saw with her she lifted it again and drove it at the creatures head engine racing blade singing through the air the chlorofiend screamed in protest and frustration lifting the stumps hah hah get it stumps of its arms in feeble defense murphy tore through them with the chain saw snickersnack and then drove the blade directly between the chlorofiends glowing green eyes the monster shrieked again writhing but its arms never managed to do more than shove murphy around a bit then it let out a final groan and the eyes winked out murphy suddenly sat atop a mound of dirt and leaves and gnarled branches i lay there staring stupidly at her then heard a gunshot the sharp cracking report of a rifle murphy threw herself down and rolled toward me a second shot rang out and a puff of leaves a foot to murphys right leapt into the air another sound cut through the nightpolice sirens getting closer murphy dragged me and herself over the ground toward the car i heard a harsh curse somewhere in the mist and then a pair of footsteps retreating a moment later i thought the mist was starting to thin out harry murphy said shaking me i blinked at her and the relief showed in her worried expression harry can you hear me i nodded my mouth felt dry and my body ached i fought to clear my head get us in the car she said enunciating the words get us in the car and get us out of here the car right i hauled murphy into the beetle got in myself and stared at the frosted windshield the heat of the summer night was already melting the frost away and i could see through it in spots harry murphy said exasperated her voice thin and shaky drive oh right drive get out i put the beetle in gear more or less and we lurched out of the parking lot and out of the mist chapter twentytwo youre kidding billy said his voice touched with disbelief a chain saw where did you get the gasoline murphy looked up from her wounded leg and the willowy georgia who had cut her jeans away and was cleaning out the long gashes shed acquired from ankle to mid calf gas generator backup power supply for all the food freezers they had a tengallon plastic jug of it billys apartment was not a large one and with a dozen people in it even with the airconditioning running full blast it was too hot and too crowded the alphas billys werewolf accomplices were out in force wed been challenged by a tall thin young man in the parking lot and shadowed to the door by a pair of wolves who kept just far enough away to make it difficult to see them in the shadows when id first seen them the alphas had been a collection of misfits with bad hair acne and wannabe tough guy leather outfits in the year and a half since theyd changed none of them had that pale look anymore none of them looked wheezy and like billy the kids whod been carrying baby fat had swapped it for lean fit muscle they hadnt become a gang of hollywood soap opera stars or anything but they looked more relaxed more confident more happyand i saw some scars some of them quite vicious showing on bare limbs most of the kids wore sweats or those pullover knit dresses garments that could be gotten out of in a hurry pizza boxes were stacked three deep on the table and a cooler of soft drinks sat on the floor nearby i piled a plate with halfwarm pizza picked up a coke and found a comparatively empty stretch of wall to lean against billy shook his head and said look harry some of this doesnt make sense i mean if they could really run around doing this mind fog thing shouldnt we have heard about it by now i snorted and said around a mouthful of pizza its pretty rare even in my circles no one who got hit with it will remember it check the paper tomorrow ten to one emergency services showed up after we left put out the fires pulled a bunch of confused people out of the building and the official explanation is a leaky gas line billy snorted that doesnt make any sense theres not going to be evidence of an exploding line no leak is going to show up at the gas company no continuing fire of leaking gas i kept eating get real billy i said you think people are going to be taken seriously by city hall if they tell them we really dont know what messed up all these people we dont know what caused all the damage we dont know why no one heard or saw anything and we dont know what the reports of gunshots at the scene were about hell no people would be accused of incompetence publicly embarrassed fired no one wants that so gas leak but its stupid its life the last thing the twentyfirst century wants to admit is that it might not know everything i popped open the coke and guzzled some hows the leg murph it hurts murphy reported considerately leaving out the implied you idiot georgia stood up from attending murphys leg and shook her head she was nearly a foot taller than billy and had bound her blond hair back into a tight braid it emphasized the gauntness of her features the cuts and bruises are nothing major but your knee could be seriously damaged you should have it checked out by a real doctor lieutenant murphy karrin murphy said anyone who mops up my blood can call me karrin i tossed murphy a coke she caught it and said except you dresden any diet i put several slices of pizza on a paper plate and passed them over live a little all right karrin georgia said folding her arms if you dont want a twentyfivethousanddollar surgery along with seven or eight months of rehab we need to get you to the hospital murphy frowned then nodded and said let me eat something first im starving ill get the car georgia said she turned to billy make sure she doesnt put any weight on her leg when you bring her down keep it straight if you can got it billy said phil greg get that blanket well make a litter out of it im not an infant murphy said i put my hand on her shoulder easy i said in a quiet voice they can handle themselves so can i youre hurt murph i said if you were one of your people youd be telling you to shut up and stop being part of the problem murphy shot me a glower but its edge was blunted by the big mouthful of pizza she took yeah i know i just hate being sidelined i grunted what are you going to do she asked i shook my head finish this coke i havent planned much past that she sighed all right harry look ill be home in a few hours ill keep digging see if i can turn up anything about lloyd slate if you need information on anything else get in touch you should rest i told her she grimaced at her leg her knee was swollen to a couple of times its normal size looks like im going to have plenty of time for that i grunted again and looked away hey harry murphy said when i didnt look at her she continued what happened to me wasnt your fault i knew the risks and i took them you shouldnt have had to no one should we live in an imperfect world dresden in case that hasnt yet become obvious enough for you she nudged my leg with her elbow besides you were lucky i was there the way i count it im the one who put on the boots a smile threatened my expression you did what put on the boots murphy said i put on the boots and kicked some monster ass i dropped the ghoul and im the one who rammed a chain saw through the head of that plant monster thing crippled the ogre too what did you do you threw a can of sterno at him thats barely an assist yeah but i soaked him in gasoline first she snorted at me around more pizza shutout whatever murphy three dresden zero you didnt do all of it i put on the boots i raised my hands okay okay youve got boots murph she sniffed and took an almost dainty sip of coke lucky i was there i squeezed her shoulder and said with no particular inflection yes thank you murphy smiled up at me from the window one of the alphas reported cars ready billy and a couple more laid out a blanket and then carefully lifted murphy onto it she tolerated them with a roll of her eyes but hissed with discomfort even at the gentle motion call she said will watch your back harry then they carried her out i picked up some more pizza exchanged some more or less polite chitchat with some of the alphas and made my escape from the crowded living room of the apartment to the balcony i shut the sliding glass door behind me only one light in the parking lot provided any illumination so the balcony was mostly covered in sheltering shadows the night was a close one humidity cooking along at a lazy summer broil but even so it felt less claustrophobic than the crowded apartment i watched billy and the alphas load murphy into a minivan and drive off then there was as much silence as you ever get in chicago the hiss of tires on asphalt was a constant liquid background punctuated with occasional sirens horns mechanical squeaks and squeals and the buzzing of one lost locust that must have been perched on a building nearby i put my paper plate on the wooden balcony railing closed my eyes and took a deep breath trying to clear my head penny for your thoughts said a quiet female voice i nearly jumped off the balcony in sheer reaction my hand brushed the paper plate and the pizza fell to the parking lot below i whirled around and found meryl sitting in a chair at the other side of the balcony deep in shadows her large form nothing more than a more solid piece of darknessbut her eyes gleamed in the halflight reflecting traces of red she watched the plate fall and then said sorry sokay i said just a little nervous tonight she nodded i was listening i nodded back to her and returned to looking at nothing listening to night sounds after a while she asked me does it hurt i waved my bandaged hand idly sort of not that she said i meant watching your friend get hurt some of my racing thoughts coalesced into irritated anger what kind of question is that a simple one i took an angry hit from my can of coke of course it hurts youre different than i thought youd be i squinted over my shoulder at her they tell stories about you mister dresden its all a lie her teeth gleamed not all of them are bad mostly good or mostly bad depends on whos talking the sidhe crowd thinks youre an interesting mortal pet of mabs the vampire wannabe crowd thinks youre some kind of psychotic vigilante with a penchant for vengeance and mayhem sort of a oneman spanish inquisition most of the magical crowd thinks youre distant dangerous but smart and honorable crooks think youre a hit man for the outfit or maybe one of the families back east straights think youre a fraud trying to bilk people out of their hardwon cash except for larry fowler who probably wants you on the show again i regarded her frowning and what do you think i think you need a haircut she lifted a can to her mouth and i caught a whiff of beer bill called all the morgues and hospitals no jane doe with green hair didnt figure there would be i talked to aurora she seemed concerned she would shes everyones big sister thinks she needs to take care of the whole world she didnt know anything meryl shook her head and was quiet for a while before she asked whats it like being a wizard i shrugged mostly its like being a watch fob repairman its both difficult and not in demand the rest of the time more emotion rose in me threatening my selfcontrol meryl waited the rest of the time i picked up its scary as hell you start learning the kinds of things that go bump in the night and you figure out that ignorance is bliss is more than just a quotable quote and its i clenched my hands its so damned frustrating you see people getting hurt innocents friends i try to make a difference but i usually dont know what the hell is going on until someone is already dead doesnt matter what kind of job i doi cant help those folks sounds hard meryl said i shrugged i guess it isnt any different than what anyone else goes through the names just get changed i finished off the coke and stomped the dead soldier flat what about you whats it like being a changeling meryl rolled the beer can between her broad hands about like anyone until you hit puberty then you start feeling things what kinds of things different depending on your sidhe half for me it was anger hunger i gained a lot of weight i kept losing my temper over the most idiotic things she took a drink and strength i grew up on a farm my older brother rolled a tractor and it pinned him broke his hip and caught on fire i picked it up and threw it off him then dragged him back to the house more than a mile i was twelve my hair had turned this color by the next morning troll i said quietly she nodded yeah i dont know the details about what happened but yeah and every time i let those feelings get loose the more i lost my temper and used my strength the bigger and stronger i got and the worse i felt about what i did she shook her head sometimes i think it would be easier to just choose the sidhe half to stop being human stop hurting if it wasnt for the others needing me it would turn you into a monster but a happy monster she finished her beer i should go check on fixhes sleeping nowand try to call ace what are you going to do try to add up some facts meet some contacts interview more queens maybe get a haircut her teeth showed again in a smile and she rose good luck she went back into the noisy apartment and shut the door i closed my eyes and tried to think whoever had sent the tigress grum the chlorofiend and the lone gunman after me had been trying to kill me it was a reasonable assumption then that i was on the right track generally speaking the bad guys dont try to bump off an investigator unless theyre worried hes actually about to find something but if that was true then why had the tigress taken a shot at me the day before id gotten the case she could have been working for the red court and taken a new contract that just happened to be me but it didnt sound likely if the ghoul had been on the same contract it meant that id been judged a threat to the killers plans from day one if not sooner the frost on my cars windows had probably been the doing of someone from winter i mean a wizard could do the same thing but as devastating spells go that one seemed to be kinda limited the ghoul presumably would work for anyone who paid the chlorofiend though i hadnt expected it to talk or to be intelligent the more i thought about the plant monster the more things didnt add up it had picked a spot and had its allies herd me to it that wasnt the behavior of your average thug even of the magical variety it had a sense of personal conflict about it as if the chlorofiend had a particular bone to pick with me and how the hell had murphy killed it it was stronger than your average bulldozer for crying out loud it had socked me once when i had my full shield going and it still hurt it had clipped me a couple of times and nearly broken bones the chlorofiend should have flattened murphy into a puddle of slurry it had hit her at least a dozen times yet it seemed like it had only tapped her as though unable to risk doing more damage then a lightbulb flashed on somewhere in my musty brain the chlorofiend hadnt been a being as such it had been a constructa magical vessel for an outside awareness an awareness both intelligent and commanding but one who could not for some reason kill murphy when she attacked it why because harry you idiot murphy isnt attached to either of the faerie courts i told myself out loud whats that got to do with it i asked myself again out loud and people think im crazy remember the queens cant kill anyone who isnt attached to the courts through birthright or bargain she couldnt kill murphy neither could the construct she was guiding damn i muttered youre right a queen seemed reasonable thenprobably from winter or more realistically the frosted windshield could have been a decoy either way i couldnt figure who would have had a reason to come after me with something as elaborate as a mind fog and a veritable army of assassins which reminded me the mind fog had to have come from somewhere i wasnt sure if the queens could have managed something like that outside of faerie if they couldnt it meant that the killer had a hired gun someone who could pull off a delicate and dangerous spell like that i started running down that line of thought but only a moment later the wind picked up into a stiff whistling breeze that roared through the air and swept down through the city i frowned at the sudden shift in the weather and looked around i didnt find anything obvious but when i glanced up i saw the lights going out a vast cloud bank was racing north fast enough that i could see it eating the stars a second wall of clouds was sailing south toward the first bank they met in only moments and as they did light flashed from cloud to cloud brighter than daylight and thunder shook the balcony beneath my feet not long after that a drop of freezingcold water landed on my head quickly followed by a mounting torrent of chilly rain the stillrising wind whipped it into a miserable downpour i turned and pulled open the door into the apartment with a frown the alphas were peering out windows speaking quietly with one another across the room billy finished messing around with a television and a rather rumpledlooking weatherman appeared the image flickering with interference lines and bursts of snow guys guys billy said hush let me listen he turned up the volume a truly unprecedented event an enormous arctic blast that came charging like a freight train through canada and across lake michigan to chicagoland and if that wasnt enough a tropical front settled quietly in the gulf of mexico has responded in kind rushing up the mississippi river in a sudden heat wave theyve met right over lake michigan and we have received several reports of rain and bursts of hail thunderstorm warnings have been issued all through the lake michigan area and a tornado watch is in progress for the next hour in cook country national weather service has also issued a flash flood warning and a travel advisory for the eastern half of illinois this is some beautiful but very violent weather ladies and gentlemen and we urge you to remain in shelter until this storm has time to billy turned the volume down i looked around the room and found nearly a dozen sets of eyes focused on me patient and trusting bah harry billy said at last that isnt a natural storm is it i shook my head got another coke out of the cooler and headed tiredly for the door side effect like the toads what does it mean i opened the door and said without looking back it means were running out of time chapter twentythree i took the beetle a ways north of town keeping to the lake shore rain sheeted down and lightning made the clouds dance with shadow and flame maybe ten miles from the center of town the downpour eased up and the air became noticeably colderenough so that in jeans and a tee i was shivering i pulled the car off sheridan road a couple miles north of northwestern university out toward winnetka set the parking brake and locked it up and trudged toward the shore of the lake it was a dark night but i called no lights to guide me and i didnt carry a flashlight it took my eyes a while but i finally managed to start making out shapes in the darkness and found my way through the light woods around this part of the lake shore to a long naked promontory of rock thrusting itself a dozen yards into the water i walked to the end of the stone and stood there for a moment listening to the thunder rolling over the lake the wind stirring the water into waves nearly like those of the sea the air itself felt restless charged with violence and the light rain that still fell was uncomfortably cold i closed my eyes pulling together energy from the elements around me where water met stone air met water stone met air and drawing as well from my own determination the power coursed into me dancing and seething with a quivering life of its own i focused it with my thoughts shaped it and then opened my eyes and lifted my arms wrists out so that the old pale round scars on either side of the big blue veins there felt the rain falling on them i pushed out the power id gathered and called into the thunder and rain godmother vente leanansidhe a sudden presence appeared beside me and a womans voice said honestly child it isnt as though im far away theres no reason to shout i jerked in surprise and nearly fell into the lake i turned to my left to face my faerie godmother who stood calmly upon the surface of the water bobbing up and down a bit as waves passed under her feet lea stood nearly my own height but instead of dark contrasts and harsh angles she was a creature of gliding curves and gentle shades hair the color of flame coursed in curls and ringlets to below her hips and tonight she wore with it a gown of flowing emerald silk laced through with veins of ochre and aquamarine a belt made from a twisted braid of silken threads of gold wound around her waist and a darkhandled knife rested on a slant at her hip through a loop in the belt she was one of the high sidhe and her beauty went without saying the perfection of her form was complemented by features of feminine loveliness a full mouth skin like cream and oblong feline eyes of gold catslitted like those of most fae she took in my surprise with a certain reserved mirth her mouth set with a tiny smile good evening godmother i said trying for a proper degree of politeness you look lovely as the stars tonight she let out a pleased sigh such a flatterer im already enjoying this conversation so much more than the last im not dying this time i said the smile faded that is a matter of opinion she responded you are in great danger child thinking about it i realize i generally have been whenever you were around she clucked reprovingly nonsense ive never had anything but your best interests at heart i barked out a harsh laugh my best interests thats rich lea arched a brow what reason have you to think otherwise for starters because you tricked me out of a big evil slaying magic sword and sold me to mab tut lea said the sword was just business child and as for selling your debt to mab i had no choice in the matter yeah right she arched her brows you should know better dear godchild you know i cannot speak what is untrue during our last encounter i returned to faerie with great power and upset vital balances those balances had to be redressed and your debt was the mechanism that the queen chose to employ i frowned at her for a minute returned with great power my eyes fell to the knife at her waist that thing the vampires gave you she rested her fingers lightly on the knifes hilt dont cheapen it this athame was no creation of theirs and it was less a gift than a trade amoracchius and that thing are in the same league is that what youre saying gulp my faerie godmother was dangerous enough without a bigtime artifact of magic what is it not what but whose lea corrected me and in any case you may be assured that surrendering my claim on you to mab was in no way an attempt to do you harm i have never meant you lasting ill i scowled at her you tried to turn me into one of your hounds and keep me in a kennel godmother youd have been perfectly safe there she pointed out and very happy i only wanted what was best for you because i care for you child my stomach did a neat little rollover and i swallowed yeah uh its very you i guess in a demented insane way i can understand that lea smiled i knew you would to business then why have you called to me this night i took a deep breath and braced myself a little look i know we havent gotten along really well lately or ever and i dont have a lot to trade with but i had hoped youd be willing to work out a bargain with me she arched a redgold brow to what ends i need to speak to them i said to mab and titania her expression grew distant pensive you must understand that i cannot protect you from them should they strike at you my power has grown poppet but not to those heights i understand but if i dont get to the bottom of this and find the killer im as good as dead so i have heard my godmother said she lifted her right hand and extended it to me then give me your hand i need my hand godmother both of them she let out a peal of laughter no silly child simply put your hand in mine i will convey you i gave her a sidelong look and asked warily at what price none none you never do anything without a price she rolled her eyes and clarified none to you child who then no one you know or knew lea said an intuition hit me my mother thats who youre talking about lea left her hand extended she smiled but only said perhaps i regarded her hand quietly for a moment then said im not sure i can believe that youre really going to protect me but i already have i folded my arms when if you will remember that night in the boneyard i healed a wound to your head that may well have killed you you only did it to sucker me into getting you the sword leas tone became wounded not only for that and if you consider further i also freed you of a crippling binding and rescued you from a blazing inferno not twentyfour hours later you charged my girlfriend all her memories of me to do it and you only saved me from the fire so that you could put me in a doghouse that does not change the fact that i was after all protecting you i stared at her in frustration for a minute and then scowled what have you done for me lately lea closed her eyes for a moment then opened her mouth and spoke her voice came out aged and querulous whats all that racket i have already called the police i have you fruits get out of our hall or theyll lock you away i blinked reuels apartment that was you obviously child and at the market earlier this eve she lifted her hand in the air made an intricate motion with long pale fingers and opened her mouth again as if singing a note of music instead the sound of police sirens emerged somewhat muted and indistinguishable from the real thing i shook my head i dont get it she moved her fingers again and the sirens blended into another silversweet laugh her expression amused almost fond i am sure you do not poppet she offered her hand again come time is pressing she had that part right at least and i knew she was telling me the truth her words had left her little room for evasion id never gotten anything but burned when making deals with the faeries and if lea was offering to help me for free there had to be a catch somewhere leas expression told me that she either knew what id been thinking or knew me well enough to guess and she laughed again harry harry she said if it is of any consequence to you remember that our bargain is still in effect i am bound to do you no harm for several weeks more id forgotten about that of course i couldnt fully trust to that either even if she had sworn to do me no harm if i asked her to take me somewhere she could drop me off in a forest full of unseelie nasties without breaking her word shed done something very similar to me last year thunder rumbled again and the light flared even more brightly in the clouds tick tick tick the clock was running and i wasnt going to get anything done standing here waffling either i trusted myself to my godmother or i went back home and waited for something to come along and squash me going with lea wasnt the best way to get what i wantedit was just the only way i took a breath and took her hand her skin felt like cool silk untouched by the rain all right and after them i need to see the mothers lea gave me an oblique glance and said survive the flood before hurling yourself into the fire child close your eyes why annoyance flickered over her eyebrows child stop wasting time with questions you have given me your hand close your eyes i muttered a curse to myself and did it my godmother spoke something a string of liquid syllables in a tongue i could not understandbut it made my knees turn rubbery and my fingers suddenly feel weak a wave of disorientation dizzying but not unpleasantly so scrambled my sense of direction i felt a breeze on my face a sense of movement but i couldnt have said whether i was falling or rising or moving forward the movement stopped and the whirling sensations passed thunder rumbled again very loudly and the surface i stood on shook with it light played against my closed eyelids we are here lea said her voice hushed i opened my eyes i stood on a solid surface among grey and drifting mist the mist covered whatever ground i was on and though i poked at it with my foot i couldnt tell if it was earth wood or concrete the landscape around me rolled in hills and shallow valleys all of it covered in ground fog i frowned up at the skies they were clear stars glittered impossibly bright against the velvet curtain of night sparkling in dozens of colors instead of in the usual pale silver jewels against the blackness of the void thunder rumbled again and the ground shook beneath the mist lightning flashed along with it and the ground all around us lit with a sudden angry blue fire that slowly faded away the truth dawned on me slowly i pushed my foot at the ground again and then in a circle around me were i choked were on were on the clouds my godmother said nodding or so it would seem to you we are no longer in the mortal world the nevernever then faerie she shook her head and spoke her voice still hushed almost reverent no this is the world between the sometimes place where chicago and faerie meet overlap chicagooverchicago if you will this is the place the queens call forth when the sidhe desire to spill blood they call it forth i asked in a quiet voice they create it even so lea said her voice similarly low they prepare for war i turned slowly taking it in we stood on a rise of ground in a broad shallow valley i could make out what looked like a mistshrouded lake shore not far away a river cut through the cloudscape wait a minute i said this is familiar chicagooverchicago she had said i started adding in mental images of buildings streets lights cars people this is chicago the land a model of it lea agreed crafted from clouds and mist i kept turning and found behind me a stone grey and ominous and enormous startlingly solid amid all the drifting white i took a step back from it and saw the shape of ita table made of a massive slab of rock the legs made of more stones as thick as the pillars at stonehenge writing writhed across the surface of the stone runes that looked a little familiar norse maybe some of them looked more like egyptian they seemed to take something from several different sources leaving them unreadable lightning flashed again through the ground and a wave of bluewhite light flooded over the table through the runes lighting them like las vegas neon for a moment ive heard of this i said after a moment a long time ago ebenezar called it the stone table yes my godmother whispered blood is power child blood spilled upon that stone forever becomes a part of who holds it who holds it she nodded her green eyes luminous for half of the year the table lies within winter for half within summer it changes hands i said understanding midsummer and midwinter yes summer holds the table now but not for much longer i stepped toward the table and extended a hand the air around it literally shook pressing against my fingers making my skin ripple visibly as though against a strong windbut i felt nothing i touched the surface of the table itself and could feel the power in it buzzing through the flowing runes like electricity through highvoltage cables the sensation engulfed my hand with sudden heat and violence and i jerked my fingers back they were numb and the nails of the two that had touched the table were blackened at the edges wisps of smoke rose from them i shook my fingers and looked at my godmother let me get this straight blood spilled onto the table turns into power for whoever holds it summer now but winter after tomorrow night lea inclined her head silent i dont understand what makes that so important she frowned at the table then began pacing around it slowly clockwise her eyes never leaving me the table is not merely a repository for energy child it is a conduit blood spilled upon its surface takes more than merely life with it power i said i frowned and folded my arms watching her so if for instance a wizards blood spilled there she smiled great power would come of it mortal life mortal magic drawn into the hands of whichever queen ruled the table i swallowed and took a step back oh lea completed her circuit of the table and stopped beside me she glanced furtively around her then looked me in the eyes and said her voice barely audible child should you survive this conflict do not let mab bring you here never a chill crawled down my spine yeah okay i shook my head godmother i still dont get what youre trying to tell me why is the table so important she gestured left and right toward a pair of hilltops facing one another across the broad valley i looked at one squinting at a sudden blur in my vision i tried looking at the other and the same thing happened i cant see i said its a veil or something you must see if you are to understand i drew in a slow breath wizards can see things most people cant its called the sight the third eye a lot of other names if a wizard uses his sight he can see the forces of magic themselves at work spells like braids of neon lights veils pierced like projections on a screen a wizards sight shows things as they truly are and its always an unsettling experience one way or the other what you see with the sight stays with you good or bad its always just as fresh in your mind as if youd just seen it id looked on a little treespirit being with my sight when id been about fourteen the first time it had happened to me and i still had a perfect picture of it in my head as though i was still looking at it a little cartoonish being that was part lawn gnome and part squirrel id seen worse since much worse demons mangled souls tormented spirits all of that was still there too but id also seen better one or two glimpses of beings of such beauty and purity and light that it could make me weep but each time it got a little harder to live with a little harder to bear a cumulative weight i gritted my teeth closed my eyes and with careful deliberation unlocked my sight opening my eyes again made me stagger as i was hit with a sudden rush of impressions the cloudy landscape absolutely seethed with magical energies from the southern hilltop wild green and golden light spilled falling over the landscape like a translucent garden vines of green golden flowers flashes of other colors spread through them clawing at the gentle ground anchored here and there at points of light so vibrant and bright that i couldnt look directly at them from the other side cold blue and purple and greenish power spread like crystals of ice with the slow and relentless power of a glacier pressing ahead in some places melted back in others especially strong around the valleys winding rivers the conflict of energies both wound back to the hilltops themselves to points of light as bright as small suns i could just barely see the shadow of solid beings within those lights and even the shadow of each was an overwhelming presence upon my senses one was a sense of warmth choking heat so much that i couldnt breathe that it pressed into me and set me aflame the other was of cold horrible and absolute winding cold limbs around me stealing away my strength those presences flooded through me sudden beauty power so terrifying and exhilarating and awesome that i fell to my knees and sobbed those powers played against one anotheri could sense that though not the exact nature of their conflict energies wound about one another subtle pressures of darkness and light leaving the landscape vaguely lit in squares of cold and warm color fields of red and gold and bright green stood against empty dead blocks of blue purple pale white a pattern had formed in them a structure to the conflict that was not wholly complete most of a chessboard only at the center at the table was the pattern broken a solid area of summers power in green and gold around the stone table while winters dark crystalline ice slowly pressed closer somehow in time with the almost undetectable motion of the stars overhead so i saw it i got a look at what i was up against at the naked strength of the two queens of faerie and it was bigger than me every ounce of strength i could have summoned would have been no more than a flickering spark beside either of those blazing fountains of light and magic it was power that had existed since the dawn of life and would until its end it was power that had cowed mortals into abject worship and terror beforeand i finally understood why i wasnt a pawn of that kind of strength i was an insect beside giants a blade of grass before towering trees and there was a dreadful attraction in seeing that power something in it that called to the magic in me like to like made me want to hurl myself into those flames into that endless icy cold moths look at bug zappers like i looked at the queens of faerie i tore my eyes away by hiding my face in my arms i fell to my side on the ground and curled up trying to shut the sight to force those images to stop flooding over me i shook and tried to say something im not sure what it came out as stuttering gibbering sounds after that i dont remember much until cold rain started slapping me on the cheek i opened my eyes and found myself lying on the cold wet ground on the shores of lake michigan where id first called out to my godmother my head was on something soft that turned out to be her lap i sat up and away from her quickly my head hurt and the images the sight had showed me made me feel particularly small and vulnerable i sat shivering in the rain for a minute before i glanced back at my godmother you should have warned me her face showed no remorse and little concern it would have changed nothing you needed to see she paused and then added i regret that it was the only way do you yet understand the war i said theyll fight for control of the area around the table if summer holds the space it wont matter if its winters time or not mab wont be able to reach the table spill blood on it and add the power of the summer knight to winter i took a breath there was a sense to what they were doing as though it was a ritual something theyd done before of course lea said they exist in opposition each wields vast power wizardpower to rival the archangels and lesser gods but they cancel one another flawlessly and in the end the board will be evenly divided the lesser pieces will emerge and do battle to decide the balance the ladies i said the knights and lea added lifting a finger the emissaries like hell im not fighting in some kind of fuckedup faerie battle in the clouds perhaps perhaps not i snorted but you didnt help me i needed to speak to them find out if one of them was responsible and so you did more truly than if youd exchanged words i frowned at her and thought through what i knew and what id learned on my trip to the stone table mab shouldnt be in any hurry if summer is missing her knight winter has the edge if they wait theres no need to take the table yes but summer is moving to protect the table that means titania thinks someone in winter did it but if mab is responding instead of waiting it means i frowned it means she isnt sure why summer is moving shes just checking titanias advance and that means that she isnt sure whodunit either simplistic lea said but accurate enough reasoning poppet such are the thoughts of the queens of the sidhe she looked out across the lake your sun will rise in some little time when once again it sets the war will begin in a balanced court it would mean perhaps little of great consequence to the mortal world but that balance is gone if it is not restored child imagine what might happen i did i mean id had an idea what might go wrong before but now i knew the scale of the forces involved the powers of winter and summer werent simply a bunch of electricity in a battery they were like vast coiled springs pressing against one another as long as that pressure was equal the energies were held in control but an imbalance in one side or the other could cause them to slip and the release of energies from either side would be vast and violent and sure to inflict horrible consequences on anything nearbyin this case chicago north america and probably a good chunk of the rest of the world with it i need to see the mothers get me to them lea rose all grace and opaque expression impossible to read that too is beyond me child i need to speak to the mothers i agree lea said but i cannot take you to them the power is not mine perhaps mab or titania could but they are otherwise occupied now committed great i muttered how do i get to them one does not get to the mothers child one can only answer an invitation she frowned faintly i can do no more to help you the lesser powers must take their places with the queens and i am needed shortly youre going she nodded stepped forward and kissed my brow it was just a kiss a press of soft lips against my skin then she stepped back one hand on the hilt of the knife at her belt be careful child and be swift remembersundown she paused and looked at me askance and consider a haircut you look like a dandelion and with that she stepped out onto the lake and her form melted into water that fell back into the stormtossed waters with a splash great i muttered i kicked a rock into the water just great sundown i know nothing and the people i need to talk to screen all of their calls i picked up another rock and threw it as hard as i could over the lake the sound of rain swallowed up the splash i turned and trudged back toward the beetle through the thunder and the rain i could see the shapes of the trees a bit better now dawn must be coming on somewhere behind the clouds i sat down behind the wheel of the trusty beetle put the key in and started the car the battered old volkswagen wheezed once lurched without being put into gear and then started to fill with smoke i choked and scrambled out of the car i hit the release on the engine cover and opened it black smoke billowed out and i could dimly see fire behind it chewing up some part of the engine i went back to the front storage compartment got out the fire extinguisher and put out the fire then i stood there in the rain tired and aching and staring at my burnt engine dawn at midsummer that meant i had maybe fifteen hours to figure out how to get to the mothers somehow i doubted that their number was listed even if it had been my visit to the battleground around the stone table had shown me that the queens possessed far more power than i could have believed their sheer presence had nearly blown the top off my head from a mile awayand the mothers were an order of magnitude above even mab and titania i had fifteen hours to find the killer and restore the summer knights mantle to the summer court and then to stop a war happening in some wild netherplace between here and the spirit world that i had no idea how to reach and my car had died again over your head i muttered harry this is too big for you to handle alone the council i should contact ebenezar tell him what was happening the situation was too big too volatile to risk screwing it up over a matter of council protocol maybe id get lucky and the council would a believe me and b decide to help yeah and maybe if i glued enough feathers to my arms id be able to fly chapter twentyfour i examined my car for a few minutes more took a couple of things off it and walked to the nearest gas station i called a wrecker then got a cab back to my apartment paying for everything with meryls advance once there i got a coke out of the icebox put out fresh food and water for mister and changed his kitty litter it wasnt until i had dug around under the kitchen sink gotten out the bottle of dishwashing soap and blown the dust off of it that i realized i was stalling i glowered at the phone and told myself pride goeth before a fall harry pride can be bad it can make you do stupid things i took a deep breath and shotgunned the coke then i picked up the phone and dialed the number morgan had left me it barely rang once before someone picked up and a male voice said who is calling please dresden i need to speak to ebenezar mccoy one moment sound cut off and i figured whoever answered must have put their hand over the mouthpiece then there was a rustle as the phone changed hands youve failed then dresden morgan stated his tone gave me a good mental picture of the smile on his smug face stay where you are until the wardens arrive to escort you to the senior council for judgement i bit down on a creative expletive i havent failed morgan but ive turned up some information that the senior council should have pride goeth harry and i need help this is getting too hot for one person to handle i need some information and some backup if im going to sort this out its always all about you isnt it morgan said his voice bitter youre the exception to every rule you can break the laws and mock the council you can ignore the trial set for you because you are too important to abide by their authority its got nothing to do with that i said hells bells morgan pull your head out of your ass the faeries power structure has become unstable and it looks like it might hit critical mass if something isnt done thats bigger than me and a hell of a lot more important than council protocol morgan screamed at me his voice so vicious that it made me flinch who are you to judge that you are no one dresden you are nothing he took a seething breath for too long you have flouted the councils rule no more no more exceptions no more delays no more second chances morgan i began i just need to speak to ebenezar let him decide if no morgan said what no you wont evade justice this time snake this is your trial you will see it through without attempting to influence the senior councils judgement morgan this is insane no the insanity was in letting you live when you were a boy dumornes murderous apprentice insanity was pulling you from that burning house two years ago his voice dropped to an even more quiet register the contrast to his previous tone unsettling someone i dearly cared for was at archangel dresden and this time your lies arent going to get you out of whats coming to you then he hung up the phone i stared at the receiver for a second before snarling with rage and slamming it down on the end table over and over until the plastic broke in my hands it hurt i picked up the phone and threw it against the stone of the fireplace it shattered its bell chiming drunkenly i kicked at the heaped mess of my living room scattering old boxes empty cans of coke books papers and startled cockroaches after a few minutes of that i was panting and some of the blind frustrated anger had begun to recede bastard i growled that pigheaded bigoted selfrighteous bastard i needed to cool off and the shower seemed as good a place as any i got under the cold water and tried to wash off the sweat and fear of the past day i half expected the water to burst into steam on contact with my skin but instead i was able to let the anger slip away while focusing on the old shower routinewater soap rinse shampoo rinse by the time i finished and stepped out shivering i felt almost completely nonpsychotic i had no idea how to contact ebenezar if he was under warden security and im sure he and the rest of the senior council were there would be no easy way the best magical countermeasures in the world would create a maze of misleading results for any spell or supernatural being that tried to find him for a moment i debated asking murphy for help the council tended to overlook any method that didnt involve the use of one kind of spell or another murphys contacts in the force might be able to find them by purely oldfashioned methods i decided against it even if murphy traced the phone number down ebenezar might not be at it and if i showed up there trying to get past the wardens to get to him it would be just the excuse morgan needed to chop my head off i mussed up my hair with the towel and threw it on my narrow bed fine i would do it without the councils help i dressed again putting on a pair of jeans and a white dress shirt still hanging in my closet i rolled the sleeves up over my elbows my sneakers were covered in muck so i dragged my cowboy boots out of the closet and put them on what the hell putting on the boots maybe it would do some good i got out my big sports bag the kind you haul hockey gear around in into it went my blasting rod my staff and my sword cane along with a backpack stocked with some candles matches a cup a knife a cardboard cylinder of salt a canteen of blessed water and various other bits of magical equipment i could use as needed i threw in a box of old iron nails and a solidsteel craftsman claw hammer with a black rubber grip and put a couple of pieces of chalk in my pocket then i slid the bag over my shoulder went into the living room and wrought the spell that would lead me to one of the very few only people who might help half an hour later i paid the cabbie and walked into one of the hotels surrounding ohare international airport the subtle tug of the spell led me to the hotels restaurant open for breakfast and half full of mostly business types i found elaine at a corner table a couple of buffet plates scattered with the remains of her breakfast her rich brown hair had been pulled back into a tight braid and coiled at the base of her neck her face looked pale tired with deep circles under her eyes she was sipping coffee and reading a paperback novel she wore a different pair of jeans these a lot looser and a billowy white shirt open over a dark tank top she stiffened a beat after my eyes landed on her and looked up warily i walked to her table pulled out the chair next to her and sat down morning she watched me her expression opaque harry how did you find me i got to thinking that same thing last night i said how did you find me that is and i realized that you hadnt found meyoud found my car you were inside it and nearly unconscious when i got back to it so i looked around the car i pulled the cap to a tires air valve out of my pocket and showed it to her and i found that one of these was missing i figured you were probably the one who took it and used it to home in on the blue beetle so i took one of its mates from the other tires and used it to home in on the missing one you named your car after a superhero on the electric company elaine reached into a brown leather purse on the chair beside her and drew out an identical valve cap clever i looked at the purse what looked like airline tickets was sticking out of it youre running you are a veritable wizard of the obvious harry she started to shrug and her face became ashen her expression twisting with pain she took a slow breath and then resumed the motion with her unwounded shoulder i feel well motivated to run do you really think a plane ticket will get you away from the queens it will get me away from ground zero thats enough theres no way to find out who did it in timeand i dont feel like running up against another assassin i barely got away from the first one i shook my head were close i said we have to be they took a shot at me last night too and i think i know who did both she looked up at me sharply you do i picked up a crust of toast shed discarded mopped it through some leftover eggs and ate it yeah but you probably have to catch a flight elaine rolled her eyes tell you what you stay here and feel smug ill get another plate and be back when youre done she got up rather stiffly and walked over to the buffet she loaded her plate up with eggs and bacon and sausage mixed in with some french toast and came back to the table my mouth watered she pushed the plate at me eat i did but between bites i asked can you tell me what happened to you she shook her head not much to tell i spoke with mab and then with maeve i was on my way back to my hotel and someone jumped me in the parking lot i was able to slip most of his first strike and called up enough fire to drive him away then i found your car why did you come to me i asked because i didnt know who did it harry and i dont trust anyone else in this town my throat got a little tight i borrowed her coffee to wash down the bacon it was lloyd slate elaines eyes widened the winter knight how do you know while i was with maeve he came in carrying a knife in a box and hed been burned it was coated in dried blood maeve was pretty furious that it wasnt any good to her lines appeared between her eyebrows slate he was fetching my blood for her so that she could work a spell on me she tried to cover it but i saw her shiver he probably tailed me out of that party thank the stars i used fire i nodded yeah dried out the blood made it useless for whatever she wanted i shoveled down some more food then last night i got jumped by a hired gun and a couple of faerie beasties i gave her the summary of the attack at walmart leaving murphy out of it maeve elaine said its about all ive got i said it doesnt fit her very well but of course it fits her elaine said absently dont tell me you fell for that psychotic dilettante nymphomaniac act she put on i blinked and then said through a mouthful of french toast no course not shes smart harry shes playing on your expectations i chewed the next bite more slowly its a good theory but thats all it is we need to know more elaine frowned at me you mean you want to talk to the mothers i nodded i figure they might let a few things slip about how things work but i dont know how to get there i thought you might be able to ask someone in summer she closed her paperback no no they wont help no im not going to see the mothers harry its insane theyre too strong they could kill youworse than kill youwith a stray thought at this point im already in over my head it doesnt matter how deep the water gets from here i grimaced besides i dont really have a choice youre wrong she said with quiet emphasis you dont have to stay here you dont have to play their game leave like you are like i am elaine said you cant stop whats been set in motion harry but you can kill yourself trying its probably what mab wanted to begin with no i can stop it she gave me a small smile because youre in the right harry it doesnt work like that dont i know it but thats not why i think so then why you dont try to kill someone who isnt a threat to you they took shots at both of us they must think we can stop them they them elaine said even if we are close we dont know who they is thats why we talk to the mothers i told her theyre the strongest of the queens they know the most if were smart and lucky we can get information from them elaine reached up to tug at her braid her expression uncertain harry look im not i dont want to she closed her eyes for a moment and then said in a voice pained please dont ask me to do this you dont have to go i said just find me the way to them just try you dont understand the kind of trouble youre asking for she said i looked down at my empty plate and said quietly yeah i do i hate it elaine and im afraid and i must be half insane not to just dig myself a hole and pull it in after me but i understand i reached across the table and put my hand over hers her skin was soft warm and she shivered at the touch please her hand turned up fingers curling briefly against mine my turn to shiver elaine sighed youre an imbecile harry youre such a fool i guess some things dont change she let out a subdued laugh before withdrawing her hand and standing ive got a favor left to me ill call it in wait here five minutes later she was back all right outside i stood thank you elaine you going to make your plane she opened her purse and tossed the airline tickets onto the table along with a pair of twenties i guess not then she took a couple of other items out of the purse a slavering of ivory carved in the shape of a ring of oak leaves and attached to a similar bracelet by a silver chain an earring fashioned of what might have been copper and a teardropshaped black stone then an anklet dangling with bangles shaped like bird wings she put them all on then looked at my gym bag still going with the phallic foci eh staff and rod they make me feel all manly her mouth twitched and she started for the exit i followed her and found myself opening doors for her out of habit she didnt seem to be too horribly upset by it outside cars pulled up into a circle drive at the front of the hotel airport shuttles disgorging and swallowing travelers taxis picking up men and women in business suits elaine slipped the strap of her purse over her good shoulder and stood there quietly maybe thirty seconds later i heard the clopping of hooves on blacktop a carriage rolled into sight drawn by a pair of horses one of them was the bluewhite color of a drowned corpse and its breath steamed in the air the other was grassgreen its mane sown with wildflowers the carriage itself looked like something from victorian london all dark wood and brass filigreeand no one was driving it the horses came to a halt directly before us and stood there stamping their feet and tossing their manes the door to the carriage swung open in silence no one was inside i took a surreptitious look around me none of the straights seemed to have noticed the carriage or the unworldly horses pulling it a taxi heading for the space the carriage occupied abruptly veered to one side and found another spot i made an effort and could sense the whisper of enchantment around the carriage subtle and strong probably encouraging the straights not to notice it i guess this is our ride i said you think elaine flipped her braid back over one shoulder and climbed in this will take us there but we wont have any protection on the other side just remember harry i told you this was a bad idea preemptive itoldyousos i said now ive seen everything chapter twentyfive the carriage took off so smoothly that i almost didnt feel it i leaned over the window and twitched the shade aside we pulled away from the hotel and into traffic with no one the wiser cars giving us a wide berth even while not noting us that was one hell of a veil the carriage didnt jounce at all and after about a minute wisps of mist began to brush up against the windows not long after the mists blocked out the view of the city entirely the street sounds faded and all that was left was silvergrey mist and the clop of horse hooves the carriage stopped perhaps five minutes later and the door swung open i opened my gym bag and took out my rod and staff i slipped the sword cane through my belt and drew out my amulet to lie openly on my chest elaine did the same with hers then we got out of the carriage i took a slow look at my surroundings we stood on some kind of spongy grass on a low rolling hill surrounded by other low rolling hills the mist lay over the land like a crippled storm cloud sluggish and thick in some places thinner in others the landscape was dotted with the occasional tree boles thick and twisted branches scrawny and long a tatteredlooking raven crouched on a nearby branch its beadblack eyes gleaming cheery elaine said yeah very baskerville the carriage started up again and i looked back to see it vanishing into the mist okay where to now at my words the raven let out a croaking caw it shook itself bits of moldy feather drifting down and then beat its wings a few times and settled on another branch almost out of sight harry elaine said yeah if you make any corny joke using the word nevermore im going to punch you do you understand me never more i confirmed elaine rolled her eyes then we both started off after the raven it led us through the cloudy landscape flitting silently from tree to tree we trudged behind it until more trees began to rise in the mist ahead of us thickening the ground grew softer the air more wet cloying the raven let out another caw then vanished into the trees and out of sight i peered after it and said do you see a light back there in the trees yes this must be the place fine i started forward elaine caught my wrist and said in a sharp and warning tone harry she nodded toward a thick patch of shadows where two trees had fallen against one another i had just begun to pick out a shape when it moved and came forward close enough that i could make it out clearly the unicorn looked like a budweiser horse one of the huge draft beasts used for heavy labor it had to have been eighteen hands high maybe more it had a broad chest four heavy hooves forwardpricked ears and a long equine face that was where its resemblance to a clydesdale ended it didnt have a coat it just had a smooth and slicklooking carapace all chitinous scales and plates mixing colors of dark green and midnight black its hooves were cloven and stained with old blood one spiraling horn rose from its forehead at least three feet long and wickedly pointed the spirals were serrated on the edges some of them covered with rustbrown stains a pair of curling horns like those of a bighorn sheep curved around the sides of its head from the base of the horn it didnt have any eyesjust smooth leathery chitin where they should have been it tossed its head and a mane of rotted cobwebs danced around its neck and forelegs long and tattered as a burial shroud a large moth fluttered through the mist near the unicorn the beast whirled impossibly nimble and lunged its spiral skewered the moth and with a savage shake of its head the unicorn threw the moth to the earth and pulverized the ground it landed on with sledgehammer blows of the blades of its hooves it snorted after that and then turned to pace silently back into the mistcovered trees elaines eyes widened and she looked at me i glanced at her unicorns i said very dangerous you go first she arched an eyebrow maybe not i relented a guardian obviously elaine said how do we get past it blow it up tempting elaine said but i dont think it will make much of an impression on the mothers if we kill their watchdog a veil i shook my head i dont think unicorns rely on the normal senses if i remember right they sense thoughts in that case it shouldnt notice you hah i said in a monotone hahhah hoho oh my ribs i have a better plan i go through while you distract it with what im fresh out of virginity and that thing doesnt look much like the unicorns i saw in summer its a lot less prancy with thoughts i said they sense thoughts and theyre attracted to purity your concentration was always better than mine theoretically if you can keep an image in your head it should focus on it and not you think of a wonderful thought great plan peter pan you have a better one elaine shook her head okay ill try to lead him down there she gestured down the line of trees once i do get moving i nodded and elaine closed her eyes for a moment before her features smoothed over into relaxation she started forward and into the trees walking at a slow and measured pace the unicorn appeared again ten feet in front of elaine the beast snorted and pawed at the earth and reared up on its hind legs tossing its mane then it started forward at a slow and cautious walk elaine held out her hand to it it let out a gurgling whicker and nuzzled her palm still moving with dreamlike slowness elaine turned and began walking down the length of the lines of trees the unicorn followed a pace or two behind her the tip of its horn bobbing several inches above elaines right shoulder theyd gone several paces before i saw that the plan wasnt working the unicorns body language changed its ears flattened back to its skull and its feet shifted restlessly before it finally rose up on its hind hooves preparing to lunge with the deadly horn centered on elaines back there wasnt time to shout a warning i lifted my blasting rod in my right hand summoned the force of my will and pushed it through the focus with a shout of fuego fire erupted from the tip of the rod a scarlet ribbon of heat and flame and force that lanced out toward the unicorn after having seen how spectacularly useful my magic wasnt on the ogre grum i didnt want to chance another faerie beast shrugging it off so i wasnt shooting for the unicorn itselfbut for the ground at its feet the blast ripped a threefoot trench in the earth and the unicorn screamed and thrashed its head trying to keep its balance a normal horse would have toppled but the unicorn somehow managed to get a couple of feet onto solid ground and hurled itself away in a fortyfoot standing leap it landed on its feet already running body sweeping in a circle to bring it charging toward me i ran for the nearest tree the unicorn was faster but i didnt have far to go and i put the trunk between us it didnt slow down its horn slammed into the trunk of the dead tree and came through it as though it hadnt been there i flinched away but not fast enough to avoid catching several flying splinters in the chest and belly and not fast enough to avoid a nasty cut on my left arm where one of those serrated edges of the horn ripped through my shirt the pain of the injuries registered but only as background data i stepped around the bole of the tree taking my staff in both hands and swung it as hard as i could at the delicate bones of the unicorns rear ankle well on a horse theyre delicate evidently on unicorns theyre just a bit tender the faerie beast let out a furious scream and twisted its body tearing through the tree shredding it as it whipped its horn free and whirled to orient on me it lunged the horn spearing toward me i swept my staff up a simple parry quatre and shoved the tip out past my body while darting a pair of steps to my right avoiding the beasts oncoming weight i kept going ducking a beat before the unicorn planted its forequarters lifted its hind and twisted lashing out toward my head with both rear hooves i rolled came up running and ducked behind the next tree the unicorn turned and began stalking toward me circling the tree foam pattering from its open mouth elaine cried out and i whipped my head around to see her lifting her right hand the ring on it releasing a cloud of glowing motes that burst around her in a swarm the little lights streaked toward the unicorn and gathered around it swirling and flashing in a dazzling cloud one of them brushed against me and my senses abruptly went into whiteout overwhelmed with a simple image of walking down a sidewalk in worn shoes the sun bright overhead a purse bumping on my hip stomach twinging with pleasant hunger pangs the scent of hot asphalt in my nose children laughing and splashing somewhere nearby a memory something from elaine i staggered and pushed it away from me regaining my senses the motes crowded around the unicorn darting in to brush against it one at a time and at each touch the faerie beast went wild it spun and kicked and screamed and lashed out with its horn lunging at insubstantial adversaries in wild frenzy but all to no avail i looked past them to see elaine standing in place her hand extended her face set in an expression of concentration and strain harry she shouted go ill hold it i rose heart pounding you got it for a little while just get to the mothers elaine responded hurry i dont want to leave you alone a bead of sweat trickled down the side of her face you wont be when it gets loose im not waiting around for it to skewer me i gritted my teeth i didnt want to leave elaine but to be fair shed done better than i had she stood against the unicorn still only a dozen long strides away her hand extended the creature as contained as if shed wrapped it in a net my slender and straight and beautiful elaine memories images washed through me dozens of little things id forgotten coming back to me all at once her laugh quiet and wicked in the darkness the feeling of her slender fingers slipping through mine her face asleep on the pillow beside me gentle and peaceful in the morning sun there were many more but i pushed them away that had been a long time ago and they wouldnt mean a thing if neither of us survived the next few minutes and hours i turned my back on her left her struggling against the strength of that nightmarish unicorn and ran toward the lights in the mist chapter twentysix the nevernever is a big place in fact its the biggest place the nevernever is what the wizards call the entirety of the realm of spirit it isnt a physical place with geography and weather patterns and so on its a shadow world a magical realm and its substance is as mutable as thought it has a lot of names like the other side and the next world and it contains within it just about any kind of spirit realm you can imagine somewhere heaven hell olympus elysium tartarus gehennayou name it and its in the nevernever somewhere in theory at any rate the parts of the nevernever closest to the mortal world are almost completely controlled by the sidhe this part of the spirit realm is called faerie and has close ties with our own natural world as a result faerie resembles the real world in a lot of ways it is fairly permanent and unchanging for example and has several versions of weather but make no mistakeit isnt earth the rules of reality dont apply as tightly as they do in our world so faerie can be viciously treacherous most who go into it never come back and i had a gut feeling that i was running through the heart of faerie the ground sloped down and grew wetter softer the mist swallowed sound quickly behind me until all i could hear was my own labored breathing the run made my heart pound and my wounded hand throbbed painfully there was a certain amount of exhilaration to the movement my limbs and muscles stretching and feeling alive after several months of disuse i couldnt have kept up the pace for long but luckily i didnt have far to go the lights turned out to be a pair of lit windows in a cottage that stood by itself on a slight rise of ground stone obelisks the size of coffins some fallen and cracked and others still upright stood scattered in loose rings around the mound the raven rested on one of them its beady eyes gleaming it let out another croaking sound and flew through an open window of the cottage i stood there panting for a minute trying to get my breath before i walked up to the door my flesh began to crawl with a shivering sensation i took a step back and looked at the house stone walls a thatch roof i could smell mildew beneath an odor of freshbaked bread the door was made of some kind of heavy weathered wood and the snowflake symbol id seen before had been carved into it mother winter then if she was anything like mab she would have the kind of power that would give any wizard the creeps it would just hang in the air around her like body warmth except that it would take a lot of body to feel its warmth through stone walls and a heavy door gulp i lifted my hand to knock and the door swung open of its own accord complete with a melodramatic hammer films whimper of rusting hinges a voice little more than a creaking whisper said come in boy we have been expecting you double gulp i wiped my palms on my jeans and made sure i had a good grip on both staff and rod before i stepped across the threshold and into the dim cottage the place was all one room the floor was wooden though the boards looked weathered and dry shelves stood against the stone walls a loom rested in the far corner near the fireplace a spinning wheel beside it before the fireplace sat a rocking chair occupied squeaking as it moved a figure sat in it shrouded in a shawl a hood as though someone had animated a bundle of blankets and cloth on the hearth above the fireplace sat several sets of teeth more or less humansized one looked simple enough all white and even the next was rottedlooking with chipped incisors and a broken molar the next set had all pointed teeth stained with bits of rusty brown and what looked like rotten bits of flesh stuck between them the last was made out of some kind of silvery metal shining like a sword interesting came the creaking voice from the creaking chair most interesting can you feel it uh i said from the other side of the cottage a brisk voice tsked and i spun to face the newcomer another woman stooped with age blew dust from a shelf and ran a cloth over it before replacing the bottles and jars she turned and eyed me with glittering green eyes from within a weathered but rosy face of course i do the poor child hes walked a thorny path the elderly lady came to me and put her hands firmly on either side of my head peering at either eye scars here some stick out your tongue boy i blinked uh stick out your tongue she repeated in a crisp tone i did she peered at my tongue and my throat and said strength though and he can be clever at times it would seem your daughter chose ably i closed my mouth and she released my head mother summer i presume she beamed up at me yes dear and this is mother winter she gestured vaguely at the chair by the fire dont be offended if she doesnt get up its the wrong season you know hand me that broom i blinked then reached over to pick up the ramshackle old broom with a gnarled handle and passed it to mother summer the old lady took it and immediately began sweeping the dusty floor of the old cottage bah whispered mother winter the dust is just going to come back its the principle of the thing summer said isnt that right boy i sneezed and mumbled something noncommittal uh pardon me ladies but i wondered if you could answer a few questions for me winters head seemed to turn slightly toward me from within her hood mother summer stopped and eyed me her grassgreen eyes sparkling you wish answers yes i said how can you expect to get them winter wheezed when you do not yet know the proper questions uh i said again brilliance incarnate thats me summer shook her head and said an exchange then she said we will ask you a question and for your answer we will each give you an answer to what you seek no offense but i didnt come here so that you could ask me questions are you sure mother summer asked she swept a pile of dust past me and out the door how do you know you didnt mother winters rasping whisper came to me disgusted shell prattle on all day answer us the questions boy or get out i took a deep breath all right i said ask mother winter turned back to face the fire simply tell us boy which is more important the body or the soul mother summer picked up they both fell silent and i felt their focus on me like the tip of a knife resting against my skin i suppose that would depend on who was asking whom i said finally we ask winter whispered summer nodded and we ask you i thought about my words for a moment before i spoke i know it shocked me too then i would say that were i old sick and dying i would believe that the soul is more important and if i was a man about to be burned at the stake in order to preserve his soul i would believe that the body is more important the words fell on a long moment of silence i found myself shifting my feet restlessly fairly said mother winter rasped at last wise enough summer agreed why did you give that answer boy because its a stupid question the answer isnt as simple as one or the other precisely summer said she walked to the fire and withdrew a baking sheet on a long handle a roundish loaf of bread was on it she set it on a rack to cool this child sees what she does not it is not in her nature winter murmured she is what she is mother summer sighed and nodded these are strange times hold on i said what she are you talking about here its maeve isnt it mother winter made a quiet wheezing sound that might have been a laugh i answered your questions i said so pay up patience boy mother summer said she took a kettle from a hook by the fireplace and poured tea into a pair of cups she dipped what looked like honey into each then cream and gave one to mother winter i waited until each of them had sipped before i said right patience expired i cant afford to wait tonight is midsummer tonight the balance begins to tilt back to winter and maeve is going to try to use the stone table to steal the summer knights mantle for keeps indeed something to be prevented at all costs mother summer arched an eyebrow then what is your question who killed the summer knight who stole his mantle mother summer gave me a disappointed glance and sipped her tea mother winter lifted her tea to her hood i still couldnt see her facebut her hand looked withered the fingers tinged with blue she lowered her cup and said you ask a foolish question boy you are more clever than this i folded my arms what is that supposed to mean mother summer frowned at winter but said it means that who is not as important as why and how mother winter added think boy summer said what has the theft of the mantle accomplished i frowned war between the courts for one odd activity in the magical and natural world alike but mostly the coming war winter and summer gathering to battle at the stone table exactly winter whispered the skin on the back of my neck rippled with a cold and unpleasant sensation hells bells shed heard me thinking but think wizard how was it done theft is theft whether the prize is food or riches or beauty or power since it didnt seem to matter either way i did my thinking out loud when something is stolen a couple of things can happen to it it can be carried away where it cannot be reached hoarded summer put in such as the dragons do yeah okay uh it can be destroyed no it cant mother winter said your own sage tells you that the german fellow with the wild hair einstein i muttered okay then but it can be rendered valueless or it can be sold to someone else mother summer nodded both of which are change i held up a hand hold it hold it look as i understand it this power of the summer knight his mantle it cant just exist on its own it has to be inside a vessel yes winter murmured within one of the queens or within the knight and it isnt with one of the queens true summer said we would sense it were it so so its already in another knight i said but if that was true thered be no imbalance i scratched at my head and as i did it slowly dawned on me unless it had been changed unless the new knight had been changed transformed into something else something that left the power trapped inert useless both of them regarded me steadily silently all right i said i have my question ask it they said together how does the mantle pass on from one knight to the next mother summer smiled but the expression was a grim one it returns to the nearest reflection of itself to the nearest vessel of summer she in turn chooses the next knight that meant that only one of the queens of summer could be behind it titania was out alreadyshe had begun the war against mab because she didnt know where the mantle was mother summer would not have been telling me this information if shed been the one to do it that left only one person stars and stones i muttered aurora the two mothers set down their teacups together time presses summer said that which must not be may be winter continued you we judge are the one who may set things aright once more if you are strong enough brave enough whoa hold your horses i said cant i just bring this out to mab and titania beyond talk now mother winter said they go to war stop them i said you two have to be stronger than mab and titania make them shut up and listen to you not that simple winter said summer nodded we have power but bound within certain limits we cannot interfere with the queens or ladies not even on a matter so dire as this what can you do i summer said nothing i frowned and looked from her to mother winter one aged cracked hand lifted and beckoned me come closer boy i started to say no but my feet moved without asking the rest of me and i knelt in front of mother winters rocking chair i couldnt see her even from here even her feet were covered by layers of dark cloth but on her lap rested a pair of knitting needles and a simple square of cloth trailing thick threads of grey undyed wool mother winter reached down with her withered hands and took up a pair of rusted shears she cut the trailing threads and passed me the cloth i took it again without thinking it felt soft cold as if it had been in a refrigerator and it tingled with a subtle dangerous energy it isnt tied off i said quietly nor should it be winter said it is an unraveling a what an unmaking boy i am the unmaker the destroyer it is what i am bound within those threads is the power to undo any enchantment done touch the cloth to that which must be undone unravel the threads it will be so i stared at the square cloth for a moment then asked quietly any enchantment any transformation any my hands started shaking you mean i could use this to undo what the vampires did to susan just wipe it away make her mortal again you could emissary mother winters tone held a bonedry amusement i swallowed and rose folding up the cloth i slipped it into my pocket careful not to let any threads trail out is this a gift no winter rasped but a necessity what am i supposed to do with it mother summer shook her head it is yours now and yours to employ we have reached the limits of how we may act the rest is yours make haste winter whispered mother summer nodded no time remains be swift and wise mortal child go with our blessings winter withdrew her frail hands into the sleeves of her robe do not fail boy hells bells no pressure i muttered i gave each of them a short bow and turned for the door i stepped over the threshold of the cottage and said oh by the way i apologize if we did any harm to your unicorn on the way in i looked back to see mother summer arch a brow winters head shifted and i could see the gleam of light on yellow teeth her voice rasped what unicorn the door shut again of its own accord i glowered at the wood for a moment and then muttered freaking weirdo faerie biddies i turned and started back the way i had come the unraveling was a cool weight in my pocket and promised to get uncomfortably chilly if i left it there too long the thought of the unraveling made me walk faster excitement skipping through me if what the mothers said was true id be able to use the cloth to help susan which was something just this side of divine intervention all i had to do was to finish up this case and then i could go find her of course i thought sourly finishing up this case was likely to kill me the mothers may have given me some insight and a magic doily but they sure as hell hadnt given me a freaking clue as to how to resolve thisand i realized they hadnt really said aurora did it i knew they had to speak the truth to me and their statements had led me to that conclusionbut how much of it was this mysterious prohibition from direct involvement and how much of it had been another fistful of faerie trickery make haste i rasped trying to impersonate winters voice we have reached the limits i said mimicking summer i quickened my pace and frowned over that last little comment winter had made she had taken an almost palpable glee in making it as though it had given her an opening she wouldnt otherwise have had what unicorn i gnawed over the question if it was indeed a statement of importance not just a passing mutter then it had to mean something i frowned it meant that there hadnt been a guardian around the little cottage or at least not one mother winter had put there so who had the answer hit me low in the gut a sensation of physical sickness coming along with the realization i stopped and clawed for my sight i didnt get to it before grum came out from under a veil elaine standing close behind him he caught me flatfooted the ogre drove a sledgehammer fist toward my face there was a flash of impact a sensation of falling and cool earth beneath my cheek then the scent of elaines subtle perfume then blackness chapter twentyseven i came to on the ground of that dark nevernever wood spirit realm or not i felt cold and started shivering uncontrollably that made playing possum pretty much impossible so i sat up and tried to take stock i didnt feel any new bruises or breaks so i hadnt been pounded while i was out it probably hadnt been long mother winters unraveling was no longer in my pocket my bag was gone as was my ring and my bracelet my staff and rod needless to say had been taken as well i could still feel my mothers pentacle amulet against my chest though which came as something of a surprise my hand throbbed where mab had driven the freaking letter opener through it other than that i felt more or less whole huzzah i squinted at my surroundings next and found a ring of toadstools grown up around me they werent huge tentacular horribly fanged toadstools or anything but it put a little chill in me all the same i lifted my hand and reached out for them tentatively extending my wizards senses along with the gesture i hit a wall i couldnt think of another way to describe it where the ring began my ability to reach move and perceive with my supernatural senses simply ended trapped double huzzah only after id gotten an idea of my predicament did i stand up and face my captors there were five of them which seemed less than fair i recognized the nearest right awayaurora the summer lady now dressed in what i could only describe as a battle gown made out of some kind of silver mail as fine and light as cloth it clung closely to her from the top of her throat down to her wrists and ankles and shone with its own dim radiance in the forests gloom she wore a sword at her hip and upon her pale hair rested a garland of living leaves she turned green eyes to me heartbreakingly lovely and regarded me with an expression both sad and resolved wizard aurora said i regret that it has come to this but you have come too close to interfering once you had served your purpose i could not allow you to continue your involvement i grimaced and looked past her at the ogre grum huge and scarletskinned and silent and the horrific unicorn that had apparently been guarding the way to mother winters cottage what do you intend to do with me kill you aurora said her voice gentle i regret the necessity but youre too dangerous to be allowed to live i squinted at her then why havent you good question said the fourth person presentlloyd slate the winter knight he still wore his biker leathers but hed added bits of mail and a few metal plates to the ensemble he wore a sword at his hip another on his back and bore a heavy pistol on his belt the gaunt tense hunger of his expression hadnt changed he looked nervous and angry if it had been up to me id have cut your throat when grum first dropped you why call him grum i said scowling at the ogre you might as well drop the glamour lord marshal theres not much point to it now the ogres face twisted with surprise i glared spitefully at the dark unicorn and spat you too korrick both ogre and unicorn glanced at aurora the faerie queen never took her eyes off me but nodded the ogres form blurred and twisted and resolved itself into the form of talos the sidhe lord from auroras penthouse at the rothchild his pale hair had been drawn back into a fighting braid and he wore closefit mail of some glittering black metal that made him look railthin and deadly at the same time the unicorn shook itself and rose up into the hulking form of korrick the centaur also dressed in mail and bearing weapons of faerie make he stamped one huge hoof and said nothing aurora walked in a circle around me frowning how long have you known wizard i shrugged not long i started getting it on the way out of mother winters cottage once i knew where to start it wasnt hard to start adding up the numbers we dont have time for this slate said and spat on the ground to one side if he puzzled it out others may have as well aurora said her voice patient we should know if any other opposition is coming tell me wizard how did you piece it together go to hell i snapped aurora turned to the last person there and asked can he be reasoned with elaine stood a little apart from the others her back to them my bag rested on the ground near her feet and my rod and staff lay there too shed added a cloak of emerald green to her outfit somehow making it look natural she glanced at aurora and then at me she averted her eyes quickly youve already told him youre going to kill him he wont cooperate aurora shook her head more sacrifices i am sorry you pushed me to this wizard her hand moved some unseen force jerked my chin up my eyes to hers they flashed a ripple of colors and i felt the force of her mind her will glide past my defenses and into me i lost my balance and staggered leaning helplessly against the invisible solidity of the circle shed imprisoned me in i tried to fight it but it was like trying to push water up a hillnothing for me to strain against nothing for me to focus upon i was on her turf trapped in a circle of her power she flowed into me down through my eyes and all i could do was watch the pretty colors now she said and her voice was the gentlest sweetest thing id ever heard what did you learn of the summer knights death you were behind it i heard myself saying my voice slow and heavy you had him killed how lloyd slate he hates maeve you recruited him to help you elaine took him inside reuels building through the nevernever he fought reuel thats why there was ooze on the stairs the water on reuels arms and legs was where summer fire met winter ice slate threw him down the stairs and broke his neck and his mantle of power redirected i mumbled you gathered it in and placed it into another person who the changeling girl i said lily you gave her the mantle and then you turned her to stone that statue in your garden it was right in front of me very good aurora said and the gentle praise rippled through me i fought to regain my senses to escape the glittering green prison of her eyes what else you hired the ghoul the tigress you sent her after me before mab even spoke to me i do not know this ghoul you are incorrect wizard i do not hire killers continue you set me up before i came to interview you in what way aurora pressed maeve must have ordered slate to take elaine out he made it look like he tried and missed but elaine played it for more you helped her fake the injury why did i do that to keep me upset worried so that when i spoke to you i wouldnt have the presence of mind to corner you with a question thats why you attacked me too telling me what a monster id become to keep me off balance keep me from asking the right questions yes aurora said and after that you decided to take me out you sent talos elaine and slate to kill me and you created that construct in the garden center slate stepped closer spooky he said he doesnt look all that smart yet he used only reason plus knowledge doubtless gained from the queens and mothers he put it together for himself rather than being told at that her gaze slanted past me to elaine i tried to pull away and couldnt great slate said no one squealed can we kill the great kreskin now aurora held up a hand to slate and asked me do you know my next objective you knew that if you bound up the summer knights mantle mother winter would provide an unraveling to free it and restore the balance you waited for her to give it to me now youre going to take it and the statue of lily youre going to take her to the stone table during the battle youll use the unraveling free lily from being stone and kill her on the table after midnight the summer knights power will go to winter permanently you want to destroy the balance of power in faerie i dont know why auroras eyes flashed dangerously she removed her gaze from mine and it was like suddenly falling back up a flight of stairs i staggered back tearing my eyes from her and focusing on the ground why it should be obvious to you why wizard you of all people she spun in a glitter of silvery mail pacing restlessly back and forth the cycle must be broken summer and winter constantly chasing each other wounding what the other heals and healing what the other wounds our war our senseless contest waged for no reason other than that it has always been soand mortals trapped between us crushed by the struggle made pawns and toys she took a shuddering angry breath it must end and i will end it i ground my teeth shivering youll end it by sending the natural world into chaos i did not set the price aurora hissed i caught sight of her eyes out of the corner of my vision and started tracking up to her face i forced my gaze down again barely in time she continued speaking in a low impassioned voice i hate it i hate every moment of the things ive had to do to accomplish thisbut it should have been done long since wizard delay is just as deadly how many have died or been tormented to madness by maeve and those like her you yourself have been tortured abused nearly enslaved by them i do what must be done i swallowed and said harming and endangering mortal kind in order to help them thats insane perhaps aurora said but it is the only way she faced me again and asked her voice cold does the white council know what you have discovered bite me faerie fruitcake slate stifled a laugh hiding it under a cough i felt more than saw auroras sudden surge of rage sparked by the winter knight but directed at me a flare of light erupted from her and i felt a sudden heat against the side of my body nearest her the hairs on my arm rose straight up her voice rang out hot and violent and strong what did you say ape they dont elaine said her voice tense she put herself between me and aurora her back to me he told me before we left for the mothers the council doesnt realize the depth of whats happening by the time they do it will be too late for them to act fine slate said hes the last loose end then kill him and lets get on with it dammit slate i said use your head man what do you think youre going to get out of helping her like this slate gave me a cold smile that old bastard reuels power for one thing ill be twice the knight i was beforeand then im going to settle some accounts with that little bitch maeve he licked his lips after that aurora and i will decide what to do next i let out a harsh bray of laughter i hope you got that in writing dimwit do you really think she would let a man and a mortal at that have that much power over her slates eyes became wary and i pressed him think about it has she ever given it to you straight a statement not a question or a dodge or something shes led you to assume suspicion grew in his gaze but aurora laid a hand on his shoulder slates eyes grew a little cloudy at her touch and he closed them peace my knight the summer lady murmured the wizard is a trickster and desperate he would say anything he thought might save him nothing has changed between us i ground my teeth at the meaningless words but aurora had slates number whatever it was maybe all that time in maeves company had softened him the drugs and pleasures she fed him making him more open to suggestion maybe aurora had just found a hole in his psychology either way he wasnt going to listen to me i looked around but korrick and talos ignored me aurora kept on whispering to slate that left only one person to talk to and the thought of it felt like someone driving nails into my chest elaine i said this is crazy why are you doing this she didnt look up at me survival harry i promised to help aurora or to give up my own life as forfeit in payment for all the years she protected me i didnt know when i made the promise that you were going to be involved she fell quiet for a moment then swallowed before she said her voice forced a little louder i didnt know if aurora isnt stopped someone is going to get hurt someone gets hurt every day elaine answered when you get right down to it does it matter who how or why people are going to die elaine that stung her and she looked up at me sharp anger warring with a sheen of tears in her grey eyes better them than me i faced her without looking away better me than you too huh she broke first turning to regard aurora and slate looks that way i folded my arms and leaned against the back of my toadstool cell i went over my options but they were awfully limited if aurora wanted me dead she would be able to see to it quite handily and unless the cavalry came riding over the hill there wasnt diddly i could do about it call me a pessimist but my life has been marked with a notable lack of cavalry checkmate which left me with one last spell to throw i closed my eyes for a moment reaching inside gathering up the magic the life force within me any wizard has a reservoir of power inherent in him power drawn from the core of his self rather than from his surroundings auroras circle could cut me off from drawing upon ambient magic to fuel a spellbut it couldnt stop me from using the energy within me granted once used there wouldnt be anything left to keep me breathing my heart pumping and electricity going through my brain but then thats why they call it a death curse isnt it it was only a moment later that i opened my eyes to see aurora draw back from lloyd slate the winter knight focused his eyes on me scary eyes empty of anything like reason and drew the sword from his belt a grim business aurora said goodbye mister dresden chapter twentyeight i faced slate headon i figured as long as i was going to take one of those swords it might as well have a shot of killing me pretty quick no sense in dragging it out but i left my eyes on aurora and held whatever power i had gathered up and ready i am sorry wizard aurora said youre about to be i muttered slate drew back his blade an oriental job without enough class to be an actual katana and tensed preparing to strike the blade glittered and looked really really sharp elaine caught slates wrist and said wait aurora gave elaine a sharp and angry look what are you doing protecting you elaine said if you let slate kill him hell break the circle around dresden aurora looked from elaine to me and back and elaine i snarled she regarded me with flat eyes and youll leave yourself open to his death curse hell take you with him or make you wish he had aurora lifted her chin he isnt that strong dont be so sure elaine said hes the strongest wizard ive ever met strong enough to make the white council nervous why take a pointless risk so close to the end you treacherous bitch i said god damn you elaine aurora frowned at me and then gestured to slate he lowered the sword and put it away yet he is too dangerous to leave alive yes elaine agreed what would you suggest were in the nevernever elaine said arrange his death and leave once you are back in mortal lands he wont be able to reach you let him spend his curse on mab if he wishes or on his godmother but it wont be on you but when i leave my power will go with me he wont be held by the circle what do you suggest elaine regarded me passionlessly drown him she said finally call water and let the earth drink him ill lock him into place with a binding of my own mortal magic will last even after ive left aurora nodded are you capable of holding him i know his defenses elaine responded ill hold him as long as necessary aurora regarded me in silence for a moment so much rage she said very well elaine hold him it didnt take her long elaine had always been smoother at magic than me more graceful she murmured something in the language shed chosen for her magic some variant on old egyptian adding a roll of her wrist a graceful ripple of her fingers and i felt her spell lock around me like a fullbody straitjacket paralyzing me from chin to toes wrapping me in silent unseen force it pressed against my clothes flattening them and made it hard to take a deep breath at the same time aurora closed her eyes her hands spread at her side then she leveled her palms and slowly raised them from within the circle i couldnt sense what she was doing but there wasnt anything wrong with my eyes and ears the ground gurgled and there was a sudden scent of rotten eggs i felt the earth beneath me shift and sag and then a slow bloop bloop of earth settling as water began rising up beneath me it took maybe five seconds for the ground to become so soft that my feet sank into the warm mud up to my ankles hells bells mortal time is racing aurora said and opened her eyes the day grows short come without so much as glancing at me she swept away into the mist slate fell into place at her heels and talos followed several paces behind slim and dangerous in his dark armor korrick the centaur spared me a sneer and a satisfied snort before he gripped a short heavy spear in his broad fist and turned to follow the summer lady hooves striking down in decisive clops that left elaine she came forward until she stood almost close enough to touch me slender and pretty she regarded me steadily while she took a band from her jeans pocket and bound her hair back into a tail why elaine i asked i struggled furiously against the spell but it was stronger than me why the hell did you stop her youre an idiot harry she said a melodramatic fool you always were i kept sinking into the earth and came level with her eyes i could have stopped her i couldnt be sure you wouldnt have thrown the curse at me too she looked over her shoulder aurora had paused a dim shape in the mist and was waiting the watery earth kept drawing me down and i looked up at her now at the soft skin on the underside of her chin she looked down at me and said goodbye harry she turned and walked after aurora then she paused one leg bent and turned enough so that i could see her profile she said in that same casually neutral tone its just like old times after that they left me there to die its hard not to panic in that kind of situation i mean ive been in trouble before but not in that kind of ticktockhereitcomes way the problem in front of me was simple steady and inescapable the ground kept getting softer and i kept on sliding down into it the sensation of it was warm and not entirely unpleasant i mean people pay money for hot mud baths but mine would be lethal if i didnt find a way out of it and the mud was already creeping up over my thighs i closed my eyes and tried to focus i reached out to feel the fabric of elaines spell around me and pushed trying to break through it i didnt have enough strength once auroras circle dropped i would be able to reach out for more power but id be running short on timeand even so brute strength wasnt the answer if i just randomly hammered at the spell around me it would be like trying to escape from a set of shackles using dynamite i would tear myself apart along with the binding still that dangerous option seemed to be my only hope i tried to hang on to stay calm and focused and to wait for auroras circle to give out i got the giggles dont ask me why but under the pressure of the moment it seemed damned funny i tried not to but i cackled and chortled as the warm mud slid up over my hips my belly my chest just like old times i wheezed yeah just like old times elaine you backbiting poisonous treacherous and then a thought hit me just like old times deceitful wicked clever girl if this works ill buy you a pony i put the studied indifference of her words together with her whole bloodless attitude that wasnt the elaine i remembered i could buy that she would murder me in a fit of rage poison me out of flaming jealousy or bomb my car out of sheer stubborn pique but she would never do it and feel nothing the mud covered my chest and still auroras circle hadnt faded my heart pounded wildly but i struggled to remain calm i started hyperventilating i might need every spare second i could get the mud covered my throat and slid up over my chin i wasnt fighting it any more i got a good deep breath just before my nose went under then darkness pressed over my eyes and i was left floating in thick gooey warmth the only sound the beating of my own heart thudding in my ears i waited and my lungs began to burn i waited not moving fire spreading over my chest i kept everything as relaxed as i could and counted the heartbeats somewhere between seventyfour and seventyfive auroras circle vanished i reached out for power gathering it in shaping it in my mind i didnt want to rush it but it was hard not to i took all the time i could without panicking before i reached out again for the fabric of elaines spell id been right it was the same binding shed used when we were kids when shed been holding me down while my old master justin dumorne prepared to enthrall me id found the way out as a kid because elaine and i had shared a certain impatience for our magical studies besides schoolwork wed been forced to pursue an entirely different regimen of spells and mental disciplines as well some nights we would have homework until dinner then head right for the magical stuff until well after midnight working out spells and formulae until our eyes ached toward the end that got to be rough when all we really wanted was to be in bed doing things much less scholarly and much more hormonal until other parts ached ahem to that end wed split the work one of us would work out the spell while the other did the homework then a quick round of copying and straight to bed id been the one who worked out that binding and it sucked it sucked because it had no flexibility to it no subtlety no class it dropped a cocoon of hardened air around the target and locked it there period end of story as teenagers we had thought it impressively effective and simple as a desperate man about to die i realized that it was a brittle spell like a diamond that was simultaneously the hardest substance on earth and easily fractured if struck at the correct angle now that i knew what i was doing i found the clumsy center of the spell where id located it all those years ago tying all the strands of energy together at the small of the back like a christmas bow there in the mud and darkness i focused on the weak spot of the spell gathered my will and muttered with my mouth clenched closed tappitytaptap it came out mmphitymmphmph but that didnt make any difference on the practical side the spell was clear in my head a spike of energy lashed into the binding and i felt it loosen my heart pounded with excitement and i reached out with the spell again the third time i tried it the binding slipped and i flexed my arms and legs pulling them slowly free id done it id escaped the binding now i was merely drowning in what amounted to quicksand the clock was running against me as i started to feel dizzy as my lungs struggled against my will trying to force out what little air remained and suck in a deep breath of nice cleansing muck i reached for more power gathered it in and hoped i hadnt spun around without noticing i pushed my palms toward my feet just as my lungs forced me to exhale and shouted with it forzare naked force lashed out toward my feet bruising one leg as it swept past even in magic you cant totally ignore physics and my action of exerting force down against the earth had the predictable equal and opposite reaction the earth exerted force up toward me and i flew out of the mud muck and water flying up with me in a cloud of spray i had a wild impression of mist and dreary ground and then a tree and then it was replaced with a teethrattling impact by the time id coughed out a mouthful of mud and choked air back into my lungs i had the presence of mind to wipe mud out of my eyes i found myself twenty feet off the ground dangling from the branches of one of the skeletal trees my arms and legs hung loosely beneath me and my jeans felt tight at the waist i tried to see how id gotten hung up that way but i couldnt i could possibly get a hand and a foot on different branches but i could barely wiggle and i couldnt get loose you foil a faerie queen i panted to myself survive your own execution get away from certain death and get stuck up a freaking tree i struggled some more just as uselessly one mudcovered boot fell off and hit the ground with a soggy plop god i hope no one sees you like this the sound of footsteps drifted out of the mist coming closer i pushed the heel of my hand against my right eyebrow some days you just cant win i folded my arms and had them sternly crossed over my chest when a tall shrouded form emerged from the mist below dark robes swirled a deep hood concealed and a gloved hand gripped a wooden staff the gatekeeper turned his head toward me and became still for a moment then he reached his other gloved hand into his hood he made a strangled muffled sound hi i said king of wit thats me the gatekeeper sounded as though he had to swallow half a gallon of laughter as he responded greetings wizard dresden am i interrupting anything my other boot fell off and plopped to the ground i regarded my dangling muddy sockfeet with pursed lips nothing all that important that is good he said he paced around a bit peering up at me and then said theres a broken branch through your belt get your right foot on the branch below you your left hand on the one above you and loosen your belt you should be able to climb down i did as he said and got my muddy self down from the tree and to earth thank you i said i privately thought to myself that id have been a hell of a lot more grateful about five minutes earlier what are you doing here looking for you he said youve been watching he shook his head call it listening but i have had glimpses of you and matters are worsening in chicago stars and stones i muttered and picked up my boots i dont have time to chat the gatekeeper put a gloved hand on my arm but you do he said my vision is limited but i know that you have accomplished your mission for the winter queen she will keep her end of the bargain grant us safe passage through her realm so far as the council is concerned that will be enough you would be safe i hesitated wizard dresden you could end your involvement in the matter you could choose to step clear of it right now it would end the trial my aching weary halfsmothered and dirty self liked that idea end it go home get a hot shower a bunch of hot food sleep it was impossible anyway i was only one tired beatup strungout guy wizard or not the faeries had way too many powers and tricks to deal with on a good day let alone on this one i knew what aurora was up to now but hell she was getting set to charge into the middle of a battlefield a battlefield furthermore that i had no idea how to even find much less survive the stone table had been in some weird pocket of the nevernever like nothing id ever felt before i had no idea how to reach it impossible painful way too dangerous i could call it a day get some sleep and hope i did better the next time i came up to the plate meryls face came to mind ugly and tired and resolute i also saw the statue of lily and elaine trapped by her situation but fighting things in her own way despite the odds against her i thought of taking the unraveling from mother winter able to think of nothing but using it for my own goals for helping susan now it would be used for something else entirely and as much as i wanted to forget about it and go home i would bear a measure of the responsibility for the consequences of its use if i did i shook my head and looked around until i spotted my bag jewelry staff and rod on the ground several yards away from the muddy bog aurora had created i recovered all of them no i said it isnt over no the gatekeeper said surprise in the tone why not because im an idiot i sighed and there are people in trouble wizard no one expects you to stop a war between the sidhe courts the council would assign no such responsibility to any one person to hell with the sidhe courts i said and to hell with the council too there are people i know in trouble and im the one who turned some of this loose ill clean it up youre sure the gatekeeper said you wont step out of the trial now my mudcrusted fingers fumbled with the clasp of my bracelet i wont the gatekeeper regarded me in silence for a moment and said then i will not vote against you a little chill went through me oh you would have had you walked away i would kill you myself i stared at him for a second and then asked why his voice came out soft and resolute but not unkind because voting against you would have been the same thing in any case it seems meet to me that i should take full responsibility for that choice rather than hiding behind council protocol i got the bracelet on then shoved my feet back into my boots well thanks for not killing me then if youll excuse me ive got somewhere to be yes the gatekeeper said he held out his hand a small velvet bag in it take these you may find a use for them i frowned at him and took the bag inside i found a little glass jar of some kind of brownish gel and a chip of greyish stone on a piece of fine silvery thread whats this an ointment for the eyes he said his tone became somewhat dry easier on the nerves than using the sight to see through the veils and glamours of the sidhe i lifted my eyebrows bits of drying mud fell into my eyes and made me blink okay and this rock a piece from the stone table he said it will show you the way to get there i blinked some more this time in surprise youre helping me that would constitute interfering in the trial he corrected me so far as anyone else is concerned i am merely seeing to it that the trial can reach its full conclusion i frowned at him if youd just given me the rock maybe i said the ointment is something else youre interfering the council would have a fit the gatekeeper sighed wizard dresden this is something i have never said before and do not anticipate saying again he leaned closer to me and i could see the shadows of his features gaunt and vague inside his hood one dark eye sparkled with something like humor as he offered his hand and whispered sometimes what the council does not know does not hurt it i found myself grinning i shook his hand he nodded hurry the council dare not interfere with internal affairs of the sidhe but we will do what we can he stretched out his staff and drew it in a circle in the air with barely a whisper of disturbance he opened the fabric between the nevernever and the mortal world as though his staff had simply drawn a circle of chicago to step intothe street outside my basement apartment specifically allah and good fortune go with you i nodded to him encouraged then i turned to the portal and stepped through it from that dark moor in faerie to my usual parking space at home hot summer air hit my face steamy and crackling with tension rain sleeted down and thunder shook the ground the light was already fading and dark was coming on i ignored them all and headed for my apartment the mud substance of the nevernever melted into a viscous goo that began evaporating at once assisted by the driving cleansing rain i had calls to make and i wanted to change into nonslimy clothes my fashion sense is somewhat stunted but i still had to wonder what do you wear to a war chapter twentynine i went with basic black i made my calls set an old doctors valise outside the front door got a quick shower and dressed in black a pair of old black militarystyle boots black jeans mostly clean a black tee black ball cap with a scarlet cocacola emblem on it and on top of everything my leather duster susan had given me the coat a while back complete with a mantle that falls to my elbows and an extra large portion of billow the weather was stormy enough both figuratively and literally to make me want the reassurance of the heavy coat i loaded up on the gear tooeverything id brought with me that morning plus the gatekeepers gifts and my homedefense cannon a heavycaliber longbarreled dirty harry magnum i debated carrying the gun on me and decided against it id have to go through chicago to get to whatever point would lead me to the stone table and i didnt need to get arrested for a concealed carry i popped the gun case and all into my bag and hoped i wouldnt have to get to it in a hurry billy and the werewolves arrived maybe ten minutes later the minivan pulling up outside and beeping the horn i checked the doctor bag closed it and went out to the van my gym bag bumping against my side the side door rolled open and i stepped up to toss my gear in i hesitated upon seeing the van packed shoulder to shoulder with young people there were ten or eleven of them in there billy leaned over from the drivers seat and asked problem i said only volunteers i said i dont know how much trouble were going into right billy said i told them that the kids in the van murmured their agreement i blew out my breath okay people same rules as last time im calling the shots and if i give you an order you take it no arguments deal there was a round of solemn nods i nodded in reply and peered to the back of the dim van at a head of dull green hair meryl is that you the changeling girl gave me a solemn nod i want to help so does fix i caught a flash of white hair and dark nervous eyes from beside meryl the little man lifted a hand and gave me a twitching wave if you go along i said same rules as everyone else otherwise you stay here all right meryl said with a laconic nod yeah fix said okay i looked around at all of them and grimaced they looked so damned young or maybe it was just me feeling old i reminded myself that billy and the alphas had already had their baptism by fire and theyd had almost two years to hone their skills against some of the lowintensity riffraff of the chicago underground scene but i knew that they were getting in way over their heads on this one i needed them and theyd volunteered the trick was to make sure that i didnt lead them to a horrible death okay i said lets go billy pushed open the passenger door and georgia moved back to the crowded rear seats i got in beside billy and asked did you get them billy passed me a plastic bag from walmart yeah thats why it took so long to get here there was police tape all over and cops standing around thanks i said i tore open a package of orange plastic box knives and put them into the doctors valise then snapped it closed again then i took the grey stone from my pocket wrapped the thread it hung by around my hand and held my hand out in front of me palm down and level with my eyes lets go okay billy said giving me a skeptical look go where the grey stone quivered and twitched then it swung very definitely to the east drawing the string with it so that it hung at a slight angle rather than straight down i pointed the way the stone leaned and said thataway toward the lake got it billy said he pulled the van onto the street so where are we heading i grunted and stuck an index finger up up billy said his voice skeptical were going up i watched the stone it wobbled and i focused on it as i might on my own amulet it stabilized and leaned toward the lake without wavering or swaying on its string up there i clarified where up there lightning flashed and i pointed toward it there up there billy glanced at someone in the back and pursed his lips thoughtfully i hope you know a couple of streets i dont then he drove for a while more with me telling him to bear right or left at a stoplight the rain still pounding on the windshield wipers flicking steadily he asked so whats the score wellintentioned but dangerously insane bad guys are ahead coming down the stretch i said the faerie courts are duking it out up there and its probably going to be very hairy the summer lady is our baddie and the winter knight is her bitch she has a magic hankie shes going to use it to change a statue into a girl and kill her on a big flintstones table at midnight there were a couple of grunts as meryl pushed her way toward the front of the van a girl lily i glanced from the stone back to her and nodded we have to find aurora and stop her save the girl or what happens billy asked badness kaboom badness i shook my head mostly longer term than that like what how do you feel about ice ages billy whistled uh do you mind if i ask a few questions i kept my eyes on the chip of stone go ahead right billy said as i understand it aurora is trying to tear apart both of the faerie courts right yeah why i mean why not shoot for just winter so her side wins because she cant i said shes limited in her power she knows she doesnt have the strength it would take to force things on her own the queens and the mothers could stop her easily so shes using the only method she has open to her screwing up the balance of power billy said but shes doing it by giving a bunch of mojo to winter limits i said she cant move winters power around at all the way she can summers thats why she had to kill her own knight she knew she could pour his power out into a vessel of her choosing lily growled meryl i glanced over my shoulder at her and nodded someone who would trust her who wouldnt be able to protect herself against auroras enchantment so whyd she turn the girl to stone billy asked it was her cover i said the queens could have found an active knight but once lily was turned to stone the knights mantle was stuck in limbo aurora knew that everyone would suspect mab of doing something clever and that titania would be forced to prepare to fight mab would have to move in response and the pair of them would create the battleground around the stone table whats the table for pouring power into one of the courts i said it belongs to summer until midnight tonight after that any power that gets poured in goes to winter which is where were going now billy said uhhuh i said turn left at that light billy nodded so aurora steals the power and hides it which forces the queens to bring out the battleground with the big table right now aurora plans to take lily there and use the unraveling to free her of the stone curse shes under then she kills her and touches off faeriegeddon shes got to get to the table after midnight but before mabs forces actually take the ground around it that means shes only got a small window of opportunity and we need to stop her from using it i still dont get it billy said what the hell is she hoping to accomplish probably she thinks she can ride out the big war then shell put it all together again from the ashes just the way she wants it thank god shes not too arrogant or anything billy muttered it seems to me that mab is going to be handed a huge advantage in this why didnt aurora just work together with mab it probably never occurred to her to try it that way shes summer mab is winter the two dont work together small favors billy said so what do we do to help im going to have to move around through a battleground i need muscle to do it i dont want to stop to fight we just keep moving until i can get to the stone table and stop aurora and i want all of you changed before we go up there faeries are vindictive as hell and youre going to piss some of them off better if they never get to see your faces right billy said how many faeries are we talking about i squinted up at a particularly violent burst of lightning all of them the stone the gatekeeper had given me led us to the waterfront along burnham harbor billy parked the van on the street outside the wharves that had once been the lifeblood of the city and that still received an enormous amount of shipping every year halogen floodlights every couple of hundred feet made the docks into a silent still life behind a grid of chainlink fence i turned to the alphas and said all right folks before we go up ive got to put some ointment on your eyes it stinks but it will keep you from being taken in by most faerie glamours me first billy said at once i opened the little jar and smeared the dark ointment on under his eyes little halfmoons of dark greasy brown he checked his eyes in the mirror and said and i used to sneer at the football team get your game face on i said billy slipped out of the car and pitched his sweats and tshirt back in i got out of the van and opened the side door billy in his wolfshape came trotting around the side of the van and sat nearby as i smeared the greasy ointment on the eyes of all the alphas it was a little unnerving to me anyway they were all naked as i did it shimmering into wolfform as soon as i had finished and joining billy outside one of the girls a redhead who had been daintily plump now looked like something from a mens magazine she gave me a somewhat satisfied smile as i noticed and the next a petite girl with mousy brown hair and a long scar on her shoulder held her dress against her front and confided shes been impossible this year as i smeared ointment on her half a dozen young men and another half a dozen young women all told made for a lot of wolf they waited patiently as i slapped the ointment on fix then meryl and finally myself i used the very last of it and blew out a deep breath i put on my gun on a hip rig instead of a shoulder holster and hoped that the rain and my duster would conceal it from any passing observation then i drew my pentacle out to lie on my shirt gathered up my staff and rod slipping the latter through the straps on the doctors bag and picked it up i juggled things around for a moment until i could get the grey stone on its thread out and into my hand and thought that maybe elaine had the right idea when it came to going with smaller magical foci i had just gotten out into the rain when the wolves all looked out into the night at once one of them i think billy let out a bark and they scattered leaving me and meryl and fix standing there alone in the rain wwhat fix stammered what happened where did they go meryl said they must have heard something she reached back into the minivan and came out with a machete and a wood axe then she pulled out a heavy denim jacket that had been festooned in layers of what looked like silverware it rattled as she put it on no chain mail i asked fix fussed with a fork that was sticking out too far and said in an apologetic tone best i could do on short notice its steel though so you know it will be harder for anything to bite her he hopped back into the minivan and came out with a bulky toolbox that looked heavy as hell the little guy lifted it to his shoulder as though he did it all the time and licked his lips what do we do i checked the stone which still pointed at the lake we move forward if theres something out there billy will let us know fix gulped his frizzy white hair slowly being plastered to his head by the rain are you sure stay close to me fix meryl said how are we going to go that way dresden theres a fence harbor security too i had no idea but i didnt want to say that i headed for the nearest gate instead come on we got to the gate and found it open a broken chain dangled from one edge part of the shattered link lay on the ground nearby the ends had been twisted not cut and steam curled up from them in a little hissing cloud where raindrops touched broken i said and not long ago this rain would cool the metal down fast not by a faerie either meryl said quietly they dont like to come close to a fence like this silly fix sniffed a cheap set of bolt cutters would have been better than just breaking a perfectly good chain yeah nasties can be irrational that way i said the stone continued to lean out toward the end of one of the long wharves thrusting into the lake out that way we went through the gate and had gone maybe twenty feet before the halogen floodlights went out leaving us in stormdrenched blackness i fumbled for my amulet with cold fingers but fix and meryl both beat me to it fixs toolbox thunked down and a moment later he stood up with a heavyduty flashlight at almost the same time there was a crackle of plastic and meryl shook the tube of a chemical light into eerie green luminescence a gunshot barked sharp and loud and meryl jerked and staggered to one side she looked down at blood spreading over her jeans her expression one of startled shock down i said and hit her at the waist bearing her to the ground as the gun barked again i grabbed at the glow stick and shoved it into my coat put out those lights fix fumbled with the flashlight as another shot rang out sending a sputter of sparks from his toolbox fix yelped and dropped the light it rolled over to one side slewing a cone of illumination out behind us the light spilled over the form of the tigress the ghoul assassin not even bothering to try a human shape now in her natural form she was a hunchshouldered greyskinned fiend something blending the worst features of mankind hyena and baboon short wiry red hairs prickled over her whole body her legs were stunted and strong her arms too long and her hands tipped in spurs of bone that replaced nails her hair hung about her head in a soggy matted lump and her eyes furious as she came running forward glared with malice pink and grey scars stood out against her skin swollen areas where shed healed all the damage murphy had inflicted on her the night before she flew toward us over the ground running with all four limbs mouth gaping wide she didnt see the alphas closing in behind her the first wolf black grease still in halfcircles under its eyes hit her right leg a quick snapping jerking motion of its jaws the ghoul shrieked in surprise and fell tumbling she regained her feet quickly and struck out at the wolf who had bloodied her but the big grey beast rolled aside as a taller tawnier wolf leapt over him the second wolf took the ghouls other leg bounding away when the ghoul turned on it while a third wolf darted in at the tigresss back the ghoul screamed and tried to run again the wolves didnt let her i watched as another wolf slammed into her knocking her down she rolled to her front but shed been hamstrung and her legs were now useless weight claws flashed out and drew flecks of blood but the wolf shed hit scrambled onto her back jaws closing in on the back of the ghouls neck she let out a last frantic gurgling scream then the werewolves buried her in a tide of fur and flashing fangs when they drew away half a minute later i couldnt have recognized the remains for what they were my stomach curled up on itself and i forced myself to look away before i started throwing up i grabbed meryl underneath her arms and started tugging her toward the nearest warehouse i snarled help me at fix and he pitched in surprisingly strong oh god fix whimpered oh god meryl oh god its not bad meryl panted as we dragged her around a corner of the building it isnt too bad fix i got out the glow stick and checked her jeans were stained with blood black in the green light but not as badly as they should have been i found a long tear along the fabric of one leg and whistled lucky i said grazed you doesnt look like its bleeding too bad i poked at her leg can you feel that she winced good i said stay here fix stay with her i left my bag there and unlimbered my gun i kept it pointed at the ground and made sure my shield bracelet was ready to go gathering energy into it in order to shield myself from any more rifle shots i didnt raise the gun to level i didnt want it to go off accidentally and bounce a bullet off my own shield and into my head as i stepped around the corner i heard a short scream and then a series of sharp barks one of the wolves appeared in the cone of fixs fallen light picked it up in his mouth and trotted toward me all clear i asked the wolf ducked his head in a couple of quick nods and dropped the flashlight on my foot i picked it up the wolf barked again and started off toward the wharf i frowned at him and said you want me to follow you he rolled his eyes and nodded again i started off after him if it turns out that timmys stuck down the well im going home the wolf led me to the wharf the stone had pointed to and there i found a young man in dark slacks and a white jacket on the ground in a circle of wolves he held one bleeding hand against his belly and was panting a rifle lay on the ground nearby next to a broken pair of sunglasses he looked up at me and grimaced his face pale behind his goatee ace i said i shook my head you were the one who hired the ghoul i dont know what youre talking about he lied get these things away from me dresden let me go im running late ace or id have the patience for more chitchat i nodded at the nearest wolf and said tear his nose off ace screamed and fell back covering his face with both arms i winked at the wolf and stepped forward to stand over the changeling or maybe his ears or toes what do you think ace whats going to make you talk fastest or should i just try them all one at a time go to hell ace gasped you can do whatever you want but im not talking go to hell dresden footsteps came up behind us meryl limped close enough to see ace and then just stood there for a minute staring at him fix followed her staring ace fix said you you shot meryl the bearded changeling swallowed and lowered his arms looking at meryl and fix im sorry meryl it was an accident i wasnt aiming at you the greenhaired changeling stared at ace and said you were trying to kill dresden the only one besides ron who has ever taken a step out of his way to help us the only one who can help lily i didnt want to but that was their price whose price meryl asked in a monotone ace licked his lips eyes flicking around nervously i cant tell you theyll kill me meryl stepped forward and kicked him in the belly hard ace doubled over and threw up gasping and twitching and sobbing he couldnt get enough breath to cry out whose price meryl asked again when ace didnt speak she shifted her weight as though to repeat the kick and he cried out wait he whimpered wait im done waiting meryl said god ill tell you ill tell you meryl it was the vampires the reds i was trying to get protection from slate from that bitch maeve they said if i got rid of the wizard theyd fix it bastards i muttered so you hired the tigress i didnt have a choice ace whined if i hadnt done it theyd have taken me themselves you had a choice ace fix said quietly i shook my head how did you know wed be coming here the reds ace said they told me where youd show up they didnt say you wouldnt be alone meryl please im sorry she faced him without expression shut up ace look he said look lets get out of here all right the three of us we can get clear of this we need to before we cant help it anymore i dont know what youre talking about meryl said you do ace said leaning up toward meryl his eyes intent you feel it you hear her calling us you feel it just like i do the queen calls us all of winters blood she calls meryl said but im not answering if you dont want to run then we should think about what were going to do after this battle is over maeve and slate are just going to come for us again but if we declare a loyalty if we choose meryl kicked ace in the stomach again you worthless trash all you ever think of is yourself get out of my sight before i kill you ace gagged and tried to protest but meryl snarled now the force of the word made ace flinch away and he turned it into a scramble before rising to run the wolves all looked at me but i shook my head let him go meryl shrugged her shoulders and lifted her face to the rain you okay fix asked her have to be she said maybe it was just me but her voice sounded a little lower rougher trollier gulp lets move wizard yeah i said uh yeah i lifted the gatekeepers stone and followed it down the wharf to the last pier then down to the end of the last pier empty of any ships or boats a dozen wolves and two changelings followed me nothing but the cold waters of lake michigan and a rolling thunderstorm surrounded me at the end of the pier and the stone twitched swinging almost to the horizontal on its pale thread no kidding i muttered i know its up i reached out a hand and felt something a tingle of energy dancing and swirling in front of me i reached a bit further and it became more tangible solid i drew up a little of my will and sent it out toward that force a gentle surge of energy brilliant light flickering through opalescent shades rose up in front of me as bright as the full moon and as solid as ice the light resolved itself into the starry outline of stairs stairs that began at the end of the pier and climbed into the storm above i stepped forward and put one foot on the lowest step it bore my weight leaving me standing on a block of translucent moonlight over the windtossed waters of lake michigan wow fix breathed we go up that meryl asked woof said billy the werewolf while were young i said and took the next step come on chapter thirty sometimes the most remarkable things seem commonplace i mean when you think about it jet travel is pretty freaking remarkable you get in a plane it defies the gravity of an entire planet by exploiting a loophole with air pressure and it flies across distances that would take months or years to cross by any means of travel that has been significant for more than a century or three you hurtle above the earth at enough speed to kill you instantly should you bump into something and you can only breathe because someone built you a really good tin can that has seams tight enough to hold in a decent amount of air hundreds of millions of manhours of work and struggle and research blood sweat tears and lives have gone into the history of air travel and it has totally revolutionized the face of our planet and societies but get on any flight in the country and i absolutely promise you that you will find someone who in the face of all that incredible achievement will be willing to complain about the drinks the drinks people that was me on the staircase to chicagooverchicago yes i was standing on nothing but congealed starlight yes i was walking up through a savage storm the wind threatening to tear me off and throw me into the freezing waters of lake michigan far below yes i was using a legendary and enchanted means of travel to transcend the border between one dimension and the next and on my way to an epic struggle between ancient and elemental forces but all i could think to say between panting breaths was yeah sure they couldnt possibly have made this an escalator long story short we climbed about a mile of stairs and came out in the land my godmother had shown me before standing on the storm clouds over chicago but it didnt look like it had before the opening curtain what had once been rolling and silent terrain sculpted of cloud smooth and naked as a dressing dummy had now been filled with sound color and violence the storm below that battlefield was a pale reflection of the one raging upon it we emerged on one of the hills looking down into the valley of the stone table and the hillside around us lit with flashes of lightning in the clouds beneath was covered in faeries of all sizes and descriptions sounds rang through the airthe crackling snap of lightning and the roar of thunder following trumpets high and sweet deep and brassy drums beat to a dozen different cadences that both clashed and rumbled in time with one another shouts and cries rang out in time with those drums shrieks that might have come from human throats together with bellows and roars that couldnt have taken as a whole it was its own wild storm of music huge teethrattling overwhelming and charged with adrenaline wagner wished he could have had it so good not twenty feet away stood a crowd of short brownskinned whitehaired little guys their hands and feet twice as large as they should have been bulbous noses the size of lightbulbs behind helmets made out of what looked like some kind of bone they wore bone armor and bore shields and weaponry and stood in rank and file their eyes widened as i came up out of the clouds in my billowing black duster leather slick with rain billy and the werewolves surrounded me in a loose ring as they emerged and fix and meryl pressed up close behind me on the other side of us stood a troll a good eight feet tall its skin upholstered in knobby hairy warts lank hair hanging greasily past its massive shoulders tiny red eyes glaring from beneath its single craggy brow its nostrils flared out and it turned toward me drool dribbling from its lips but the wolves crouched down around me snarling the troll blinked at them for a long moment while it processed a thought and then turned away as though disinterested more creatures stood within a long stones throw including a group of sidhe knights completely encased in faerie armor and mounted on longlegged warhorses of deep blue violet and black a wounded sylph crouched nearby and would have looked like a lovely winged girl from fifty yards awaybut from there i could see her bloodied claws and the glittering razor edge of her wings i couldnt see the whole of the valley below some kind of mist or haze lay over it and only gave me the occasional glimpse of whirling masses of troops and beings ranks of somewhat human things massed together against one another while other beings some of which could only be called monsters rose up above the rest slamming together in titanic conflicts that crushed those around them as mere circumstantial casualties more important i couldnt see the stone table and i couldnt even make a decent guess as to where i was standing in relation to where it should have been the stone the gatekeeper had given me leaned steadily in one direction but that led straight down into the madness below us what next meryl yelled at me she had to shout though she was only a few feet awayand we were standing above the real fury of the battle below i shook my head and started to answer but fix tugged on my sleeve and piped something that got swallowed by the sounds of battle i looked to where he was pointing and saw one of the mounted sidhe knights leave the others and come riding toward us he raised the visor of his helmet an oddly decorated piece that somehow seemed insectoid pale faerie skin and golden cateyes regarded us from atop the steed for a moment before he inclined his head to me and lifted a hand the sounds of battle immediately cut off boom like someone had turned off a radio and the silence threatened to put me off balance emissary the sidhe knight said i greet thee and thy companions greetings warrior i said in response i needs must speak with queen mab posthaste he nodded and said i will guide thee follow and bid thy companions put away their weapons ere we approach her majesty i nodded and said to those with me put the teeth and cutlery away folks we need to play nice a while longer we followed the knight up the slope of the hill to its top where the air grew cold enough to sting i gathered my coat a little closer around me and could almost see the crystals of ice forming on my eyelashes i just had to hope that my hair wouldnt freeze and break off mab sat upon a white horse at the top of the hill her hair down rolling in silken waves to blend in with the mane and tail of her horse she was clothed in a gown of white silk the sleeves and trains falling in gentle sweeps to brush the cloudy ground at her steeds feet her lips and eyelashes were blue her eyes as white as moonlight clouds the sheer cold cruel beauty of her made my heart falter and my stomach flutter nervously the air around her vibrated with power and shone with cold white and blue light oh my god fix whispered i glanced back the werewolves were simply staring at mab much as fix was meryl regarded her from behind a forced mask of neutrality but her eyes were alight with something wild and eager steady folks i said and stepped forward the faerie queen turned her regard to me and murmured my emissary you have found the thief i inclined my head to her yes queen mab the summer lady aurora mabs eyes widened enough that i got the impression that she understood the whole of the matter from that one fact indeed and can you bring proof of this to us if i move swiftly i said i must reach the stone table before midnight mabs empty eyes flickered to the stars above and i thought i saw a hint of worry in them they move swiftly this night wizard she paused and then breathed out almost to herself time himself runs against thee what can be done to get me there mab shook her head and regarded the field below us again one entire swath of the battlefield flooded with a sudden golden radiance mab lifted her hand and the aura around her flashed with a cerulean fire the air thickening that flame lashed out against the gold and the two clashed in a shower of emerald energy canceling one another out mab lowered her hand and turned to look at me again her eyes fell on the chip of stone on its pale thread and widened again rashid what is his interest in this matter uh i said certainly he isnt uh you know it isnt like hes representing the council and theyre interfering mab took her eyes from the battle long enough to give me a look that said quite clearly that i was an idiot i know that and your ointment its his recipe i recognize the smell he helped me find this place yes mabs lips twitched at the corners so what does the old desert fox have in mind this time she shook her head and said no matter the stone cannot lead you to the table the direct route would place you in the path of battle enough to destroy any mortal you must go another way im listening she looked up and said queen of the air i may be but these skies are still contested titania is at the height of her powers and i at the ebb of mine not that way she pointed to the field all weirdly lighted mist in gold and blue green mist swirling with violence where they met and summer gains ground despite all our knight has not taken the field with us he has been seduced i presume yes i said hes with aurora mab murmured thats the last time i let maeve hire the help i indulge her too much she lifted her hand evidently a signal and scores of bats the size of hang gliders swarmed up from somewhere behind her launching themselves in a webwinged cloud into the skies above we yet hold the river wizard though we lose ground on both sides now thy godmother and my daughter have concentrated upon it but reach the river and it will take thee through the battle to the hill of the stone table get to the river i said right i can do that those who are mine know of thee wizard mab said give them no cause and they will not hamper thee she turned away from me her attention back upon the battle and the sound of it came crashing back in like a pentup tide i turned from her and went back to the werewolves and the changelings we get to the river i shouted to them try to stay in the blue mist and dont start a fight with anything i started downhill which as far as i know is the easiest way to find water we passed through hundreds more troops most of them units evidently recovering from the first shock of battle scarlet and blueskinned ogres in faerie mail towered over me their blood almost dull compared to their skin and armor another unit of brownskinned gnomes tended to their wounded with bandages of some kind of moss a group of sylphs crouched over a mound of bloody stinking carrion squabbling like vultures blood all over their faces breasts and dragonfly wings another troop of battered lanternjawed burly humanoids with wide batlike ears goblins dragged their dead and some of their wounded over to the sylphs tossing them onto the carrion pile with businesslike efficiency despite their fellows feeble screeches and yowls my stomach heaved i fought down both fear and revulsion and struggled to block out the images of nightmarish carnage around me i kept moving ahead driving my steps with a sense of purpose i didnt wholly feel and kept the werewolves moving i could only imagine that it all was worse for billy and georgia and the restwhatever i saw and heard and smelled they were getting it a lot worse through their enhanced senses i called encouragement to them though i had no idea if they could hear me through the din and no idea if it did them any good but it seemed like something i should do since id dragged them here with me i tried to walk on one side of fix screen out some of the worst sights around me meryl gave me a grateful nod ahead of us the bluish mists began to give way to murky shades of green faerie steel chimed and rasped on faerie steel and the shrieks and cries of battle grew even louder more important amid the screams and shouts i could hear water splashing we were near the river okay folks i shotted we run forward and get to the river dont stop to slug it out with anyone dont stop until youre standing in the water or i thought until some faerie soldier rips your legs off and i ran forward into the proverbial fray chapter thirtyone an angry buzzing sound arose from the musical din of battle ahead of us and grew louder as we moved forward i saw another group of goblin soldiers crouched in a ragged square formation the goblins on the outside of the square tried to hold up shields against whistling arrows that came flickering through the mist over the water while those within wielded spears against the source of the buzzing soundabout fifty bumblebees as big as park benches hovering and darting i could see a dozen goblins on the ground wracked with the spasms of poison or simply dead white and greenfeathered arrows protruding from throats and eyes a dozen of the jumbo bees peeled off from the goblins and came toward us wings singing like a shop class of band saws holy moly fix shouted billy the werewolf let out a shocked woof get behind me i shouted and dropped everything but my staff and rod the bees oriented on me and came zipping toward me the wind stirred up by their wings tearing at the misty ground like the downblast of a helicopter i held my staff out in front of me gathering my will and pushing it into the focus i hardened my will into a shield sending it through the staff focusing on building a wall of naked force to repel the oncoming bees i held the strike until they were close enough to see the facets of their eyes swept my staff from right to left and cried forzare a curtain of blazing scarlet energy whirled into place in front of me and it slammed into the oncoming bees like a giant windshield they went bouncing off of it with heavy thuds of impact several of the bees crashlanded and lay on the ground stunned but two or three veered off at the last second circling for another attack i lifted my blasting rod tracking the nearest i gathered up more of my will and snarled fuego a lance of crimson energy white at the core leapt out from the tip of the blasting rod and scythed across the giant bees path my fire caught it across the wings and burned them to vapor the bee dropped part of one wing making it spin in a fluttering spiral that slammed into the ground on the bank of the river the other two retreated and their fellows attacking the goblins followed suit the green tones faded from the mist at the edge of the river which deepened to blue the goblins let out a rasping snarling cheer i looked around me and found fix and meryl staring at me with wide eyes fix swallowed and i saw his mouth form the word wow i all but tore my hair out in frustration go i shouted and started running for the water pushing and tugging at them to get them moving go go go we were ten feet from shore when i heard hoofbeats sweeping toward the river from the far side i looked up to see horses sailing through the mistnot flying horses but longlegged faerie steeds coats and manes shining golden and green that had simply leapt from the far side of the river bearing their riders with them on the lead horse the first whose hooves touched the ground on our side of the river was the winter knight lloyd slate was spattered in liquids of various colors that could only be blood he bore a sword in one hand the reins to his mount in the other and he was laughing even as he landed the nearby goblins mounted a charge slate turned toward them sword whirling and gathering with it a howl of freezing winds its blade riming with ice he met the first goblins sword with his own and the squat faerie soldiers blade shattered slate shifted his shoulders and sent his horse leaping a few feet to one side behind him the goblins head toppled from its shoulders which spouted greenish blood for a few seconds before the body fell beside the head on the misty ground the remaining goblins retreated and slate whirled his steed around to face me wizard he shouted laughing still alive more faerie steeds leapt the river summer sidhe warriors touching down behind slate in helmets and mail in a riot of wildflower colors one of them was talos in his dark mail also stained with blood and bearing a slender sword spattered in so many colors of liquid that it looked as if it had cut the throat of a baby rainbow aurora landed as well her battlegown shining and a moment later there was a thunder of bigger hooves and a grunt of effort and korrick landed on our side of the river his hooves driving deep into the ground strapped onto the centaurs shoulders both human and equine was the stone statue of the kneeling girllily now the summer knight aurora drew up short and her eyes widened her horse must have sensed her disturbance because it halfreared and danced nervously left and right the summer lady lifted her hand and once more the roar of battle abruptly ceased you she half whispered give me the unraveling and let the girl go aurora its over the summer ladys eyes glittered green and too bright she looked up at the stars and then back to me with that same toointense pressure to her gaze and i began to understand bad enough that she was one of the sidhe already alien to mortal kind bad enough that she was a faerie queen driven by goals i didnt fully understand following rules i could only just begin to grasp she was also mad loopy as a crochet convention the hour is here wizard she hissed winters rebirthand the end of this pointless cycle over indeed mab knows aurora i said titania will soon know theres no point to this anymore they wont let you do it aurora let her head fall back as she laughed the sound piercingly sweet it set my nerves to jangling and i had to push it back from my thoughts with an effort of will the werewolves and the changelings didnt do so well the wolves flinched back with highpitched whimpers and frightened growls and fix and meryl actually fell to their knees clutching at their ears they cannot stop me wizard aurora said that mad laughter still bubbling through her words and neither can you her eyes blazed and she pointed her finger at me korrick with me the rest of you kill harry dresden kill them all she turned and started down the river golden light burning through the blue mist in a twentyfoot circle around her and the centaur followed leaving the battle roar the horns and the drums the screams and the shrieks the music and the terror to come thundering back over us the sidhe warriors a score of them focused on me and drew swords or lifted long spears in their hands talos in his spellrepelling mail that had enabled him to impersonate an ogre shook colors from his blade and focused on me with deadly feline intensity slate let out another laugh spinning his sword arrogantly in his hand around me i heard the werewolves crouch down growls bubbling up in their throats meryl gathered herself to her feet blood running from her ears and took her axe in one big hand drawing her machete into the other fix his ears bleeding his face pale and resolved opened his toolbox with shaking hands and drew out a great big old greasestained monkey wrench i gripped my staff and blasting rod and planted my feet i called my power to me lifted my staff and smote it against the ground power crackled along its length and rumbled like thunder through the ground frightening the faerie mounts into restlessness slate leveled his sword at me and let out a cry taking the panicked animal from a frightened rear to a full frontal charge around him the warriors of the summer court followed the light of stars and moon glittering on their swords and armor horses screaming surging toward us like a deadly bejeweled tide the werewolves let out a fullthroated howl eerie and savage meryl screamed wild and loud and even fix let out a tinny battle shriek the noise was deafening and no one could have heard me anyway as i let out my own battle cry which i figured was worth a shot what the hell i dont believe in faeries chapter thirtytwo cavalry charges are all about momentum you get a ton of furious horse and warrior going in one direction and flatten everything in your way as the sidhe cavalry came thundering toward us along the banks of the river and as my heart pounded in my chest and my legs started shaking in naked fear i knew that if i wanted to survive the next few seconds i had to find a way to steal that momentum and use it for myself i dropped my blasting rod to grip my staff in both hand and extend it before me the moment i did sidhe riders began making swift warding gestures accompanied by staccato bursts of magical pressure separate protective charms rising up before each of them to block whatever magic i was about to throw the horses however didnt do any such thing i raised a shield but not in a wall in front of me such a warding would have brought the faerie nobles into contact with it and no one wizard could hold a spell against the wills of a score of faerie lords i brought up a shield only a couple of feet high and stretched it in a ribbon across the ground at the feet of slates mount the winter knights steed a giant greygreen beast never knew what hit it the low wall id called up clipped it at the knees and it came crashing down to the misty earth with a scream dragging slate down with it talos on slates right could not react in time to stop his mount or to avoid the wall but he threw himself clear as his horse went down dropped into a roll as nimble and precise as any martial arts movie aficionado could desire and came up on his feet he spun a dancelike step somehow in time with the vast song of the battlefield and his sword came whipping at my head dimly i heard other horses screaming tripping not only on my wall but on one another now but i had no idea how well the spell had worked on the rest of the sidhe warriors i was too busy ducking taloss first swing and backing out of range of the next meryl stepped between us and caught taloss sword in the x formed by her axe and machete she strained against summers lord marshal leaning her whole body into the effort muscles quivering id felt exactly how strong the changeling girl was but talos simply pressed against that strength his face composed slowly overcoming her why do you do this changeling child talos called you who have struggled against winter so long it is useless stand aside i wish no harm to thee like you wish no harm to lily meryl shouted how can you do that to her it does not please me child but it is not for me to decide talos answered she is my queen shes not mine meryl snarled and drove her forehead forward into taloss nose she struck him hard enough that i heard the impact and it drove the faerie lord back several staggered paces she didnt see slate come up from the ground a few feet away and make a quick squatting lunge at her flank meryl i shouted into the tumult look out she didnt hear me the winter knights sword bit into her just below her lowest rib and she took more than a foot of frostcovered steel thrusting up and back slates sword tore through her and came out through her jacket and the flatware coating it emerging like some bloody blade of grass she faltered her mouth opening in a gasp both axe and machete fell from her hands meryl fix screamed nearby slate laughed and said something i couldnt hear then he twisted the blade with a wrenching pop and whipped it back out meryl stared at him and reached out a hand slate slapped it contemptuously aside and turned his back on her she fell limply down i felt the rage rising and climbed back to my feet gripping my staff in both hands slate reached down and dragged talos up from the ground with one hand slate i shouted slate you murdering bastard the winter knights head whipped around toward me his sword came up to guard taloss eyes widened and his fingers made a series of swift warding gestures i gathered my rage together and reached down into the ground beneath me found the fury of the storm within it that matched my own i thrust the end of my staff down into the misty cloudground as if id been driving a hole through a frozen lake then extended my right hand toward the winter knight ventas i shouted ventas fulmino the fury of the storm beneath us reared up through the wood of my staff electricity rising in a buzzing roar of light and energy coming up from the ground and spiraling around the staff and across my body it whirled down my extended right arm a serpent of bluewhite lightning hesitated for a second and then lashed across the space between me and the tip of lloyd slates sword fastening onto the blade and bathing slate in a writhing coruscation of azure sparks slates body jerked his back arching violently thunder tore the air apart as the bolt of lightning struck home throwing slate into the air and hurling him violently to the ground the shock wave of the thunder knocked me down together with everyone else in the immediate area everyone except talos the lord marshal of summer braced himself against the concussion lifting one hand before his eyes as if it had been a stiff breeze then in the deafening silence that came after he lifted his sword and came straight toward me i reached for my blasting rod on the ground not far away lifted it and threw a quick lash of fire at talos the sidhe lord didnt even bother to gesture it aside it splashed against him and away and with a sweep of his sword he sent my blasting rod spinning from my grasp i lifted my staff as a feeble shield with my left hand and he struck that away as well some of my hearing returned enough for me to hear him say and so it ends youre damned right i muttered look down he did id drawn my in my right hand while hed knocked the staff out of my left i braced my right elbow against the ground and pulled the trigger a second roar of thunder sharper than the first blossomed out from the end of the gun i dont think the bullet penetrated the dark faerie mail because it didnt tear through talos like it should have it hit him like a sledgehammer instead driving him back and toppling him to the ground he lay there for a moment stunned it was cheap but i was in a freaking war and i was more than a little angry i kicked him in the face with the heel of my boot and then i leaned down and clubbed him with the heavy barrel of the until his stunned attempts to defend himself ceased and he lay still the skin of his face burned and blistered where the steel of the guns barrel stuck him i looked up in time to see lloyd slate his right arm dangling uselessly swing the broken haft of a spear at my head there was a flash of light and pain and i fell back on the ground too stunned to know how badly id been hit i tried to bring the gun to bear again but slate took it from my hand spun it around a finger and lowered the barrel toward my head already thumbing the hammer back i saw the gun coming down and saw as well that slate wasnt going to pause for dramatic dialogue the second i saw the dark circle of the barrel i threw myself to one side lifting my arms the gun roared and i waited for a light at the end of what i was pretty sure would be a downward sloping tunnel slate missed a ferocious highpitched shriek of fury made him whip his head to one side as a new attacker entered the fray fix brought his monkey wrench down in a twohanded swing that ended at lloyd slates wrist there was a crunch of impact of the delicate bones there snapping and my gun went flying into the water slate let out a snarl and swung his broken arm at fix but the little guy was quick he met the blow with the monkey wrench held in both hands and it was slate who screamed and reeled from the blow you hurt her fix screamed his next swing hit slate in the side of his left kneecap and dropped the winter knight to the ground you hurt meryl slate tried to roll away but fix rained twohanded blows of the monkey wrench down on his back evidently whatever power it was that let slate shrug off a bolt of lightning had been expended or else it couldnt stand up to the cold steel of fixs weapon the little changeling pounded on slates back screaming at him until one of the blows landed on the back of his neck the winter knight went limp and lay utterly still fix came over to me and helped me up as he did wolves surrounded us several of them bloodied all of them with teeth bared i looked blearily over them to see the sidhe warriors regrouping dragging a couple of wounded one horse lay on the ground screaming the others had scattered and only one warrior was still mounted another slender sidhe in green armor and a masked helm weapons still in hand the sidhe prepared to charge us again help me fix pleaded hauling desperately at meryls shoulder i stepped up on wobbly legs but someone brushed past me billy naked and stained with bright faerie blood took meryl under the shoulders and dragged her back behind what protection the pack of werewolves offered this is going to be bad he said we had an edgetheir horses were terrified of us on foot i dont know how well well do almost everyones hurt hows harry dammit meryl growled thickly let me go it isnt all that bad see to the wizard if he goes down none of us are going home meryl fix said i thought you were hurt bad the changeling girl sat up her face pale her clothing drenched in blood most of it isnt mine she said and i knew she was lying how is he billy had sat me down on the ground at some point and i felt him poking at my head i flinched when it got painful sitting down helped and i started to put things together again his skull isnt broken billy said maybe a concussion i dont know give me a minute i said ill make it billy gripped my shoulder relief in the gesture right were going to have to run for it harry theres more fight coming toward us billy was right i could hear the sounds of more horses somewhere nearby in the mist and the hammering of hundreds of goblin boots striking the ground in step we cant run meryl said aurora still has lily billy said talk later here they come he blurred and dropped to all fours taking his wolfform again as we looked up and saw the sidhe warriors coming toward us the waters behind them abruptly erupted the still surface of the river boiling up and cavalry all dark blue sea green deep purple rose up from under the waves the riders were more sidhe warriors clad in warpedlooking armor decorated in stylized snowflakes there were only a dozen of them to the summer warriors score but they were mounted and attacking from behind they cut into the ranks of the summer warriors blades flickering led by a warrior in mail of purest white bearing a pale and coldlooking blade the summer warriors turned to fight but theyd been taken off guard and they knew it the leader of the winter attack cut down one warrior then turned to another hand spinning through a series of gestures cold power surged around that gesture and one of the summer warriors simply stopped moving the crackling in the air around him growing louder as crystals of ice seemed simply to erupt from the surface of his body and armor frozen from the inside out in seconds he was nothing but a slowly growing block of ice around a goldandgreen figure inside and the pale rider almost negligently nudged the horse into a solid kick the ice shattered into pieces and fell to the ground in a jumbled pile the pale rider took off her helmet and flashed me a brilliant girlish smile it was maeve the winter lady her green eyes bright with bloodlust dreadlocks bound close to her head she almost idly licked blood from her sword as another summer warrior fell to one knee his back to the water sword raised desperately against the riders confronting him the waters surged again and pale lovely arms reached out wrapping around his throat from behind i caught a glimpse of golden eyes and a greentoothed smile and then the warriors scream was cut off as he was dragged under the surface the summer warriors retreated swift and in concert the rest of the mounted winter warriors set out in pursuit your godmother sends her greetings maeve called to me id have acted sooner but it would have been a fair fight and i avoid them i need to get to the table i called to her so i have been told maeve said she rode her horse over to lloyd slates unmoving form and her lovely young face opened into another brilliant smile my riders are attacking further down the river drawing summer forces that way you should be able to run upstream she leaned down and purred hello lloyd we should have a talk come on then grunted meryl can you walk wizard in answer i pushed myself to my feet meryl stood too though i saw her face twist with pain as she did fix hefted his bloodied monkey wrench i recovered my staff but my blasting rod was nowhere to be seen the black doctor bag lay nearby and i recovered it taking time to check its contents before closing it again all right people lets go we started along the stream at a jog i didnt know how far we had to go everything around us was chaos and confusion once a cloud of pixies flew past us and i found another stretch over the river where spiders as big as footballs had spun webs trapping dozens of pixies in their strands a group of faerie hounds green and grey and savage went past hot on the heels of a long panther like being headed for the water arrows whistled past and everywhere lay the faerie dead and dying finally i felt the ground begin to rise and looked up to see the hill of the stone table before us i could even see korricks hulking form at the top as the centaur backed away from the stone figure of lily evidently just set upon the table aurora dismounted was a slender gleaming form looking down upon us with anger lily meryl called though her voice had gone thready fix whirled to look at her his eyes alarmed and meryl dropped to one knee her ugly honest face twisting in pain get her fix save her and get her home she looked around focusing on me youll help him you paid for it i said stay here stay down youve done enough she shook her head and said one thing more but she settled down on the ground hand pressed to her wounded side panting aurora said something sharp to korrick the centaur bowed his head to her and spear gripped in his hand came down the hill toward us crap i said billy this guy is a heavy hitter dont close with him see if you can keep him distracted billy barked in acknowledgment and the werewolves shot forward as the centaur descended fanning out around him and harrying his flanks and rear while their companions dodged his hooves and spear stay with meryl i told fix and scooted around the werewolves flanks heading up the hill toward the stone table i got close enough to the top to see aurora standing over the statue of lily she held mother winters unraveling in her fingers pressed against the statue and she was tugging sharply at the strands beginning to pull it to pieces i felt something as she did a kind of dark gravity that jerked at my wizards senses with sharp raking fingers the unraveling began to come apart strand by strand and line by line under auroras slender hands i stretched out my hand adrenaline and pain giving me plenty of fuel for the magic and called ventas servitas wind leapt out in a sudden spurt seizing the unraveling and tearing it from auroras fingers sending it spinning through the air toward me i caught it stuck my tongue out at aurora yelled meep meep and ran like hell damn thee wizard screamed aurora and the sound raked at me with jagged talons she lifted her hands and shouted something else and the ground itself shook throwing me off my feet i landed and rolled as best i could down the hill until i reached the bottom it took me a second to drag in a breath then i rolled to my back to sit up sudden wind slashed at me slamming me back down to the earth and tore the unraveling from my hands i looked up to see aurora take the bit of cloth from the air with casual contempt and start back up the hill i struggled to sit up and follow but the wind kept me pinned there unable to rise from the ground no more interruptions aurora spat and gestured with one hand the ground screamed from it writhing up with whipping ferocious motion came a thick hedge of thorns as long as my hand it rose into place in a ring around the waist of the hill so dense that i couldnt see aurora behind it i fought against auroras spell but couldnt overcome it physically and i didnt even bother to try to rip it to shreds with sheer main magical strength i stopped struggling and closed my eyes to begin to feel my way through it to take it apart from the inside but even as i did fix started screaming harry harry help one of the werewolves let loose a highpitched scream of agony and then another my concentration wavered and i struggled to regain it those people were here because of me and i would be damned if i would let anything more happen to them i tried to hang on to the focus the detachment i would need to concentrate to unravel auroras spell but my fear and my anger and my worry made it all but impossible they would have lent strength to a spell but this was delicate work and now my emotions so often a source of strength only got in the way then hooves galloped up striking the ground near me i looked up to see the warrior in green armor the only rider of those original sidhe cavalry to stay mounted standing over me horse stamping spear leveled at my head dont i said wait but the rider ignored me lifted the spear its tip gleaming in the silver light and drove it down at my unprotected throat chapter thirtythree the spear drove into the earth beside my neck and the rider hissed in an impatient female voice hold still she swung down from the faerie steed reached up and took off the masked helm elaines wheatbrown hair spilled down escaping from the bun it had been tied in and she jerked it all the way down irritably hold still ill get that off you elaine i said i went through a bunch of heated emotions and i didnt have time for any of them id say i was glad to see you but im not sure thats because you always were a little dense harry she said her voice tart then she smoothed her features over her eyes falling half closed and spread her gloved hands over my chest she muttered something to herself and then said here samanyana there was a surge of gentle power and the wind pinning me to the ground abruptly vanished i pushed myself back to my feet all right she said lets get out of here no i said im not done i recovered my valise and my staff i need to get through those thorns you cant elaine said harry i know this spell those thorns arent just pointy theyre poisonous if one of them scratches you youll be paralyzed in a couple of minutes two or three will kill you i scowled at the barrier and settled my grip on my staff and they wont burn either elaine added oh i ground my teeth ill just force them aside then thatll be like holding open a screen door harry theyll just fall back into place when your concentration wavers then it wont waver you cant do it harry elaine said if you start pushing through aurora will sense it and shell tear you apart if youre holding the thorns off you you wont be able to defend yourself i lowered my staff and looked from the thorns back to elaine all right i said then youll have to hold them off me elaines eyes widened what you hold the thorns back ill go through youre going to go up against aurora alone and youre going to help me i said elaine bit her lip looking away from me come on elaine i said youve already betrayed her and i am going through those thorns with your help or without it i dont know yeah you do i said if you were going to kill me youve already had your chance and if aurora finishes what shes doing im dead anyway you dont understand i know i dont i snapped i dont understand why youre helping her i dont understand how you can stand by and let her do the things shes done i dont understand how you can stand here and let that girl die i let that sink in for a second before i added quietly and i dont understand how you could betray me like that again for all you know elaine said it will happen a third time ill let those thorns close on you halfway through and kill you for her maybe so i said but i dont want to believe that elaine we loved each other once upon a time i know you arent a coward and you arent a killer i want to believe that what we had really meant something even now that i can trust you with my life the way you can trust me with yours she let out a bitter little laugh and said you dont know what i am anymore harry she looked at me but i believe you i know i can trust you then help me she nodded and said youll have to run im not as strong as you and this is brute work i wont be able to lift it for long i nodded at her doubt nagged at me as i did what if she did it again elaine hadnt exactly been sterling in the upfronthonesty department i watched as she focused her lovely face going blank and felt her draw in her power folding her arms over her chest palms over either shoulder like an egyptian sarcophagus hell i had ten million ways to die all around me what was one over another at least this way if i went out id go out doing something worthwhile i turned and crouched bag and staff in hand elaine murmured something and a wind stirred around her lifting her hair around her head she opened her eyes though they remained distant unfocused and spread both hands to her sides wind lashed out in a column five feet around and drove into the wall of thorns the thorns shuddered and then began to give bending away from elaines spell go she gasped go hurry i ran the wind almost blinded me and i had to run crouched down hoping that none of my exposed skin would brush against any thorns i felt one sharp tug along my jacket but it didnt pierce the leather elaine didnt let me down after a few seconds i burst through the wall and came out in the clear on top of the hill of the stone table the table stood where it had been before but the runes and sigils scrawled over its surface now blazed with golden light aurora stood at the table fingers flying over the unraveling its threads pressed against the head of the statue of the kneeling girl still upon the table i circled a bit to one side to stay out of her peripheral vision and ran toward her when i was only a few feet away the unraveling suddenly exploded in a wash of cold white light the light washed over the statue in a wave and as it passed cold white marble warmed into flesh her stone waves of hair becoming emeraldgreen tresses lily opened her eyes and let out a gasp looking around dazedly aurora took lily by the throat drove the changeling down to the surface of the stone table with her hand and drew the knife from her belt it wasnt all that gentlemanly but i slugged the summer lady in the back with a twohanded swing of my staff as i did the stars evidently reached the right position and we reached midnight the end of the height of summer and the glowing runes on the table flared from golden light to cold cold blue the blow jarred the knife from auroras hand and it fell to the surface of the table lily let out a scream and got out from under auroras hand rolling across the tables surface and away from her aurora turned to me as fast as any of the other sidhe leaning back on the table and planting both feet against my chest she kicked hard and drove me back and before i was done rolling she had called a gout of fire and sent it roaring toward me i got to my knees and lifted my staff calling together my will in time to parry the strike deflecting the flame into the misty sky the red light of it fell on a green faerie steed leaping in the air above the thorns it didnt make it over the wall but fall twenty feet short screaming horribly as it landed on the poisoned thorns its rider didnt go down with it though talos his face bloodied leapt off the horses back did a neat flip in the air and came down inside the circle of thorns unscathed aurora let out a wild laugh and said kill him lord marshal talos drew his sword and came for me i thought the first blow was a thrust for my belly but hed suckered me and the sword darted to one side to send my staff spinning off into the thorns as he stalked me i gripped my valise and backed away looking around me for a weapon for something to buy me a few seconds for options then a basso bellow shook the hilltop and froze even aurora for a second the wall of thorns shook and quivered and something massive bellowed again and tore through it into the open the troll was huge and green and hideous and strong it wielded an axe in one hand like a plastic picnic knife and was covered in swelling welts poisoned wounds and its own darkgreen blood it had a horrible wound in its side ichor flowing openly from it it was dragging itself along despite the wounds but it was dying and it was meryl shed chosen i could only stare as i recognized her features inside the insane fury of the trolls face it reached for talos and the lord marshal of summer whirled his bright sword taking off one of the trolls hands she got the other on his leg though and dragged him beneath her even as she fell the weight of her pinning him down crushing him to the ground with a choked gurgling cry of rage and triumph i looked back to see aurora catch lily by her green hair and drag her back toward the table i ran to it and beat her to the knife a curved number of chipped stone dragging it across the table and to me fool aurora hissed i will tear out her throat with my bare hands i threw the knife away and said no you wont aurora laughed and asked eyes mad and enticing and why not i undid the clasp of the valise because i know something you dont what she laughed what could you possibly know that matters now i gave her a cold smile and said the phone number to pizza spress i opened the bag and snarled get her toot there was a shrill piping blast from inside the valise and toottoot sailed up out of it leaving a trail of crimson sparkles in his wake the little faerie still wore his makeshift armor but his weapons had been replaced with what id had billy pick up from walmartan orange plastic box knife its slender blade extended from its handle aurora let out another laugh uglier and said and what can this little thing do toot blew another little blast on his trumpet and shouted voice shrill in the name of the pizza lord charge and the valise exploded in a cloud of crimson sparkles as a swarm of pixies all armed with cold steel blades sheathed in orange plastic rose up and streaked toward aurora in a cloud of red sparkles and glinting knives she met my eyes as the pixies came for her and i saw the sudden fear the recognition of what was coming for her she lifted a hand golden power gathering there but one of the pixies reached her box knife flashing and ripped across her hand with its blade she screamed blood flowing and the golden light dimmed no she howled no not now the pixies swarmed her and it wasnt pretty the bright faerie mail of her gown gave her no protection against the steel blades and they sheared through it like cardboard from all directions in a whirling cloud around her toottoot and his companions struck dozens of times in only a few seconds the bright steel splashing scarlet blood into the air i saw her eyes open burning brightly even as zipping darting death opened up more cuts flaying her pale skin she hauled herself toward the table if she died there bled to death on the table she would accomplish her goal she would hurl vast power to the winter courts and destroy the balance between the faerie courts i threw myself up onto the table and into her bearing her back down and to the ground she screamed in frustration and struggled against mebut she didnt have any strength we rolled down the hill a few times and then wound up on the ground me pinning her down holding her there aurora looked up at me green eyes faded of color unfocused wait she said her voice weak and somehow very young she didnt look like a mad faerie sorceress now she looked like a frightened girl wait you dont understand i just wanted it to stop wanted the hurting to stop i smoothed a bloodied lock of hair from her eyes and felt very tired as i said the only people who never hurt are dead the light died out of her eyes her breath slowing she whispered barely audible i dont understand i answered i dont either a tear slid from her eye and mixed with the blood then she died chapter thirtyfour id done it id saved the girl stopped the thief proved mabs innocence and won her support for the white council thereby saving my own ass huzzah i lay there with auroras empty body too tired to move the queens found me maybe a quarter of an hour later i was only dimly aware of them of radiant light of gold and blue meeting over me gold light gathered over the body for a moment and then flowed away taking the dead flesh with it i was left cold and tired on the ground the gold lights departure left only cold blue a moment later i felt mabs fingers touch my head and she murmured wizard i am well pleased with thee go away mab i said my voice tired she laughed and said nay mortal it is you who must now depart you and your companions what about toottoot i asked it is unusual for a mortal to be able to call any of faerie even the lowest into service but it has been done before fear not for your little warriors they were your weapon and the only one accountable for their actions will be you take their steel with you and it will be enough i looked up at her and said youre going to live up to your side of the bargain of course the wizards will have safe passport not that bargain ours mabs lovely dangerous mouth curled up in a smile first let me make you an offer she gestured and the thorns parted maeve stood there in her white armor and mother winter stood behind her all shrouded in black cloth before them on the ground knelt lloyd slate broken obviously in pain his hands manacled to a collar around his throat the whole made of something that looked like cloudy ice we have a traitor among us mab purred and he will be dealt with accordingly after which there will be an opening for a new knight she watched me and said i would have someone worthy of more trust as his successor accept that power and all debts between us are canceled not just no i muttered hell no mabs smile widened very well then im sure we can find some way to amuse ourselves with this one until time enough has passed to offer again slate looked up blearily his voice slurred and panicky no no dresden dresden dont let them dont let them take me take it please dont let them keep me waiting mab touched my head again and said only twice more then and you will be free of me and they left lloyd slates screams lingered behind them i sat there too tired to move until the lights began to dim i vaguely remember feeling ebenezar heft me off the ground and get my arm across his shoulders the gatekeeper murmured something and billy answered him i woke up back at my place in bed billy who had been dozing in a chair next to the bed woke up with a snort and said hey there you are you thirsty i nodded throat too dry to speak and he handed me a glass of cool water what happened i asked when i could speak he shook his head meryl died she told me to tell you that shed made her choice and didnt regret it then she just changed we found her on the ground near you i closed my eyes and nodded ebenezar said to tell you that youd made a lot of people see red but that you shouldnt worry about them for a while heh i said the alphas banged up billy said a hint of pride in his voice one hundred and fiftyfive stitches all together but we all came out of it more or less in one piece pizza party and gaming at my place tonight my stomach growled at the word pizza i took a shower dried off and dressed in clean clothes that made me blink i looked around the bathroom then peeked out at my bedroom and said to billy you cleaned up did laundry he shook his head not me there was a knock at the door and he said just a minute i heard him go out and say something through the door before he came back in visitors i put some socks on then my sneakers who is it the new summer lady and knight billy said they looking for trouble billy grinned and said just come talk to them i glowered at him and followed him out to the main room it was spotless my furniture is mostly secondhand sturdy old stuff with a lot of wood and a lot of textured fabrics it all looked clean too and there were no stains in it my rugs everything from something that could have flown in the skies of mythic araby to touristtrap faux navajo had also been cleaned and aired out i checked the floor underneath the rugs mopped and scoured clean the hod had fresh wood in it and the fireplace had been not only emptied out but swept clean to boot my staff and blasting rod were in the corner gleaming as if theyd been polished and my gun hung in its holster freshly oiled the gun had been polished too i went over to the alcove with the stove sink and icebox the icebox was an oldfashioned one that stocked actual ice given my problems with electricity it had been cleaned and new ice put in it it was packed with neat rows of foodfresh fruits and veggies juice cokesand there was ice cream in the freezer my pantry was full of dry foods canned foods pasta sauces and mister had a new litterbox made of wood lined with plastic and full of fresh litter he had a carved wooden bowl as well and a mate for water and he had emptied it of food mister himself sprawled on the floor batting idly at a cloth sack of catnip hanging from a string on the pantry door i died i said i died and someone made a clerical error and this is heaven i looked around to find billy grinning at me like a fool he hooked a thumb at the door visiting dignitaries i went to the door and opened it warily peeking around it fix stood there in a set of mechanics coveralls his frizzy white hair floated around his head and complemented his smile he had grease on his hands and face and his old toolbox sat on the ground next to him beside him stood lily shapely figure showing off simple dark slacks and a green blouse her hair had been pulled back into a ponytail and it had turned snow white harry fix said how you doing i blinked at them and said you the new summer lady lily flushed prettily and nodded i know i didnt want it but whenwhen aurora died her power flowed into the nearest summer vessel usually it would be one of the other queens but i had the knights power and it just sort of plopped in there i lifted my eyebrows and said are you okay she frowned im not sure its a lot to think about and its the first time this kind of power has fallen to a mortal you mean youre not uh you havent chosen lily asked she shook her head its just me i dont know what im going to do but titania said shed teach me i glanced aside and you chose fix as your knight huh she smiled at fix i trust him suits me i said fix kicked the winter knights ass once already lily blinked and looked at fix the little guy flushed and i swear to god he dragged one foot over the ground lily smiled and offered me her hand i wanted to meet you and to thank you mister dresden i owe you my life i shook her hand but said you dont owe me anything im apparently saving damsels on reflex now my smile faded and i said besides i was just the hired help thank meryl lily frowned and said dont blame yourself for what happened you did what you did because you have a good heart mister dresden just like meryl i cant repay a kindness like that and its going to be years before i can make much use of my my she fumbled for a word power okay power but if you need help or a safe place you can come to me whatever i can do i will she had some brownies come clean up your place for you harry fix said and i just finished up with your car so it should run for you now i hope you dont mind i had to blink my eyes a few times before i said i dont mind come on in ill get you a drink we had a nice visit they seemed like decent kids after everyone left it was dark and there was another knock at the door i answered it and elaine stood there in a tshirt and jeans shorts that showed off her pretty legs she had her hair up under a cubs baseball hat and she said without preamble i wanted to see you before i left i leaned against the doorway close to her you got out okay i guess so did you did mab pay up i nodded yeah what about you are you still beholden to summer elaine shrugged i owed everything to aurora even if shed wanted to quibble about whether or not id paid her back in full its a moot point now where are you going she shrugged i dont know somewhere with a lot of people maybe go to school for a while she took a deep breath and then said harry im sorry things went like that i was afraid to tell you about aurora i guess i should have known better im glad you came through it all right really glad i had a lot of answers to that but the one i picked was she thought she was doing something good i guess i can see how youd look its done she nodded then she said i saw the pictures on your mantel of susan those letters and that engagement ring i glanced back at the mantel and felt bad in all kinds of ways yeah you love her elaine said i nodded she let out a breath and looked down so that the bill of her hat hid her eyes then can i give you some advice why not she looked up and said stop feeling sorry for yourself harry i blinked and said what she gestured at my apartment you were living in a sewer harry i understand that theres something youre blaming yourself for im just guessing at the details but its pretty clear you were driving yourself into the ground because of it get over it you arent going to do her any good as a living mildew collection stop thinking about how bad you feelbecause if she cares about you at all it would tear her up to see you like i saw you a few days ago i stared at her for a moment and then said romantic advice from you she flashed me half of a smile and said yeah the irony ill see you around i nodded and said goodbye elaine she leaned up and kissed my cheek again then turned and left i watched her go and illegal mind fog or not i never mentioned her to the council later that night i showed up at billys apartment laughter drifted out under the door along with music and the smell of delivered pizza i knocked and billy answered the door conversation ceased inside i came into the apartment a dozen wounded bruised cut and happy werewolves watched me from around a long table scattered with drinks pizza spress boxes dice pencils pads of paper and little inchtall models on a big sheet of graph paper billy i said and the rest of you guys i just wanted to say that you really handled yourselves up there a lot better than i expected or hoped i should have given you more credit thank you billy nodded and said it was worth it right there was a murmur of agreement from the room i nodded okay then someone get me a pizza and a coke and some dice but i want it understood that im going to need thews billy blinked at me what thews i said i want big bulging thews and i dont want to have to think too much his face split in a grin georgia do we have a barbarian character sheet left sure georgia said and went to a file cabinet i took a seat at the table and got handed pizza and coke and listened to the voices and chatter start up again and thought to myself that it was a whole hell of a lot better than spending another night crucifying myself in the lab you know what disappoints me billy asked me after a while no what all of those faeries and duels and mad queens and so on and no one quoted old billy shakespeare not even once i stared at billy for a minute and started to laugh my own aches and bruises and cuts and wounds pained me but it was an honest stretchy pain something that was healing i got myself some dice and some paper and some pencils and settled down with friends to pretend to be thorg the barbarian to eat drink and be merry lord what fools these mortals be
