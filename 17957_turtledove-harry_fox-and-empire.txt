harry turtledove fox and empire fox and empire i up in the watchtower the lookout winded his horn a long unmelodious blast two chariots approach from the south lord king he bellowed from the courtyard far below gerin the fox king of the north cupped a hand to his mouth and replied thanks andiver well see who they are when they get here arent you going to go up on the palisade and have a look the sentry demanded indignantly in a word no gerin answered if two chariots worth of warriors can conquer fox keep either theyre gods in which case looking at them wont do me any good or else were all such cowards that the men who are on the palisade now would be running away and thats not happening either so ill wait for them down here thanks very much andiver said something the height of his perch kept gerin from understanding the fox decided it was probably just as well his son dagref smiled at him that was very logical he said dagref at fourteen was as remorselessly logical as the most terrifying sithonian philosopher whod ever made a living lecturing in the elabonian empire up until twenty years before gerins kingdom as well as the rest of the land north from the high kirs to the river niffet had been a frontier province of the empire elabon though had abandoned the land north of the mountains in the face of the devastating werenight caused by all four moons coming full at the same time and almost incidentally the barbarous trokmoi swarming south over the niffet it was indeed gerin said so what dagref stared at him man and youth shared a long face long nose and swarthy complexion dagref though had only fine down on his cheeks and chin and his hair was a brown almost black gerins neat beard and his hair were gray and getting grayer by the year he was past fifty now and often knew it by the creaking in his bones logic is the greatest tool the greatest weapon in the world dagref declared that depends on what youre doing gerin replied if youre in the middle of a brawl you cant slay a gradi or a trokm or one of aragis the archers jolly henchmen with a wellaimed syllogism thats why we carry these things every now and then he hefted his sword the sun glinted red as blood from the polished edge of the bronze blade dagref held a sword too he enjoyed fencing with it much less than fencing with his wits he was very dangerous with the latter only somewhat so with the former come on gerin made as if to attack him if some big ugly lug carves chunks off you it doesnt matter that hes never heard of the law of the excluded middle you wont be around to instruct him afterwards dagref parried the slash his answering cut made gerin give back a pace they did not work against each other as often as gerin would have done had he not been lefthanded learning how to fight him went only so far in teaching dagref how to fight others his son was lefthanded too which gave gerin the rare chance to see what others faced when they met him keep the blade up the fox cautioned you dont keep the blade up i can do something like this he snapped a cut at dagrefs head so quick and sharp that his son had to stagger back or even this the fox feinted another head cut if he hadnt stopped his thrust he would have put it into dagrefs chest yes i see dagref nodded and he did see too he had the makings of a good swordsman he had long arms and quick feet and didn t do the same thing wrong over and over again but he didnt automatically do the right thing either and when he did do it he didnt do it fast enough only years of patient practice would give him the speed he needed intellectually he realized that he was very good at realizing things intellectually lets try it again father those were the words gerin wanted to hear before he could go through the passage again though one of his men up on the palisade called a challenge to the approaching chariots who comes to castle fox the answer made gerin forget about swordplay and hurry up onto the palisade after all i am marlanz rawmeat emissary of king aragis the archer come to have speech with king gerin hello marlanz gerin called once he reached the walkway and could peer over the tops of the palisade timbers come in and be welcome ill listen to whatever aragis has to say though i dont promise ill do anything about it at his command the gate crew let down the drawbridge over the ditch around the palisade marlanzs chariot rattled into fox keep king aragis representative was a big burly man in his late thirties from previous encounters with him gerin knew he was smarter than he looked hello lord king marlanz said as the fox came down to greet him when gerin clasped hands with him marlanzs big paw a word that came naturally to gerins mind as marlanz had a were streak in him almost engulfed his own what brings you north this time the fox asked though he had the bad feeling he already knew and sure enough marlanz said lord king aragis bids me tell you that he is not going to stand idly by if balser debos son swears homage and fealty to you he warns you not to pursue that further the fox looked down his nose at aragis ambassador no mean feat since marlanz was three or four digits width taller than he aragis has no business telling either balser or me what sort of relationship we can have balser was never aragis vassal nor was his father before him balser styles himself baron nothing more but hes as free a man and as independent a lord as i amor as aragis is yes and aragis intends that he remain free and not come under your influence marlanz said if of his own free will he wants to declare himself my vassal aragis has not the right to forbid it marlanz rawmeat folded thick arms across his broad chest lord king king aragis is strong enough to enforce his will on balserand on you in the end it came down to strength gerin thought adiatunnus the trokm a rival now a vassal had first declared the fox king of the north after hed beaten the gradi pirates back to a single keep on the edge of the orynian ocean aragis had started calling himself king a little later his claim springing from his being the only noble left in the northlands with strength enough to stand against gerin if aragis tries that he will get the war hes been saying he doesnt want ever since the days right after the werenight gerin answered tell him that marlanz make sure he understands it and tell him that if he does try it i believe hell end up being the sorriest man ever born marlanz scowled hed known gerin long enough to know the fox did not casually make such boasts in marlanzs younger days hed been more a bruiser than a diplomat hed gained skill with years these days aragis probably trusted him further than anyone elsenot that aragis trusted anyone very far trying to strike a conciliatory tone marlanz said you have to see how things are lord king balsers holding points like a knife straight at the heart of the lands that acknowledge king aragis suzerainty if it comes under your control youre halfway to invading his domain right there gerin scowled back in aragis sandals his acquisition would look that way i dont want to use the holding as a knife i want to use it as a shield against aragis the fox said its hardly less dangerous to me in his hands than it is to him in mine you might remind him that he was the one who paraded chariots past balsers border to frighten him into yielding i cant help it if balser started talking to me instead it might be best if we could keep balser neutral between you and aragis inclining neither to the one nor the other marlanz said that would have been fine gerin said it was fine while it lasted i wasnt the one who changed it now balser doesnt think he can trust aragis to keep his hands where they belong am i supposed to tell him no im sorry i wont protect you from your neighbor even if you want me to marlanz looked unhappy i knew that was foolish he muttered gerin didnt think he was supposed to hear aragis envoy gathered himself lord king im sorry but i dont have a lot of room to wiggle here king aragis has told me to tell you that if balser becomes your vassal it will mean war between the two of you then it will be war gerin slapped marlanz on the back and waved him toward castle fox we dont have to start killing each other quite yet i dont think why dont you come into the great hall and drink some ale with me eat some bread and well see what else we can scare up for you ill do that right gladly marlanz said you brewed a fine ale the last time i was here lord king and youre not the sort to let something like that slip and you have a name all through the northlands for feeding your guestfriends well i probably earned it when i managed to get you out of my keep before you ate the larder emptyjust before gerin said marlanz laughed although like most of gerins jokes that one had a hard core of truth come on the fox urged and they walked into the great hall side by side van of the strong arm rihwin the fox and carlun vepins son sat at a table near the hearth and near the altar to dyaus allfather in front of it a tarredleather jack of ale sat in front of each of them van was also gnawing a roast rib of mutton as gerin and marlanz walked in the big outlander tossed it into the rushes on the floor to watch a couple of dogs squabble over it by all the gods its marlanz rawmeat van rumbled recognizing aragis envoy he rose from the bench and strode up to clasp marlanzs hand as they did whenever they met the two big men studied each other gerin studied them both the goldenhaired outlander was taller and broader through the shoulders but he was also older being within a year or two either way of the foxs age at his peak hed been stronger than marlanzhed been stronger than anyone gerin had ever known but marlanz a decade younger was closer to his own peak which had also been formidable if the two of them fought gerin didnt know what would happen that was strange in the more than twenty years since van had come to fox keep hed always been sure his friend could best anyone merely human now now were getting old gerin thought strength goes he smiled to himself guile though guile endures aloud he said marlanz says aragis will go to war with us if balser gives me homage and fealty hes welcome to try it van said i dont think hell be so happy afterwards though a few years earlier he would have whooped with glee at the prospect of a fight he still didnt shrink from itgerin couldnt imagine him shrinking from a fightbut he no longer rushed toward it like a man rushing toward his beloved my king is not happy about it now marlanz answered but he will not shrink from it not if that means seeing his own rights overthrown that made rihwin the fox speak up in good sooth king aragis has no right pertaining to the holding of balser debos son it never having been a fief of his i said the same thing gerin told him but not half so prettily you have not the advantages of a noble upbringing south of the high kirs rihwin replied as if forgiving his fellow fox for flaws beyond his control after two decades in the northlands rihwin still clung to the elaborate phrasing hed learned at the heart of the elabonian empire and to the gold hoop he wore in his left ear an affectation to which the rest of gerins vassals had never quite accommodated themselves marlanz looked from rihwin to gerin and back again as i have noted before he has the right to keep a stronger neighbor from taking advantage of a weaker one as i noted before gerin said pointedly if aragis werent a strong neighbor liable to take advantage of a weaker one balser wouldnt be interested in having me as his lord if you told him as much out there van said did you bring him in here to tell it to him over again as a matter of fact i brought him in here for some ale and some bread and whatever we can pry out of the kitchen in the way of meat gerin said he slapped aragis vassal on the shoulder again sit you down marlanz if aragis and i have to fight well fight meanwhile youre my guestfriend servants brought marlanz a drinking jack a round of flatbread and some ribs like the one van had been gnawing carlun vepins son gerins steward looked as if he was calculating the cost of everything and so no doubt he was the fox wouldnt have wanted him for the job if he didnt keep track of every jar of ale sack of beans and barrel of salt pork whatever carlun thought he kept it to himself while warriors other than gerin were around he was no fighting man hed been the headman of the serf village close by fox keep till gerin caught him cheating on the records there trying to hold back produce from his overlords notice that had earned him both a promotion and a warning about what would happen if the fox ever caught him cheating again either he hadnt cheated since or hed done it too well for gerin to have noticed the fox didnt think carlun was clever enough to get away with that he almost but not quite hoped he was wrong marlanz made eyes at one of the serving women gerin happened to know she was newly married and happy with her husband she kept on serving aragis envoy but did nothing to encourage him and twisted away before he had the chance to pull her down onto his lap he glanced over to gerin you always did give your serfs a lot of say in what they should do to keep your guests happy i havent changed the fox answered far as i can see forcing them to bed men they dont want only causes trouble if shes interested in you marlanz thats fine if shes not maybe you can find someone else who is marlanz didnt make an issue of it gerin remembered how hed been inclined to do just that the first time he came up to fox keep yes hed learned a thing or two over the intervening fifteen years and of course since he was fifteen years older himself he didnt burn so hot as he had then either i passed the night at your sons holding on my way up to your keep here lord king marlanz remarked changing the subject with a smoothness he hadnt had as a younger man he seems to be shaping into a fine baron in his own right for which i thank you gerin said aye i think durens a splendid lad of course being his father id think that even if it werent so well it is marlanz said and i didnt see any signs that his vassal barons are anything but what they ought to be either you had some trouble with that as i recall a bit the fox admitted duren held his holding as grandson to the previous baron ricolf the red not as gerins son ricolfs petty barons had been anything but enthusiastic about accepting him partly because they feared gerins influence and partly because with ricolf gone theyd had hopes of escaping vassalage altogether and setting up on their own as far as gerin could see the hope had obviously been foolish but that hadnt kept them from having it a lot of the hopes men had were obviously foolish to everyone but them aye durens a fine young fellow marlanz cocked his head to one side is he the heir to your kingdom or is that dagref whom i saw out in the courtyard with you yes gerin answered and let marlanz make whatever he would of it duren was his son by elise ricolfs daughter he hadnt seen her since duren was a toddler shed run away with a traveling horse doctor dagref his sister clotild and his brother blestar were his by selatre the former sibyl at the farseeing god bitons shrine down at ikos the fox sighed life was never so simple as you wished it would be yes to which marlanz demanded he was gerin knew persistent the fox just smiled at him after a bit aragis vassal figured out he wouldnt get a straight answer he smiled back shrugged and emptied his jack of ale a serving womannot the one hed tried to pawrefilled it for him gerin took a pull at his own ale he wondered where dagref had gone his eldest child by selatre had a curiosity as fierce and ruthless as a longtooth he should have been besieging marlanz with every sort of question the fox wondered what hed found more interesting than the arrival of a nearstranger had it been duren at the same age gerin would have guessed he was off with a girl but dagrefs curiosity was as yet more of the intellect than of the body one day soon the fox suspected a serving girl would kick his feet out from under him what happened after that would be interesting no sooner had gerin thought of his son than dagref as if summoned came running into the great hall he spared marlanz rawmeat no more than a hasty glance father come quick out back by the stables he exclaimed its ferdulf again oh by the gods gerin said which where ferdulf was concerned had alarmingly literal implications the fox sprang to his feet dagref the message delivered was already dashing away gerin pounded after him aware with every step that he wasnt as fast as he had been behind him he heard van and rihwin exclaiming too a moment later they followed the fox and marlanz came right on their heels he hadnt a clue about what was going on but he wanted to find out dagref sprinted around castle fox then pointed with a dramatic forefinger there he said there were clotild and blestar there too were maeva and kor van s children maeva though a year younger than dagref was already blossoming into ripe womanhoodbut womanhood of heroic proportions vans blood told in her temperament as well as her size and strength she wanted to be a warrior and gerin rather to his own alarm thought she would make a good one kor was even more alarming he also had his fathers build but took his incendiary temper straight from fand the trokm woman with whom van lived in something less than wedded bliss and there were geroge and tharma the two monsters towered over all their companions even maeva they were large and hairy and remarkably ugly with clawed hands and feet low foreheads little eyes under beetling brow ridges and long jaws full of big teeth though geroges right upper canine was of gold rather than being a natural fang they both waved to gerin who had raised them from he supposed cubs was the best word he didnt see ferdulf and then just before dagref said there again he did the preternaturally beautiful fouryearold had doffed his tunic and was walking around in the air about twenty feet off the ground magic marlanz asked from behind gerin with what was under the circumstances commendable calm the fox shook his head not exactly he raised his voice to ferdulf come down from there this instant before you he stopped before you hurt yourself didnt work as it had with his own children ferdulf wasnt going to hurt himself gerin wasnt sure ferdulf could hurt himself he tried a different tack before you drive everybody down here crazy what do i care ferdulf stood on his head supported by exactly nothing his voice was not a fouryearolds but the same rude rich baritone hed had since he was a newborn babe marlanz said lord king will you please tell me whats going on here he took geroge and tharma in stride hed met them before ferdulf however was new to him like most men in the northlands he viewed the new with suspicion gerin didnt in most cases with ferdulf he made an exception trying to sound casual he answered thats mavrixs son by fulda a peasant woman here now do you understand for a moment marlanz didnt then he did and his eyes got wide mavrix he tried his best to imitate gerins flat unemphatic tones but didnt have much luck the sithonian god of wine calm crumbled into astonishment youve got a gods get here lord king yes the little bastard gerin said which in dealingor trying to dealwith ferdulf had proved true in any number of ways dagref plucked at his fathers sleeve i brought you out here so you could do something about him he said pointedly the last time he started going around up in the air this way he piddled on all of us and i wanted to see if we could keep that from happening again the glare he gave the fox said his fathers reliability had just come down a peg for him what exactly do you want me to do gerin asked in some exasperation i cant lean a ladder against the air the way i would against the palisade he cast a cautious eye up toward ferdulfs little pecker mavrixs get had divine powers and a fouryearolds sense of humor the fox was hard pressed to imagine a more terrifying combination dagref took a deep breath if you dont come down from there this instant he told ferdulf none of the rest of us is going to play with you for a long time his voice broke in the middle of the threat so he didnt sound so fierce as he might have but he did sound as if he meant what he said he always sounded as if he meant what he said he gestured to his comrades clotild and blestar nodded so did maeva and kor and a beat late so did geroge and tharma oh all right ferdulf said sulkily sounding very much like his own father who raised petulance to an art he came floating down and put his tunic back on that was bravely done maeva said she eyed dagref with a thoughtful interest to which he as yet remained in large measure blind that was bravely done gerin agreed telling ferdulf what to do took nerve well his son had never lacked for that sense possibly but not nerve the fox went on but why did you call me when you could handle it by yourself i didnt know if that would work dagref answered and i thought you would have a better idea when you didnt he raised one eyebrow as gerin might have done you should have had a better idea he said without words in a much more cautious voice than hed used till now marlanz rawmeat asked what all can the little godlet do besides fly what all gerin clapped a hand to his head as if it ached when he thought about ferdulf it soon did ache who knows ill tell you this much i went to see him as soon as i got word hed been born and he said hello to me in that same voice you heard him use now life hasnt been dull since believe me is his mother a goddess too or a demon or marlanz fell silent seeming to guess how little he could guess gerins smile was ironic i told you his mothers name is fulda she still lives down in the village close to the keep here she has a pretty face and a ripe body which is why i used her when i was summoning mavrix against the gradiwhich in case youre wondering was a good idea that didnt work ferdulf listens to her when he feels like it and ignores her the rest of the time which is about what he does for everybody else you told me youd summoned mavrix the last time i came up here marlanz said remembering you didnt tell me hed got a woman with child ferdulf hadnt been born then the fox answered i didnt know then what id get for that matter i still dont know what i have why dont we go back to the great hall and have another jack of ale and we can talk some more about it good enough lord king marlanz hurried back to the hall as if he feared ferdulf and was trying to conceal it from everyone especially from himself selatre had been working in the kingdoms libraryan overstatement of what one upstairs room of castle fox held but an overstatement gerin had been making ever since hed succeeded his father as local baron more than twenty years before she came down for supper when she did marlanz bowed before her lady seeing as you were sibyl at ikos and seeing as the farseeing god spoke through you there he said getting around to his question a clause at a time like a lawyer south of the high kirs does that mean this ferdulf youve got here pays any special heed to what you say he spoke of mavrixs son as he might have of a dangerous wild beast which struck gerin as fitting enough selatre gave the question grave consideration almost as if she expected biton to speak through her here and now after scratching the side of her pointed chin for close to a minute she delivered a short answer not very often marlanz stared then started to laugh well thats straight and no mistake he said his last couple of words blurring into an enormous yawn he turned back to gerin if youll be kind enough to have somebody show me up to my bedchamber ill thank you for it ive spent a good many days on the road coming up from aragis keep i can do that gerin said and waved for a servant who led aragis envoy away the warriors who had accompanied marlanz would sleep in the great hall the fox had made sure they had plenty of blankets to stay comfortable no one at fox keep had to fear night ghosts for he made a point of giving them the blood they needed to keep from molesting mortals once marlanz was gone selatre put on that thoughtful expression again do you suppose we could find a way to use ferdulf she said in a low voice against aragis you mean gerin asked as quietly his wife nodded he said i never thought about it before i never imagined ferdulf doing anything but whatever he wants he looked around none of the men whod come to fox keep with marlanz seemed to be listening and a couple of them were already asleep but gerin had not grown as old as he hadolder than i ever thought id beby taking unnecessary chances the necessary ones were quite bad enough lets talk about it upstairs all right selatre rose from the bench in one smooth motion she and gerin walked up the wooden stairway hand in hand in the chamber nearest the top of the stairs van and fand were arguing the outlander and the trokm woman looked on quarrels as most folk looked on meat and drink gerin met selatres eye wryly he shook his head after elise had left him before hed met selatre he d shared fands affectionand her temperwith van for a while no wonder he did his best to keep his eventempered wife that way he had standards of comparison he and selatre shared the next bedchamber with their children since he didnt feel like explaining everything to dagref however much his son thought himself entitled to explanations and since clotild might well also still be awake he led selatre past that door too she nodded understanding his reasons without his having to spell them out one more reason to love her he thought rihwin had the chamber on the other side of the foxs since rihwin could no more keep secrets than fand could keep calm gerin walked by his room the next bedchamber held marlanz across from it was the library to which gerin and selatre were both drawn like feathers gliding toward rubbed amber few in the northlands knew their letters selatre hadnt not till gerin taught them to her after bringing her to fox keep hed thought to give her a useful place here not knowing he would fall in love with her in short orderand she with him too which struck him as stranger and more marvelous shed also fallen in love with books that unlike falling in love with him he understood completely hed done it himself he opened the door then gestured for her to go in ahead of him she didand started to laugh when he followed her into the chamber he laughed too there sat dagref in front of a lamp his nose in a scroll gerin glanced over at selatre anyone would think he was our child he said dagref looked up at his parents of course im your child he said testily and im sure you came in here so you could talk about something you think is none of my business youre right selatre told him it isnt fair he said how am i supposed to learn what i need to know if you wont let me find out about it he started to stalk off then stopped under gerins glare when he went back rolled up the scroll and replaced it in its proper pigeonhole his father stopped glaring that was good selatre said with a smile after her son did depart he figured out why you were unhappy something anyway gerin agreed tell him the same thing four hundred times in a row and he will start to listenif it suits him if it doesnt his scowl said what happened then after a moment he went on and yet if its something he wants to learn hell soak it up the way dry ground soaks up the first rain of the year selatre gazed at him with amused fondness anyone would think he had you for a father she murmured the fox tried to glare again but ended up laughing instead you know me too welland you have altogether too little respect for your king that made selatre laugh too but gerin quickly sobered can we use ferdulf as a weapon against aragis if we do go to war i would be happier trying it if he were the son of any other god than mavrix selatre said why do you say that because mavrix is about the least predictable god in anyones pantheon or because hes shown he isnt fond of me in particular yes selatre said as gerin had with marlanz he made a face at her despite her joke though both halves of the question could legitimately be answered yes mavrix was the sithonian god of wine beauty fertility creativity and of the chaos accompanying all those he did not know from one moment to another what he would do next nor did he care and his encounters with the fox over the years had mostly ended up alarming both the god who was a coward at heart and the man who was anything but gerin said for once id like to use a weapon against my foes that isnt stronger than i am so i wont have to spend so much time worrying whether it will turn in my hand and end up being worse than simply losing whatever fight i happen to be making the question then it seems to me is if we go to war with aragis whether we can beat him without resorting to extraordinary means selatre said gerin paused a moment to admire the precise phrasing of that he tried to answer with similar precision we canif everything goes right if adiatunnus chooses to remember hes my vassal and doesnt take the fight as an excuse to throw off his allegiance and set up on his own for instance hed better not selatre said with no small anger not when he s the one who first proclaimed you king hes been a good enough vassal since too gerin admitted but hes a trokm which means hes almost as fickle as mavrix if he sees the two greatest elabonian lords in the northlands going at each other the temptation may be too much for him to stand and there are the gradi too the seafaring invaders from the chilly lands north of the trokm forests had tried to establish themselves and their grim gods in the northlands a few years before fear of them was what had made adiatunnus remember he was gerins vassal fighting together instead of against each other elabonians and trokmoi had pinned the northerners against the orynian ocean more than that they could not do not when gradi galleys controlled the sea because voldar the chief gradi goddess and the rest of the northerners gods contemplated making the northlands into a frigid copy of the home from which theyd come a land too cold for even barley to grow there gerin had managed to persuade baivers the elabonian god of barley beer and brewing to join with the ferocious powers of geroge and tharmas kind and battle those gradi gods he didnt know whether that battle on the spiritual plane had been won or lost his best guess was that it still went on five years after its beginning time for the gods was not as it was for men what he did know was that without help from their gods the gradi hadnt been able to stand against him that was the only thing that mattered no not quite the only thing if voldar and the other gradi powers ever manage to pull loose from the battle i found for them they wont be very happy with me they havent done it yet and its been a long time now selatre spoke with her usual brisk practicality and if they do youll come up with something that wasnt practicality it was as far as gerin could see madness everyone else expects me to have all the answers and pull them out of my beltpouch whenever i need them he growled i thought you knew better she looked steadily back at him you forget ive been living by your side these past fifteen or sixteen years i know what you can do everyone else just guesses when that drew nothing more than a sardonic snort from the fox selatre went on you would come up with something i know you too well to doubt it maybe with ferdulf here you could use him to call on mavrix and that would be wonderful wouldnt it gerin said mavrix likes me about as well as voldar does trying to use one god who cant stand me to head off another one who cant stand me either i think i d be better off jumping out of the watchtower and hoping i broke my neck when i hit besides voldars stronger than mavrix i found that out well youd do something else then selatre still sounded confident i thought of mavrix because we were talking about ferdulf so we were gerin said the best thing i can think of to do with him is to hope that his being here frightens aragis and to hope aragis never finds out how much his being here frightens me youre the king of the north amusement glinted in his wifes eyes nothing is supposed to frighten you she was poking him in the ribs to make him jump he knew as much but answered seriously no thats aragis as far as ive ever seen nothing does frighten himand that frightens me hes very simple like a hunting hawk he goes straight for what he wants knocks it down and kills it the only reason hes never gone after me is that ive always looked too big to knock down maybe i dont not any more i dont think marlanz is bluffing no aragis doesnt want you becoming balsers overlord selatre agreed she cocked her head to one side and studied him wouldnt you say that means hes afraid of you gerin started to say something then stopped what he did say in tones of appreciation was i think ive just been outargued selatre was still studying him but now in rather a different manner and what do you propose to do about that she inquired he got up walked over to the door and barred it hed had a serf skilled in carpentry install the bar and the brackets that held it a couple of years before at about the same time hed taken to storing a bolt of thick woolen cloth in one corner of the library that had perplexed dagref whod noted pointedly and accurately that nothing else but books ever got stored in that room its not doing any particular harm there so let it alone gerin had told him that was also true dagref had grumbled about it for a while but then as is the way of such things hed got used to it he probably didnt even notice it was there any more the other thing he didnt notice however alert he was to connections between events around him was that that bar and the roll of cloth had appeared in the library at about the same time he and clotild grew to the point where they didnt sleep much more than gerin and selatre did the foxs bedchamber had only one large bed in it private moments there got harder and harder to find what are you doing selatre asked now though her tone of voice suggested she knew perfectly well what he was doingand that she might have done it herself if he hadnt who me gerin unrolled the cloth on the floor when hed doubled it over onto itself it was a little longer than a woman or even a man might be lying at full length selatre came over and stood beside him as if altogether of its own accord his arm slid around her waist she moved closer her voice though was thoughtful as she said its really not quite so soft as the bed is it and you dont always remember to keep your weight on your elbows instead of on me she let out a small sigh that might have proclaimed she was resigned to his iniquities some pleasant little while later gerin murmured there you can t say im squashing you now selatre astride him nodded agreement altogether too solemn for the moment both of them started to laughquietly gerin slid his hands along her smooth warm length is this better then better her shrug was delightful even then though the answer she gave was carefully considered i dont know its not the same and youre not squashing me thats enough she began to move and the answers she and gerin found were not expressed in words once hed put on his linen tunic and wool trousers gerin rolled up the bolt of cloth and slung it back in its corner in the light of the single lamp still burning in the library it looked altogether mundane just one more thing for which there hadnt been room anywhere else in the crowded castle suddenly selatre started to giggle the fox raised an interrogative eyebrow she said i wonder what ferdulf would have thought if hed been walking in the air outside the window just then there was an aspect of ferdulfs unusual abilities gerin hadnt contemplated till then maybe he would have learned something he said which made selatre laugh again he went on considering which god hes the son of maybe he wouldnt have too he and selatre both laughed at that were they a little nervous if they were they both kept quiet about it he unbarred the door selatre blew out the lamp they went off to bed marlanz rawmeat looked as if hed bitten into something sour its still no is it he said and swigged at the ale which with bread and honey made up his breakfast its still no gerin said firmly if balser debos son acknowledges that he is my vassaland i expect he willill protect him from all his neighbors including aragis the archer im sorry to hear that lord king marlanz said ill take your words down to king aragis after that i expect ill see you in the field he put down the loaf on which hed been gnawing and made cutandthrust motions guestfriends dont slay each other of course but that doesnt hold for your men i know gerin said tell aragis also that i have no quarrel with him if he has no quarrel with me tell him i dont aim to use balsers land against him tell him he and i have managed to keep from going to war with each other up till now even though weve been the two strongest men in the northlands for most of the past twenty years im in no great hurry to change that ill tell him everything you say lord king marlanz upended his jack then looked into it as if amazed it held no more ale ill tell him but his minds made up if balser claims you for his overlord aragis will go to war when he says something like that its as sure as the sun coming up tomorrow from everything gerin had gleaned by intently watching his rival over the years marlanz was telling the truth when aragis said he would do something he would do it no matter how appalling it might be he was not a man who deviated from his declared purposes that made him more dangerous than someone who might be intimidated but also made him more vulnerable because he was more predictable but the lands he controlled and those acknowledging the foxs overlordship already marched over a long stretch of the northlands if he went to war with gerin he could pick the spot for the first assault tell aragis one thing more from me the fox said and marlanz rawmeat nodded attentively tell him that if he starts this war i will finish it and he wont care for that by marlanzs expression he didnt care for it either i will take your words to him just as you say them lord king he promised his face got longer yet i dont think it will help but ill do it all right ill tell you one thing too marlanz gerin said i dont hold this against you personally youre doing as a good vassal should following the orders of your suzerain i think youll be sorry for doing it even so thats in the hands of the gods marlanz said and then looked as if he wished he could have the words back they must have made him think of ferdulf and from ferdulf go on to mavrix he wouldnt know mavrix was none too well disposed toward gerin aragis did know thator had known it some years before but aragis had also seen gerin cozen mavrix into doing what the fox wanted him to do he might well reckon that meant man and god had patched things up with luck the prospecteven if it wasnt a true prospectof facing an irate god would give even the archer pause the prospect of facing an irate god had given gerin pause several times that didnt mean he hadnt done it it didnt mean he hadnt got away with it either he had no reason to assume aragis couldnt get away with it too he wished he did have such a reason try to make aragis see that i dont want this war will you the fox persisted if i did want it id hold you here and the first thing aragis would know was that my men were coming over the border at him as i say lord king ill pass on everything you say to me marlanz replied i dont think it will do much good as i told you before king aragis will answer that it only means you dont want war now right this minute not that you dont want war at all he sat a little straighter a little more defiantly can you tell me my king would be wrong yes gerin said if id wanted war i could have had it whenever i chose and ive never chosen war with aragis not down through these past twenty years he sighed he was blessedor perhaps cursedwith the ability to see the other fellows point of view and hell say the only reason i didnt do it was because i wasnt ready all this time and now i finally am he felt tired go on home marlanz pretty soon aragis and i can try killing each other and then well find out whos better at that the warriors who had accompanied aragis envoy up to fox keep had their chariots ready for the return journey gerins resignation to the prospect of war ahead seemed to reach marlanz where his earlier denials had been brushed aside as marlanz stepped up into his car he spoke urgently ill urge him to hold the peaceby father dyaus i swear it whether he listens to me if he doesnt listen to you maybe hell listen to edged bronze gerin waved to the gate crew let down the drawbridge the men in the gatehouse turned the capstan bronze chain rattled out a link at a time down went the bridge the fox waved again this time to marlanz rawmeat marlanz looked to be on the point of saying something more instead he bowed stiffly and tapped his driver on the shoulder the fellow flicked the reins the horses got moving the chariots axle squeaked as it began to roll the other car the one with a crew of warriors followed horses hooves thundered and wheels boomed on the drawbridge marlanz was still peering back over his shoulder at the fox when his driver swung south and took the car out of the narrow line of sight the gate offered gerin could have mounted to the palisade and watched marlanz till he was out of sight but what point to that he went back into the great hall and called for ale instead carlun vepins son sat in there cutting a length of sausage into identical bitesized chunks before he ate them he looked up from that fussily precise task and said there will be war then lord king im afraid there will gerin answered i dont see how i can turn balser down evidently aragis doesnt see how he can let me accept balsers vassalage if thats not a recipe for war i dont know what is carlun stabbed one of those chunks of sausage with the knife hed used to cut it he brought it up to his mouth chewed swallowed only then did he deliver his verdict it will be expensive thanks so muchi hadnt realized that gerin snapped the steward choked on another bite of sausage hed always been vulnerable to sarcasm gerin slapped him on the back steady thereexpensive yes fatal no i suppose not lord king carlun said nothing else youve undertaken has been fatalthough the gods can drop me in the hottest of the five hells if i understand why not he cocked his head to one side maybe its magic gerin turned his most enigmatic stare on the steward maybe it is he answered which made carlun look nervous gerin had studied sorcery down in the city of elabon before the elabonian empire severed itself from its fractious northern province hed had to return to the northlands with his magical studies like all the rest incomplete the trokmoi had slain his father and brother leaving him baron a job hed wanted about as much as a longtooth wanted an aching fang despite insatiable curiosity he hadnt intended to practice much sorcery after coming back to the north the only thing more dangerous commonly to himself than a halftrained mage was the fox backed up and started that thought again because he couldnt think of anything more dangerous than a halftrained mage that didnt mean he hadnt practiced magic every now and again amazing what desperation will do he thought when faced with a trokm wizard bent on destroying him for a fancied slight or with the eruption of the monsters from under bitons temple down at ikos or with the invasion of the gradi and their ferocious gods the risks of sorcery suddenly seemed smaller he hadnt killed himself yet that was the most he could say for his sorcery after a moment he shook his head rejecting false modesty in hairraising fashion the magic had done what hed wanted it to do balamung the trokm mage was destroyed the monstersexcept geroge and tharmawere made to return to their gloomy caverns the gradi were pinned back to a single castle at the edge of the ocean and because gerin hadnt killed himself oncethough not for lack of effort he thoughtboth his friends and his foes had conceived the notion that he really was a formidable wizard in his own right so long as he didnt conceive the same foolish notion and try to act on it he figured hed be fine thinking he had a true sorcerous talent also made people think twice about crossing him as now carlun said then i will prepare for war sure everything will turn out right even if i dont see how that went too far gerin shook his head again prepare as if you think everything will go wrong in your mind make things look as black as you can figure out how wed come through that then when something works out better than you expectif anything works out better than you expect he added from the depths of a deeply pessimistic nature you can take it as a bonus i understand lord king carlun hesitated then said forgive me lord king but in a lot of ways you think more like a serf than how i thought a noble would think i always thought nobles had so much they never needed to worry about what to do when things go wrong only goes to show you were born a serf and not a noble gerin answered the only people without worries are the dead ones and the ones who havent been born yet nobles dont worry about their overlords taking too much of the harvest away and making them starve they worry about their neighbors taking their lands away and killing them comes out about the same in the end id say maybe so carlun said but nobles press on peasants all the time and on their neighbors only now and again nobles in my domain had better not press on peasants all the time or on their neighbors either gerin said but he understood what carlun meant that was how things commonly worked in the northlands and how they had worked for generations he wondered if he ought to despair when his own steward seemed to think the changes he was making were anomalies that wouldnt last he got no time to contemplate that gloomy notion which might have been just as well herris bigfoot the headman of the peasant village close by fox keep came running into the great hall crying lord king lord king come quick lord king ferdulfs at it again hullo herris said carlun who was the headmans brotherinlaw hullo herris grudged his kinsman by marriage the one word but then gave his attention back to the fox will you come lord king gerin had already risen to his feet im coming herris though by all the gods im not certain what i can do to rein in ferdulf that you couldnt manage for yourself but lord king thats your job herris said the fox sighed it was his job which didnt mean he relished it how was he supposed to impose his will on a fouryearold demigod rather more to the point how was he supposed to do it without regretting it afterwards in weary resignation he asked whats he gone and done this time uh lord king youd better come see for yourself the headman answered people had been saying that about ferdulf since the day he was born hed spoken to the midwife while she was cutting the cord that had linked him to his mother hed greeted gerin when the fox came down to the village to see what mavrix had begotten on fulda and hed only become more alarming since as his power had grown with his body out of fox keep and over the drawbridge strode herris and gerin the village was only a short walk south of the keep the peasants lived in thatchroofed huts of wattle and daub smoke issued from the holes in the center of several of those roofs women cooking no doubt other women were working in the vegetable gardens by the huts or feeding the chickens that ran around as if they thought the place belonged to them not to the fox most of the men were away from the village either tending to cattle and sheep or weeding in the fields of growing wheat and barley gerin didnt notice any signs of unusual chaos which wasnt always the case when ferdulf got into mischief he noticed as much with something approaching hope in his voice youll find out lord king herris bigfoot said he led the fox toward fuldas hut before they got there fulda came outside she might well have been the bestlooking young woman in the village the long tunic she wore lessened but could not hide the impact of her figure rihwin the fox had chosen her at gerins urging to help attract mavrix to fox keep to fight the gradi gods after failing in that fight mavrix himself had chosen to impregnate her lord king she said now im sure he didnt mean it when that phrase got stuck to the mischief of an ordinary small boy it meant said mischief was worse than it had any business being when it was applied to the mischief of a small demigod whats he gone and done now gerin asked not sure he wanted to find out no that wasnt true he did want to find out he wished he didnt have to find out youd better see for yourself herris and fulda said in the same breath they looked at each other and laughed the headmans eyes lingered on fulda any mans eyes had a way of lingering on fulda seeing that gerin thought it was liable to cause trouble one of these days it would however be trouble of an ordinary sort trouble hed seen many times before trouble he knew how to handle the kind of trouble ferdulf caused was something else again whats he gone and done the fox repeated he was playing in the mud by the pond and he fulda began she gave up her shrug was magnificent youd better see for yourself herris said again gerin loudly exhaled through his nose spinning on his heel he stalked off toward the pond close by the village herris and fulda hurried after him both expostulating none of the expostulations made much sense that didnt surprise him had things made sense to the villagers they wouldnt have needed him to straighten them out he strode past the last hut there was the pond not much of a pond perhaps to a connoisseur of such but enough ducks swam in it in the mud by its edge the village pigs wallowed their happy grunting filled the foxs ears much as the gabble from herris and fulda had done not long before but not all of that grunting came from the edge of the pond nor were all the quacks that punctuated it from ducks on the water after a second more careful look at the peaceful scene ahead gerin turned back to the village headman and the demigods mother i owe you an apology he said not a common admission for a lord to make to a couple of serfs what are we going to do lord king herris bigfoot demanded idontknow gerin stared out at the pond most of the ducks there were of the ordinary sort the males with shiny green heads the females drab and brown all over a couple of them though a couple of them gerins eyes confirmed were ducks only from the neck down from the neck up they were pigs because their heads were smaller than they had any natural business being the grunts those heads admitted sounded strange but they were undoubtedly piggy grunts and sure enough one of the piggy bodies by the pond sported an outsized green head with a flat bill and another a head similar but brown neither pork nor fowl the fox thought dazedly what are we going to do it seemed to be the sort of day where everyone repeated himself herris turn again i dont know gerin was echoing his own words too then he found something new to add hope they breed true maybe herris and fulda both stared at him hed succeeded in startling them anyhow well theyand ferdulfhad succeeded in startling him too suddenly the village headman started to laugh i wonder if theyll lay eggs or have live young he said fulda voiced a more immediately pragmatic consideration i wonder what theyd taste like gerin tried to imagine a flavor halfway between duck and pork his stomach rumbled he didnt know whether his imagination was accurate but it was vivid enough to make him hungry he said if you find out what they taste like now you wont find out later whether they lay eggs or not youre right lord king fulda didnt seem to have thought so far ahead but herris bigfoot said lord king what will you do to ferdulf on account of this even if he is a gods son hes got no business changing things around so what if he starts putting the wrong heads on people next a lot of people are wrongheaded enough without getting switched around gerin said but that was a quip not an answer knowing it was necessary the fox went on ill have a word with him and what if he decides to put the wrong head on me there was a thought the fox wished he hadnt had pretendingmost of all to himselfit had never crossed his mind he turned to fulda is he back at your house yes lord king she said she hesitated torn between a mothers love for her child and the certain knowledge the child she had borne to mavrix was not of the ordinary sort whatever you do lord king be careful that was good advice it was such good advice in fact that gerin wished his career had given him more chances to take it as things had worked out for him though had he been careful he probably would have been dead several times over he started back toward the hut where fulda lived she and herris trailed after him he discovered ferdulf had come out while he was staring at the pigducks in the pond and the duckpigs by it ferdulf was whacking at something in the grass with a stick for all the world like any other fouryearold but he was not any other fouryearold he looked up at gerin and spoke in his mellow baritone i wonder how youd look with a big green ducks head he frowned in concentration nothing happened for which the fox was duly grateful probably pretty silly he replied after considering he refused to let ferdulf put him in fearor rather he refused to let ferdulf see he put him in fear in the same mild thoughtful tones hed just used he went on i wonder how youd look with your backside all red and sore you wouldnt dare ferdulf said you know whose son i am gerin did know only too well ive spanked you before when you earned it he answered which was also true he didnt tell ferdulf hed gone back to fox keep and got drunk afterwards to celebrate surviving the experience ferdulf frowned i was littler then i didnt know all the things i could do just because you can do something doesnt mean you should do it gerin said if ferdulf thought he was coming into his full powers at four what would he be like at fourteen at thirtyfour the fox did his best not to think about that he also did his best not to think about how unlikely it was for mavrixs get to understand what restraint meant why not ferdulf asked with what sounded like genuine curiosity sure enough he didnt understand gerins point patiently gerin explained because some of the things you can do either frighten people or make them unhappy so what yes ferdulf was mavrixs son all right how do you like it when someone frightens you or makes you unhappy gerin asked youre about the only one who ever tries to do anything like that ferdulf answered he looked thoughtful i wonder if i could stop you the fox felt fingers prying in his mind that was how he recalled the sensation later at any rate it showed him that ferdulf however strong he was by merely mortal standards was weak by those of the godsmavrix had rummaged through gerins thoughts and memories like a man going through a beltpouch in search of a pin stop that the fox said and tightened his mental muscles he wasnt sure that would do any good but had no intention of yielding to the little demigod without first putting up whatever fight he could ferdulf looked astonished as he usually did when things failed to go as hed thought they would how are you doing that he demanded youre supposed to be thinking about what i want you to think about not what you want to think about by his tone that latter wasnt worth contemplating those probing mental fingers groped harder gerin grunted ferdulf had told him his resistance had some success something an older wiser foe would have known better than to do so he kept on resisting as the palisade to fox keep had withstood a trokm siege he got the feeling resistance wasnt enough not by itself here he said youre going to think about what i want you to think about he couldnt reach out and touch ferdulfs mind not directly but there were other ways of gaining the demigods attention gerin grabbed ferdulf and flipped him over his knee ferdulf let out a squeal of pure outrage i said you wouldnt dare he cried the probing fingers vanished from gerins mind if nothing else the fox had managed to distract him just because you said it doesnt make it so not without a certain amount of trepidation gerin brought down the hand that wasnt restraining ferdulf the demigods howl was quite satisfactory ferdulf tried to rise straight up into the air as he had while playing at fox keep he did rise too but not very far not with the fox holding onto him have i got your attention yet gerin asked even with his feet off the ground he retained enough presence of mind to administer another dose of the medicine he had chosen why dont you put us both down and we can talk about it some more instead of fighting oh very well ferdulfs petulant tones were an echo of those mavrix used when as did happen once in a while the sithonian god was compelled to change his ways thank you gerin said most sincerely when his feet touched the ground again youre welcome ferdulf answered an unexpected bit of politeness he must have acquired from his mother he gave the fox a dirty look why are you so much harder to change than pigs and ducks as the implications of that sank in herris bigfoot and fulda gasped gerin gulped ferdulf had been trying to give him a ducks head then i dont know why he said im just glad i am and i want you to remember i am the next time you try to change meor anything elseyoure going to be in trouble have you got that yes ive got it ferdulf didnt look happy about it either which was a long way from breaking gerins heart the little demigod glared up at him how come you get to tell me what to do when youre only a mortal why the fox considered that i can think of a couple of reasons one is i may be just a mortal but ive been around a lot longer than you have i know more about the world than you do the first of those statements was undoubtedly true the second would undoubtedly have been true were ferdulf an ordinary fouryear old were ferdulf an ordinary fouryearold though he wouldnt have tried flying off with the fox and he wouldnt have tried decorating him with a mallards head either whatever else ferdulf was he wasnt trained to catch logical flaws he accepted what the fox told him more readily than gerin would have thats one he said whats two two is very simple gerin answered i just showed you im strong enough to do it didnt i besides being aragis argument over balsers allegiance that also had its logical flaws how long would gerin go on being stronger than ferdulf what would happen when he wasnt stronger any more gerin didnt know the answers to those questions he could think of things liable to be more pleasant than discovering what those answers were but ferdulf though a demigod was a fouryearold demigod as with any other fouryearold things as they were now seemed close to the way they would be forever yes youre stronger he said angry resignation in his voice but not everybody is if that aside didnt want to make herris and maybe fulda too run somewhere far far away maybe it should have gerin carefully chose a different issue im not the only one whos stronger than you ferdulf what about selatre my wife despite her disclaimer to marlanz ferdulf had been known to heed what she said thats not fair he exclaimed now the god she knows still keeps an eye on her and my father wont pay any attention to me you can tell that farseeing biton still holds selatre in his mind gerin asked of course ferdulf said cant you he didnt altogether grasp how limited the ordinary human sensorium was hed also said something else interesting though he probably didnt know it so mavrix was less than attentive to his offspring was he that didnt surprise gerin though he hadnt known it before a god of unbridled fertility didnt strike the fox as likely to make the most devoted parent for any one child will you behave yourself he demanded of the little demigod i suppose so ferdulf answered no more pigducks or duckpigs gerin said having dagref in his household hed learned better than to leave loopholes open and no more mixing any other creaturesor peopletogether all right all right ferdulf said not too much sulk in his voice gerin didnt trust his promise very far but didnt altogether discount it either from what hed seen of ferdulf the promise was worth about as muchand as littleas that of any other child of the same age sooner or later the demigod would forget hed made it and do something else appalling that was how children behaved even children of large powers but the fox didnt think ferdulf would go out and deliberately break his word fair enough he said we have a bargain then ferdulf nodded and went off to play gerin didnt think he walked a couple of feet off the ground intending to intimidate more likely he just wasnt thinking about what he was doing herris bigfoot by now took such minor impossibilities in stride he said thank you lord king we are grateful to you believe me for keeping him under what control you do gerin looked him straight in the eye quack he answered seriously quack quack quack herris looked horrified fulda gasped in dismay gerin let both of them stew for a moment then started to laugh that wasnt nice lord king fulda said sounding more sorrowful than angry he thought about it when ferdulf terrorized the villagers he didnt know any better gerin did youre right of course he told fulda i shouldnt have done it im sorry if anything the apologythe second in the space of a few minutesdisconcerted her more than the quacks had youre the king she blurted you dont have to say youre sorry to the likes of me he shook his head no youre wrong its aragis who never needs to say hes sorry thats the difference between us right there fulda didnt understand he hadnt expected she would back next contents ii who comes to fox keep called the sentry up on the palisade i am balser debos son came the reply from the chariot outside the keep i am here to give homage and fealty to gerin the fox the king of the north to acknowledge him as my suzerain and overlord of my barony the sentry whirled to see where gerin was as it happened he was standing in the courtyard not far away did you hear that lord king he exclaimed his voice going high and shrill with excitement did you hear that i heard it the fox answered hed been waiting for this moment for some time waiting for it and at the same time half hopingmaybe more than half hopingit would not come now that it was here though he would have to make the most of it he raised his voice balser debos son is welcome at fox keep let him enter bronze chain clattered as the gate crew lowered the drawbridge balsers chariot rolled into the courtyard the driver reined in the fine twohorse team balser got down from the car and walked over to the fox he was a young man dark slim not very tall but well put together who wore his beard in the forked style that had long been out of date but was suddenly all the rage again like the first stone sliding down a mountain to start an avalanche gerin remembered how the elabonian empire had blocked the last pass through the high kirs with just such an avalanche leaving the northlands to their own devices when the trokmoi invaded balser was going to cause a lot more trouble than he ever could have accounted for by himself his coming here in fact was no doubt the beginning of the rockslide well no help for it gerin hurried to meet him halfway the two men clasped hands i greet you balser debos son the fox said as his men gathered to watch the drama unfold use my keep as your own as long as you are here i thank you lord king balser replied if you should ever come south my keep is likewise yours gerin nodded he was glad to make a new guestfriend webs of host and guest guest and host each bound by the sacred ties of friendship to do no harm to the other stretched across the northlands without them feuds among barons would have been even worse than they were but balser had not traveled here to become a guestfriend however pleasing that might have been for the southern baron youre certain you want to become my vassal gerin said you dont care to stay your own lord as your father and grandfather were before you my father and grandfather never had to worry about aragis the archer balser sent gerin a curious look is it that you dont want my vassalage lord king thats not what you gave me to understand before no it isnt that aragis has threatened you aragis has tried to scare you out of your breeches as a matter of fact the breeches in question were dyed in bright checks of maroon and yellow a trokm mode that had grown fashionable among men of elabonian blood too scaring balser out of them would in gerins opinion have improved his wardrobe that however was not of the essence i dont blame you for wanting me to protect you from him and ill do just that the gods be praisedand you too lord king for your generosity balser said thats exactly what i want im not strong enough to hold him off on my ownhes shown me that you let your vassals remember theyre men id sooner go with you than have him swallow me down for which i thank you the fox didnt want to thank balser not really he wanted to kick him he wanted to kick aragis too for frightening balser into his own arms he wanted to kick aragis for being too arrogant to blame himself for frightening balser too had aragis shown only a little more restraint balser would have stayed neutral but the only man in all the northlands who had ever made the archer show restraint was gerin precisely because gerin worried him he could not bear to have the fox ruling balsers barony which lay close to his own another round of war was the last thing gerin wanted but that had nothing to do with anything war had come up to fox keep riding in balsers chariot balsers name had brought van and rihwin out of castle foxand selatre too a few paces behind them gerin didnt know where dagref materialized from one moment he wasnt anywhere to be seen but he stood at his fathers elbow the next vans daughter maeva had a quiver on her back and a bow in her hand she must have been practicing her shooting unlike dagref she hung back a little from her elders but balsers name drew her tooshe knew it meant fighting and that was what she wanted as the crowd grew balser said ill do it here and now if you like lord king we seem to have enough witnesses oh indeed the fox said its getting anything done without witnesses thats hard around here geroge and tharma came ambling around the corner of the castle gerin didnt think balsers name had attracted them but when they saw people gathering they hurried up to find out what was going on they were people tooor they were convinced they were balser didnt look so sure lord king id heard you kept a couple of those monsters at your keep but i hadnt believed it you may as well because its true im quite fond of them as a matter of fact gerin offered no compromise there whatever if balser didnt like it he could go back to his barony that would disappoint maeva who wanted a war but not the fox who didnt but balser showed no signs of packing up and leaving are they your vassals too he asked i do like to know the company im keeping one of gerins eyebrows rose at that display of sangfroid stepchildren more like he answered and had the satisfaction of startling balser in return why is everybody standing here geroge asked he pointed at balser with a clawed index finger and who is this strange gentleman hearing him speak and make good sense startled balser again the baron could have remarked on geroges being a strange gentleman himself gerin gave him points because he didnt instead he answered the question seriously i am balser debos son and i have come to give homage and fealty to your stepfather geroge and tharma both clapped their large hairy hands together oh good they said seeing that everyone who dwelt at fox keep took the monsters for granted helped balser do the same he turned back to gerin saying where were we lord king he answered his own question by going to one knee before the fox rihwin coughed and said meaning no offense son of debo but the ritual of offering submission to the king he being of rank superior to that enjoyed by other sorts of overlords requires the vassal to rest both knees on the ground gerin hadnt intended to make an issue of it as far as he was concerned one knee would have been as binding as two balser fortunately didnt seem inclined to make an issue of it either very well he said and went from one knee to two at the same time offering his hands to gerin palms pressed together the fox enclosed balsers hands with his own balser gave him homage i balser debos son own myself to be your vassal gerin the fox king of the north and give you the whole of my faith against all men who might live or die i gerin king of the north accept your homage balser debos son and pledge in my turn always to use you justly in token of which i raise you up now the fox pulled balser to his feet and kissed him on the cheek sealing the ceremony of homage by dyaus the father of all and the other gods of elabon i swear my fealty to you lord king balser said with a bow gerin bowed to him in turn by dyaus the father of all and the other gods of elabon i accept your oath and swear to reward your loyalty with my own i am your man lord king balser said not a formal part of the ceremony but a truth nonetheless so you are gerin said well feast tonight to celebratenot that he felt much like celebratingand then tomorrow ill send out messengers to some of my other vassals telling them your lands need protecting against aragis i want warriors down there as fast as may be balser looked less than delighted at that prospect but in the end nodded he seemed to be realizing for the first time what all having an overlord entailed gerins men were going to be overrunning his holding and he couldnt do anything about it they wouldnt burn and loot and kill as aragis men would have done at least not to anywhere near the same degree but they would be there and the holding would no longer be his in the sense it had been for so long and of course the presence of the foxs men in balsers holding was liable to bring aragis army over the border in which case the archers men would do the burning and looting and killing balser had come to gerin to prevent the fox thought he saw the moment in which balser figured that out too his new vassal wasnt so good as he might have been at holding his face straight second thoughts gerin asked him some balser answered which bespoke a certain basic honesty i couldnt go it alone any more and i couldnt stomach bending the kneebending both kneesto aragis that left bending the kneethe kneesto you for which ringing endorsement i thank you gerin said balsers worried expression made him hold up a hand dont fret you havent offended me you knew what you were doing and why you were doing it thats more than a lot of people ever manage now come on he waved balser toward castle fox well enjoy ourselves for the time being and then van broke in from the crowd of onlookers and then well go off and fight ourselves one bloody big war he didnt sound so eager as he would have in his younger days but he did sound very sure no one who heard him claimed he was wrong either gerin shouted for ale and ordered an ox slain carlun vepins son grimaced at that gerin took no notice of him telling the cooks lay the fatwrapped thighbones on dyaus altar and set them afire so the smoke will rise up to heaven and the allfather will favor what balser and i have done today actually by everything hed seen by everything other gods had told him dyaus hardly bothered noticing what went on in the material world gerin shrugged he still had to make the effort fand came downstairs to see what the commotion in the great hall was about a big rawboned trokm woman still more than handsome though gray streaked her oncefiery hair she carried a couple of pieces of cloth shed been sewing into a tunic and a long bone needle shed heard vans last remark go off and fight a war will you now she said advancing on him leave me behind will you now the outlander scowled i will he rumbled and pointed to the needle theres a weapon for piercing cloth not flesh fand scowled right back at him youve got a weapon in your breeches for piercing flesh she jeered and better nor half the reason youre so wild for going off to battle is that along the way you find some pretty young things to stick it into girls who arent after hearing your lies a thousand times the way i have better than half the reason im wild to go off to battle is that you arent carping and cawing at me while im away van retorted fand shouted at him again he shouted back each ones opening shot had made the other angrier no doubt because both contained a painful amount of truth gerin eyed with some concern the needle fand was holding shed stabbed a trokm lover before she turned up at fox keep she and van occasionally quarreled with more than words but neither of them had ever seriously damaged the other the fox wanted that to stay true balser glanced over at him they must care for each other gerins new vassal remarked else theyd try and kill each other over some of the things theyre saying that marched very well with gerins own thoughts some people enjoy quarreling he said ive never seen the sport in it myself in the midst of her own tirade fand heard his quiet comment she spun away from van and toward him sure and im not quarreling for nobbut the sport of it lord king gerin the fox she loaded his title and name with the familiar scorn that could only have come from a former lover pointing at van she went on im quarreling for that he willna keep his trousers on the instant hes out of my sight am i the only one van shouted by the gods its hardly better than luck my children look like me instead of coming to blows they went upstairs a few minutes later gerin breathed a silent sigh of relief hed seen them do that a good many times before too they found being angry added spice to their lovemaking that bemused the fox too it wasnt the way he worked rihwin the fox said as a calm descends over the battlefield he winked if you had a wife shed be after you the same way gerin said without a doubt you have reason lord king rihwin gave a bow that was only slightly mocking therefore i was wise enough never to wed therefore youve got bastards in half the peasant villages in my domain gerin said which was also true i am not a eunuch rihwin said with dignity and i do all i can for my byblows gerin had to nod rihwin was erratic and extravagant but not badhearted never a dull moment around these parts is there balser debos son was looking a trifle walleyed as if he hadnt expected anything like the turbulent stir of personalities hed found at fox keep maybe he was having more second thoughts about becoming gerins vassal too late now in all seriousness gerin replied i do keep trying for them but i havent had much luck balser laughed wrongly thinking hed made a joke riders went out of fox keep the next morning to summon gerins vassals to bring their retainers to his holding for the likely campaign against aragis so many men climbing up on horses backs balser said as bemused by the show of equitation as by what had gone on in the great hall the night before which to the foxs way of thinking had been on the mild side always something new here eh lord king i hope so gerin answered that he saw startled balser anew he went on dont you think life would get dull if we kept doing the same things the same old way forever the more so as a lot of those old ways dont work as well as they might balser plainly hadnt thought about it at all as plainly he would have been quite happy to go on not thinking about it at all and to see the same old ways go on forever if he could most people were like that as gerin had discovered to his continued disappointment about this business of horseriding balser said we dont hardly see it down in my part of the northlands hed steered clear of openly arguing with his new overlord and was turning the conversation back toward the comment hed made first not a bad performance gerin thought aloud he said its been more than twenty years now since one of my vassals duin the bold came up with those footmountsstirrups we call emthat let a man stay mounted while he uses both hands for archery and let him charge home with a spear without having to worry about going back over the horses tail the instant he strikes home we had good luck using mounted men against the gradi i think the chariot is on the way out for traveling i can see that it might be balser said easier to ride than to harness up a car every day and you dont have to worry about your axle or your wheels breaking either suddenly seeming to realize what hed said he scratched his head ive just spoken well of the new havent i ill not tell if you dont gerin said solemnly thats a bargain balser laughed but then held up a hand i dont speak well of everything new mind you are you saying riders will take the place of chariots in war too i have trouble believing that a man on horseback isnt nearly so frightening to his foes as a chariot thundering down on them maybe not gerin said but riders can go places chariots cant and can fight on ground that would have chariots tipping over and with chariots remember your driver has to tend to the horses he cant do much fighting with men on horseback youre not wasting one in three but every rider has to tend to his horse balser returned i dont see that the gains worth it one way or the other well find out gerin said there will be a lot of chariotry in the force i bring down to defend your landtherell have to be because a lot of my vassals dont like the idea of riding any better than you do ill have a good many horsemen along too though and well see how they fare against aragis chariots they gave the gradi plenty of trouble as ive said but the gradi fight on foot this will be a different test a test balser debos son tasted the words a fitting comparison for he went on you sound as if youre trying out different ways of brewing ale as a matter of fact adiatunnus the trokm gave me one not so long ago gerin answered his people have taken to roasting the barley malt almost to the point where its burnt id lay long odds they did it by accident the first time but it makes a pretty good brew black as rich earth and full of flavor balser threw his hands in the air i might have known youd have something of the sort to tell me he exclaimed and then looked at the fox from under lowered eyelids you havent given me any of this funny black ale i dont like to spring it on people as a surprise gerin said it does take a bit of getting used to or so most folk find but if youre game for something new i have a few jars down in the cellar balser was more willing to contemplate novelty in ale than he was in ways of fighting after hed downed a jack of the trokmstyle brew he smacked his lips a couple of times and said thats not too bad i dont think id care to drink it all the time but for now and again itd be fine itd go right well with blood sausage id say now that you mention it it does gerin said and called for some to prove the point while they were eating he went on you ask me the more choices you have in anything the better if youre bedding a woman for instance you dont want to just climb on top and pound away all the time balser looked as astonished as he had at the idea of fighting from horseback rather than in a chariot what other way is there he demanded gerin spent a moment silently pitying his new vassals wife if balser had one but then the fox while a student down in the city of elabon had become acquainted with a scroll that got copied and recopied as it passed from hand to hand and from generation to generation the text had been educational the illustrations even more so he didnt go into great detail the more he talked though the wider balsers eyes got balser could see possibilities if you pointed them out to him lord king he burst out idve become your vassal for this all by its lonesometo the five hells with anything else i never thought of getting vassals like that the fox said with a laugh more flies end up stuck in honey than in vinegar though dont they i wonder if adiatunnus would have given me less trouble over the years if hed spent more time figuring out all the different postures he could bend the trokm girls into balser ran his tongue over his lips im from far enough south that i havent had much dealing with the trokmoior their women are the wenches as loose as i hear well no gerin answered and balser looked disappointed the fox went on their ways are freer than ours youll never find a trokm whos shy about telling you what heor she very much or shethinks if they like you youll know about it and if they dont like you youll know about that too ah balser said well thats not too bad i suppose he was young enough and of rank high enough to assume that women would like him maybe he was even right on the other hand given how much hed shown he didnt know maybe he wasnt on the other hand gerin sighed on the other hand he said theres adiatunnus hes as good at hiding what he thinks as any elabonian ever born hes learned from us too since he brought his band of woodsrunners south over the niffet if he hadnt had me for a neighbor he might be the one styling himself king of the north these days he sounds like trouble balser said you should have killed him he is trouble gerin answered he was trouble anyhow i did try to kill him it didnt work if it hadnt been for the gradi id have tried again and that probably wouldnt have worked either the past five years hes been as good a vassal as a man could want he even came to fox keep so i could teach him his letters a woodsrunner both balsers eyebrows shot up why on earth did he want to do that i never felt the need myself hes always thought we elabonians were more civilized than his people and so aped us though hed never own as much out loud gerin said ill teach anyone who wants to learn i dont mind having serfs able to read and write for one thing it makes keeping track of what they have and what they owe easier for another some of them are sharpmy steward used to be a serf for instance ive heard some things about that balser didnt say whether he thought those things good or bad gerin didnt much care one way or the other he also wasnt quite ready to change the subject but i was talking about adiatunnus trokm or not he never shows ahead of time how hell jump hes my biggest worry in going to war against aragis as a matter of fact hows that lord king balser asked afraid hell jump you from behind thats just what im afraid of the fox looked at balser with somber approval the baron from the south might not think much of reading but he was not a fool and thats why ill be waiting and watching to see what he does now that ive asked him for men if he gives me all ive asked for well and good if he comes himself at their head better than well and good if he sends me excuses instead of men in that case i have to leave more men behind myself but then you wont be able to do a proper job of defending me balser exclaimed i wont be able to do a proper job of defending you if im fighting a big war up here either gerin pointed out he held out his hands as if they were the pans of a scale and moved them slowly up and down its not a matter of doing all one thing or all the other its finding a proper balance between them balser didnt say anything the noise he made in the back of his throat though did not sound like agreement of course we may be fretting over shadows gerin said it depends on adiatunnus balser made the same noise rather louder by dribs and drabs vassals started coming into fox keep they slept in the rushes of the great hall they slept in the courtyard and as the army grew they began setting up tents on the meadow near the keep and sleeping there every time a new contingent arrived gerin would look delighted and carlun vepins son appalled the fox thought of them as fighting men to his steward they were but extra mouths to be fed ill tell you what they are van said one day after a dozen or so warriors led by a young baron named laufram the lean stared in wonder at the nondescript keep of their overlord and at the swelling host theyre peculiar thats what how do you mean gerin asked i dont quite know the outlander confessed but theyre different from the way they used to be when i first came to fox keep were different from the way we used to be when you first came to fox keep gerin said we were young men ourselves then or near enough van shook his head with some impatience he answered i know that its not what i mean ive taken it into account or i think i have all right gerin spread his hands but if that isnt what you mean and you cant tell me what you mean how am i supposed to make sense of it van shrugged a massive shrug and walked off muttering into his beard a little while later though he came up to gerin at a pounding trot i have it captain he said hed never called his friend lord or lord prince or lord king by all the gods i have it the fox raised an eyebrow do you suppose taking a physic will cure you of it when van made as if to hit him he laughed and said all right you have it now that you have it what is it its this the outlander said importantly back in the old days your vassal barons would just as soon spit in your eye as look at you is that so or isnt it oh its so all right gerin agreed a lot of them had been used to dealing with my father to them i was nothing but a puppy sitting in the big dogs place i had to prove i belonged there every day the smile he wore was slightly twisted some of his memories of the early days after he took over the barony were fond ones others anything but thats right vans head bobbed up and down thats exactly right but these troopers coming in now and the barons leading them toowhat do they treat you like to the five hells with me if they dont treat you like a king gerin thought about it then he too slowly nodded maybe they do he said the ones who are lordlets now are the sons and grandsons most of them of the lords who held those keeps back twentyodd years ago you and i van weve outlived most of the men who started with us we havent outlived aragis van said not yet anyway his big fist folded around the hilt of his sword in grim anticipation no nor adiatunnus either gerin plucked at his beard outlasting the competition wasnt a very dramatic way of gaining the upper hand but it worked how many young men died long before they were able to show all they could do how many times had he nearly died himself more than he cared to think of that was certain ah adiatunnus van spoke with a certain fond ferocity gerin often heard the same note in his own voice when he talked about the trokm chieftain the outlander went on and what will you do if himself himselfhe put on a trokm lilt for a momentdoesnt care to come when hes called as a good vassal should worry the fox answered which made van laugh its not funny gerin insisted i was talking about this with balser too and fretting over it before i talked with him if adiatunnus waits till i m all tied up with aragis and then rises against me i dont think id enjoy that much neither would he after you were through with him van said gerin thought that even his friends got the idea he could do more than he knew to be humanly possible van continued if he betrays you you could loose the gradi against him oh now theres a fine notion gerin exclaimed if you have a sore toe take an axe and whack off your foot well you could make him think you were going to do it van said and that when you got down to it wasnt the worst idea in the world ferocious as they were the trokmoi feared the gradi who had often beaten them in battle and whose gods had trounced their own if they hadnt feared the gradi so much adiatunnus would have gone to war against gerin years before instead of asking him for aid nevertheless i hope i dont have to think about it gerin said i hope he shows up here with a whole great whacking unruly lot of trokmoi in chariots he laughed at himself and if id said anything like that a few years back everyone would have been sure i was out of my mind dont you fret about it captain van reassured him everyone was sure you were out of your mind anyhow its such ringing endorsements that have made me what i am today the fox said which is bloody fed up with people who use friendship as an excuse to insult me he did not intend to be taken seriously and van obliged him dont fret about that either id insult you even if we werent friends both men laughed gerin laughed even more four days later when adiatunnus and a whole great whacking unruly lot of trokmoi in chariots did show up at fox keep he had all the relief off his face by the time the trokm chief swaggered over the drawbridge and into the courtyard or so he thought at any rate after the bows and the handclasps were over adiatunnus tilted his head back to look down his long thin nose at the fox he blew out a long breath through his luxuriant drooping mustachios and said sure and ill wager youre not sorry to set eyes on me at all at all well if youre bright enough to see that youre bright enough to see id be lying if i said anything else gerin answered youre not the sort of man i can take for granted you know adiatunnus preened like a lot of trokmoi he was vulnerable to flattery but gerin hadnt been lying either he would much sooner have had the woodsrunner under his eye than behind his back so youre finally going after aragis the archer are you now lord king adiatunnus said about time says i past time says i his pale eyes gleamed in his knobbycheekboned face for years i waited for the shindy twixt the two of you to start so i could put paid to you once for all he shook his big fist at gerin in anger not altogether assumed and you you kernyou wouldna fight him you were one of the reasons i never did gerin said again truthfully i knew youd land on my back if i got into it with aragistill you and i made peace with each other that is he said not a word about any worries hed had on summoning adiatunnus as a vassal this time if the trokm chief didnt already have ideas in his head the fox had no intention of putting them there adiatunnus as it happened already had them oh aye i thought on doing it the now but i held myself back indeed and i did thats interesting gerin felt a drop of sweat slide down his back why if you dont mind my asking not a bit adiatunnus answered two reasons in all the first is you came to my aid against the gradi when you were right on the point o going to war against me instead what a blackhearted spalpeen id be to forget it well by the gods the fox exclaimed gratitudes not dead after all he bowed to adiatunnus now youve put me in your debt but go on two reasons you said and you gave only one whats the other the trokm scuffed his foot against the ground more like an abashed boy than a man whod ably led his clan for more than twenty years sure and im shamed to own it but im shamed to lie too here it is fox and to the crows with you if you brag of it i was after fearing that did i hit you whilst you looked the other way youd still somehow or other make me sorry i ever was born i say that mind and i reckon myself not the least tricksy man living these days nor the weakest either gerin considered mm i dont know whether i could have or not i tell you this though i would have tried he doubted he could have done much to adiatunnus not if he was embroiled against a foe as formidable as aragis at the same time again he did not mention his doubts to the trokm ideas about how dangerous he was were ones he wanted adiatunnus to have when do we move against aragis adiatunnus asked whenever it is my warriors will be ready likely tell gerin gave him a saucy grin ill set the day for you two days before the one i tell my elabonians so we can all set out at the same time adiatunnus glared is that a tongue you carry in your mouth or a woodworkers rasp were not so slow as all that indeed and were not for youd fret over less an we were fair enough gerin said come drink some ale with me now and your warriors and mine can get drunk together and tell lies about all the different times they tried to kill each other and some of the tales they tell wont be lies at all fox darling adiatunnus said widin simrins son would be here for instance im thinking he wasna in his own keep when i passed it by on the way hither yes hes here gerin answered remember he and you are both my vassals now you cant go having your own little wars for the fun of it indeed and id never think such a thing the sparkle in adiatunnus eyes said he didnt expect gerin to believe a word of it but i do recall the days when we went after each other and not a doubt have i got that theyre in his memory as well hashing them out over some ale will be safer nor going through them ever was truth that gerin agreed falling into the trokm tongue for a couple of words like a lot of elabonians whod grown up on the border he used it almost as readily as his own language adiatunnus held up a forefinger one more question before i drink deep and forget i meant to ask it have you had more of your books copied out that i might buy them of you yes gerin answered a chronicle and a poem ah thats fine thats fine indeed the trokm chieftain said when you told me youd teach me the art of reading i bethought myself id learn it as i learned to use a tool or a weapon the more such things you know the better after all but you omadhaun you why did you not tell me beforehand itd be near as much fun as futtering why gerins eyes were wide and innocent if i had told you thatbeforehand mind youwould you have believed me nay i wouldna adiatunnus admitted he gave the fox a sudden suspicious stare dont go thinking youre civilizing me the now or whatever youre after calling it a trokm i am and i remain and proud of it of course gerin said more innocently still lord king i beg you put the army in motion soon carlun vepin s son said you have no idea how fast theyre going through the stores youve built up over the years i have a very good idea how fast theyre doing it gerin returned i ought to and the reason you build up stores in the first place carlun is to be able to use them at times like these normally that sort of answer would have silenced the steward now though he shook his head and said truly lord king you must see this for yourself come down into the storerooms under the castle look at the empty shelves look at the empty chambers by the gods see what this campaign is doing to fox keep the fox sighed the trouble with carlun as with any good steward he supposed was that accumulating got to be an end in itself for him not a means to an end shouting at the former serf had produced no lasting relief humoring him might buy gerin a longer quiet stretch all right lets go have a look he said and rose from the bench in the great hall he and carlun had been sharing after exclaiming in glad surprise carlun rose too pausing in the kitchen only to light two clay lamps at a cookfire the steward handed gerin one of them and then led him down into the cellars below castle fox the air was cool and damp down there full of the yeasty smell of ale and a greener odor suggesting that somewhere back among those corridors a crock of gherkins had gone over carlun pointed to a bare wall look lord king we had jars of ale set there not so long ago i know that gerin said patiently if we all started drinking river water the first thing it would do is make all my vassals and all their vassals and all their retainers hopping mad at me the second thing it would do is give about half of them a flux of the bowels thats not really what you want if you expect to fight a war sometime soon and here carlun said dramatically paying no attention whatsoever to him he held the lamp close to another row of jars so the fox could see they had the lids off and were empty these were full of wheat and these over here were full of barley and these and you carlun youre full of beans gerins patience was breaking now when it broke it left sharp edges if i dont feed my soldiers that will get me talked about worse than not giving them ale the steward still was not listening the steward was determined not to listen in the darkness all around the flickering lamplight gleamed off his pale set face gerin had seen less battleready faces coming at him over shields carlun pointed toward a corridor down which theyd not yet gone and the peas lord king when you think whats happening to our peas what gerin was thinking was that this wasnt working as hed hoped no matter what he did carlun wasnt going to stop nagging him about how much the warriors were eating wearily he said all right show me the peas carlun and then well go back upstairs the men arent eating any more than i thought they would and the stores dont look to be in any worse shape than i thought they were carlun rounded the corner gerin followed close behind him with a gasp the steward stopped in his tracks gerin had to stop in a hurry too lest he walk up carluns back and perhaps set the stewards tunic on fire then the foxs hand flew to the hilt of his sword for he heard two other gasps from farther up the corridor he took his hand away from his sword as fast as it had gone there he started to laugh down here two gasps didnt mean thieves they meant two people surprised when they wanted privacy he had fond memories of some of the corridors in the cellar not this one in particular but some nearby he knew his son duren had amused himself down here too sorry to disturb you he called into the gloom at the end of the passage wondering if hed interrupted dagref at a moment in his education he couldnt possibly have acquired from a book from out of that gloom came a deep voice you startled us lord king we didnt think anyone would be down here gerin clapped a hand to his forehead he knew that voice it wasn t dagrefs carlun and i will go up to the great hall now he said when the two of you have put yourselves back together i want you to come up there too we have some talking to do im afraid aye lord king came the answer from the darkness come on gerin said to carlun who was still staring down the passageway lets go the steward looked back toward him as if hed gone mad but lord king were not nearly through the vegetables and we havent even begun on the smoked meats and er sausages to the five hells with the vegetables and the smoked meats gerin didnt mention the sausages if he didnt think about them maybe he wouldnt think about on the other hand maybe he would he grabbed carlun by the arm come on curse you do you want to annoy them hanging about down here that got carlun moving as the fox had thought it would it got carlun moving so fast he tripped on the stairs going up to the kitchens not once but twice once up in the kitchens he hurried out through them gerin followed more slowly he wondered if carlun would wait in the great hall to discuss beans and radishes and smoked pigs knuckles when carlun chose to find something else to do out in the courtyard the fox nodded without any particular surprise he hadnt hired his steward to be a hero he sat down at the bench where he and carlun had been talking a couple of troopers started to come into the great hall the fox waved them out again a serving girl walked over to him with a pitcher of ale he waved her away too wanting both a clear head and no audience for the discussion he knew he was going to have a couple of minutes later geroge walked out of the kitchens looking as nonchalant as he could gerin nodded and slapped the bench beside himself some of the monsters nonchalance evaporated as he came over and sat down gerin nodded again he didnt say anything not until tharma came out of the kitchens too she didnt even try for nonchalance worry twisted her face as she joined geroge and the fox well well gerin said then as mildly as he could how long has this been going on geroge and tharma were too hairy for him to tell whether they blushed by the way they wiggled on the benches he thought they did not long lord king geroge answered he did more talking than tharma the fox glanced over to the female monster youre not with child are you oh no lord king she said quickly i would know thats good he said and wondered where to go from there geroge and tharma had been raised as brother and sister he thought they were brother and sister the peasant whod found them as cubs and brought them to him said theyd been together but discussions of incest seemed out of place when they were the only two of their kind above ground in the northlands hed actually thought this moment would come sooner than it had are you angry at us lord king geroge asked reading his expression and tone of voice werent easy but he seemed more worried about the foxs anger than one of his own children would have been gerin shook his head if that wasnt irony he didnt know what was with a sigh he answered no im not angry youre the only two like yourselves in these parts and youre a man and a woman he knew no better way to put it what else are you going to do oh good tharma said i hope i do get to be with child before too long gerin coughed im not so sure thats a good idea he said one of the better understatements he remembered making in some time why not tharma asked you could marry us the way you or the headman does for the serfs and then the children wouldnt be bastards we wouldnt want that lord king geroge added seriously the fox was tempted to pound his head against the top of the table at which he was sitting all things considered he was more proud of himself than not over how hed raised them they earnestly wanted to do everything the right way the proper way the only trouble was they didnt see enough of the picture a failing anything but unique to their kind he explained as gently as he could you know how people who dont know you get upset when they first see you because you remind them of the trouble that happened around the time when you were born he couldnt come up with a politer way of putting that the monsters had done their horrific best to overrun the northlands and that best had nearly proved good enough oh yes we know about that geroge answered nodding his large fearsome head but once people get to know us they see were all right even if we dont look just like them part of the reason people saw thata big partwas that the two monsters were under gerins protection another part the fox admitted to himself was that as monsters wenteven as people wentgeroge and tharma were good people and another big part of the reason they got such tolerance as they did was that they were the only two monsters above ground i dont know how happy regular people would be if you started raising a family gerin said carefully they might worry that the things that happened when you were born would start happening again thats foolish tharma bared her prominent teeth in indignation we know how to behave we should you taught us yourself and wed teach our little ones the same way im sure you would gerin was absurdly touched at the faith they put in his teachings no his own children didnt pay nearly so much attention to them even so though people would worry and they might get nasty i dont want that to happen youre the king geroge said you could tell them to stop it and theyd have to listen that was how the monsters had lived to grow up in the first place gerin didnt know if he could stretch it to a family of them he didn t really want to find out hed contemplated getting rid of geroge and tharma when they reached the age where they could reproduce their kind he hadnt done it the reason he hadnt done it he now discovered was that he couldnt do it hed raised them as his stepchildren and they were in essence his stepchildren by all the gods be careful he told them he might have told dagref the same thing one of these days soon he would be telling dagref the same thing he gestured sharply geroge and tharma hastily rose from their seats and went out into the courtyard gerin stared after them he bunched his right hand into a fist and brought it down hard on the tabletop hed known this day was coming he was a man who prided himself on acting with decision now the day had come and gone and all he had to show for it was ambiguity he looked down at his fist and willed it to unfold when it did he started to laugh it was not amusement or not amusement with anything but the human condition the part of it that had to do with the difference between the way men thought things would work and the way they actually turned out and with making the best of that difference twenty years ago he muttered under his breath twenty years ago i thought i was going to slaughter every trokm on the face of the earth hed had good reason to think that too what better reason than the woodsrunners killing his father and older brother and making him leave the city of elabon to return to the northlands hed learned to despise hed taken vengeance as great as any man could have done and now and now adiatunnus walked into the great hall waved walked over and sat down beside him and clapped him on the back while shouting for ale and the fox was genuinely glad to have the trokm with him he was too honest to try to pretend otherwise to himself life he observed with a profound lack of originality is a much stranger and more complicated thing than we think when we first set out on it truth there adiatunnus agreed or would i be after calling a cursed southron like your own self a friend and meaning it that so closely mirrored gerins own thought he blinked in startlement adiatunnus went on but not a chance at all have we of making the pups believe it ive given up i have they think everythings simple sure and they do a grave now a graves a simple thing what comes beforenay you should have gone down to the city of elabon to study philosophy gerin said youd have made the sithonian lecturers work for a living i think philosophy were getting old you and i is that philosophy it will do till something better comes along gerin called for ale himself carlun vepins son stood beaming from ear to ear the army gerin had assembled was leaving fox keep the soldiers wouldnt stop eating and drinking of course but they would stop eating and drinking where the steward could see them doing it and where he could see the results of their depredations to carlun nothing else mattered dagref drove gerins chariot concentration turned the youngsters face masklike this was his first campaign and he was determined to make no mistakes he would of course despite all his determination gerin wondered how he would deal with that the only way to find out was to let him have the chance and see what happened van had another thought setting a hand on dagrefs shoulder he said i rode to war with your brother at the reins not so long ago yes i know dagref answered duren is older than i am so of course he got to do all these things first of course van echoed and winked at gerin the fox nodded that qualification was dagref to the core not only precise but also just a little slighting to anyone who dared presume he wasnt precise gerin said when we get down to durens holding in a few days hell be surprised how much youve grown yes dagref said and fell silent again five years earlier dagref had wanted to be like duren in every way he could now he was his own person and increasingly insistent that everyone acknowledge him as such no doubt he also thought about duren in a different way these days one of them would succeed the fox duren was gerins firstborn but dagref was his firstborn by selatre duren already ruled in his own right the barony that had been his grandfathers dagref as yet ruled nothing and nobody in another five years though or ten since gerin had yet to decide who would succeed him he didnt blame dagref for having the question a good deal in his mind too he wished he could send the lad down to the city of elabon even more than himself perhaps dagref was made for the scholars life the fox sighed he hadnt been able to stay a scholar and there was no guarantee dagref would either life as gerin had learned did not come with a guarantee that was a lesson serfs sucked in with their mothers milk most serfs seeing an army on the move whether made up of the enemy or of their overlords warriors ran for the woods and swamps with whatever they could carry women ran faster than menand had better reason to run the serfs who labored in the foxs holding though watched the chariots come forth from the keep without fear a few of them even waved from the fields and vegetable plots where they labored slowly over the years theyd let gerin convince them his soldiers were likelier to mean protection than rapine and rape as dagref drove past the village a small figure came out of one of the huts there and trotted after his chariot no child should have had any business gaining on a twohorse chariot this one did so with effortless ease father dagref asked in a small tight voice did you intend for ferdulf to campaign with us of course not gerin answered he waved to the little demigod go back to your mother no ferdulf answered in his utterly unchildlike tones the village is boring and with you and all your soldiers gone from the keep itll be boring there too ill go with you maybe you wont be boring he sounded as if with some reluctance he was giving the fox the benefit of the doubt gerins reaction was that life with ferdulf wasnt likely to be boring either but that didnt mean it would be more enjoyable go back to your mother the fox repeated no ferdulf said in his stubbornness not only childlike but godlike a point in common between the two aspects of his nature gerin had noticed before ferdulf stuck out his tongue like mavrix he could stick it out improbably far when he wanted to you cant make me either as if to emphasize that he leaped into the air and flew along ten or fifteen feet above gerins head jeering all the while if the little bugger doesnt knock that off van muttered behind his hand hes liable to find out just how close to immortal he is when he comes in for a landing i know what you mean gerin said he didnt expect van to try wringing ferdulfs neck or to succeed if he did try he understoodhe understood down to the groundthe reasons the outlander had for contemplating semideicide glaring up at ferdulf the fox declared if you dont come down from there this minute ill tell your father on you go ahead ferdulf answered he doesnt like you either thats true gerin said calmly but he wouldnt pick such foolish ways of showing it he thought he was even telling the truth whatever else could be said about himand a great deal else could have been said about himmavrix had style ferdulf did hesitate in his hesitation he fell a few feetalmost low enough for gerin to reach up and try plucking him out of the air at the last minute he thought better of it hed laid hold of ferdulf on the ground and had got away with it there doing the same thing from a moving chariot struck him as imperfectly provident dagref spoke over his shoulder arent you going to make him go back to the village im open to suggestions gerin snarled right now id be satisfied with making him shut up oh i can do that dagref said i thought you wanted what you said you wanted in the first place one of these days youll learn the difference between what you want and what youll settle for gerin said to which his son responded with only a scornful toss of his head nettled the fox snapped what forfeit will you pay if you dont make the little bastard shut up why whatever you like of course dagref replied van whistled softly hes asking for it fox you ought to give it to him so i should gerin tapped dagref on the shoulder go ahead do it now all right dagref said what forfeit will you pay if i do whatever you like of course gerin spoke in mocking imitation of his son hmm dagref looked up to ferdulf who was still flying along making a hideous racket you know right now youd annoy my father much more by keeping quiet than you do with all that noise silence after a minute or so van broke that silence with a thunderous guffaw gerin glared up at ferdulf who flew along still silent but made a horrible face back at him merely human features could never have accommodated that sneer of course a merely human being wouldnt have been flying along above the chariot either have i won father dagref asked aye youve won gerin admitted more than a little apprehensively what will you ask of me hed promised too much he knew hed promised too much now he had to deliver if dagref said something like declare me your successor on the spot he didnt see how he could do anything elseunless he could talk his son out of it talking dagref out of anything was no easy task he couldnt see his sons face dagref was concentrating on driving the chariot more silence stretched gerin knew what that meant dagref was thinking things over one thing he seldom did was speak too soon in that he was very like his father gerin had broken his own rule and now he would have to pay for it i dont know right now dagref answered after that pause for thought when i decide ill tell you all right gerin said youll know best whatever it turns out to be make sure its what you really want now and what you really want years from now too ah dagref rode on for another little while then said youre not going to tell me you were only joking and you didnt really mean it had he and dagref been having a purely private argument gerin might have tried telling him just that with a demigod as witness he thought the consequences of granting whatever dagref asked for would be less than those of trying to break his word no im not going to tell you that he said im going to count on your good sense van poked him in the ribs he grimaced the outlanders face bore an unseemly smirk the fox knew what he was thinking at dagrefs age good sense was hard to come by with anyone of that age but his contemplative son he would have had little hope himself as things were he had some dagref said all right father his chuckle was eerily like the one gerin would have used under the same circumstances im not likely to get another promise like that out of you am i you werent likely to get the first one gerin answered that was a sneaky bit of business you used playing ferdulf off against me i learned it from you dagref said youve been playing foes off one against another for years now sometimes they even notice you re doing it but never till too late he spoke matteroffactly he knew what he knew that gerins foesall of them men grownhad failed to see it till too late was their misfortune not his in his own rather withdrawn way he was formidable rihwin and a squadron of his riders came up and surrounded the chariot just then gerin was glad to watch them for a while they took his mind off both dagref and ferdulf the horseriders were staring up at ferdulf and exclaiming not all of them had paid the little demigod much heed till now ferdulf responded with a series of aerial maneuvers that would have left an eagle dizzy the riders clapped and cheered ferdulfs face bore a smug grin like mavrix he was vain dagref having used ferdulf to score his point against his father paid no more attention to him he watched the riders too gerin understood that most of them were young men a good number hardly older than dagref gerin hadnt seen so many nearly smooth cheeks and chins since his days in the city of elabon where shaving was the custom even the riders who had raised beards looked absurdly young to the fox one of them though very fuzzy made gerin wonder if he had even dagrefs years the fox shook his head hed been thinking more and more lately that the whole world was looking too bloody young but then he saw dagref eyeing that very younglooking horseman too and decided his eyes and wits hadnt been playing tricks on him after all he said son i can tell that riding horses is the coming thing you wont have to spend all your time driving a chariot you can learn what you need to know dagref looked away from the rider umm he said rather foolishly as if his mind had been somewhere else that was unlike him then he gave his usual serious notice to what gerin had said oh its all right he said i can ride a horse nowrihwins been teaching maeva and me and some of his own bastards when they come to fox keep i havent done any fighting from horseback yet but not a lot of men have youre right the fox said i dont think it will go on being so much longer though if we fight aragis now everybody in the northlands will know what horsemen can do and if they do what i think they will everybody in the northlands will want to have his own riders by this time next year now theres an interesting question father dagref said you could profit by sending out men to teach your neighbors how to fight from horseback but that would also be teaching them to fight better against you would it be worthwhile do you suppose yes that is interesting gerin said do i sell a man the axe he wants to use to chop off my head i suppose id have to decide one case at a time instead of laying down a blanket rule beforehand some id think i could trust some of the ones i couldnt trust id be sure i could beat and some i wouldnt want to help any which way ah dagref considered that then nodded youre saying that making a rule is like making a promise once youve made it you have to stick by it whether that looks like a good idea or not he coughed a couple of times then added i wish youd have said that more often when i was smaller straightfaced gerin answered i havent the faintest idea what youre talking about dagref turned to give him an irate stare after a moment they both started to laugh when evening came the army was still on land that had been in the foxs family for generations peasants who lived near the roadway came up to the army with sheep and pigs and chickens to sell adiatunnus watched the dickering with no small astonishment they run toward you not away he said to gerin its not that they stay in their fields the which is strange enough but they run toward you by the way he spoke the peasants might have practiced some unnatural vice theyve seen me lead armies south on campaign a good many times the fox answered they know we wont rob them or take any woman who doesnt want to be taken doesna seem right the trokm chieftain said if they dinna fear you how can you rule them oh they fear meif they get out of line they know ill make them sorry for it gerin said but they dont fear that well steal or rape for the amusement of it the idea is to make them feel safer with me over them than with anyone else they might think of adiatunnus walked off shaking his head as the sun neared the horizon tiwazs waxing gibbous disk halfway between first quarter and full grew brighter golden math a day before full crawled over the eastern horizon ruddy elleb and pale nothos were not in the sky both a little past third quarter they would rise not long after midnight just before sunset gerins men dug several short narrow trenches on the outskirts of their encampment they wrung off the chickens heads and cut the throats of the other animals theyd got from the peasants letting the blood spill into the trenches an offering for the night ghosts that might otherwise have driven them mad the ghosts came forth as soon as the sun disappeared from the sky gerin had been trying all his life to grasp their shape trying and failing nor could he understand their cries which dinned in his mind grateful for the boon of blood they tried to give him good advice but he perceived it only as wind and noise ive heard em howl worse van remarked i was thinking the same thing gerin said weve fed em well and weve got goodsized fires going to hold em away from us a bit but ive heard em a lot louder and more frightening than they are now i know what part of the answer is or i think i do van grunted ive seen it myself around your keep and in the village close by its that ferdulf isnt it i think so gerin said with a sigh the ghosts are just ghostsspirits that never found their way into the five hells theyre stronger than we arestronger in the nighttime anyhowbecause they havent got any bodies to worry about but stack them up against a demigod and they know theyd better walkuh flittersmall belike youre right van made a fist and smacked it into his open palm but i tell you this captain theres been plenty of times i wanted to slaughter the nasty little bugger no matter whose son he is heh gerin said and then you know i dont set much stock in being king not among friends i dont this time though im going to claim my rank if anybody tries killing him itll be me first wait till after weve fought aragis van said well yes that thought crossed my mind too the fox admitted i do wonder why ferdulf decided to come along though what worries me is that he is half a god the wrong half van put in the wrong god too come to that maybe but what does he know that i dont and how does he know it the outlanders jaw worked as if he truly were chewing that over and as if he didnt like the taste of the answer he got he spat on the grass bah he said best i can tell you is were all liable to be better off if we never find out cant argue with you there gerin said but my guess is were going to find out one way or the other i dare hope ferdulf is here so that if we do need some strange sort of help against aragis hell be able to give it to us aye van said i hope that too and if were wrong and hes along to let aragis have some help against us hell give it to us then too right up the yes i know i understand that gerin broke in hastily its the chance we take thats all ive taken a lot of chances these past twenty years and more whats another the one that kills you could be van said well yes the fox shrugged there is that back next contents iii every time a chariot came up the elabon way from the south gerin tensed wondering whether this would be the one that brought him word aragis had swarmed over the border into balsers holdingor whether aragis had swarmed over the border in some other place altogether in which case he would have to change his line of march in a hurry but no such news came on the fifth day after setting out from fox keep the army reached the castle from which gerins son duren ruled his holding the pace was slower than the fox would have liked but an army on the march of necessity moved no faster than its slowest parts holding the keep by descent from his grandfather as duren did he maintained full formal independence from gerin gerin had asked his eldest sons leave before entering his barony at the head of a fighting force he would have been astonished and dismayed had duren refused him that leave but duren did nothing of the sort the border guards he still maintained at the frontier between his holding and the lands over which the fox was suzerain stood aside as the warriors came past them their eyes got wide when they saw how many men gerin had with him gerin could not see the eyes of the sentry on the wall of durens keep but he would have bet they were wide too the fellows voice sounded more than a little awestruck as he hallooed who comes to the castle of duren ricolfs grandson he knew perfectly well who came but the forms had to be observed a great many men gerin had seen over the years got very upset when jolted out of the smooth routine of their everyday lives and so as if he were an unexpected arrival he answered i am gerin the fox king of the north come to guest with my son duren ricolfs grandson he didnt blame duren for using ricolfs name after his own on the contrary he found it a clever touch enter lord king and be welcome as lord durens guestfriend and as his father the sentry replied the drawbridge to the keep was already down with his holding altogether surrounded by the foxs lands duren feared no sudden assault gerin tapped dagref on the shoulder durens half brother drove the chariot across the drawbridge over the moat and into the keep duren was waiting in the courtyard as gerin had been sure he would be coming into this keep gerin saw ghosts that had nothing to do with the ones that came forth when the sun went down ricolf the red and elise and his own younger self he saw durens younger self too coming here at about the age dagref had now to claim this barony and make it his own that over these past five years duren had done he was nineteen now and looked enough like a young version of the fox to make gerin wonder for a crazy instant if he hadnt somehow slipped back across the years to his own early days oh duren was a little fairer a little stockier but the biggest difference between him now and his father at the same age was that his face held not the slightest trace of dreaminess gerin had been a second son able to afford such luxuries as thinking about whatever he chose with five years as a baron already under his belt duren worried about essentials first and everything else afterwards that did not mean he wasnt smiling good to see you father by dyaus and all the gods he said his voice deeper than gerins he folded the fox into a bear hug when gerin got down from the car then he nodded to dagref who still held the reins youve got him learning the trade i see same as you did with me at the same age how does it feel dagref his half brother weighed that with deliberation hed probably got from selatre too much to do not enough time to do it in he answered probably would be more if i were better at what i did you will be duren told him then turned back to gerin hes shaping well seems like he spoke thoughtfully in a way gerin hadn t heard from him before the fox knew what that meant the succession was in his mind well he would have been a fool if it werent the awkward moment passed quickly duren went on mothers well i trust he meant selatre he knew she hadnt birthed him of course but she was the only mother he remembered he hadnt been weaned long when elise ran off with the horseleech yes shes fine the fox said nodding clotild and blestar too and my pair as well said van who had got down to stand beside gerin and beam at the young man who was as near his nephew as made no difference youve grown up that you have beards thicker than mine was at the same age id say its darker duren said judiciously so it will look thicker than a yellow one like yours come into the great hall drink some ale with me so youre finally going to war with aragis are you father no gerin said hes going to war with me or he says he is marlanz rawmeat told me hed stopped here so youll have heard aragis side of the story he frightened balser into going over to me and now hell try to punish balser and me both hes welcome to try coming back from your keep marlanz didnt seem very happy duren said good gerin said he shouldnt be happy neither should aragis the archer is strong and tough and dangerous he can pick his time and his spot to start the war and once hes done that i aim to lick him im sure you will duren saidas usual more confident than the fox himself what help do you want with me if your vassals will send a few chariots south with the rest of the army that would be fine gerin answered if they dont want to do that though im not going to lose any sleep over it they dont love me some of them and they can say its not their fight do you want me to go myself duren asked as i say i wont turn you down but i dont see any great need for it either gerin said he nodded toward dagref you said it yourself its your brothers turn to learn the trade you already know yes duren didnt say anything more his eyes narrowed gerins mouth tightened things would never be the same for duren and dagref theyd be watching each otherand watching himtill the day he died after that regardless of the provisions hed made they were liable to square off against each other for that matter if gerin lived long enough blestar was liable to square off against both of them duren said ill feast your leaders tonight will you be swinging off the elabon way and heading over to ikos to find out what biton has to say about the fight against aragis i hadnt planned to no gerin said when the sibyl speaks the prophetic verses they usually stay obscure until after the fact and even when they arent obscure some people will try to make them so you ought to know that for yourself oh i do duren said my loving vassals doing everything they could to keep from admitting the god had said i was meant to be baron of this holding after all he snorted theyve got used to the idea by nowor if they havent they keep quiet about it that will do gerin said it will have to do you cant control how they think only what they doand only so much of that he raised an eyebrow a feast eh what does your steward have to say about that he says it will cost too much duren answered as best i can tell thats what stewards always say the fox laughed and nodded he ate bread and honey and smoking beef ribs and berry tarts in the great hall a little later and washed them down with ale as he ate and drank he thought of other longago feasts hed had in this place rihwin the fox sat across the table from him hed feasted here too when he was courting elise with a mischievous grin he asked shall i dance for you lord king go howl gerin exclaimed if rihwin hadnt got drunk and danced an obscene dance ricolf the red would have wed elise to him and then gerin didnt know and then what the world would have been vastly different for him he did know that the chamber duren gave him for the night was only a couple of doors down from the one in which hed slept twentyone years before the one in which elise had begged him to help her escape from a marriage to wolfar of the axe a marriage that most sensibly she did not want before too long shed been wed to the fox which also turned out to be a marriage she did not want duren couldnt have known where his father had stayed on that earlier visit gerin had no intention of ever telling him van had been in the next room then he was in the next room now hed brought a serving girl in there then hed brought a serving girl in there now the walls were thin gerin had no doubts hed been unattached then he was married to fand now gerin hoped he wouldnt bring her back an itemized list of his infidelities on campaign as hed been known to do life was hard enough already the outlander didnt have the stamina hed enjoyed two decades before quiet returned now sooner than it had then gerin took advantage of the quiet to go to sleep he woke up in the middle of the night in the next room van was snoring so was the girl they kept gerin awake almost effectively as they would have making love after a while he did drift off again he woke the next morning with a headache that wasnt quite a hangover a jack of ale and some bread and honey made it retreat if not disappear van washed raw cabbage down with his ale suggesting he had more morning pain than gerin did seeing the fox watching him he grinned and said i keep reminding myself what a good time i had last night last night i kept reminding myself how miserable id be today if i let myself drink too deep the fox felt smugly virtuous for feeling as good as he did theres the difference between us all right van said i had the good time and ill take the bad that goes with it you miss the bad aye but you miss the good too sometimes some people like mountains and valleys gerin replied some people like flatlands better me im one of them besides i dont really want any woman but selatremm not enough to do anything about it anyhow and he added with considerable dignity i dont snore honh van said thats what you think when adiatunnus didnt come out for breakfast as soon as gerin thought he should the fox asked duren to send a servant to pound on his door adiatunnus duly emerged looking much worse for wear than van did you see son gerin said to duren he was slow getting up when we campaigned against the gradi and he still is im not slow fox darling the trokm said in the cautious tones of a man who does not want to hear himself talk too loud what i am is dead be after having some respect for the corp of me he shuddered at the first taste of ale but looked more lifelike after hed downed a couple of jacks since you may not have to bury him in the courtyard after all gerin said to his son drawing a glare from adiatunnus well be off soon i dont know fox van said remember the rest of the woodsrunners are liable to be as sleepy as this one is we may not be out of here for two or three days and to the corbies with you as well adiatunnus said remind me once more were allies so i dont go cutting your throat from the sheer high spirits of it you and which army van returned politely they were just warming to the debate and still on this side of sword and axe and mace and spear when gerin said slaughter each other some other time if you must but remember for now that we have to take on aragis first sure and its all the fun out of life youre stealing adiatunnus said and van rumbled agreement the two of them united quite happily in complaining about the fox till the army left durens keep and headed off to the south balser debos sons driver brought his chariot up alongside the foxs now were getting close to my lands balser said better country if youll forgive my saying so than what youve got up around your own keep maybe gerin answered the timbers a little differentyouve got more elms and beeches and such down here not so many pines and your peasants can plant a few days earlier in spring and wont have to worry about frost quite so soon in the fall better country as i said balser sounded smug maybe gerin said or better some ways might be a truer way to put it youll grow a few things we dont but the elabon way here has gone back to gravel because peasants and local lords plundered the stone paving when there was nobody around to tell em they couldnt or shouldnt as if to prove his point gravel kicked up from one of the wheels to balsers chariot and hit him in the hand he grunted wasn t even gravel here when this land first came under my suzerainty balser coughed well lord king the way that works is you do what you think you have to do for the moment and let later on take care of itself gerin knew what that meant it meant balser and his vassalsand his serfs too if they thought they could get away with ithad been plundering the elabon way in his holding for building stone whenever they needed it he wouldnt do anything about that not when it had happened before balser was his subject he did say no more pulling up paving stone thats all over now if the road werent here balser we wouldnt be able to get to your holding fast enough to do you any good about aragis i suppose not balser plainly hadnt looked at it in that light before just as plainly he didnt care either i mean it the fox said this is part of what you bought when you gave me homage and fealty the elabon way is the one good thing the empire left behind when it pulled back from the northern lands i ve done everything i could to keep it in good shape its turning into the backbone for my own kingdom well yes i have seen that you care about it balser admitted its only a road though after all he and gerin looked at each other with complete mutual incomprehension youll have to get used to some new ways of doing things now that you are my vassal gerin said and let it go at that yes lord king balser didnt sound dutiful he sounded resigned the fox had no doubt about what he was thinking something on the order of how many of those new ways of doing things will i really have to get used to and how many will i be able to ignore every one of his new vassals had thoughts like that after a while theyor most of them anyhowgot the idea that the new waysor most of them anyhowworked pretty well when gerin had come by this road years before on his way down to the city of elabon with elise and van hed thought the barons here well away from the river niffet were soft they hadnt trimmed the brush back from the road as well as they should they hadnt kept their castles in good repair theyd half forgotten they were supposed to be fighting men the past twenty years and more had changed that the trokm invasion the eruption of the monsters from under bitons shrine and endless rounds of strife among the elabonians themselves meant barons who werent alert didnt live long the ones who did live made sure no one ever got the chance to take them by surprise still no move from aragis gerin said when they made camp that evening thats not like him hes never been one to bluff and then back down if he says hell do something he does it hes a bastard but a reliable bastard not far away an elabonian fell on his face as if hed tripped over a stone in the grass but there were no stones in the grass the meadow was as smooth as an ornamental lawn in front of a high functionarys residence in the city of elabon ferdulf giggled gerin scowled van said ithe does tempt you to find out just how nearly immortal he really is compose yourself lord king rihwin said could it not be that by mere rumor of his presence the demigod intimidates and inhibits aragis the archer from trying conclusions with you remembering how thoughtful ferdulf had made marlanz rawmeat gerin had to nod ferdulf certainly intimidates and inhibits me he said it would be nice if he did it to everyone else van looked around to see if balser debos son was in earshot not spotting him the outlander chuckled and said balsers going to be mighty unhappy if you bring this army down to his holding eat every storeroom he has empty lay tight hold on the land that was his and then dont even have to do any fighting myself i wouldnt mind that a bit gerin replied fighting is wasteful but youre right balser became my vassal so i could protect him if he doesnt need protecting but had he not come to you for protection aragis could have swallowed him at his leisure rihwin pointed out thats so van agreed but he wont think about it hell think he never should have come to the fox at all if wheat and barley were as thin on the ground as thankfulness wed all go hungry most of the time and thats a fact gerin said still and all the crop does grow adiatunnus told me one of the reasons he set out on this campaign with me instead of revolting being a trokm hes revolting almost by definition rihwin broke in you keep quiet gerin told him which aimed at rihwin was good advice almost by definition as i was saying or trying to say one of the reasons he set out on this campaign was that he was grateful i d gone to his aid against the gradi five years ago aye that was one van said the other if i recall was a nasty hunch youd turn around and kick him in the ballocks if he tried stabbing you in the back i never claimed gratitude was the only reason he chose to bring his men along with ours just that it was a reason gerin said he started to elaborate but both his old friends were laughing too hard to pay any attention to him after a moment he gave up and started laughing himself they reached balsers keep the next morning eight days after setting out from fox keep math and tiwaz floated in the sunpale sky the one at the third quarter the other a waning crescent not far from the suns skirts seeing the keep still undisturbed balser who was riding at the head of the army with gerin let out a sigh of relief we wont have to try to take it back from aragis the gods be praised he said i hadnt thought we would gerin said the countryside maybe but not the keep he hasnt had anywhere near the time hed need to starve it out and storming a castle is expensive even if you win if you lose trying it is likely to ruin you he looked east then west if aragis the archer hadnt come charging straight into balsers holding hed probably gone and hit the fox somewhere else along their border with the news not having reached him yet try as he would gerin couldnt make himself believe aragis really would stay quiet after giving such a blunt warning that he would go to war if gerin accepted balsers vassalage a look at balsers keep suggested why aragis might have thought it wise to launch his attack somewhere else the keep perched atop of knob of high ground that the baron had scrupulously swept clear of all undergrowth above ankle high a kitten would have had trouble approaching unseen no man could have not even afoot strong place the fox observed your strong place now lord king balser said and you didnt even have to win it at war was that bitterness it might have been in balsers shoes gerin seeing peace and tranquillity in the holding would have been wondering whether he could have gone on playing his two bigger rivals off against each other instead of finally yielding to one of them balser had alert men in his keep they were on the walls and ready long before the army came into archery range nor did they assume it was friendly for no better reason than its coming from the north with aragis for a neighbor gerin would have been alert too the men on the wall raised a cheer when they recognized their overlord they raised another cheer when he told them gerins warriors had come to protect them from anything aragis might try to do the second cheer was not so lusty as the first perhaps they hadnt looked to be quite so thoroughly protected but at balsers shouted command they lowered the drawbridge and let the foxs forces into the keep as far as gerin was concerned that finally proved balsers good faith i am your vassal lord king balser said thinking along with him what is mine is yours and you have handsomely met your obligations to me gerin had no doubt met those obligations altogether too handsomely to suit balser whose holding now lay in his hands ill send some men down toward your frontier with aragis he said most of the army will camp outside here we wont pack the keep too full and well try not to eat up everything you own this is the business of the whole kingdom now not just of the lands you rule the whole kingdoms resources will help support it thank you lord king balser bowed that you say such a thing is why i would sooner be your vassal than aragis balsers men came out to help the foxs warriors deal with their horses and chariots they exclaimed to see so many men on horseback rihwins troop galloped over the flatlands and drew more exclamations and applause at the way they handled their animals afterwards gerin and van started to head up into balsers keep the fox looked around for dagref to bring him along too he spotted his son talking with one of the improbably young implausibly fuzzy riders the one hed noticed early in the marches as being both younger and fuzzier than anyone had any real business being dagref seemed to sense gerins eye on him he made a hasty farewell and hurried up to the fox in the great hall balser served up stewed trout and apple tarts and ale flavored with honey he introduced to the fox his wife a plump young woman named brinta shell be glad of what ive learned from you too lord king he said i do hope so gerin answered resolutely keeping his face straight no balser hadnt forgotten their talk on different ways of doing things just at that moment the dogs in the great hall who had been happy enough to root around in the rushes for scraps all seemed to decide at once that soldiers legs were the longlost objects of their affection the soldiers for some reason did not share that opinion a great racket of shouts and yelps erupted what on earth brinta said with a giggle gerin looked this way and that till he spotted ferdulf the little demigod was giggling too nastily catching his eye gerin shook his head ferdulf stuck out his tongue the fox sighed ferdulf had already worked his mischief nothing to be done about it a serving maid was sitting on vans lap gerin suspected shed be sitting on the outlanders lap again or in some other posture as soon as the two of them found some privacy and another serving girl was hovering over dagref and doing it so obviously that he couldnt help but notice she was older than he but not by a great deal and looked more friendly than calculating dagref himself looked interested and surprised at himself for being interested yes your body will surprise you gerin thought watching while seeming not to watch if dagref was going to discover just what his flesh could do gerin was as well pleased that he should do it away from fox keep with a woman he probably wouldnt see again she wouldnt want so much to put on airs for being his first and hed be less inclined to imagine himself in love with her for no better reason than discovering what she hid between her legs oh by the gods gerin murmured when i make calculations like that i know ive been a ruler a long time too bloody long maybe im sorry lord king balser said i didnt quite hear that it wasnt anything really the fox answered turning toward him only the fuzz that gathers if you dont dust your brains every now and then brinta laughed a little she understood what he was saying a frown slowly spread over balsers facehe didnt and then a moment later he did and enlightenment slowly replaced confusion he had by then drunk enough ale to keep him from doing anything in a hurry thats well put lord king he said i thank you gerin answered courtesy of any sort hed found was uncommon enough to deserve encouragement well put balser repeated his breath was enough to get a man drunk reminds me of a story that the story as he told it had not much point and went on for so long gerin wished he hadnt encouraged it when at last it ended he looked around the hall again van and his new friend had disappeared gerin had expected nothing less he wondered what fand was doing back in fox keep and with whom when this campaign was over hed probably find out in alarming detail and dagref and the young serving girl were gone too gerin stared down at the table his son would be different when the sun rose tomorrow in ways he didnt yet suspect being dagref he was liable to be different in ways gerin didnt yet suspect too he still hadnt said what he wanted from gerin as a forfeit for making ferdulf keep quiet with some people the fox might have taken that to mean hed forgotten about it as far as he could tell though dagref never forgot about anything gerin realized hed been woolgathering when he looked up again and discovered balser and brinta had gone off to bed without his noticing he poured down the ale left in his drinking jack the woman who refilled it said lord king if youre weary ill take you up to your bedchamber now maybe hed been doing more than woolgathering there maybe hed been dozing he picked up the jack and said maybe thats a good idea lord balser has put you in the chamber next to his own she said up these stairs here down this hallas she spoke she guided him and its this door right here she worked the latch a lamp was already burning on a stool set by the bed she hesitated then asked lord king do you want me to go in with you what gerin said and then felt foolish the young woman had made what perfectly plain the fox smiled a lopsided smile my thanks thats kind of you but no i dont forget i have a wife when im away from home he waited to see how she would take that hed had such offers a good many times when he said no as he habitually did about half the time he ended up offending the woman whose company hed declined some people fondly imagined they were irresistible and that their beauty could move even a king had he been half his age a lot of them probably would have been right this time though the serving girl just shrugged and nodded however you like lord king sleep well then she went back toward the stairway not even waggling her rump to show him what hed be missing he went into the bedchamber took off his sandals and stripped down to his undertunic and drawers after hed used the chamber pot he lay down on the bed and blew out the lamp he didnt go to sleep right away the walls here were no thicker than those at durens keep and the noises from the chamber next door distracting by the sound of things balser was intent on trying out every variation on an ancient theme about which hed learned in fox keep and by the sound of things brinta also found the experiments interesting for a little while listening to them amused the fox after that he just wished theyd shut up so he could doze off he tried not to listen to them which was like trying not to think about the color red the more he tried the more he failed finally about the time when he should have got thoroughly annoyed he fell asleep instead his first thought on waking up to early morning sunshine was to wonder if balser and brinta would be at it again his new vassal was a young man but things next door were quiet either balser had worn himself out or hed already gone downstairs the fox splashed water from a basin onto his face got into his clothes and went downstairs himself balser was sitting in the great hall drinking ale and looking absurdly pleased with himself a couple of tables over sat van who was also drinking ale and looking absurdly pleased with himself and a couple of tables over from him sat dagref who was drinking ale and looking thoughtfulbut a long way from displeased with himself gerin started to go over to him then decided that wasnt the best idea hed ever had if dagref thought he was prying he not only wouldnt get anywhere his son would also be more inclined to hide things later so the fox remembered from his own youth anyhow he called for ale and he called for a couple of apple tarts and he made a point of not looking in dagrefs direction while he ate and drank after a little while dagref got up and came over to him good morning son the fox said concealing the pride he took in the success of his restraint good morning father dagref answered and seemed at a loss how to go on from there gerin hadnt asked if hed slept well against which he could have reactedone way or another after a moment the youth brightened could you break me off half of that tart please certainly gerin said and did he kept on eating his own breakfast when he spoke again it was of business well probably pass today here too tomorrow ill send men down along balsers border with aragis to show the archer we are here and we do intend to protect this holding that sounds good enough dagref had no trouble talking about things that would happen away from the keep its not as if weve tricked aragis in any way we let him know what we were going to do before we did it he has no proper cause for complaint i can see ha the fox said just because you cant see it doesnt mean aragis cant see it but in justice dagref began in his most didactic tones then his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth that startled his father who had seen him in a great many states but confusion seldom among them gerins gaze followed dagrefs and all grew clear coming out of the kitchen was the serving girl whod stayed close by dagref the night before exactly how close by him shed stayed gerin suspected he was about to find out the girl looked as if she hadnt had a whole lot of sleep but she was also of an age where she could get through a day without much sleep she also looked tousled and happy a look often harder to counterfeit than passion at the moment itself she came over to dagref and stood behind him of itself his hand found hers he sent gerin an alarmed look as if realizing hed given away the game he didnt realize hed given it away sometime earlier a little more slowly than he should have he also figured out he needed to say something father he announced this is rowitha hello rowitha the fox said gravely hello lord king she answered her hand tightened on dagrefs she found the moment almost as awkward as he did at last she managed your son hes very nice dagrefs face went as hot and red as the fire in the hearth i think so gerin said grave still im glad you do too id also say he nodded to dagref he thinks youre very nice yes dagref agreed with great fervor now he squeezed rowithas hand gerin hoped he wasnt going to decide he was in love with her dagref clung to his opinions as tenaciously as freshwater mussels clung to rocks that was fine when those opinions had some rational basis gerin didnt reckon bedding a woman for the first time any such rational basis convincing dagref it wasnt however was unlikely to be easy then he stopped worrying about how to deal with the beginnings of his sons love life for one of balsers men dashed into the great hall from the courtyard beyond crying lord king lord king aragis aragis the archer gerin sprang to his feet with an oath aragis has crossed over the border he demanded aye lord king balsers man replied balser and van were on their feet too and so was dagref rowitha for the moment forgotten hes here lord king what with his army gerin said by the gods is there fighting out there how did he get here with no word beforehand he looked around for his armor which hung on the wall not far from the fireplace and balsers man stunned him again saying no lord king as far as anyone on the wall can tell hes here by his lonesome down went the drawbridge as soon as it had thumped onto dry land on the other side of the moat aragis driver crossed over it and into balsers keep no hesitation gerin thought standing there in the courtyard with balser and dagref and van and some of his leading vassals but then aragis the archer seldom showed hesitation about anything which was one reason the fox wondered why they werent already at war without waiting for the chariot to stop aragis hopped out of it and strode briskly over to gerin he was a slim hawkfaced man of about the foxs age who leaned slightly forward as he walked as if he were a hunting dog following an exciting scent abruptly he stuck out a hand i greet you lord king he said as an obvious afterthought he nodded to balser baron i greet you lord king gerin said accepting the clasp aragis grip was firm and hard as it had been for as long as the fox had known him you dont mind my asking why arent we trying to kill each other right now dont worry i thought wed be doing just that by this time too aragis bared his teeth in what was as much snarl as smile i think id have won too but something more importants come up more important than which of us ends up ruling the northlands gerin said incredulously aragis head jerked up and down in a sharp emphatic nod gerin whistled softly under his breath a few times in his life hed been at the very edge of spreading news the outermost boundary between those who knew and those who didnt aragis plainly was such an outer ripple now the fox said youd better tell me then hadnt you aragis nodded again its not a question of which of us ends up ruling the northlands any more he said its a question of whether we can keep our heads on our shoulders by your five elabonian hells what are you talking about van boomed the empires come back to the northlands aragis answered for a few heartbeats that didnt mean anything to the fox save for memories of his student days down in the capital he hadnt thought much about the elabonian empire in the more than twenty years since it had closed itself off from its former northern province hed thought about it as little as he could get away with in the days before it had done so too he hadnt paid the tribute required of him because he hadnt got the protection the tribute was supposed to earn but if the empire had returned father dyaus he whispered thats the way of it all right aragis the archer agreed theyve cleared two of the passes through the high kirs and theyre sending soldiers through em i dont know what alls been happening down there these past years but it surely looks as though theyve got a lot of soldiers to send father dyaus gerin said again hed worried about aragis hed worried about adiatunnus and the trokmoi hed worried about the monsters from the caverns under bitons shrine at ikos hed worried about the gradi hed worried about ferdulf worrying about the empire of elabon long vanished from the northlands had never crossed his mind dagref spoke with his usual precision and accuracy something might perhaps be done against the empire if you two kings joined forces aragis turned his clear coldeyed gaze on dagref but spoke to his father saying no fools in your family are there fox this wouldnt be the lad who was kidnapped would it the one i got back for you from that cursed minstrel no thats duren his older half brother gerin answered this is dagref whom i present to you with the warning that youd better not ever be wrong in his presence or you will hear about it ah one of those aragis said and then paused the small grin hed put on slowly fading he gave dagref another long look mm no maybe not most of that kind think they know it all and turn out not to know a thing if this one says something hell have a good notion of what hes talking about youd have been the same way before your beard sprouted eh oh yes gerin answered putting an arm around his son who looked as if he could have done without the attention i was always sure in those days i wasnt always right mind you but i always thought i was dagref squirmed under the foxs arm let me be he said indignantly the only other way either one of you could come through this mess would be to ally with the empire against the other and how far do you suppose you could trust the imperials theyd use you and then sweep you aside both gerin and aragis stared at him then gerin was pretty sure he eventually would have reached that same conclusion himself but not with his sons effortless ease and ruthless clarity aragis made a sharp short bow to dagref he said i came here to propose alliance to your father you help me see i chose right i am in your debt dont let it worry you dagref said tranquilly my fathers in my debt too you didnt lose a bet to get there aragis turned a speculative eye on gerin dont ask me about that now the fox said more important things to think about as you say aragis the archer managed a thin smile still anyone who gets the better of you at anything needs careful watching shall we speak then of what needs doing against the empire balser debos son said use my great hall as your own lord kings of all the people in the courtyard he was the only one who sounded delighted at the news aragis had brought gerin had no trouble figuring out why it meant aragis and he wouldnt be fighting their war through balsers holding the noble might not even have to feed his new overlords large expensive army very long if the warriors headed south to fight against the elabonian empire theyd end up on aragis lands they want the land back aragis said after hed sat down and had a jack of ale pressed into his hand as far as theyre concerned it s as if theyve never been away the one who came to my keep said i could stay onas baron mind you not as kingif i paid twentyone years worth of back tribute dyaus allfather gerin exclaimed did you let him live im afraid i did the archer sounded faintly embarrassed at the admission i wasnt ready to fight in the south theni had all my strength shifted north to go to war with you he spoke as if gerin should have expected nothing else since the fox had expected nothing else he only nodded aragis went on i just sent him out of my lands naked to let the empire have a clue as to how much it could ever expect to take away from me well done van boomed adiatunnus clapped his hands gerin admired aragis gesture too but probably would have handled the imperial envoy rather differently himself before he could decide whether to say as much dagref did it for him being less abrupt with the fellow might have proved more prudent dagref was still at the age where if something seemed obviously true to him he let the world know about it without troubling his head about things like tact i thought about that later aragis said after pausing to down his ale and hold out the jack for a refill he went on at the time all i thought about was that the arrogant bastard had angered me and so i was going to anger him right back by the gods are you fighting with the imperials down on the southern border of your kingdom then gerin asked aragis shook his head theyre holding some of the territory thats rightfully mine the whoresons i dont know whether you know it or not but these days i rule almost down to the foothills of the high kirs again his smile was one that a wolf might have offered easier pushing south against the odds and sods there than coming north against you fox good gerin gave back that same display of teeth aragis concern about him was the only thing that had kept them from clashing years before so you want my help against the empire do you its your neck too aragis answered steadily if they beat me by myself do you think theyll stop at the northern border to my realm and if they look like beating me do you think i wouldnt go over to them as your boy says and save what i can by helping them smash you flat no and no respectively the fox admitted aragis gave him that fierce smile again he sighed equal allies as we were against the monsters fifteen years ago aragis nodded as if that went without saying from his perspective no doubt it did gerin might have tried extorting more from him since he was the one more threatened but didnt bother aragis had a notoriously long memory for slights thinking as much gerin realized that while he intimidated aragis aragis also intimidated him adiatunnus realized the same thing at the same time youre giving him better terms than ever you offered me the trokm said indignantly youve been my vassal the past fifteen years and of your own free will too gerin retorted of course you spent a lot of that time forgetting it of your own free will but that doesnt make it any less so adiatunnus didnt look any less aggrieved either too bad for him the fox thought aragis the archer coughed theres one thing more he said gerin didnt care for his tone of course gerin hadnt care for his tone since hed come into the courtyard or for any of the news hed delivered wondering what he was saving for last the fox asked and that is theyve got wizards with em aragis answered glumly real wizards i mean trained in that sorcerers whatchamacallit of theirs down in the city of elabon collegium gerin said and aragis nodded hed forgotten the unfamiliar term well isnt that jolly gerin went on i dont think theres a single sorcerer like that in all the northlands and theyll have more than one along sure as sure thank you my friend i didnt think i could feel any worse now i find im wrong theyll know what theyre doing tooreally know every spell hed tried he d tried knowing he was liable to make a horrid botch of it he needed a couple of heartbeats to recognize the expression on aragis face for one thing it didnt sit well there aragis had for years molded his features to project harsh certainty and very little else for another he hadnt thought the archer granted him so much respect in this particular area but aragis said another reason i want you with me fox is the skill youve shown as a mage since the days of the werenight you havent got any idea what youre talking about gerin said his voice not far from a groan aragis went on as if he hadnt spoken and when marlanz rawmeat came back from your keep he told me you had a gods son living in the village close by if we have a gods son with us even those cursed imperials will have to sit up and take notice the archer grew eager did thisfergulf was that his namecome south with you to campaign against me can we use him against the empire ferdulf gerin corrected absently yes he came along he didn t come to campaign against you so much i dont think he said he came because fox keep would be boring once the army left aragis looked blank gerin sighed looking around balsers great hall he didnt see mavrixs annoying son he turned to dagref go track down ferdulf would you please my fellow king here had better get a good idea of what hes pinning his hopes on dagref took a deep breath as if about to argue he didnt want to miss a single word of what passed between his father and aragis the archer seeing gerins face though he sensibly decided arguing here wouldnt do him any good and would land him in trouble he got up with no more than a small grimace and hurried out into the courtyard he came back soon enough ferdulf at his sideand for a wonder walking on the ground ferdulf as the fox had seen to his own discomfiture got on with dagref better than he did with almost anyone else gerin wasnt sure what that said about his sons character and wasnt sure he wanted to find out either dagref pointed aragis out to ferdulf the demigod strode up to him inspected him and shook his head this is supposed to be another king he said aragis eyes widened when he heard the deep voice coming out of the small body ferdulf sniffed doesnt seem so much of a much to me his gaze swung toward gerin of course youre not so much of a much either im so glad i have your respect gerin said aragis stared from one of them to the other gerin already knew the archer tolerated much less in the way of back talk and disrespect from subjects than he did himself and now despite having heard about ferdulf despite having heard for himself that ferdulf was not the ordinary fouryearold his body made him out to be he made the mistake of treating him as if he were you boy he said as he might have to any serf who was your father again gerin could have told the archer hed just done something foolish before he got the chance ferdulf demonstrated it as usual showing proved more effective than telling ferdulf walked over to aragis then he walked up aragis legs treating their vertical as a horizontal then he walked across aragis lap and then he walked up aragis chest treating that in the same fashion as he had the archer s legs planting his feet on aragis collarbones he looked acrosseffectively downat his startled face my father man was the god mavrix of sithonia who was yours or didnt your mother know either aragis had courage not even his worst enemy would ever have denied that so now he heard only the insult and forgot a demigod had delivered it grabbing ferdulf by the ankles he tried to throw him away that didnt work ferdulf refused to be budged snarling an oath aragis sprang to his feet and grabbed for his sword everyone who was anywhere near him snatched at his arm to keep him from drawing the bronze blade enough gerin said sharply my judgment is that dishonors are even here what gives you the right to judge aragis and ferdulf said the same thing at the same time then glared at each other for having done so aragis ive put up with you since just after the werenight and you ferdulf ive put up with you for as long as youve been aroundit only seems like forever gerin said if i havent got the right to judge who does no one again demigod and king spoke together again they glared at each other neither was fond of the fox each was fonder of him than of the other get off king aragis ferdulf dagref urged standing on him like that wont do any good it does me plenty of good ferdulf said but he took a step off aragis chest into midair then drifted to the ground like a chunk of thistledown aragis rubbed at his collarbones he must have felt the weight of the demigod on him ferdulf you havent got much use for elabonians have you gerin asked a question whose answer seemed obvious would you were you i ferdulf returned rolling his eyes oh i dont know gerin spoke musingly now after all youre half elabonian yourself all the more reason to despise that half the demigod said without it id be altogether divine without it you wouldnt be here at all gerin thought but he didnt bother mentioning that instead he said well from what king aragis here tells me the empire of elabon is coming the emperor wants to make this part of the world do as he says when hes down in the city of elabon he wants to make this part of the world obey him the same way that sithonia has to obey him even after more than four years he didnt know just how much instruction mavrix had given ferdulf about sithonia or how much knowledge of his fathers homeland ferdulf had inherited or whatever the process was by which ferdulf knew what he knew he did know ferdulf knew enormously more than any purely human fouryearold had any business knowing would that be enough he could but hope ferdulf had disappointed his hopes a good many times and blasted them a few more this time he lived up to them the elabonian empire will never do to this land what its overmuscled morons have done in and with and to fair sithonia the little demigod cried his big voice echoing back from the roof beams of the great hall it shall not come to pass i shall not permit it aragis started to say something gerin caught the archers eye and shook his head ever so slightly for a wonder aragis listened to someone other than himself he kept quiet i shall destroy the elabonians root and branch i shall smite them hip and thigh ferdulf thundered some of balsers men broke into applause aragis the archer looked as if he was about to join them gerin caught his eye once more the fox shook his head again a gesture even smaller than the first one as slightly aragis ever so erect shoulders slumped gerin was glad ferdulf wanted to take on the forces of the elabonian empire he didnt think mavrixs son would be able to beat them singlehanded elabon had ruled sithonia for hundreds of years no matter how much the sithonians looked down their noses at their overlords divided into quarreling citystates the sithonians also looked down their noses at one another their gods squabbled among themselves if all their men and all their gods hadnt been able to keep the elabonians out of sithonia one badtempered little demigod wasnt going to keep the empire out of the northlands not by himself he wasnt as long as he despised the elabonian empire more than he despised either gerin or aragis though having him along wouldnt hurt what are we waiting for ferdulf demanded the sooner we strike these bronzebound blockheads the sooner we send them scurrying back into the south when we fight let us give no quarter every once in a while when trying to work magic the fox had a spell succeed too well he hadnt worked magic here not in the strict sense of the word but got something of that feeling nonetheless what would happen if and when ferdulf discovered he couldnt beat the empire by himself would all his joy in trying disappear would he turn on gerin and aragis instead this once gerin wished he werent quite so good at coming up with unpleasant questions long before he had any answers for them aragis said are we allies against the empire then you and i and ferdulf here you and i are gerin said i already told you that having the empire on my border i like even less than having you on my border aragis showed his teeth again in that snarling smile the fox went on as for ferdulf he turned to the demigod will you join with us against the elabonian empire i am against the elabonian empire ferdulf said if you want to stand against it too you may join with me gerin remained of the opinion that one gods son no matter how arrogant was not going to prove a match for all the soldiers and if what aragis said was true all the mages of the empire of elabon but he did not feel like quibbling about definitions with ferdulf instead he held out his hand aragis clasped it a moment later the demigod set his warm little palm over both their hands gerin had made a good many unlikely alliances in his time this one struck him as being as improbable as any balser debos son looked mutinous by the gods lord king why should i furnish you with twenty chariot crews all the fighting you aim to do will be off my land thats not the point gerin might have borrowed his hard harrowing smile from aragis the archer the point is that you owned yourself my vassal true you did it because you wanted me to help protect you but that doesnt mean your obligations go away when the danger to your holding disappears i have the right to ask this of you and ask it i do its outrageous balser exclaimed why should i send my men off to fight farther south than theyd ever have any natural reason to go because if you dont theyre likelier to be fighting here sooner or later anyhow gerin answered the idea if we can bring it off is to beat the empire as far south as we can if we can do that the imperials may never get up here at all if all the fighting turned out to be in the south aragis lands would suffer far more than his own that might end up giving him a decisive edge on the archer so declared the calculating part of his mind that never slept i suppose my twenty men are going to make the difference between beating the imperials and losing to them balser said scornfully by themselves i doubt it or else were in worse trouble than i think gerin said but if you leave yours home and widin simrins son leaves his home and adiatunnus leaves his home you didnt much like the idea of adiatunnus leaving his men home when you thought aragis was going to land on you like a load of rocks did you balser had the decency to turn red all right i see what youre saying lord king bah to the five hells with me if i like it oh im just dancing with glee myself at the idea of taking on the elabonian empire dancing with bloody glee the fox did a few rather awkward steps balser stared at him kings were supposed to be serious even solemn people gerin didnt fit the bill he hadnt intended to be a king he hadnt intended to be a prince or a baron if he wasnt always what the world thought he was supposed to be that was the worlds hard luck but he wasnt always a funny man either one more thing for you to think about he told balser how many men do i have on your lands right now that got through to his new and now reluctant vassal balser looked as if hed bitten into a pear about three days after it should have been tossed into a swill bucket for the pigs lord king when i became your vassal you promised youd respect my rights he said reproachfully so i did gerin agreed and when you became my vassal you promised youd live up to your duties this is one of them i am within my rights to ask it of you you are not within your rights to refuse it to me plainly balser debos son did not agree as plainly he couldnt do anything about it very well he spat out the words one by one twenty chariots and their crews to go with you when you leave my land i do thank you for them the fox said they will help and theres one other thing you need to remember the sooner you furnish them to me the sooner we will be able to leave your land and the sooner we stop eating your storerooms empty ah balser said i was wondering if youd be able to come up with a reason for me to give you the crews and cars in a hurry you have by the gods i thought that might be so gerin said balser sighed get caught up in the quarrels of neighbors bigger than you are and you find they make you do things and then expect you to like it i dont expect you to like it gerin told him i do hope youll see the need he got a shrug from balser which was about as much as hed thought the baron would give him then he shrugged too the elabonian empire was forcing him into a position not far from the one in which hed put balser he hoped hed have better luck than balser getting out of it aragis the archer studied gerins assembled forces ill tell you this much fox he said im gladder to have you with me than i would have been fighting you youve got more men here than i thought you could raise ive never picked a quarrel with you gerin answered i wasnt picking a quarrel with you over balsers holding either however you chose to take it but i wasnt going to back away either leave that aside since im not such a fool as to call my ally a liar aragis said which let him call the fox a liar even as he said he was doing no such thing youve put a lot of men on horseback here too you always were one to try things no one would have looked for maybe gerin raised an eyebrow you came here all by your lonesome and you say i do things nobody would look for what would have kept me from dropping you off balsers wall on your head aragis shrugged i counted on your good sense biggest worry i had was that some of your troopers would do me in before i got the chance to tell you what the empire was up to but your men are well disciplined toomaybe not quite so tight as mine but well enough your idea of discipline is to make your men fear you worse than any foe the fox said well of course aragis said as if surprised gerin contemplated discipline of any other sort its worked too tell me it hasnt gerin couldnt tell him that whether it would work for aragis successor was a different question maybe aragis didnt care maybe he thought one of his sons was as fierce as hean alarming idea if ever there was one my way works too gerin said and aragis could not deny that the fox went on well seeor our sons will see or our grandsonswhose way ends up working better by way of reply aragis only grunted gerin hadnt expected much more from him other times hed talked with aragis about anything further away than the immediate future hed got only incomprehension in return within aragis range of vision he was most effective beyond it he didnt seem to see at all how determined did the imperials seem to be about taking back the northlands the fox asked aragis if we give them one set of lumps or maybe two will they go back over the high kirs and leave us alone or do you think theyll keep coming after us no matter what we do i dont know the answer to that aragis answered i do know one thing if we dont give them a set of lumps weve lost the cursed fight he paused as if waiting for gerin to disagree with him when gerin didnt say anything the archer picked up again theyre every bit as arrogant as i remember them being and thats saying a lot so it is gerin agreed down in the city of elabon theyd look down their noses at you for wearing trousers instead of robes and for coming straight out and saying what you mean instead of talking all around it from four different directions at once he looked up at the sound of hoofbeats and a good day to you rihwin what can i do for you atop his horse the noble from the city of elabon tossed his head in anger more assumed than real i heard that last remark of yours lord king and i desire you to know that it filled my heart with resentment that i reject it as a slanderous and scurrilous assault on my former homeland that it bears not even the slightest relation to truth of any sort and that furthermore your syntax in framing the said remark being both slipshod and leaden causes me to prove the point of everything i was saying gerin suggested oh i am wounded wounded rihwin cried clapping a hand over his heart gerin snorted by the expression on aragis face he wouldnt have put up with rihwins flamboyant nonsense for a moment there were times when gerin wondered why he put up with his fellow foxs nonsense himself but over years rihwin hadnarrowlyconvinced him he was worth keeping around and then his friend did his best to unconvince him rihwins face took on a look almost of transfiguration in soft reverent tones he said with the empire returned to the northlands once more surely commerce between us and the longsundered south will soon revive as soon as rihwin spoke of commerce gerin knew what he had in mind gerin would have liked to see commerce revived too commerce in books and fine cloth and other such luxuries the northlands had trouble producing for itself rihwin however would be thinking of only one such luxury you dont mean commerce what you mean is wine and wherefore i pray you should i not rihwin demanded for one thing you get into trouble when you drink wine gerin answered you get into trouble when you drink ale too but you get into worse trouble when you drink wine for another with wine comes mavrix lord of the sweet grape do you truly want more dealings with him that did give rihwin pause the first time hed ever invoked mavrix just before the werenight the sithonian god had permanently taken away his ability to work magic their meetings since had not been marked with any great warmth either mavrix disliked and distrusted not only gerin but also anyone who had anything to do with him but rihwin was made of stern stuffeither that or he had a marvelously selective memory he said it should be all right lord king and for the chance to taste wine once more what risk could be too great he struck a melodramatic pose on horseback i like wine well enough aragis said but ale suits me he stuck out his chin and folded his arms across his chest in a different sort of melodrama the pantomime of demanding obedience as gerin could have told him getting obedience out of rihwin the fox was an uphill fight loftily rihwin observed some people are of the opinion that for no better reason than somethings suiting them it should suit everyone a proposition easily demonstrated to be fallacious aragis blinked gerin watched him sort through rihwins sentence a clause at a time he watched him scowl when he got to the end of it some people aragis rumbled are of the opinion that anyone else cares about their opinions to the extent of dumping a pisspot yes some people are rihwin agreed he and aragis glared at each other gerin would have bet the two of them were likely to rub each other the wrong way when he made bets of that sort he usually proved right when he bet something would go well on the other hand he was wrong dishearteningly often that afternoon his army reached the border between balsers holding and the lands aragis the archer ruled the border guards cheered kick aragis the arrogants arse one of them shouted the rest offered even more creative advice they all cheered gerin aragis tapped his driver on the shoulder his chariot broke out of the swarm and rattled over to the border station one of the guards recognized him and went from jeering to whitefaced and shaky in the space of a heartbeat at his whispered comment the other warriors shut up one by one i thought i would give you the chance to say to my face what you say to my back aragis told them i see you have not the belly for it this surprises me not at all at his order his driver took him back up alongside gerin that took nerve the fox said in his own coldblooded way aragis had style the archer shrugged most men are dogs they yap loud enough when nothing bigger and fiercer is around when challenged though they sniff your backside and then roll over use them as men and youll find them likelier to behave as men gerin said aragis shook his head they rode on in silence after that gerin would have been happier had he been more nearly certain he was right and his royal rival wrong back next contents iv gerin had not been down in the lands over which aragis the archer ruled for more than twenty years for some time hed been busy far closer to fox keep then after his attention reached so far south the only way he could have come was at the head of an invading army here he was at the head of an army but to what would have been his astonishment up until a couple of days before he wasnt invading before the empire of elabon withdrew beyond the high kirs the lands closer to the mountains had been more nearly a true part of the empire than the raw frontier up by the river niffet some of the villages hereabouts had almost deserved to be called towns close by the elabon way especially trade had flourished it was in fact the condition to which the fox aspired to lift his own holdings and aragis who had such splendid underpinnings for his kingdom was letting them slip maybe gerin remembered these lands as having been more prosperous than they really were because hed been so much younger the last time hed been through them but he didnt think so he hadnt been so young as all that he could see signs of change too and not for the better several villages had buildings standing emptynot just houses but smithies and potters works and taverns as well some had fallen down into rubble some were being torn down to patch other buildings still in use and only weeds and bushes grew in the blank spaces between houses where others had presumably stood some fields werent being cultivated either in them scruffy wheat and barley fought what was going to be a losing fight against brambles and saplings and plain ordinary grass you dont seem to have quite so many people as you did gerin remarked to aragis sounding as casual as he could just have to make sure the ones who are left work harder to take up the slack past that aragis was indifferent gerin wanted to grab him by the front of the tunic lift him into the air and shake some sense into him what are you doing you fool he wanted to shout don t you see that if this goes on a while longer the peasants you have left wont be able to feed all your warriors then it wont matter how strong your armies are or would be because you wont be able to keep them in the field aragis wouldnt listen aragis wouldnt have the vaguest idea what he was talking about aragis would get angry knowing all that gerin walked away instead of screaming at him van followed the fox if you could have seen the look on your face there when the archer said so what the outlander began if he saw it he didnt know what it meant gerin kicked at the dirt if he had known what it meant he wouldnt have let this happen to his lands in the first place gerin kicked again i wouldnt have had to fight him in another few years all this would have fallen under its own weight maybe van said or maybe if he heard the creaking he would have fought you if he won hed have your lands to ruin over the next twenty years even if he lost he wouldnt have so many fighters to feed gerin studied him thats a coldblooded way of looking at things its more the way id look at them than how id expect you to and whos been living beside you in fox keep these twenty years and more van returned he shook his head i wouldnt have thought that way when i first came there not when i swam the niffet with the trokmoi shooting arrows at me till i got out of range id spent so many years wandering i didnt expect id ever put down roots his head went back and forth again never would have thought id stay attached to the same woman so long either you dont let that worry you not when youre off someplace where fand cant see what youre up to and so what van said if i get the itch by the gods i scratch it his chuckle was mordant and if i didnt id get no credit for holding back one campaign we fought over in the southwest years ago this was i kept my prong in my breeches the whole time and when i got back to castle fox i said as much to my lady love what happened do you remember what happened fox sorry gerin answered you and fand have had enough dustups that that one doesnt stick in my mind no eh well it does in mine she thought i was lying is what she thought that put more fire under her cookpot than she gets when i tell her about all the pretty girls i rumple so i ask you what am i supposed to do i dont know the fox said as far as he could see van and fand quarreled as much because they enjoyed quarreling as because they really had anything about which to quarrel hed suggested as much to the outlander once or twice van had agreed with him which was alarming and had done exactly nothing to change his ways which gerin found even more alarming dagref trotted by on horseback he waved to the fox and to van loping along beside the horse barely visible over the beasts back was the fuzzybearded youngster gerin had noticed once or twice before as the army moved south he didnt wave has to be from some keep out in the middle of nowhere gerin thought the kings son isnt far from his own age so he can be easy with him but with the king and his old friendno van said one of these days before long kor will be coming with us when we go to war too wont be long not the way time goes by now youre right about that gerin said hell be something to watch out for on the battlefield too that he will van said proudly my size or most of it and fands temper or worse i tell you the truth the gods had better help anybody fool enough to stand in his way by the time hes seventeen and if maeva were a lad id have two grand warriors to leave behind me when i go he scratched his chin i wonder how many brats ive got that i dont know the first thing about a few i shouldnt wonder but ive never been like rihwin ready to keep track of em all rihwins almost as good at keeping track of his bastards as carlun is at keeping track of beans gerin agreed he spotted his fellow fox not far away and raised his voice a little the only thing rihwin cant keep track of is rihwin are you speaking to me or of me or against me rihwin asked in sooth i was but enjoying a vision a memory of days long past and nights as well nights spent in the pursuit of knowledge nights spent comparing the color and bouquet of one glorious vintage against another and mornings spent wishing you were dead gerin broke in rihwin looked indignant with his flexible features every expression he assumed was in a small way a work of art gerin took no notice of him but pressed ahead all you remember about wine is the parts of the drinking of it you enjoyed the parts that werent so much fun you forget rihwin shook his head there was he insisted nothing about drinking wine that failed of enjoyment for me i was a connoisseur he struck a pose of exaggerated estheticism that would have made mavrix proud fanciest word for drunk i ever heard van said rihwin looked indignant all over again giving a rendering full of even more virtuosity than the previous one before he could protest out loud though gerin spoke up in agreement with the outlander you werent much of a connoisseur the day we met you down in that horrible dive in the city of elabon the one not far from the sorcerers collegium what you were was somebody trying to climb into a wine jar through the little hole in the neck and you didnt care a lick about the vintage you were drinking after all these years i must confess to remembering little about the occasion rihwin said with dignity yes passing out will do that to you wont it gerin replied you were as cold as a carp on a snowbank van added if you grand and magnificent gentlemen who of a certainty have been sober every moment of every day of your lives insist on reviling me and casting imputations upon my character i shall be forced to take myself off and drown my sorrowsin ale worse luck rihwin marched away nose in the air behind him gerin and van both started to laugh theres nothing we can do with him gerin said and his voice held only admiration not a single thing how about a good swift kick in the arse van suggested if all the knocks rihwins taken over the years havent let in any sense one more kick wont do the job gerin said and van laughed again nonetheless gerin kept a thoughtful eye on rihwin the fox when rihwin got particularly vehement on the subject of wine strange things had a way of happening gerin didnt want strange things to start happening life at the moment was quite complicated enough without them unfortunately he had not the slightest idea what he could to do prevent them most of aragis warriors were down in the southern part of his lands keeping an eye on the forces of the elabonian empire even so more detachments joined the army the fox was leading aragis peasants and villagers might have had their troubles but his kingdom did seem to support an astonishing number of soldiers every one of them well armed well equipped and to all appearances a rugged customer i would have put even more men into the south against the empire aragis remarked to gerin when yet another contingent of his warriors came rattling up in their chariots to join the army but i had to hold a good many back to fight you in case you decided to jump on me and then worry about the empire to the five hells with me if you dont have enough fighting men to tackle two big wars at once gerin said if your trokm neighbor had decided to forget he was your vassal you wouldnt have brought so many of your own troopers down to balser s holding aragis spoke with as much certainty as if hed announced that math moved through the sky more slowly than tiwaz since he was right gerin changed the subject whos commanding the force youve got facing the empire my eldest son aranast with marlanz rawmeat to hold him steady should he falter aragis answered aranast has never tried leading that big an army before if hes up to it well and good if hes not i dont aim to let him throw away the kingdom thats sensible gerin agreed though he wondered how happy aranast was at having marlanz looking over his shoulder then something else occurred to him the first time you sent marlanz up to treat with me you had an older man with him too to hold him to the road if he tried wandering off you have your son with you here aragis said nodding to dagref one day hell lead men on his own for now hes still learning gerin nodded but still thought the two principles not quite the same dagref plainly lacked the experience he needed to lead now in a while he would as plainly have it aragis seemed to make a habit of using a man with such experience alongside one who was just on the edge of having it the idea was a long way from the worst one gerin had ever met that evening as the steadily growing army was encamping by the side of the elabon way a chariot came pounding up the highway wheels clattering on stone paving the driver whipping on the horses to wring every last drip of speed from them the fellow in the car with him sprang down as soon as the chariot halted lord king he gasped and then paused for a moment to catch his breath he was swaying a little if hed come a long way in a chariot going hells for leather solid ground probably felt unsteady under his feet gerin came over to hear what he had to say aragis frowned at that but said nothing the messenger resumed lord king uh lord kings theres an imperial coming behind me youll meet him on the road tomorrow ive no doubt but i can tell you what hes going to say good aragis said briskly and gerin nodded say on sandifer the archer glanced at the fox and shrugged a small shrug acknowledging that this business concerned both of them sandifer said lord uh kings hes going to give you ten days to disperse your forces or else there will be war voluminous war i heard him say whatever that means it means he talks like a southerner gerin said they like to throw in a fancy word every now and then whether they use it the right way or not i heard that rihwin called if they want volumes of war aragis said ignoring rihwin as did gerin well give them enough to fill the foxs library that wasnt using voluminous the right way either but gerin was not inclined to undertake literary criticism on his fellow kings utterances if it comes to warno when it comes to war he said do you aim to go back into your keeps and make the empire dig you out one castle at a time only if i have to aragis answered at once if i were fighting the imperials alone i might do that for theyd have far more strength than i do by myself but theyd ravage the countryside so that even beating them back now might mean losing to you next year my lands shield yours here youll notice thats what you get for living south of me gerin scratched his head aragis could see that having the elabonian empire devastate his territory would weaken him to the point where hed have trouble withstanding the fox he wasnt stupid nor anything close to it but the idea that he was doing to his own lands over the course of years what the empire would do in a single campaigning season had never entered his mind it wasnt immediately apparent and so wasnt there at all for him the archer said with you beside me fox i aim to fight those imperial bastards as hard as i can and as far south as i can one thing i will say about you now that youve said you will fight alongside me i dont think youll turn on me instead of the empire there are others in the northlands to whom id not trust my back gerin bowed slightly when it came to judging how things ran in the short term aragis was as good as anyone hed ever knowas good as he was probably could he trust aragis at his back the only answer he could come up with was sometimes he said knowing which enemy to pick counts for a good deal oh indeed aragis bared his teeth in one of his alarming smiles did i not rely on you to understand the elabonian empire was more dangerous to both of us than we are to each other did i not put my life in your hands on that understanding and no more you did gerin wondered whether he would have done that in reverse if say the gradi had been on the point of beating him five years earlier maybe maybe not too because aragis lived so close to the hereandnow every crisis was liable to seem a matter of life and death to him gerin was better at waiting than his hardcharging fellow king we cast defiance in the envoys teeth then and smash the empires army on the battlefield aragis eyes had a fierce falcons glint in them too he believed every word of what he was saying maybe that would help him make his belief real maybe it would make him try to do more than he really could gerin shrugged hed find out soon when the chariot bearing the envoy of the elabonian empire and those in which his retinue rode came into view gerin feltnot for the first time since leaving fox keephed fallen back in time through close to half his life not since his last trip down to the city of elabon more than twenty years before had he seen men dressed in the flowing robes the imperials south of the high kirs affected adiatunnus saw them too and did not know what to make of them is the empire after sending women to treat with us the now he asked not quite in jest no thats just their style down there the fox answered and they shave not only their cheeks and chins the way you trokmoi do but their upper lips as well i did it myself when i lived down in the city but you had the sense to go back to a better way adiatunnus said gerin shrugged sometimes different is just different not better or worse he looked around for ferdulf when he spied the little demigod he waved for him to come over ferdulf came looking suspicious more often than not gerin was doing his best to make him go away what do you want ferdulf growled see those fellows up ahead the fox pointed thats the envoy from the elabonian empire and his friends ferdulfs lip curled in splendid scorn so what do you want me to do about it miserable imperial his voice faded down into a scatological mumble that was just what gerin wanted they probably wont like you any better he said with a grin he did not show ferdulf seemed to have forgotten he too was an elabonian theyre the ones who hold down sithonia after all i wonder what i can do to them ferdulf mused dagref looked back over his shoulder at gerin gerin wished he hadnt done it the look might have alerted ferdulf to the notion that he was being manipulated if dagref did have to give gerin a look though a look of approval was the one the fox wanted dagref as his father had learned to his own discomfiture was better than anyone else at manipulating ferdulf up came the elabonian chariots the one in the lead had a shield painted in green and white stripes mounted on the pole between the two horses a shield of truce that chariot and the one behind it pulled away from the rest and approached the army that had set out from fox keep i am efilnath the earnest the fellow in the fanciest robe called commissioner to his majesty crebbig i emperor of elabon i see here aragis the archer who presumes to make the error of styling himself king rumor has it that others in the province are equally rash be any such others present that i might treat with and dismiss all such false claimants simultaneously i am gerin the fox gerin announced king of the north i am here in alliance with aragis i note efilnath that if you call claims false and say ahead of time you will dismiss them you are not treating with those who make them only disposing of them i also note that theyand weare not to be disposed of so readily he wondered who crebbig i was on his last journey down to the city of elabon hildor iii had reigned there an indolent excuse for a monarch whatever crebbigs faultsand being a man he was bound to have themindolence did not seem to be among their number as the elabonian empire does not recognize that this land has ever been anything but an imperial province so naturally we cannot recognize any men styling themselves kings save in recognizing them as rebels and traitors efilnath said aragis the archer growled something angry under his breath gerin was about to growl something out loud when his eye chanced to fall on one of the men in the chariot behind efilnaths the fellow was nothing special to look atnot too tall not too wide not too handsomeand wore a robe that would have been altogether ordinary in the city of elabon nonetheless perhaps by the way he carried himself perhaps by a certain look in his eye gerin knew him for what he was a wizard from the sorcerers collegium and he recognized gerin toonot as an equal as one who had completed the same arduous training but as one who had some part of it those oddly compelling eyes of his widened just a little plainly he had not expected to come across anyone in the northlands who shared even a fragment of his arcane expertise gerin understood that the elabonians south of the high kirs reckoned the northlands a barbarous backwater he knew they had a point but not so much of one as they thought they did he smiled at the wizard a bleak display of acknowledgment and warning the elabonian got down from his chariot and hurried over to efilnaths he whispered in the envoys ear whatever he saidand the fox had a pretty good notion of what it would beefilnath seemed unimpressed come what may a backwoods baron remains a backwoods baron he said a distinct sniff in his voice oh ferdulf gerin called sweetly come and say hello to these nice people would you please what nice people ferdulf snarled all i see is a bunch of elabonians who think theyre smarter than they really areidiots who think theyre halfwits as if his rumbling baritone wouldnt have been enough to alert the southerners that he was something out of the ordinary he also strolled along a couple of feet off the ground efilnath gaped at him so did the wizard in a different more intensely concentrated way who are you he demanded and then a moment later what are you by way of reply ferdulf stuck out his tongue it went out improbably far the tip wiggled like a serpents tongue for a moment then he drew the whole thing back in with a wet plop he smiled unpleasantly at the elabonian sorcerer sweetly still gerin said lord efilnath lord wizard call me caffer the wizard said as the fox knew it was not his real name wizards warded those to keep enemies from working magic with them lord efilnath lord caffer then gerin resumed allow me to present you to ferdulf the son of mavrix who when he is not accompanying me dwells in the village by fox keep a son of the lord of the sweet grape here efilnath exclaimed impossible not impossible caffer said it is truth he and the elabonian envoy conferred again more urgently this time gerin hoped the idea that ferdulf was at least in some measure under his control would get through to the imperials ferdulf didnt help remarking and a bloody boring hole that village is too yield to the empires might pay the tribute long owed us and all shall be forgiven concerning these usurpations of authority you have perpetrated efilnath said with what he obviously thought was true generosity return to your own barony abandon any false claims to suzerainty over your neighbors and live under the beneficent splendor of crebbig justly styled the magnificent pay twenty years tribute gerin shook his head not likely not when the elabonian empire wasnt here for a day of that time twenty years tribute yes efilnath said plus whatever you may have owed prior to that time our records indicate that you northern barons were shockingly lax in paying your dues even before such time as we temporarily fell out of touch with you thats a nice way to put it gerin said before you forgot all about us you mean before you left us to the tender mercy of the trokmoi you mean before you werent here to help us fight the monsters or the gradi you mean and if you go away again now youll expect us to pay you again for being gone wont you ignoring the sarcasm efilnath said you did not as i have noted contribute your fair share before we temporarily fell out of touch with you with a shrug gerin answered it all depends on how you look at things i never saw any imperial soldiers on the niffet helping me hold the trokmoi at bay if the crops failed i never saw any grain hauled up from south of the high kirs to help us i dont know about you efilnath or about your emperor crebbig either but im not in the habit of paying for what i dont see crebbig is your emperor as well as mine efilnath sounded shockedartfully shockedthat gerin could imagine otherwise caffer broke in speak to me of the gradi lord baron south of the high kirs we know less of them than we would like the foxs style is lord king even as is mine aragis said best you remember it lest he take your rudeness to heart and avenge himself on you aragis was likelier than gerin to do something like that gerin started to say he wasnt offended but then checked himself why not give the imperials something else to worry about he laughed scornfully instead ill answer he said they think they can rule this province and they dont even know who lives in it they temporarily fell out of touch thats all dagref said he struck the perfect tone it wasnt even scorn it said the empires envoy and wizard didnt rate scorn only amused disdain it struck home too in a voice less suave than he had used before efilnath demanded lord baron will you then yield to the authority of the emperor crebbig and beg his forgiveness for the autonomy you have usurped in a word no gerin answered this would look to be a word you people dont know well since your comrade heard it from aragis without listening to it ferdulfs yawn was as extravagant and as anatomically unlikely as the distance to which hed stuck out his tongue go away you foolish people he said you only prove how dull elabonians can be and then without warning all the gentleness disappeared from his mockery begone get out of this land you have no right to it i a gods son so declare efilnath flinched gerin would have flinched too had an angry demigod growled at him but the empires envoy was not without spirit the gods of elabon say otherwise and i serve them and the emperor what do you suppose the gods of elabon do say father dagref whispered to gerin efilnath and his friends here are elabonian but so are we how do the gods choose one side or the other my guess is they probably dont the fox whispered back the gods of elabon from everything hed seen intervened in human affairs as little as they possibly could most of the time that suited him fine against the gradi whose own gods were as aggressive as they were hed wished the elabonian deities had done more now hed be just as well pleased to have them keep on doing nothing in particular while he and dagref talked efilnath and caffer were also holding their own lowvoiced colloquy gerin couldnt make out what the elabonian envoy was saying whatever it was caffer agreed with it he nodded several times each more vigorously than the one before quit jabbering the two of you ferdulf growled at the men from south of the high kirs i told you once get out of here now i tell you twice leave while you can still take your clothes with you which is better luck than the last imperial envoy had isnt it now efilnath nodded to caffer the wizard pointed in ferdulfs direction his lips moved so did his right hand in passes gerin knew he would never be able to match for swift fluidity as aragis had said this was a mage from the sorcerers collegium the most highly trained and skilled band of sorcerers this part of the world knew ferdulf shouted in rage try and silence me will you he roared and suddenly despite staying the same size seemed much larger and fiercer than he had a moment before he pointed two fingers at caffer a vulgar gesture straight from the alleys of the city of elabon it was a vulgar gesture with power behind it caffer staggered and had to snatch at the rail of efilnaths chariot to keep from falling he looked astonished that his sorcery had failed the one flaw gerin had sometimes noted in trained elabonian wizards was a belief that because they could do so many things they could do everything but ferdulf looked astonished too he evidently had expected to flatten the elabonian wizard enough both of you gerin said sharply we met here behind a shield of truce shall we fall to blows now and save the waiting no efilnath said caffer gave a shaky nod to show he agreed with his superior ferdulf on the other hand looked readylooked eagerto continue the battle of powers gerin glared at him he glared back his eyes blazed with more power than the fox had ever seen in them resolutely gerin kept staring to his everlasting relief ferdulf finally nodded too go back to your soldiers then gerin told the imperial envoy when we meet again we shall be at war i said this earlier to your other ambassador aragis added now my fellow king confirms it if you want this land you will have to take it from usand from the gods son here he beamed at ferdulf gerin had never seen him beam before it was when you got down to it a pretty alarming sight we have powers of our own caffer said his voice wasnt as certain and bright as a newstamped coin though after that first clash with ferdulf doubts had entered his mind doubt was the enemy of strong sorcery the thought made gerin beam too in caffers direction the mage from the city of elabon looked as if he could have done without that sunny smile efilnath the earnest tapped his driver on the shoulder the fellow steered the horses in as tight a circle as he could they went off the elabon way for part of it their hooves kicking up clumps of dirt and grass then they got back on the road and clattered off down the paving stones in precise order of precedence the rest of the chariots in efilnaths party followed caffer jumping up into his car when it came past him as that car rolled away caffer looked back over his shoulder at gerinor perhaps at ferdulf who stood nearby ferdulf snarled like one tomcat warning another to go away caffer stared steadily back at hima stare that proclaimed i will not be coweduntil the soldiers in another chariot got between him and mavrixs son it will be war aragis the archer spoke with a certain somber satisfaction if the imperials will not heed words let them heed the flight of arrows and the thunder of chariotry it will be war gerin agreed he looked around i dont think efilnath or his men were paying much attention to our riders thats to the good in my view may they prove an unpleasant surprise for the imperials so may it be aragis said though sounding more as if he hoped it would be so than as if he expected it lets follow the imperials as close as we can gerin said if theyre as proud of themselves as they always used to be theyll expect us to cower and wait for them to come to us the more we can rock them back on their heels the better off well be oh aye no doubt of that if id had only a few more men of my ownor if i hadnt worried that youd jump me instead of joining me id have done as much myself aragis said he turned his harsh gaze on the fox and now for what youd likely call an interesting question who commands interesting indeed gerin said almost as lightly as hed hoped he could well its easy enough to answer you do just like that the archer stared hed been ready for an argument but gerin said just like that for one thing this is your land you know it and i dont for another you also knowor youd better knowill take my men out of the fight if you try to harm them with your orders that should be enough to keep you honest or close to it aragis weighed the words then nodded with his usual abrupt decision very well let it be so had you insisted on taking the lead i likely would have yielded but id have given you a harder time than you sound as though youll give me that also crossed my mind gerin grinned at the other king in the northlands i didnt feel like arguing with you every time i turned around either life is too short for that youre a perfectly good general ive seen as much i doubt wed do a whole lot better with me giving orders than with you why do you make me think youve won a victory when i see you yielding aragis asked suspiciously sometimes you can do both at once gerin told him the archer shook his head like a man bedeviled by gnats he couldnt see the only victories he understood were the ones where he went out and smashed something gerin nodded to himself with luck there would be plenty of that sort there had better be he thought more and more of aragis men joined the army as it moved south in the wake of the imperial envoy and his entourage at gerins suggestionto which the archer agreed after a sour lookthe newcomers rode at the head of the army that way gerin said blandly if the imperials have spies in your land theyll have a harder time spotting all our riders if the elabonians have spies in our land ill crucify them aragis obviously meant what he said down south of the high kirs the empire crucified miscreants the headsmans axe mostly settled them in the northlands but for spies gerin would not have been surprised in the least to learn that aragis might take the trouble to run up crosses marlanz rawmeat sent a charioteer back to aragis and gerin to let them know the imperial envoy had passed his army and returned to the host the elabonian emperor had sent into the northlands and the messenger added he says the horseman you sent to warn him this efilnath was coming got there ahead of the cursed imperial even though he went crosscountry as a chariot couldnt do no man afoot could have run fast enough to outdo a car either isnt that fine gerin said isnt that splendid isnt that magnificent rihwin the fox said oh shut up aragis the archer said gerin and rihwin both laughed at him till he looked so fierce they stopped rihwin probably wouldnt have stopped even then but gerin contrived to tread on his toes he wanted aragis angry at the elabonian empire not at his own allies he might make rihwin stop laughing making rihwin shut up was another matter in his best didactic tones rihwin lectured aragis so you see lord king judicious employment of men riding horses does in good sooth have the potential to smite the foe when and where he least expects it i see a man who talks too bloody much is what i see aragis rumbled and worked a small miracle rihwin did fall silent aragis kept right on scowling not so much at rihwin as at the world around him were going to eat this country empty curse it could be worse gerin said cheerfully oh how the scowl remained now turned full force on gerin he said easy enough could be the imperials eating your countryside empty for that matter could be the imperials burning out your countryside so nobodyd be able to eat from it aragis pondered that then looked surprised well youre right it could be worse he said gruffly that doesnt make this any too good though i didnt say it did gerin resolutely kept his tone light that wasnt too hard for him his land wasnt facing invasionyet his land wasnt facing being eaten emptyhis land had already had an army feeding off it when hed thought he was going to war against aragis rather than the elabonian empire the next afternoon gerins force came up to the encampment where aragis main army kept an eye on the imperials marlanz rawmeat rode out to greet the fox well met lord king he said clasping gerins hand im happier to see you fighting with me than fighting against me if you know what i mean heh heh oh yes gerin said i never wanted to fight a war with your king either and now i wont ill fight a war with the elabonian empire instead and i would have wanted that even less had it occurred to me not to want it marlanz said lord king i present to you aranast aragis son lord king aranast said politely bowing he looked like aragis right down to the cast of features that warned nobody had better disagree with him for any reason whatever gerin didnt think he had the force of character that would let him back up that cast of features but he wasnt very old yet either he couldnt have had more than a couple of years on duren thinking of duren made the fox wish hed accepted more support from his own eldest son he hadnt thought hed need it against aragis the archer the elabonian empire had rather greater resources than his rival king he didnt know what part of those resources the empire had committed or would commit to reconquering the northlands but hed find out soon enough aranast said weve all heard a great deal about you lord king thats nice gerin said blandly playing the simpleton to see how aragis son would respond aranast drew back half a pace struggling to reconcile the ruler whod held his father at bay for two decades with this fellow who sounded as if he had not a brain in his head after a moment he smiled a smile that matched any of aragis for icy precision much of what weve heard is how selfeffacing you are i see thats so all right then he wasnt a fool that disappointed the fox with a smile of his own gerin said if i wanted to stay in hiding i wouldnt have come south were glad you did whatever your reasons were marlanz said hastily the empire wont be so glad he paused is that ferdulf with you as he had up at fox keep he spoke of the demigod as if ferdulf were some kind of wild animal oh yes hes here gerin answered good marlanz said with heartfelt reliefone of the rare times ferdulf had ever inspired that emotion or indeed any emotion save inchoate or sometimes not so inchoate fury in anyone as if to prove he was there ferdulf strolled over rose into the air till he could look marlanz in the face and said i remember you youre the man whos made out of raw meat most men are marlanz replied with what gerin thought of as commendable calm he stared back at ferdulf i expect you are too well yes the little demigod admitted but not raw meat of such a gross and repellent sort as yours or the foxs here of that i m comfortably certain no doubt youre right gerin said in a voice of elaborate unconcern when you go in the bushes its daisies and violets that come out not the stuff that makes them grow ferdulf gave him a look full of such concentrated loathing he had to brace himself to stand against it the demigod stalked off through the air he does dislike the empire more than he dislikes us doesnt he marlanz asked anxiously i had hoped he would ever since i learned the imperials were coming over the mountains he did anyhow gerin said which made marlanz look more anxious still and aranast downright alarmed the fox laughed it will be all right he and i have been carving chunks off each other for as long as hes been around hes used to it hell get over it but he despises the elabonian empire with a fine bright loathing that should be good for a long time to come do you plan to move straight against the empire lord king marlanz asked the fox gerin pointed to aragis youd better put that to your own overlord marlanz he replied hes in overall command here aranast looked as if hed already assumed that marlanz looked surprised then tried to look as if he hadnt it didnt work aranast had noticed marlanz would probably be unhappy after aragis found a chance to speak with him in private had the archer been operating against gerin he would have been delighted since they were on the same side he wasnt aragis said they are here they have no business being here my fellow king agrees they have no business being here he turned his fierce gaze on gerin as if daring him to disagree he couldnt disagree aragis came to a conclusion as obvious to him as a sithonian geometer found the proof of two triangles congruence and so we attack a mounted scout came galloping back to the army of the northlands lord kings he shouted to gerin and aragis who rode at the head of their conjoined forces the imperials arent far southjust back of the next rise south from the one i rode over here theyre in column but they arent asleeplook like they can deploy in a hurry whenever they take a mind to well hit them anyhow aragis said at his order his driver reined in gerin had dagref pull to a stop beside his fellow king aragis waved to gain the attention of the troopers behind him left and right he shouted form line of battle left and right cheers rose from his men and gerins both they were going to get the fighting so many of them craved the fox hadnt understood anyone s being eager for battle not since his first one but a lot of people were the warriors peeled off across the fields to either side of the elabon way to make a ragged line that would only get more ragged as they advanced against the empire what about the horsemen gerin asked when aragis didnt give them any special orders the archer frowned thats right he saidsure enough hed forgotten about them after a moments thought he issued the command let them go off around to the right maybe they can take the imperials in the flank since they wont be looking for anything like that he spoke as if he didnt expect that to happen as if he was sending rihwins riders out of the way so he could get on with the main battle gerin didnt try to change his mind no matter why hed issued the order it made good sense gerin waved for rihwin drew his attention and relayed it aye lord king we shall essay it rihwin replied he glanced over to aragis the archer with an expression that said he too knew aragis didnt expect much perhaps we shall disabuse doubters of their dubiety talk fancy like that when you get near the imperials aragis said maybe theyll think youre one of them long enough to help you hurt em i shall lord king and i thank you for the suggestion rihwin said he surveyed aragis with respect no less real for being grudging but the archer hadnt finished if you dont fool them maybe you can bore them to death thank you again lord king so much rihwin said tightly he rode off to rally his men and take them in the direction aragis had commanded gerin wondered whether aragis had insulted him for the sake of being insulting or to inspire him to fight harder gerin also wondered whether aragis bothered drawing such distinctions wheres that ferdulf aragis demanded looking around i want him front and center against the empire front and center ferdulf came he and aragis made allies more unlikely than gerin and aragis back over the mountains with them ferdulf shouted and rose above the front rank like a living battle standard the troopersespecially aragis men who knew him only as a demigod and not as an obnoxious bratraised a cheer forward aragis shouted with another cheer with a rumble of wheels and squeaks from ungreased axles the chariots rolled ahead in the car with gerin and dagref van said ah well another brawl he hefted his spear now to make the other fellows sorry their mothers ever bore em aragis shouted again our cry is the northlands a third cheer rang out from his men and the foxs louder than either of the other two gerin set a hand on dagrefs shoulder drive as i command you or as seems best to you if im too busy fighting to give you any orders the gods keep you safe and you father and all of us dagref answered then he frowned his back was to gerin but the fox recognized the expression by the way his sons shoulders hunched forward a little after his usual pause for thought dagref went on but of course the gods wont keep all of us safe why make the prayer then if dagref was worrying over philosophical questions he wasnt likely to panic when the fighting started gerin had never gone into battle with that sort of preparation he didnt think duren had either but if philosophy helped keep his eldest by selatre on a steady course the fox would not complain over the first low rise rolled the army the chariots were just coming down the far slope when over the crest of the second rise the scout had mentioned came the lead chariots of the force the elabonian empire had sent out to reclaim the northern province it had abandoned a generation before at the sight of their foes gerins men and aragis raised a great shout derision and hatred all commingled hold the line steady aragis yelled by father dyaus ill cut the balls off the first chariot crew i see charging ahead all on their lonesome hold steady and the line did hold steady in the short run fear worked well enough to keep men obedient more and more imperial chariots came up over the crest of the second rise they were deploying as they advanced their line got wider as the fox watched he wished his men and aragis had been closer to them to hit them before they shook themselves out into line wishing got him what wishing usually got dagref said all their chariots look just alike isnt that peculiar not when you think about it gerin answered down in the city of elabon the empire has an armory where smiths and carpenters and such make weapons for the whole imperial army they have a pattern for spears and a pattern for helmets and a pattern for chariots too its not the way it is here where each keep will have its own carpenter or wheelwright with his own notions about how to do things then these cars will likely be better than some of ours but worse than others dagref said if they keep on making them to the same pattern long enough while we test worse against better sooner or later all of ours will be better than theirs or else well try something different altogether gerin looked west to see if he could spot rihwins troop of horsemen he was on the whole glad to discover he couldnt trees screened them from what would momentarily become the battlefield if they got round that screen they were liable to give the imperials a nasty surprise elabon elabon elabon the foe was shouting too in rhythmic unison very different from the great incoherent roar that came from the men of the northlands the imperials were much more uniform in appearance than gerin and aragis troopers each of whom equipped himself as he could afford and as he thought best the men from south of the high kirs put the fox in mind of the warriors ros the fierce had used to conquer this province in the first place a couple of hundred years before that comparison worried him ros warriors by all accounts had been as tough as any ever made thisll be the biggest chariot fight ive ever seen van said as more and more imperials came over the rise biggest chariot fight this part of the world has ever seen gerin answered unless there were bigger ones when we elabonians conquered it in the first place no sooner were the words we elabonians out of his mouth than he found them odd he thought of himself as an elabonian he spoke the elabonian language he worshiped elabonian gods he revered elabonian civilization not least the parts borrowed or stolen from sithonia and now he was going to do his best to defeat the soldiers of the elabonian empire of course theyd kill him if he didnt that was a powerful argument in favor of fighting ferdulf floated high overhead screaming abuse at the imperial army gerin didnt know what the little demigod could do beyond screaming abuse even that would help with his being so obviously supernatural maybe ferdulf didnt know himself whether he could do anything maybe he wouldnt know till he tried it and it either worked or it didnt to dagref gerin said if you see the empires wizards steer toward their cars if we can get rid of them we help our own cause more than we do by putting paid to ordinary troopers dagref nodded gerin reached over his shoulder pulled an arrow from his quiver and set it to his bowstring the two armies were closing fast already the first few arrows had begun to fly they fell far short of their targets there were always soldiers who couldnt wait till they had some reasonable chance of hitting something before they started to shoot closer and closer came the enemy cars gerins own mouth felt dry his heart pounded he understood why the overeager troopers had begun to shoot too soon it made them feel the battle had started and the waiting was over beside the fox in the jouncing car van was muttering come on come on come on gerin didnt think he knew he was doing it he wanted to get into the fight too but carried no bow straight ahead was an imperial with a gilded corselet and helmet that made him an officer of some sort and also a good target gerin set himself drew the bow to his ear in one smooth motion and let fly the bowstring lashed the leather brace on his wrist he grabbed another arrow nocked it and let fly again the officer in the gilded armor did not fall shooting from a chariot took a lot of luck even for the best of warriors of course with enough shafts in the air some of them were bound to be lucky here and there screams rose from both lines men crumpled and fell out of their cars as those bounded over the fields horses crashed down too sending chariots slewing sideways and once or twice crashing into one another and bringing more men to ruin buzzing like an angry bumblebee an arrow flew past the foxs ear he shook his head as if at a veritable insect indeed with enough shafts in the air some were bound to be luckyand unlucky for him an old pale scar puckered his left shoulder he knew what wounds were like here we go van said aragis wasnt being subtle about what he did he was throwing his army straight at the imperial forces maybe he thought they would break and fleethey were effete southerners after all the commander the elabonian emperor had sent over the mountains was taking the same approach to the warriors from the northlands maybe he thought they would break and fleethey were halfbarbarous rebels after all neither side broke neither side fled neither side did much in the way of maneuvering gerin aimed for the driver of the chariot that was thundering toward him his arrow caught the luckless elabonian right in the neck the fellow dropped the reins and clutched at himself as he fell out of the chariot a wheel thumped over him he lay very still one of the bowmen in that imperial chariot snatched for the reins he missed they dragged along the ground the horses no longer under anyones control slowed from gallop to walk dagref steered past them so close that van was able to use his heavy spear he let out a great shout of fierce glee as he watched the imperial soldier crumple some of the chariots of the opposing sides shot past one another others pulled up to avoid collisions the fight turned into a melee what had been neat lines turned into a confused jumble of chariots and horses some men kept on shooting arrows at their foes others at closer quarters drew swords and axes and slashed away at one another pull back in the emperors name an imperial officer shouted to his men well form line again and smash through these savages but the troopers of the elabonian empire could not pull back and reform they were locked together with the warriors from the northlands as tightly as if held in a lovers embrace smash em aragis yelled smash em to pieces gerin wondered how hed grown so strong with no better notion of strategy than that maybe ferocity had had more to do with it than strategy any of aragis men who gave ground would have to face him afterwards that meant giving ground was anything but a sure way to escape from danger an imperial chariot pulled close to the one dagref was driving one of the warriors in it turned and cut at gerin with his sword the fox leaned away from the blade which flew past him he snatched an axe out of a bracket set into the side of his chariot and smashed it into the troopers ribs it bit through the scales of his corselet blood gushed from the wound with a bubbling shriek and an outraged expression the soldier toppled van boomed laughter you do that once every fight captain seems like he said they never expect you to be lefthanded and thats a mistake they never get to make twice gerin started to answer but shouted watch yourself instead an imperial trooper with an axe ran toward the chariot from the side many horses on both sides were down many drivers had been hit many chariots had overturned some men kept fighting on foot van jumped down from the car and with a roar that might have sprung from a longtooths throat rushed at the soldier of the elabonian empire the soldier was close to a foot shorter than the enormous outlander whose helm and the nodding horsehair crest above it made him seem taller still when van thrust with his spear the imperial did not wait to try conclusions with him but spun on his heel and ran away to find a foe for whom he was more nearly a match shouting laughter van sprang back into the chariot dagref managed to get out of the press and send the car at gerin s direction toward several imperial chariots whose crews were pressing hard against some of aragis men and some of his own a couple of the empires chariots also pulled loose and quickly moved to block his path suddenly ferdulf flew down from the sky and screeched in the faces of the imperials horses one team ran wild thundering out of the fight the other team didnt run at all the horses reared and screamed in terror the elabonian warriors clung to the rails of their car that was all they could do to keep from being spilled out onto the ground that also made them easy meat for gerin and van the fox shot one at close range van speared another the third did dive out of the chariot then and so preserved himself well done gerin shouted to ferdulf keep it upyoull drive them crazy floating in midair ferdulf grinned at the fox who with the elabonian empire as the new standard of comparison looked better to the obnoxious little demigod than he ever had before ive found something else new to do to them too ferdulf said he drifted up above the fight tugged his tunic up over his belly and it wasnt really something new it was the disgusting game hed been playing at fox keep when marlanz rawmeat came to visit then it had been nothing but disgusting now if a soldier of the elabonian empire unexpectedly got pissed on from out of the sky he was liable to be distracted for a few crucial moments during which he could neither attack nor defend himself very well several soldiers paid with their lives for such distraction ferdulf seemed to have an unlimited supply of his nasty weapon gerin had never thought that one of a demigods attributes might be the ability to piss endlessly without having to load up on water or ale that was not the sort of ability on which the sithonian mythologizers and their elabonian imitators dwelt they had their minds on higher things ferdulf didnt another attribute of his one the mythologizers might actually have mentioned in writing was his uncanny ability to avoid arrows he got plenty of chances to use that ability too plenty of outraged imperials sent shafts his way and he was not floating so high as to be anything but an easy target nevertheless every arrow missed gerin couldnt tell whether the arrows went wide or ferdulf dodged however that worked none struck home he took unpleasant revenge on the men who shot at him too and then with a squawk of surprise and indignation he tumbled out of the sky not far from the fox oh a pestilence gerin exclaimed caffer or one of their other cursed wizards found a spell that would bite on him after all dagref aye father dagref said and then looked back over his shoulder at gerin are you really sure you want to rescue him dont tempt me lad gerin said he would have liked it better had the words come out of his mouth sounding more like a joke but while he wouldnt have cared to explain himself to either ferdulf or mavrix the idea of leaving the sithonian gods irksome little bastard to his fate held an appalling appeal even though ferdulf wasnt flying arrows still wouldnt strike him they dug into the ground all around his little feet but none pierced his flesh finish him an imperial shoutedsure enough there was caffer looking indecently pleased with himself steer toward the sorcerer gerin shouted and shot an arrow at caffer the wizard deflected it with an absentminded pass he could not do so without effort though as ferdulf could and while he was momentarily distracted the demigod floated off the ground as soon as the arrow had gone by the mage from the city of elabon renewed his spell and ferdulf shouting in fury found his feet on the ground again gerin shot at caffer once more once more the wizard made him miss an imperial warrior jumped out of a chariot and ran toward ferdulf who after another leap into the air while caffer was otherwise engaged had again returned to earth cursing van sprang down and dashed to the demigods aid unlike the other trooper this one stood and fought the fox had scant time to watch that fight dagref by then had driven quite close to caffers car close enough for him to snap his whip at the wizard the whip wasnt so easy to deflect as gerins arrows had been caffer did manage to evade it then howled a spell the lash changed to a serpent in dagrefs hands the serpent hissed twisted and tried to bite that however did not work so well as caffer had hoped like a lot of boys his age dagref was fond of snakes this one was bigger than any gerin had seen around fox keep but that did not seem to faze his son dagref grabbed it behind the head he had to use both hands to control its writhing length gerin snatched up the reins to keep the horses from running wild thank you father dagref said then he shouted to caffer you made itnow see how you like it he threw the snake into the wizards car caffer had had a spell handy for turning whip to snake he did not seem to have one for turning a snake back into a whip he and his driver and the warrior in the chariot with them all shouted and stomped and slashed at the serpent which like every other serpent proved extremely reluctant to expire dagref took the reins back from gerin as calmly as if nothing had happened the fox shot a third arrow at caffer the wizard knew nothing of this one till it rammed its way between two ribs and pierced him almost to its fletching he straightened up and screamed a long wail of agony and surprise mixed since men like snakes could prove reluctant to die gerin shot him again this time in the face he spilled out of the chariot like a sack of peas with a shout of joy ferdulf floated above the field once more gerin looked around to see if van needed help against his foe the imperial warrior lay on the ground thrashing toward death vans spear dripped blood fool was brave the outlander said as he got back into the chariot but that doesnt make him any less a fool father im sorry but i havent got a whip any more dagref said considering what you did with it i think ill forgive you the fox answered his voice dry that was quick thinking dagrefs shoulders went up and down in a shrug i didnt see anything better i could do with the thing van looked around the field then nudged gerin fox are we winning this confounded fight or losing it gerin looked too to the five hells with me if i know he said they arent running and we arent running and were all mashed together with a certain sardonic pride he added the fights i make are neater than this anyhow aragis has no sense of tidiness you can tell him that when everything here is done van said with a grin wait till im around though if youd be so kind i want to hear what he says to you afterwards dagref managed to keep the chariot moving as he wanted even without a whip to speed the horses along what to do on the battlefield did not come naturally to him as it did say to van and to duren too but he thought well and did not let himself get rattled all that counted too and he managed to keep everything that was and should be going on straight in his mind which a good many men who reckoned themselves great captains had trouble doing he said shouldnt rihwin and his horsemen ride in from the flank sometime soon father dyaus gerin exclaimed his head whipped around toward the west id forgotten all about them where are they anyhow van looked west too probably in amongst the trees he said trying to figure out which side is which like you said fox this is about as untidy a brawl as ive ever seen well one way for them to neaten things up would be to attack right about now gerin said our men know who they are and the imperials dont except to figure out that they arent friends and he shut up neither dagref nor van was paying attention to him they were both staring west gerin took another look in that direction too his sour expression disappeared to be replaced by an enormous grin sounding more serious than he often did van said you ever by any chance think of going into the prophet business i leave that to my wife and farseeing biton thanks gerin answered regardless of whether or not hed foretold their arrival rihwins riders approached the battlefield at something close to a gallop gerins men and aragis cheered the imperials either cursed or laughed more slowly than he should have the officer who led the elabonian empires army figured out that the horsemen however peculiar they looked to him might represent a real threat he detached a squadron of chariots from his main forceno easy task considering how heavily engaged against the men of the northlands his army wasand sent them against the new foes on horseback when other imperials werent trying to kill him gerin watched with great interest the clash of the old way and the new to his vast astonishment it went exactly as rihwin the fox had predicted it would hed known rihwin more than twenty years in all that time he couldnt recall thinking such a thing before what he thought now was that rihwin had picked a splendid time to be right the chariots thundered across the fields toward the horsemen bumping and jouncing as they always did the warriors in the bumping jouncing cars shot arrows at rihwins men rihwins men shot back not only that they rode around the chariots as if the latter were nailed to the ground they shot back at the imperials from all directions at once anyone who tried to lift a shield against a shaft coming from the right was apt as not to be pierced by one coming from the left or the rear dagref said were watching the end of a whole way of fighting i didnt think it would happen quite so easily neither did i gerin said neither did anybody van said but happen it did before long the chariots the imperial commander had sent out against the horsemen were swept off the field as if by a broom rihwins riders began showering the men in the main imperial force with arrows some rode close to use sword and spear against their foes where the men of the elabonian empire had fought gerin and aragis chariots to a standstill the shock of the new alarmed them far more than its actual effect on the battlefield and the number of horsemen would have warranted at first by ones and twos and then in larger numbers they broke off the fight and withdrew to the south they werent routed they fought back fiercely when the men of the northlands pursued but they werent going to fight on that field any more either rihwin rode up to gerin his sword had blood on it so did his face an arrow had nicked one cheek but his face also bore an enormous grin gerin didnt blame himhed earned the right to grin how about that lord king rihwin said how about that well how about it gerin asked deadpan rihwin stared then started to laugh so did gerin why not theyd won back next contents v its a battle gerin said for the eighteenthor was it the twentythirdtime that afternoon its not the war this particular time he happened to be talking with adiatunnus the trokm chieftain gave him an impatient look as if he were quibbling over trifles theyre licked the now and well see them no more is it not so no curse it its not so the fox said wearily or rather it s so that we beat them but theres no way of knowing whether that means theyve had enough or whether well be in another battle day after tomorrow adiatunnus said youre after telling me then that the elabonians from over the mountains are even more stubborn nor the lot of you kerns we trokmoi have been coping with all along as stubborn as we are anyhow were a branch off that trunk gerin said the other part of the bargain is theyre drawing on the resources of a land bigger than this province and all of it under the rule of one man its not split into fragments the way the northlands are if the emperor orders this army to keep fighting it will if he orders another army up over the high kirs well have to fight that one too maybe this whole business of civilization isna the fun i thought it was adiatunnus walked off shaking his head gerin went back to what he had been doing helping to care for the injured study and more practice than he wished hed got had left him as good a battlefield surgeon as anyone else in the northlands he dug out arrowheads stitched up slashes helped set a couple of broken bones and urged anyone with any sort of wound to wash it out with ale it helps clean he said and a clean wound is less likely to go bad than a dirty one wine would be better said an imperial trooper who had been pitched out of his chariot and captured while he was stunned so it would if we had any the fox agreed spotting ferdulf strolling along not far away he waved and called the demigods name rather to his surprise ferdulf came to him what do you want mavrixs son asked sounding less hostile than gerin was used to maybe ferdulf had figured out that he ought to be grateful and maybe the fox would flap his arms and fly to fomor hed borrowed the image from the trokm tongue fomor was the name the woodsrunners gave the moon elabonians called tiwaz hoping to take advantage of what passed for good nature with ferdulf gerin said do you have any healing powers by any chance mavrix had great power over flesh but gerin thought it wiser not to mention that lest ferdulf grow angry at being reminded however indirectly that he was only half a god the question seemed to take ferdulf by surprise i dont know he answered i dont think i ever tried why should i try anyhow even if i can all id be doing would be healing elabonians and i dont like elabonians youd be healing warriors who could fight against the elabonian empire again gerin pointed out there is that ferdulf admitted grudgingly his small shoulder shrugged oh all right ill see what i can do i dont know if i can do anything you know sometimes when i try to do something i find i can sometimes i cant that makes me angry be angry at the empire for causing these wounds in the first place gerin suggested dont be angry at our men who are hurt its not their fault no ferdulf said if they were better soldiers maybe they wouldnt have got hurt to begin with but having said that he went over to a man who was cursing as blood from a wounded arm slowly soaked the bandage wrapped around the injury whats he going to do the soldier looked at ferdulf as dubiously as the demigod was looking at him ferdulf reached out and touched the bandage the warrior exclaimed in delight ferdulf exclaimed too and jerked his hand away he grabbed at his own arm in the spot where the warrior had been wounded his lower lip stuck out in petulant dismay it hurts it hurts as if the arrow had gone into me but it took my pain away the warrior said while you were holding me it didnt hurt any more and i thought i felt it getting better if you know what i mean but when you took your hand off the wound it hurt again and i stopped hurting ferdulf said as if that were much more important to him no doubt it was gerin said could you try a little more even so this would be a great help in the war against the empire if you could do it it hurts ferdulf repeated gerin though had chosen the right hook with which to catch his fish ferdulf might have been reluctant but he set his hand on the warriors wound once more the fellow let out a great luxuriant sigh as his pain vanished again ferdulf grimaced and whimpered but did not let go then the soldier said dyaus allfather will you look at that with his good arm he pointed to the demigod gerin stared forming on ferdulfs little arm even as he watched was what looked as if it would be a wound of the same sort as the trooper had suffered gently the fox said ferdulf you dont have to go on any more in fact it might be better if you didnt when ferdulf looked down at himself he gasped and jerked his hand away from the wounded man along with gerin and the warrior he stared at his arm slowly what would have become a wound faded from his flesh you made mine better little fellow and i thank you for it the soldier said it doesnt hurt near so much now but i wouldnt have wanted you to go on any more not when you were going to start bleeding yourself any minute there too high a price to pay gerin said regretfully he clapped ferdulf on the back as if the little demigod were a man you did what you could and i thank you for trying if i were all god i could have done it ferdulf scowled no that thought was never far from his mind i feel the power in me but i cant keep it from doing what it does to me my body wont bear what it should the fox suspected that problem would plague him all his life which was liable to be a very long life indeed being only a man gerin had only human abilities which did not overtax his merely human frame ferdulfs abilities outstripped the body containing them as if a squirrel say were to be suddenly endowed with human intellect while gerin was pondering that aragis the archer came up to him he looked as happy as he ever did which wasnt very your men fought well fox he said nodding to gerin better than i thought they would and ive never thought they couldnt i understand that or youd have attacked me gerin said to which the archer unabashed nodded again gerin went on nothing wrong with the way your soldiers did their job either but ive always known any men you led would fight hard if they didnt youd have attacked me aragis said that was what he would have done and he judged others by his own standards after a few heartbeats he added you got more out of those riders than i thought you would too always up for something new what came next was half bark half chuckle keeps your neighbors on their toes gerin raised an eyebrow and grinned a lopsided grin thats the idea oh i know i understand as much aragis said even so i never thought youd put a woman on horseback he turned that coughing chuckle loose again women are for being ridden not for riding what in the five hells are you talking about now gerin demanded i havent got any women and aragis threw back his head and guffawed gerin was as astonished as if the high kirs had suddenly stood up on little spindly legs to dance a sprightly trokm dance by the gods theres something you didnt know the archer said haw haw haw who would have guessed it the fox with something going on right under his nose and he had never a clue haw haw he wiped his streaming eyes the last time something had gone on under gerins nose without his noticing elise had run off with the horseleech after close to half a lifetime that memory remained bitter as horseradish holding his voice under tight control he said youd better tell me just what you mean i mean what i say aragis face bore an utterly uncharacteristic grin i generally do which is more than some people i might mention can claim and what i say is thisif one of your riders tries to piss standing up itll run down her leg and if you didnt notice you ought to take your eyes to a smith and get em sharpened youre not joking gerin said slowly that was foolish and he knew it as far as he could tell aragis never joked the fox pointed toward the riders who as they usually did stayed a little apart from the rest of the warriors show me this woman you say is there father dyaus if you dont know a woman when you see one aragis didnt merely guffaw he giggled gerin wondered if a demon had taken possession of him it would have to be a very silly demon to get a giggle past aragis lips the archer took him by the arm all right come on then if you need showing ill show you while im about it shall i tell you how to make children too i have the hang of that thanks gerin said through clenched teeth now do as you said you would come on then aragis was still chuckling as he headed for rihwins riders gerin following fumed the archers head went this way and that gerin was about to start jeering when aragis arm shot out there by the gods talking to your own son she is did he bring her along to keep himself amused on campaign thats not a the words clogged in gerins throat the rider standing there talking with rihwin was the very younglooking fellow with the very fuzzy beard hed noticed a couple of times on the way south from fox keep hed thought that an improbable beard for such a young man to have now that he took a closer look he saw it was improbable because it wasnt real recognizing that it wasnt real he took a closer look at the face under it maeva he exclaimed vans daughter whipped her head around dagref spun toward his father and aragis then resigned turned back to face maeva gerin caught a few words of what he was saying bound to happen sooner or later well fox aragis said chuckling still is that a woman or have you forgotten what they look like that is a woman gerin agreed seriously that is a woman who now that youve found her out is liable to kill you for doing it aragis started to laugh some more then looked at him the archer looked at maeva too she stood a couple of digits taller than he did and was wider through the shoulders too and as gerin had recognized her face aragis recognized her name considering who her father is youre likely the one who isnt joking now he said not even a little bit the fox answered i tell you my fellow king i shouldnt want her angry at me he raised his voice maeva come here if youd be so kind dagref youd better come too you seem to have known what was going on yes i knew father dagref said with impressive artificial calm what of it you never forbade maeva to come on campaign with us and i never thought id have to forbid her to come on campaign with us gerin said because i never thought shed do it dagref talked right through him and she killed at least one imperial and wounded three more if that doesnt show she can hold her own on the field what does she have to do to prove it gerin started to answer that then stopped when he realized he had no good answer handy he turned to maeva what will your father say when he finds out youve come to war she shrugged which only made her shoulders seem wider hell probably shout and scream at me she answered but what can he say now im here and ive already fought he would have done the same thing he did do the same thing back when he was my age younger gerin said absently but he was a man youre here and alive and with a dead foeman dagref put in that is what you were going to say isnt it father aragis snorted gerin gave him a dirty look and dagref another then the fox spotted a tall nodding horsehair crest of crimson he waved in that direction van waved back gerin waved again this time to bring his friend over im not going to say anything right now he said as van ambled toward him ill leave that to maevas father maeva herself gave him a look he would sooner not have had but she stood straight and waited for van to arrive he towered over her but he towered over almost everyone hello fox he boomed what do you need me for now i was just about to he followed gerins glance toward maeva for a moment the fox didnt think hed recognize her under the false whiskers shed stuck to her face gerin was ready to twit van for that before remembering he hadnt penetrated maevas disguise either and then van did his grayblue eyes got very wide he started to say something but all that came out of his mouth was a wordless coughing croak of astonishment hello father maeva said by then she had her voice under control it was a strong contralto that could easily have been mistaken for the treble of a youth whose voice hadnt brokenalthough such a youth probably wouldnt have sprouted so thick a beard still gerin wasnt altogether astonished shed managed to pull off the imposture most people saw what they expected to see heard what they expected to hear maeva was as big as a man she was in a place where only men were expected to be she handled her weapons like a man so what else but a man was she likely to be an illustration of the difference between whats likely and what is the fox thought van finally found words what are you doing here they werent the best words perhaps but gerin would have been hard pressed to come up with better on the spur of the moment maeva had had the chance to compose herself why spinning thread and baking bread of course she answered with irony she must have learned from dagref van stared and spluttered dagref sounding helpful when in fact he was anything but said shes one of rihwins riders she killed an imperial and wounded a couple of more what will your mother say van demanded of his daughter that made gerin stare he couldnt ever remember hearing van use fands name in such a fashion before evidently maeva couldnt either with a shrug she replied when you go on campaign you dont pay attention to what mother says why do you think im going to listening with an analytical ear gerin admired that it assumed maeva had as much business going on campaign as anyone else the fox waited to see if van would accept or even notice that unspoken assumption the outlander shook his head like a bear bedeviled by bees its not the same not the same at all he said fine woman that your mother is theres only so long i can stand being in the same place with her do you think its any different for me maeva asked van coughed then turned red beneath his bronzed hide well aye its some different he answered and let it go at that rather than explaining how it was different that would have involved explaining how adultery ranked alongside fighting as his favorite campaign sports he coughed again then said now that i know youre here i ll say youve had your fun and now youre to go back to fox keep where you belong maeva set her chin no she said a reply remarkable for simplicity and succinctness somehow the shade of red van turned was different this time i am your father ill have you know and what i tell you that you shall do no maeva said again did you pay any attention to what your father told you once youd killed your first man he was dead by then van said an answer that was not really an answer he turned to gerin youre the king fox if you tell her to go home and keep herself safe shell have to do it gerin suffered his own coughing fit then in all the years hed known van the outlander had never appealed to his authority till now thoughtfully he said i dont know isnt a lone girl on the road liable to face more danger than one in the middle of our own army she can take care of van began and then a couple of words too late stopped in his tracks dagref as was his way drove home the logical flaw with a mallet if she can take care of herself what point to sending her home maeva sent him a grateful look the one van sent him was anything but gerin said i dont think youre going to win this one old friend if she were a boy you wouldnt be trying but shes no boy which is the point to the business van said stubbornly i know soldiers and wait the fox held up a hand i know maeva too dont you think anyone who tried to touch her if she didnt care to be touched would end up a eunuch like the priests of biton and that bloody quick van kept frowning not right he said again not even close to right after a moment gerin figured out what was likely troubling him no doubt maeva could protect herself if she didnt want to be touched what if she did want to be touched though that had to be in vans mind aragis said youre not going to send her home he sounded as if this was the first time hed imagined that possibility gerin bowed to him lord king there she is he pointed to maeva if you think you can order her home and make it stick go ahead me i dont like to waste orders that wont be obeyed it weakens every other order i give after that one way to do it would be to forbid her from any future fighting here aragis said and to post guards around her to make sure she cannot join it he was not a fool he would never have done so well for himself had he been a fool maevas face fell gerin could indeed do that van saw as much too where his daughter wilted he beamed thats the way by the gods he said and bowed to aragis i thank you archer thats just the way oh yes a splendid suggestion dagref said had gerin loosed his own sarcastic tones quite so freely when he was younger on reflection he decided he had no wonder no one had liked him much dagref went on not only does it take one proved fighter out of the army it takes half a dozen or however many more out to watch her and make certain she doesnt do what shes already shown shes good at doing maeva had eyed him with a certain speculation back at fox keep he hadnt noticed then if he didnt notice now he was blind besides his education in such things had advanced since then but maybe he didnt after all for aragis was eyeing him too i am a king young fellow the archer said coldly do you cast scorn on me on you lord king of course not dagref answered but a king can spout foolishness like anyone else if you dont believe me listen to my father for a while aragis pursed his lips then turned back to gerin if that one can fight as well as he talks he will be dangerousif you let him live honh van broke in weve said the same thing about ferdulf close enough no wonder those two get on pretty well dagref took no notice of that he spoke to gerin who hadnt managed to get a word in edgewise about aragis suggestion father one of the things you always talk about is giving people the chance to do what theyre good at why else would you have made carlun your steward because you werent old enough yet to do the job the fox suggested perhaps a fourth in jest his son ignored him his son was good at ignoring him and getting better why else do you teach peasants to read and write if maevas good at fighting and wants to do it why shouldnt she have the chance you cant get maimed with a pen and a scrap of parchment in your hands curse it van said gerin still hadnt said anything no matter what he did say he realized he was going to make people he cared about unhappy he hated having to speak in circumstances like that too many times though he had no choice this was one of them slowly he said maeva has proved what she can do that she came south with us proves she wanted to do it much as id like to i cant see any justice in sending her back thank you lord king maeva said quietly dagref looked as pleased as if hed invented her van looked like a thunderstorm about to spill over maeva went on now i peel this fuzz off my face were i you i wouldnt gerin said with the beard you look like any other northern warrior near enough without it the imperials will see youre something out of the ordinary and take special care against you thats the last thing you ever want on the battlefield ive got rid of a good many foes who didnt think i was dangerous till too late i dont know van said i want em afraid of me with his tallplumed helm his gleamingly polished corselet of solid bronze and his great size and bulk he smashed gerins principle to smithereens he had the strength and skill to get away with it too dagref said a lot of the southerners shave their faces they might not take maeva for a woman just for a northerner who does likewise if youll remember son gerin said with a certain relish i didnt say they were liable to take her for a woman i said they were liable to take her for something out of the ordinary a man from north of the high kirs without a beard is out of the ordinary too why so he is dagref said youre right father he was not least disconcerting because he had no trouble admitting he was wrong gerin rubbed his own chin hed shaved his face when he came back up from the city of elabon but harsh ceaseless teasing had made himand rihwin tooconform in outward appearance if not in what lay beneath thank you lord king maeva said again i will do everything i can to show myself a worthy warrior for you i shall have words for you presently young lady van said and stomped off somehow that particular salutation seemed out of place when aimed at someone in a leather shirt with bronze scales sewn into pockets on it you handled that smoothly aragis said to gerin the fox supposed he meant it for a compliment i wouldnt have decided as you did but i can see how and why you did it which i never would have guessed when i spied your new warrior with a nod to maeva that might have been ironic or might not he took himself off too maeva went back toward the rest of the riders gerin expected dagref to follow her but the youth stayed i want to thank you father for keeping maeva with the army he said if youd ordered her back to fox keep i would have used the promise i won from you to make you change your mind would you gerin said and his son nodded half the foxmaybe more than halfwished he had ordered maeva back that would have rid him of the promise at a price he could afford now who could say what dagref would come up with now gerin eyed his son in a speculative way you must think a lot of her if youd give up the promise for that shes like a sister to me dagref said then a moment later he turned pink with characteristic honesty he corrected himself maybe not quite like a sister he didnt so much leave as flee rubbing his chin once more gerin stared after him the next morning gerins men and aragis moved south after the imperials the pursuit went slowly gerin had expected it would but it was even slower than hed looked for in their withdrawal the soldiers of the elabonian empire had manhandled boulders onto the elabon way and scattered caltrops not only on the road but in the fields to either side of it we may have won a battle fox but we havent won the war aragis the archer said theyll be ready to take us on again before long i thought as much from the way they pulled back gerin answered i said so to whoever would listen nobody much listened i wish id been wrong every so often he would roll past wreckage of the army he had beaten a chariot fallen to pieces a dead horse a hastily dug grave brown against the green of the fields to mark the final resting place of some imperial trooper whod died slowly instead of quickly every time he spotted a grave he wondered if maeva had seen it that probably didnt matter no one her age believed anything bad could happen to her the years taught you otherwise sooner or latermore often sooner a rider came trotting back from around a bend in the road lord king he shouted and then remembering himself lord kings what have the imperials gone and done now gerin asked lord king the scout answered seeming relieved to be speaking to a single sovereign lord king theres a wall across the road gerin pictured a barricade of rocks and logs perhaps with a few dismounted archers behind it to give approaching warriors a greeting less friendly than they might have wanted did you ride around it he asked do they have an ambush somewhere back of it couldnt ride around it lord king the horseman said its too wide to ride around he stretched out his arms as far as they would go whats he talking about aragis demanded irritably i dont know the fox admitted best thing i can think for us to do is go have a look for ourselves he tapped dagref on the shoulder forward wed better find out as soon as the chariot rounded the bend he saw the horseman had been telling the truth his own visualization had been at fault the wall was of red brick about ten feet high and stretched off to east and west as far as the eye could see van said the imperials couldn t have built that of course not gerin agreed or their soldiers couldnt have anyway its sorcerous without a doubt maybe its an illusion van said hopefully maybe if we go up to it we can go right through it it looked very solid of course an illusion that didnt look solid wouldnt have been much of an illusion gerin jumped down from the chariot he walked up to the brick wall and slapped it with the palm of his hand it felt very solid too suddenly suspicious he closed his eyes and walked forward he bumped his nose not too hard because he wasnt going too fast he opened his eyes he was staring at bricks up so close they were blurry he backed away the bricks became sharp and clear they didnt disappear no matter how hard he wished they would more and more of the army came round the bend in the road gerin heard the exclamations of surprise that rose from his men and aragis some were just exclamations of surprise he could deal with those he was surprised himself others though ones that came mostly from his men were full of confidence that he could get rid of the wall in short order van had his own ideas about how to do that saying dont be shy with the cursed thing he shouted for a hammer when he got onea stout bronzeheaded tool that looked about as deadly as the mace he carriedhe slammed it into the wall with all his strength nothing happened except that he grunted in pain and rubbed at his shoulder didnt even dent it he said in disgust you wouldnt gerin said its magical really van said packing enough sarcasm into the word to prove hed lived a good many years in fox keep aragis the archer said this is why i wanted you with me fox not against me gerin glared at him why so i can look like an idiot in front of your men and mine both aragis expression was one of stolid incomprehension he was convinced gerin was a marvelous mage nothing would unconvince him except watching the fox fail in that case he was liable to get unconvinced in a hurry hoping to sidestep the issue gerin looked around and shouted ferdulf what do you want the little demigod demanded he was back to being surly most of the time gerin wouldnt have let that bother him now he would have been glad for a little of the grudging gratitude ferdulf had shown right after the battle against the empire since he didnt have it he went ahead without can you fly up over the wall and tell us whats on the other side of it grass ferdulf said trees cows elabonians go far enough and there are mountains i dont need to fly over it to tell you that gerin exhaled through his nose i will not let the little divine bastard get my goat he thought with as much patience as he could he said knowing exactly where the imperials are might be good for us well probably fight them again once we get past the wall you know oh all right ferdulf said sulkily and hopped up into the air what happened next made everyone who saw it exclaim in surprise and alarm as ferdulf rose so did the wall in front of him he exclaimed tooangrily he didnt much care about obeying gerin having the elabonian empire thwart him was something else again but as fast as he flew as high as he flew whichever way from side to side he flew the wall rose to keep him from passing over it when he flew lower it shrank as if it or the wizard in charge of it could sense exactly how high he was at any given moment when he returned to the ground the wall went back to being what it had been before he started flying ten feet high and very solidlooking gerin rubbed his nose it felt as solid as it looked you ought to knock it down ferdulf said a wall like that has no business existing in the first place van didnt have much luck and if its magical im not sure we can knock it down gerin said for instance how thick is it i dont know ferdulf answered i think youre pretty thick yourself though if you stand here and let it baffle you rihwin the fox came riding over to gerin nice piece of work isnt it he said with the tones of one admiring a fellow professionals achievement even when that achievement inconvenienced him hed studied sorcery down in the city of elabon till a jape played on a senior wizard got him expelled from the sorcerers collegium despite that expulsion hed been a better mage than gerin up to the moment when mavrix took away his sorcerous powers he still knew magic well even if he couldnt work it any more id like it better if it werent so nice gerin said oh but its as pretty a use of the law of similarity as ive ever seen rihwin protested not only in building the wall but also in making detection of the keystoneor rather in this case the key brickas difficult as possible what nonsense is he spouting now aragis demanded irritably gerin took no notice of his fellow king father dyaus he whispered i do believe youre right of course im right rihwin said when have you ever known me to be mistaken pray tell only when you open your mouth gerin replied which reduced rihwin to irate splutters gerin ignored those too he walked up to the wall and examined it brick by brick sure enough each brick was identical to all its neighbors not just similar to them but identical each one had a chip near the center each had a scratch at the upper lefthand corner and each over to the right had embedded in it a tiny crystal or flake of mica that sparkled when the light caught it at the right angle isnt that interesting he murmured now youre the one full of drivel aragis complained tell me at once whats going on one of their wizards took a brick and sorcerously duplicated it about as many times as there are drops of water in the niffet gerin answered if i could find out which brick is the real one i wouldnt have any troublewell not much troublemaking the wall disappear ah aragis said and then all right i was beginning to wonder whether you were able to talk sense or not i see you are good as i told you i wanted you on my side because of the wizardry you know nowfind that brick and get rid of it rihwin had the grace to give gerin a sympathetic look its not quite so easy as that im afraid gerin said one of these bricks along the bottom row is sure to be the brick but which one go ahead lord kingyou tell me which one it is youre the wizard aragis said youre the one whos supposed to know things like that now get to work curse it he might have been ordering a lazy serf to spread manure over a field i cant tell which brick it is by looking any more than you can gerin said that means ive got a couple of thousand to choose from and thats liable to mean well be here for a while can we go around the bloody thing aragis asked maybe gerin said but i wouldnt bet anything i cared to lose on it my guess is that if the wall can go up and down to keep ferdulf from flying over it itll go from side to side to keep us from getting by it that makes more sense than i wish it did aragis said how do you go about finding out which brick is the brick then you have not put forward an easy question lord king rihwin the fox said the essence of the law of similarity centering on resemblance distinguishing between prototype and likeness is by its nature a daunting task if it were easy the cursed imperials wouldnt have bothered running up the wall in the first place aragis retorted he folded his arms across his chest and looked over toward gerin well well my fellow king much as i hate to disappoint youand to disappoint myself i might addi havent the faintest idea which one is the brick gerin answered i told you that once already maybe i can figure out some sort of sorcerous test though the gods only know how long thatll take or whether itll work youd need a god to tell you which one brick out of thousands is the real one and his voice trailed away youd need a godor maybe a demigod how about it ferdulf you want something more from me ferdulf said indignantly his sigh declared that he was put upon far beyond anything his powers might have made acceptable there are times when i wonder why the gods ever bothered creating mortals in the first place some sithonian philosophers wonder whether mortals didnt create gods instead of the other way round gerin said which made ferdulf despite being descended from a sithonian deity give him a horrible look he wished hed kept his mouth shut since he hadnt he went on in smoothly ingratiating tones be that as it may can you use your own great powers to see what we cannot it would give you another chance to have a go at the elabonian empire and embarrass the imperial wizard who put up the wall thinking it would stop us so easily oh all right even in agreement ferdulf was petulant in that he took after his father he floated up a foot or so into the air and drifted along to the west a couple of hundred yards its this one right here he didnt raise his voiceor gerin didnt think he didbut it came as clear as if hed been standing by the fox a helpful soldier ran forward and set his hand on the brick after ferdulf left it gerin trotted over to it ignoring the weight of his bronzeandleather armor to look at it was just another brick in the wall hed expected nothing different he turned to van whod followed him will you do the honors i will and gladly the outlander answered he smashed at the brick with the bronzeheaded hammer when a chip flew from it chips flew from all the others along the wall soldiers cheered van hit the brick again and again till it cracked in three places the rest of the bricks cracked too van pushed at one of the pieces with his foot it came away from the rest of the brickand the wall vanished about a hundred feet behind it stood a fellow in a fancy robe who looked absurdly surprised to be staring all at once at the entire army of the northlands thats a wizard gerin exclaimed as the man turned to run dont let him get away ill take care of that van growled he snatched up a piece of the brick he had broken and flung it at the sorcerer it caught him between the shoulderblades he went down on his face with a dismayed squawk before he could get to his feet again dagref and a couple of other men whod run after him jumped on him and frogmarched him back to gerin and aragis hello the fox said mildly i gather youre to blame for this latest bit of unpleasantness the wizard didnt answer gerin clicked his tongue between his teeth in mock dismay and i remembered manners south of the high kirs being so much smoother than they are here in the northlands tell us what to call you anyhow lengyel the sorcerer replied to that without hesitation it was after all only his usename not his hidden true name well lengyel suppose you start answering my questions gerin said still sounding mild but looking anything but well lengyel suppose you start answering questions or well see how long you last up on a cross aragis added youll have a cursed hard time working magical passes with your hands nailed to the wood sounding mild was beyond the archer but he did seem more matteroffact than menacing to gerin at least that made him more frightening not less it seemed to have the same effect on lengyel who did not look to be in a good position to work passes anyhow not with dagref jamming one arm up behind his back and the other held tight against his side after licking his lips the wizard said tell me what you want to know you were the fellow who made this wall the fox repeated yes lengyel said and then spoke in some exasperation and i certainly did not expect a pack of semibarbarous backwoods bumpkins to penetrate its secret quickly i did not expect you to penetrate them at all in fact you keep a civil tongue in your head if you want to keep any tongue in your head aragis said in about the tone gerin would have used to tell blestar to get down off the table dont worry about it archer gerin told him thats how the empire thinks of the northlands its how the empire has always thought of the northlands since the empire hasnt had anything to do with us for the past twenty years you cant expect them to have changed their minds during that time how did lengyels face suddenly twisted in pain stop that he hissed then you stop wiggling your fingers replied dagref who had given the wizards arm a yank i dont know what sorcery you were trying and i dont care to find out either lengyel bowed his head for the first time he seemed to realize the sorcerous wall hadnt come down and he hadnt been caught by a lucky accident you northerners are more clever than id expected he said slowly were clever enough to know were better off out of the empire than in it anyhow gerin said of course you dont have to be very clever to figure out that paying taxes and not getting anything for themno soldiers when the barbarians come over the border no grain when the harvest failsisnt the best bargain in the world you people have paid no taxes the past twenty years and you didnt pay many before that lengyel returned why you deserve to be rewarded for not doing what you should have is beyond me even when we did pay back a long time ago the city of elabon forgot everything this side of the high kirs gerin said that isnt the point aragis said the point is where in the five hells is the imperial army we thrashed once we thrash it again and maybe one more time after that you southerners will figure out that you ought to leave us alone this is the territory of the empire of elabon lengyel said we shall not abandon what is ours i think youd be wise to answer king aragis gerin said if you dont answer hes liable to get insistent and you wouldnt care for that believe me lengyelyou wouldnt lengyel looked at aragis he licked his lips again gerin hadnt said what aragis would do to him if sufficiently displeased hed figured lengyels imagination would come up with something more horrific than anything he might suggest if studying aragis hard face didnt start a frightened imagination working at a gallop nothing ever would to make matters worse aragis smiled the fox would not have wanted to be on the receiving end of that smile by all appearances lengyel didnt either his larynx worked a couple of times before he said the armymy armywill be most of a days journey south of here no doubt regrouping to face you rebuh you northernersonce more and this time come away victorious no doubt gerin said dryly nowwill the other wizards with the army know this wall has fallen or will we be able to give them a surprise greeting lengyel licked his lips again gerin saw evasion forming in his eyes dagref must have sensed the same thing for he gave the wizards arm another jerk upwards aii lengyel yelped have a care youll break it answer my father then dagref said pleasantly yes lengyels voice was sullen they will know too bad gerin said id have like to drop in on them unannounced but as aragis has said we will beat them one way or another van pointed at lengyel what are we going to do with him now keeping a cursed wizard captive in our midst could mean trouble for us so it could gerin said i hope it wont though he raised his voice ferdulf what do you want to annoy me with now ferdulf asked as touchy as he usually was he drifted through the air toward the foxand toward the captured imperial wizard lengyels eyes almost bugged out of his head as he stared at the demigod ferdulf went on what do you think im able to do that youre too stupid to manage for yourself i want you to keep an eye and an ear and whatever other senses you happen to need on this fellow here the fox pointed at lengyel if he tries to make a nuisance of himself with magic stop him if you cant stop him shout for the guards i expect theyll stop him for good yes ill do that ferdulf said a look of nasty anticipation on his face i dont like elabonian wizards not even a little i dont like what they can do either he hadnt cared for landing with a thump in the middle of the battle between the imperials and the men of the northlands he hadnt been able to do anything about it though not till gerin dealt with caffer by means altogether unsorcerous much as the late unlamented certainly by the fox caffer had lengyel asked what manner of creature is this ferdulf is that right before gerin could answer ferdulf shouted i am not a creature wretch you are the creature and a miserable creature you are too ill have you know i am the son of a god kindly grant me the respect due my station lengyel was not in a good position to grant anyone respect and dagref and his other captors did not loose their grip on him anyway the wizard spoke to gerin he wont be enough to hold back the might of the empire of elabon nothing will be enough to hold back the might of the empire of elabon do what you will with me for saying so but it remains true no it remains your opinion gerin answered my opinionand i know the empire better than you know the northlands i assure youis that you have no idea what youre talking about he nodded to his son take him away by the time two more days had passed gerin began to wonder how well hed really known the elabonian empire after all the imperials responded to defeat far more resolutely than hed expected they hadn t relied only on their sorcerous wall but had had scouts and skirmishers out south of it the skirmishers when they clashed with gerins men fought hard they wouldnt have acted like this in hildors day aragis said of course in hildors day they stayed down in cassat under the mountains and didnt bother with the rest of the northlands at all this new emperor of theirs must be a real meateater im afraid youre right the fox said gloomily ahead in the distance the latest party of imperial skirmishers fled back toward their own main force some of rihwins riders and a few chariots offering pursuit gerin clicked his tongue between his teeth i hope they arent trying to lure our people into an ambush you dont think they would do you dagref sounded far more alarmed and far less rational than usual gerin needed only a moment to understand why maeva was liable to be among the riders if he said something about that hed only make his son angry at him as well as worried what he did say was well its not beyond the bounds of the possible you know dagref nodded yes thats true he admitted as much to himself as to the fox i hope they dont though all right son i hope they dont too gerin said i do want to remind you our captains didnt get to be captains because they were so generous and trusting theyd follow the enemy wherever he went without another thought in their heads yes thats also true dagref said of course if all captains were as clever as you make out no ambush would ever work and we know thats not so van boomed laughter hes got you there fox i never thought id see the day when you were outlogicked but your sprout can do it now and then youre right gerin said and let it go at that van evidently hadnt figured out what dagref had that his daughter was liable to be riding into danger gerin supposed that meant dagref had outlogicked the outlander too had he been dagrefs age himself he would have pointed it out being the age he was he kept quiet not all the things the years had brought were welcome but discretion often came in handy before long the riders and chariots returned no ambuscade had awaited them and for that matter maeva was not among them dagref had the grace to look sheepish some little while later as the chariot rattled south along the elabon way van let out several startled oaths whats biting you gerin asked what nothing never mind van shook his head and looked determined not to answer the fox decided pushing him right then would probably be a bad idea the outlander had taken a while to work out what dagref saw right away was his guess and didnt care for it any more than dagref had nothos elleb and tiwaz were in the sky when the army camped that night the first pale moon a thin crescent swiftmoving tiwaz a much fatter one almost at first quarter and ruddy elleb a couple of days before full rihwin said i think theyll fight us again soon tomorrow or the day after if they wait much longer well be down to cassat youre likely right gerin said he caught one yawn then let another one loose they wont fight us tonight though with the ghosts abroad traveling by night will be more dangerous to them than we would there you speak sooth lord king rihwin answered he yawned too i shall have a good nights rest the better to lay waste the imperials come morning and the better to forget i was once a man from south of the mountains myself yes you had better forget that hadnt you gerin said pointedly he yawned again me im going to forget everything but my bedroll morning dawned bright and clear it also dawned without lengyel both his guards were asleep and remained so despite repeated efforts to shake them awake some drug or other i judge gerin growled examining the prostrate men with no small annoyance maybe he had it secreted on his person or maybe he found an herb he could use when he went behind a bush either way he raised his voice to a shout ferdulf what now the demigod demanded drifting over from some distance away the wizard escaped the fox snapped i didnt know anything about it ferdulf said he looked at lengyels unconscious guards too he didnt use magic to do it thats what i was looking for thats what you told me to look for if youll recall gerin exhaled angrily i dont care if the whoreson bored them to sleep reading bad poetry i didnt want him loose thats not what you said ferdulf replied with considerable aplomb i cant keep track of everything at once you know im only superhuman in the abstract gerin admired the line he had scant time to worry about the abstract since you let him get away i did no such thing ferdulf retorted you were charged with keeping him here gerin said i was charged with making sure he did not escape by magic the demigod said i did as i was charged and he did not escape by magic if a couple of witless mortals let him up and wander off when he didn t even have to bother with sorcery thats hardly my problem now is it he folded his skinny arms across his narrow chest and floated off the ground till he was staring the fox straight in the eye the expression on his face ached for a slap regretfully gerin held off from delivering it instead keeping his voice light he said it depends on how you look at things i suppose if you dont mind taking the chance that his magic will do worse things to you than caffers did you may be right ferdulf might have had a god for a father but he wasnt much better than any other fouryearold at looking ahead to the likely consequences of things he didand things he didnt do he was unhappy enough at what gerin said to let his feet scuff the dirt once more all rightwhat should i do about that he asked in tones much less toplofty than he usually used now that he has escaped can you use your powers to hunt him down or to help some troopers hunt him down gerin asked i dont think so ferdulf frowned or maybe i can i could try anyway gerin nodded he rose into the air now till he drifted high above the encampment like a badtempered cloud he twisted his body so that he faced due west then slowly began bearing ever more to the south gerin wondered what sort of sense he was using to feel for the vanished lengyel had it been a sense the fox possessed he could have done the search himself up in the sky ferdulf suddenly stiffened he dropped a few feet as he had a way of doing when he wasnt paying full attention to his flying were he wholly divine no doubt he wouldnt have had to worry about such things were he wholly divine gerin would have had to worry much more about him there he called down to the fox pointing southwest hes going that way that way was the direction in which gerin was almost certain the bulk of the imperial army lay how far away is he he shouted up to ferdulf can you tell hard to be sure ferdulf answered i wasnt sure i could find him at all you know yes yes gerin said but is it worth my while to send a few men after him or has he got back safe to the enemys main camp the little demigod dropped a few feet more i cant tell he said sounding angry at gerin lengyel and himself i wish i could but i cant a pestilence gerin muttered i wish you could too he looked around for aragis the archer wasnt far away shall we send men after the wizard gerin asked him were it up to me id say yes but youre the overall commander if you want to hold back and let him go i wont quarrel are you daft aragis growled of course send men after him bringing him back is worth the risk send some of your riders its the sort of thing theyd be good fortheyre faster than men afoot and they can go places where chariotry cant chase him till he wishes hed never run away good enough as gerin shouted for rihwin he reflected that the best way to fight aragis was liable to be leading him into a trap a place where hed think he had an easy victory but where in fact more foes waited than hed expect for the moment though he was an ally how many men would you have me send lord king rihwin asked and shall i take ferdulf if hell go with you certainly gerin answered thatll make it harder for lengyel to turn your troopers into toads he raised an eyebrow youre going to lead this chase yourself by your leave i am rihwin said since i could not even detect the presence of a woman warrior among my men id fain reassure myself that i am on occasion capable of seeing beyond the end of my nose fair enough gerin told him but dont just have your eyes open for lengyel remember the imperials are liable to be waiting for you somewhere out there too he hesitated then asked and how did maeva seem to youas a warrior i mean oh i understood you you need not fret over that rihwin looked chagrined had aragis not noticed what she was i doubt i should have done so this you must follow disturbs me for not one but two reasons first that she performs in every way so much like a man and second that i of all people simply failed to note her femininity and what would you have done if you had gerin asked and then answered his own question if she didnt make you sing soprano for trying to do that her father would have i do not molest women who find my attentions unwelcome rihwin replied with dignity given the number who find those attentions most welcome i have no need to bother or bother with the others what with the number of bastards hed fathered over the years that comment held no small grain of truth with more dignity still he went on in any event the charms of a womanor i should say a girlof that age hold little appeal for me all right im persuaded gerin said now go off and but rihwin once begun was not so easily headed maeva may well be attractive to someone with fewer years than myself your son for example immediately springs to mind aye he does doesnt he gerin said which seemed to disconcert rihwinmaybe hed expected indignant denials gerin waved his fellow fox forward go on get after that wizard dont stand around gabbing all day rihwin and a squadron of his riders went trotting south a few minutes later ferdulf went along with them gerin wouldnt have wanted to be an imperial mage the little demigod flushed out of hiding on the other hand he wouldnt have wanted to be rihwin using ferdulf as a hunting hound either most hunting hounds had the sovereign virtue of not talking back rihwin and his men had been gone only moments when someone spoke to gerin in a reedy tenor lord king he turned and found himself facing a fuzzybearded youth he needed a heartbeat to remember the beard was false and the tenor in fact a contralto what is it maeva he asked cautiously when you sent the riders out just now vans daughter asked did you tell rihwin not to put me in that squadron no gerin answered maybe i would have if it had occurred to me but it didnt i didnt tell him anything one way or the other did he say i did no he didnt say that maeva said but when he didnt choose me i wondered can you blame me i suppose not the fox admitted if youre going to do this though theres something i want you to think about all right what either in her own proper person or disguised as a man maeva was no one to trifle with this gerin said just because you can be chosen to do this that or the other thing doesnt mean you will be chosen all the time or that you have to be chosen it may just mean you werent chosen this one time and you may be the next maeva considered that with almost the grave intensity dagref might have shown at last she said all right lord king thats fair enough as far as it goes but if im never chosen for anything dangerous then it doesnt go far enough if that happens ill get angry her eyes blazed as if to warn that getting her angry was not a good idea being acquainted with her parents gerin could haveindeed hadfigured that out for himself he considered her words in turn youre with the army maeva youre fighting if you think none of the imperials could have killed you in the last battle maybe i should send you home after all she tossed her head a feminine gesture odd when combined with the false beard stuck to her chin and cheeks nobody knewwell nobody but dagref knewwho i was what i was i was just another trooper it s not going to be like that any more it cant be like that any more i wish it could im not going to send you back no matter how much your father wishes i would gerin said that means youre going forward youll get more fighting believe me you will he paused what will your mother think when you come home fand was formidable but not in the same way maeva was my mother you heard me tell my father i didnt worry about that much but maeva thought it over my mother would probably say i didnt need to put on armor and carry a bow if i wanted to fight with men gerin laughed yes that probably is what shed say he wondered whether maeva knew he and fand had been lovers for a while in the dark time between elises leaving him and his meeting selatre if she did he wondered what she thought he saw no way to ask he didnt really want to find out some curiosity was better left unsatisfied he let out a small snort rihwin would surely disagree with him there but then rihwin didnt believe in holding back on anything whats funny now lord king maeva asked sometimes the things you dont do are as important as the things you do he answered maeva cocked her head to one side no doubt wondering how that could possibly be amusing would dagref have understood maybe maybe not too the fox couldnt think of anyone else so young who might have when gerin didnt seem inclined to explain further maeva went off scratching her head he was unoffended hed sent his vassals off bemused more times than he could count most of those times had worked out all right that gave him reason to hope this one would too he peered south and kicked at the dirt he also hoped rihwins chase after lengyel would work out all right but he had no particular reason to believe it would rihwin could perform far better than anyone who knew him only slightly might imagine he could also perform far worse until he did whatever he did on any given day no one could guess what that would be trees blocked gerins view he couldnt see as far as he would have liked he couldnt see ferdulf in the air any more either what was happening out there where he couldnt see how foolish had it been to let rihwin and ferdulf each erratic by himself go off together how sorry would he be when he found out how foolish hed been was that a bird in the sky down there to the south nono bird had ever flown with such a smooth effortless motion that was ferdulf and what did the birds think of the little demigod who invaded their domain gerin would have bet they found him as annoying as everyone else did he was coming this way and out from behind those trees here came horsemen they had people on foot with them gerin took that for a good sign also promising was the way ferdulf kept flying down and darting into the faces of the men on foot as if they were chariot horses of the soldiery of the elabonian empire the fox wondered if ferdulf was doing anything disgusting to them from on high that didnt seem the best way to treat prisoners he supposed they were gerin trotted toward the returning horsemen so did aragis so did a good many ordinary soldiers a lot of people were still curious to learn what the riders could do a horseman detached himself from the rest and approached the fox at a rapid trot after a moment gerin saw it was rihwin we have him rihwin shouted as soon as he was close enough for his voice to carry the soldiers cheered gerin clapped his hands together aragis looked astonished and didnt bother hiding it gerin called who are all the others you have there a round dozen of the fanciest whores off the streets of the city of elabon rihwin answered gerin blinked the soldiers burst into louder cheers rihwin waved them down would it were so but alas it isnt theyre imperial troopers at whose forward camp lengyel was staying they offered no resistance for we not only outnumbered them two to one but also came on them by surprise thanks going almost entirely to the aid ferdulf furnished you probably wouldnt have been able to do it in chariots would you gerin asked and rihwin shook his head aragis said i never denied horsemen had their uses fox i even said this was one of them dont twit me here he didnt sound so angry as he might have he couldnt have expected rihwin to succeed as fully as he had here came lengyel looking even more dejected than he had when the men of the northlands captured him the first time hello again gerin greeted him arent you glad were barbarians and dont know what were doing delighted im sure lengyel said sourly which made gerin respect him for the first time as a man rather than simply as a dangerous sorcerer rihwin said and lord kinglord kingswe have booty that may prove as valuable and delightful as our victory itself has been he pointed to the mounts of some of his riders the animals had skins tied on behind the horsemen grinning he went on here we find precious treasure scarcely seen in the northlands for a generation of men rihwin you didnt gerin began oh but lord king my fellow fox i did rihwin broke in did you think that after so long i could resist the allure of so much splendid glorious magnificent wine back next contents vi you idiot gerin said to rihwin you clodpoll you jackanapes you bungler you cretin you jobbernowl you madman you fool you loon you twit you lout you thank you lord king i have by now some notion of your opinion so you need not elaborate further rihwin said oh but i was just warming up gerin said i hadnt even begun to discuss your ancestry if any your habits and how lovingly the demons of the five hells will roast you after you diewhich may be far sooner than you think for im bloody tempted to murder you myself be reasonable my fellow fox rihwin said a request to which gerin might usually be expected to respond well could you imagine i would pour the blood of the sweet grape out onto the uncaring ground rather than bringing it home in triumph and what about the lord of the sweet grape rihwin gerin shouted too furious for reason to hold any appeal what about mavrix do you want to deal with mavrix do you want mavrix to deal with you what happens when mavrix and ferdulf make each others acquaintance how far away would you like to be when that happens can you get to a place so far away i dont know rihwin said an answer more inclusive than specific why didnt you bother thinking about any of those things ahead of time gerin demanded though he knew the answer only too well at the sight of wine anything resembling thought had fled from rihwins head rihwin said lord king imagine if youd been without a woman for most of the last twenty years and then found not one but half a dozen beautiful maids all of them not only willing but eager would you leave them behind would you spill their blood out on the ground instead of enjoying them its not the same and dont you try to distract me gerin said you havent exactly been pining away youve made do quite well with ale a man who wants women can without them make do with boys rihwin replied he can even if his temper runs that way make do with sheep making do though will not stop him from wanting women i ought to spill this wine right now gerin grated hed meant that to alarm rihwin instead it made the transplanted southerner brighten you mean you shant spill it out not right now gerin answered reluctantly not till i think it through which is a cursed lot more than you ever bothered doing blessings upon you lord king rihwin cried in fervent tones he seized gerins hand which alarmed his overlord then he kissed it which alarmed gerin even more have no fear rihwin said his eyes sparkling with amusement i am not one of those who wanting boys make do with women of that you may rest assured he changed notes yet again er lord kingwhy arent you going to spill the wine out on the ground gerin let out a weary sigh because ive seen more often than it suits memuch more often than it suits methat you and wine and the will of the gods are somehow all tied together the only reason i can think of to make it so is that your head is altogether empty inside which means they have no trouble filling it with their desires i loved the blood of the sweet grape long before i made mavrixs acquaintance rihwin said i should have been as glad not to make that acquaintance and i should have gone on loving wine had i not made it all of that is no doubt true gerin replied none of it has anything to do with how many pits of wheat are buried around the village by fox keep and none of it i fear has anything to do with why you found that wine and why you decided to bring it back here to our camp this may be so lord king rihwin said let us assume it is so if it be so if i act at the will of the gods rather than pursuant to my own will how is it you are furious with me when i was but the emptyheaded conduit through which they manifested their will because gerin stood there with his mouth hanging open realizing he had no good answer at last he said because youre handy curse it adding a moment later and because youd have brought back that wine even without a god whispering in your ear and you bloody well know it such a claim is all the better for proof rihwin said loftily if you do not purpose spilling the wine what will you do with it set a guard over it so you cant guzzle it gerin replied at once and watched rihwins face fall and so no one else can either he said for good measure but that did little to cheer his fellow fox you take all the fun out of life rihwin complained i hope so gerin said which made rihwin angrier yet the wine stayed under guard rihwin kept right on grumbling he wasnt the only one either most of those grumbles gerin simply ignored he couldnt ignore the ones from aragis the archer well go ahead my fellow king the fox said if you want to see what will happen go ahead if you want to meet mavrix face to face go ahead youre a king you can do as you pleasetill a god tells you otherwise anyhow suppose i drink it and nothing happens aragis demanded then you get to call me a fool gerin said suppose you drink it and something happens will there be enough left of you for me to call a fool aragis muttered something into his beard that gerin didnt catch the archer stomped off making a point of kicking at the grass at every stride he did not drink any wine gerin thought about teasing him then thought better of it and then he got a request for wine from someone else in a fashion he had not expected ferdulf came up to him in as nearly a polite way as hed ever seen from the demigod may i please have a taste of the blood of the grape he asked gerin stared as far as he could remember hed never heard please from ferdulf before not least because of that he didnt say no right away instead he asked why do you want it why do you think ferdulf replied with somebut not allof his usual irritating sense of superiority gerin had an answer or thought he did but didnt speak it he waited the arrogance leaked out of the demigod in a voice much smaller than ferdulf usually used he said if i drink wine perhaps it will bring my father thither that was the possibility that had occurred to the fox too it was not one that much appealed to him whatever ferdulf thought of it if your father does come he asked cautiously what would you do ferdulf looked confused and unhappy as opposed to malicious and intent on making everyone around him unhappy his more usual aspect i dont know he answered something else he hardly ever said i think id like to ask him why he brought me into the world and what he intends of me thoughthat for a beginning and who can say from there why did he start you gerin thought as best i can tell for no better reason than to annoy me mavrix had certainly succeeded there aloud the fox said why are you asking leave of me you have the strength to overcome the guards ive setim sure of it oh yes ferdulf said carelessly but i know it might cause trouble so i thought i had better ask before i do anything that didnt sound like ferdulf either if nothing else in the world intimidated him mavrix did gerin said i dont really think the time is ripe now tell me the truth do you the little demigod sagged maybe not he said and walked off with his feet on the ground his head down then suddenly he turned back hopping half his height into the air as he did so if my father were to be summoned though would he not take our side against the empire of elabon which has inflicted such indignities on sithonia over the centuries he might the fox admitted and let it go at that adding more would have reminded ferdulf that the men of the northlands were as much elabonians as the imperials he went on in a different vein saying remember what the imperial wizard told us thoughthe empire of elabon has ruled sithonia for all those years and the sithonian gods havent been able to do anything about it except slander the imperials that being so how much good will mavrix do us ferdulf descended to the ground once more he didnt answer but went off in the direction hed chosen before his afterthought gerin concluded he didnt think mavrix would do much good seeing a humble ferdulf was as novel an experience as any the fox had had lately he looked in the direction of the wineskins and the guards around them theyd drawn a fairsized crowd at first that alarmed him then he relaxed a little if a lot of people were hanging about the wine that would make it harder for any one manrihwins smiling face popped into his mindto sneak away with any of the blood of the grape while the fox was thinking thus van came up to him and said by all the gods captain its been a long time since i slugged down any wine if i could just undo the tie on one of those skins now wait fox what in the five hells do you think youre doing looking at me like that curse it fox put your sword back in its sheath have you gone mad no its the whole world around me gerin answered van examined him closely for signs he was joking by the way the outlander walked off shaking his head he didnt find any the next morning the army of the northlands rolled through another of those villages that had trembled on the edge of being towns and were now falling back unmistakably into the lesser status gerin had no time to do anything but mournfully note as much for a couple of bowshots south of the village imperial scouts riding chariots with fast horses began pelting his men and aragis with arrows ha aragis exclaimed they arent as smart as they think they are without waiting for gerins advice he shouted rihwin forward the riders aye lord king rihwin said and shouted orders of his own out rode the horsemen gerin looked to see if he could spot maeva among them but had no luck by the way dagrefs head followed the evolutions of the riders he was looking for maeva too with roughly equal numbers the horsemen routed the charioteers as they had at the first big battle between the imperials and men of the northlands the riders were faster and more maneuverable than their foes they shot no worse than the men in the chariots before long those chariots streamed back toward the southwest in headlong retreat i think we ought to form line of battle gerin told aragis we re liable to run into the whole imperial army any time now aragis frowned if we dont run into the imperials moving forward that way will slow us down after a bit of thought though he nodded let it be as you say if we do run into them before were ready theyll make us sorry for it as he had before the earlier battle with the forces of the elabonian empire he halted the army and shouted left and right form line of battle left and right as they had then his men and gerins cheered that still left the fox bemused though he supposed he should have been used to it why didnt they think forming line of battle meant they were about to get maimed or die painful lingering deaths if they thought like that and if their opponents fought the same way nobody would fight wars and then and thenwhat then they would not die painful lingering deaths in battle which was not as gerins logical mind noted the same as saying they would not die painful lingering deaths fever might take them from life raving or they might die of a wasting sickness that ate them from the inside out or they might fall over from a fit of apoplexy and linger perhaps for years unable to speak and with half their bodies dead in life when you got down to it there werent any good way ways to die only bad ones and worse ones when measured with that ruler perhaps dying on the battlefield looked less appalling gerin looked up to ferdulf who floated over the army light as thistledown demigods unlike the divine half of their parentage werent immortal they commonly outlived ordinary mortals and they commonly died in ways ordinary mortals might envy such as dropping off to sleep and never waking up the fox wondered if the chance of dying was in ferdulfs thoughts now he doubted it no ordinary fouryearold gave such things a thought then aragis shouted riders to the right and left well hit the imperials on both flanks this time and see if we cant cave em in the horsemen who hadnt joined rihwin in his assault on the imperials cheered as they rode to take the positions to which aragis had ordered them gerin felt like cheering too to his fellow king he said youre learning aragis gave him a wintry look before answering the first time your father set a sword in your hand did you know straightaway everything you could do with it now you have given me a new weapon and i am beginning to discover what it may be good for fair enough gerin said better than fair enough in fact a great many people when they come across something new will either pretend it isnt there or try to use it as if it were old and familiar regardless of whether its really anything like the old and familiar a lot of people are fools cold contempt filled the archers voice tell me youve not seen that in your years as baron and prince and king and ill call you a liar to your face i cant do it gerin answered the difference between us i think is that you scorn men for being fools and i find them funnyat least i do my best to find them funny the gods know its not always easy easy aragis snorted its not worth doing you ask me gerin hadnt expected him to say anything different the archers arrogance had taken him a long way as long a way as it could have taken him unless he overthrew gerin and ruled as king of the whole of the northlands or unless he crossed over the mountains and cast crebbig i down from his throne were all different gerin observed with profound unoriginality so we are aragis said sometimes i think youre lightminded as a trokm then i look at what you do not what you say and i think youre hiding behind a mask all these years and i still havent figured out what to make of you he sent the fox an accusing stare good gerin let it go at that keeping aragis off balance had probably gone a long way toward keeping the two of them from fighting a war before they could take it any further ferdulf whizzed down toward them pointing southwest and shouting if thats not the imperial army beyond the next rise its a herd of elephants a moment later mounted scouts came back with the same news aragis for once looked at ferdulf with approval unalloyed he gave us the news faster than the riders did he took on a thoughtful expression warfare would be a different business if both sides had people up in the air spying on the foe i wonder if you could fight at all if the other bastard knew what you were going to do as you did it you could unless i miss my guess gerin answered youd just have to make it look as if you were going to do one thing while you really intended to do something else aragis studied him now for some time without saying anything when he finally spoke it was in tones of reluctant admiration aye and belike youd find some way to do just that too you are a sneaky demon no mistake he shouted and waved to his troopers and the foxs who werent forming their battle line fast enough to suit him in the car with gerin dagref said how could the archer not have seen that subterfuge would be necessary if each side could observe the others preparations for combat because he doesnt think as fast as you do gerin said and he doesnt like to play with hypotheticals in his mind ill tell you this though son if he really did have to worry about people spying on him from the air his dispositions would be the lyingest ones you ever saw thats a fact van agreed if its real aragis is good with it if its not real he doesnt worry about it foolishness dagref said with a sniff flicking the reins to bring the horses up to a trot the hypothetical has a way of becoming real without warning before it happened who would have thought the elabonian empire would come roaring back over the high kirs to trouble us i didnt think that would happen myself gerin said and id be just as glad if it hadnt happened too believe me the elabon way swung wide and he got his first glimpse of the imperial army but theyre here and were going to have to deal with them van said by the gods weve taught them something like respect they arent swarming toward us the way they did in the first fight then they thought they could ride right over us and make us run they know better now the stinking whoresons yes gerin said not altogether contented with the change in the imperials tactics he wanted his enemies to go right on being stupid it made them much easier to deal with he also glanced over at the outlander and look whos talking about the elabonian empire as if hed been born in the northlands and spent his whole life listening to people running it into the ground go howl van said with dignity its a fight and im on this side so of course the imperials are a pack of bastards if i were over on that side everybody from the northlands would be a filthy rebel there doesnt that make sense more than i like gerin answered he watched rihwins horsemen swing wide to right and left to take the imperial army in the flank the imperials didnt send squadrons of chariotry out against them to try to hold them up theyd learned better than that too what they hadnt learned the fox saw with rising glee was that if they didnt stop the riders they were going to get both wings of their army smashed up in a hurry dagref saw the same thing at the same time what do they think theyre doing he demanded like a schoolmaster faced with unprepared pupils theyre trying to throw the fight away van said ill let em anybody thinks ill complain if they make my work easy is plumb daft he started to elaborategerin knew it was a theme on which he would be able to elaborate for a good long whilebut then grunted in surprise and shut up some of the horses had gone down just as they were nearing bow range of the imperials flanks is that magic father dagref asked do you know i dont think so the fox replied if i had to guess id say the imperials have strewn some caltrops around to either side of their position to help ward their flanks they work against chariot horses so i dont suppose theres anything that would keep them from working against horses with men on top of em some of rihwins riders did get through and started plying the men of the elabonian empire with arrows but some hung back and even those who didnt had to ride more slowly they were an annoyance then not a devastation as they might have been seeing as much the imperials cheered horns blared along their line now they rolled forward they would not receive the attack of the chariots from the northlands while standing still themselves men on both sides shouted gerin and aragis troopers as individuals the imperials in the fierce unison that had seemed so effective in the first battle arrows flew as always the first few fell short but the range between the two armies closed rapidly men began to cry out horses began to scream here and there chariots overturned spilling soldiers onto the ground any place in particular father dagref asked as gerin arrow set to bowstring looked around for his first target the other king doesnt seem to take much care in the way he arranges things does he that held an unmistakable sniff before gerin could reply van laughed and said being the son of your father has spoiled you lad aragis had given us a decent field and a good chance to win if we fight hard and ive seen plenty of captains who lived to grow old and fat even though they were in the habit of handing their men a lot less dagref sniffed again he had high standards and was too young to have realized the trouble most mortals had meeting such standards pointedly he said you still havent answered me father steer for anybody who looks to have fancy armor or a fine team of horses the fox said most men of high rank enjoy showing off honh van said his castbronze corselet and plumed helm were without a doubt the most distinctive gear on the field you heard me gerins armor was not gilded nor even polished the leather that secured the bronze plates in place was scuffed and patched but all the leather and all the plates were sound the horses dagref drove were undersized and roughcoated but they had more endurance than most they were descended from a pony off the plains of shanda for which van had traded while accompanying gerin and elise down to the city of elabon more than twenty years before that horse had been even smaller and uglier but it was tougher than any other gerin ever knew obediently dagref pointed the team at an imperial whose armor was bright with gold paint and who wore a crimson cloak that fluttered behind him gerin let fly the officer of the elabonian empire threw both hands in the air and tumbled out the back of the chariot well shot van shouted though refusing to use the bow in battle he would not hold back praise from others who used it well dagref guided the horses toward another imperial who looked more splendid than his fellows gerin shot at the foeand missed however good a shot he was however much practice he had shooting from the pitching platform of a chariot he missed more often than he hit disappointed but not devastated he reached over his shoulder for another shaft thunk an arrow smote the leftward horse of the team just back of the animals left foreleg the horse went down as if clubbed the arrow must have pierced its heart its fall fouled the other horse the chariot tipped jounced along on one wheel for a couple of frantic heartbeats and then overturned spilling onto the ground all three men in the car gerin heard himself shouting as he flew through the air hed gone out of chariots before he tried to tuck himself into a ball to land as softly as he could even so the soft ground slammed against him as if it were granite his helmet spun off his head and bounced away pain shot through his right side which took most of the impact but when he tried to scramble to his feet he discovered he could nothing broken then that was somethingor would be if he could stay alive long enough to appreciate how lucky he was he was he discovered still holding his bow nohe was still holding a piece of his bow unlike him it had broken when it hit the ground he threw down the chunk in his hand and yanked out his sword then he looked around to see how van and dagref were both of them were on their feet too and seemed sound so for the moment they like he were lucky how long their luckand hiswould last remained problematical not very long seemed the likeliest guess the chariots of the elabonian empire were very close now and getting closer every heartbeat one of them thundered straight toward dagref who being slim and beardless and without sword or spear looked to be the easiest target of the three downed warriors gerin ranslowly favoring his right legto his sons aid dagref proved not to need any aid with him as with the fox looks turned out to deceive though he had no sword or spear hed held on to the whip he used to urge on his team a replacement for the one caffer had turned into a snake he waited till the elabonian chariot was terrifyingly close then lashed out with the whip striking one of the horses on its soft tender nose the animal screamed in shock and pain it stopped dead and tried to rear the driver kept it from doing that but the chariot thundered past dagref instead of riding him down and as it went past the whip lashed out again the driver screamed as loud as the horse had he clutched at his eyes the other two imperials in the car clutched at the reins hed dropped neither one of them could make a clean grab that was unfortunate for them because they got only the one chance dagref cracked the whip again one of them shrieked he shrieked again a moment later when van speared him in the sideshrieked and crumpled gerin scrambled up into the chariot the surviving unwounded imperial was an archer who carried only a dagger for selfdefense he didnt stay unwounded long he scrambled over the rail of the car and ran off howling and dripping blood killing the driver seemed unfair since he still had both hands clapped to his face in the middle of a battle though fair was a flexible notion gerin thrust home hard threw the drivers thrashing body over the side and seized the reins he started to shout for van and dagref but they were already up in the car with him with a flourish he handed his son the reins i think you know what to do with these he said he knows what to do with all sorts of things van said an enormous grin on his face dont you dagref the whip who me dagref looked absurdly pleased with himself a man could get an ekename any number of ways if he was very fair or very fat he might have one before he could toddle or he might be called his fathers son his whole life long earning an ekename on the battlefield didnt happen to everyone it didnt happen to many in fact dagref the whip gerin agreed better than dagref the surly or dagref the brown study or since the whip is still in my hand dagref remarked pointedly a prudent man would save such suggestions for another time a prudent man wouldnt have done a lot of the things ive done over the years gerin said youre the most prudent man i know fox van said that may be true but it doesnt say much for the rest of the people you know gerin retorted fand immediately came to mind but the fox was prudent enough not to mention her instead he said how prudent is it for that matter to ride around in a chariot when none of us has a bow you should have grabbed the one that imperial had before you pitched him out of the car van said aye that would have been prudent gerin agreed if only id thought of it at the time cant think of everything at once though no matter how much i wish i could van said well since we havent got one well have to pretend were some of rihwins riders and see how close we can get to the imperials ive always liked that kind of fighting better anyhow why am i not surprised gerin murmured being so big and so strong the outlander naturally excelled at closequarters fighting a man with a bow though might hurt him before he had the chance to do damage of his own dagref took the discussion between his father and his fathers friend as an instruction for him and guided the chariot toward the nearest one full of imperials the men of the elabonian empire seeing a car that looked like their own took a fatal moment too long to realize the warriors inside were foes van speared one of them dagref kept using the whip to wicked effect and by the time the brief fight was done gerin once more had a bow to call his own he reached over his shoulder to snatch an arrow out of his quiver an imperial screamed like a longtooth a moment later and clutched at the side of his thigh the fox shot another arrow this one missed he reached back yet againand found the quiver empty he scowled the quiver had been nearly full before he spilled out of the chariot before he he growled a curse most of the arrows must have gone flying from the quiver when he hit the ground he hadn t even noticed hed had rather more urgent things on his mind such as staying in one piece come on fox van said why arent you shooting at the whoresons ill tell you what gerin answered as soon as you figure out how to spear them without any spear ill shoot them without any arrows what the outlander stared then his face cleared oh aye we did go arse over souppot there didnt we well all right well have to keep on doing the way we did just now wont we sooner or later everyone will start running out of arrows dagref said oh indeed gerin nodded the next interesting question is whether people will run out of arrows before one gets stuck in one of us thats an interesting question in any fight interesting oh aye heh van snorted then spat in a way that was disgust in another way it was bravado not many warriors on the field gerin would have guessed had enough saliva in their mouths to spit he was a long way from sure he did himself he worked his cheeks experimentally then he stopped worrying about whether he could spit there ahead sure as sure was a gap in the imperials line where chariots had swung right and left around one that had overturned and then hadnt closed up again he looked around not far from himhow theyd got there he hadnt noticedwere a good many chariots full of trokmoi he waved to them a couple of the woodsrunners aimed arrows at him they lowered them when he shouted in their own language through there nowhe pointedand well be after carving a great chunk from the southron spalpeens do you want me to go through that gap and hope the barbarians will follow dagref asked by his tone hed heard ideas he liked much better but gerin said thats just what i want you to do be a mite embarrassing if the trokmoi decide theyd sooner be rid of you than of the cursed imperials van remarked what he meant was if that happens were going to get killed gerin couldnt recall the last time hed heard such a protest so elegantly phrased he stopped worrying about that too go on he told dagref quick now before they close up the hole all right his son urged the horses forward the fox shouted when the chariot did force its way between two manned by soldiers of the elabonian empire the imperials hesitated before trying to block his path as had happened once already they thought anyone in a chariot from south of the high kirs was bound to be a comrade as had happened once already they discovered they were mistaken gerin laid open the face of one of the imperial troopers on his left a cut that took the enemy doubly by surprise because he delivered it with his left hand on the other side of the car van speared an imperial archer out of a chariot the fellow looked comically surprised or would have had he not also been in agony well i think thats drawn their notice dagref said i bloody well knew it would draw their notice gerin answered as an arrow hissed past his ear what i want to know is has it drawn the woodsrunners in after us if it hasnt he let that hang if it hadnt van was rightthey would get killed he looked back over his shoulder and whooped with glee the trokmoi were behind him and more of them than hed expected often what looked suicidally stupid to an elabonian looked like fun to a trokm gerin was heartily glad of that not least because it meant the imperials wouldnt be concentrating on him alone theyd have other things on their minds such as stopping the penetration before it split their whole army in two sometimes distraction was better than victory sometimes they were one and the same chariots were at close quarters now everyone hacking and stabbing and shooting at everyone else the men of the elabonian empire seemed to feel a slight superstitious awe of the trokmoi who must have been much discussed but never seen during the years when the empire stayed south of the high kirs superstitious awe however had a way of lasting no longer than the first successfully blocked blow after that it was just man against man for their part the trokmoi went after the imperials with almost unholy glee the woodsrunners had no more use for elabonians than elabonians had for them but by now theyd dwelt south of the niffet for a generation to them gerins men were only partly hated southrons they were also neighbors sometimes friends sometimes even inlaws none of those palliatives applied to the warriors from south of the mountains they were the enemy pure and simple the trokmoi laid into them with an appalling lack of concern for what might happen to themselves so long as they could get in a few more licks at the foe because the woodsrunners were so fierce the imperials needed a disproportionate number of men to hold them in check and because they were making a move that would be important if it succeeded the imperials threw those men at them that didnt help their position along the rest of the line which was what gerin had had in mind there as he had before he aimed dagref toward a gap between a couple of imperial chariots if we get through there and bring a few trokmoi after us we really have cut the whoresons in two aye father dagref urged the horses forward wild whoops proclaimed that the trokmoi were still following the fox the imperials he faced knew they were holding an important part of the line they could hardly help knowing it with so many foes bearing down on them one of them let fly with an arrow behind gerin a trokm shrieked the fox had a perfect shot at the imperialor would have had one with any arrows in his quiver and then the imperial cried out and clutched at his flank from which a shaft sprouted to have hit him at that angle it couldnt have come from straight ahead gerin turned his head to the right recognizing him some of rihwins horsemen waved he waved back an enormous grin on his face weve got em van shouted by all the gods weve got em in the mill all we have to do now is crumble em from grain to flour itll be harder work than that gerin said the grain in the mill doesnt try to break the millstones is this really the time for literary criticism dagref asked possibly not gerin admitted an imperial who had been thrown out of his chariot flung a stone at him it clanged off his shoulder which started to throb maybe that was literary criticism maybe it wasnt whatever it was vans spear responded to it most pointedly the imperial was never heard to comment on a metaphor again with part of their army cut off and surrounded the rest of the forces of the elabonian empire began falling back as they had before the imperials retreated with a professional competence the men of the northlands trokmoi and elabonians both would have been hard pressed to match they held their ranks and kept fighting instead of running every which way which was the more usual response to defeat north of the high kirs they didnt seem to be saying were beaten gods preserve us it was more as if they meant all right youve got the better of us this time but it was probably just luck see what happens when we meet again thinking thus gerin said what worries me is this is the second time weve beaten them not the first dont you think they ought to be getting used to the idea that they dont fight as well as we do dagref said theyre probably getting used to the idea that they re going to need reinforcements from over the mountains i wish you hadnt said that gerin told his son where are we going to get reinforcements if they do father dyaus where are we going to get reinforcements even if they dont its a bloody miracle that aragis and i are on the same side as things are what do we do if they should send another army over the high kirs dagref asked either fight it out or surrender and go back to cheating the empire out of the tribute it thinks it deserves the way i did in the old days gerin answered here he was winning a battle and dagref had managed to make him think he was losing pointedly he went on lets tend to one thing at a time if you please if we manage to botch what were doing now the empire wont need to think about sending reinforcements thats sensible father dagref allowed after his usual pause for thought nice of him to admit it eh fox van said with a chuckle dagref started to say something else gerin cut him off and the outlander too take it up after the fights over with he said meanwhile lets see what we can do to get it over with faster he raised his voice to a shout imperials give yourselves up and i promise you your lives one of the men in the surrounded pocket of charioteers asked and who are you that we should care about your promise gerin the fox king of the north he answered every once in a while wearing unobtrusive gear had disadvantages as well as good points if hed dressed like a king they would have known who he was if hed dressed like a king though they might have done a better job of trying to kill him what will you do with us if we yield ourselves the imperial inquired that was a good relevant question gerin wished he didnt have to come up with a reply on the spur of the moment if you yield now he said ill disarm you and send you north and settle you in peasant villagesone or two of you in each one because i dont want you plotting against me its the best i can do will you take it otherwise youll die right here either that or be used as slaves if you give up later and we decide to let you live what do you say the imperial whod been asking questions threw down his bow and took off his helmet good enough for me he said at once his comrades started throwing down their weapons too once gerin saw they were going to yield he detailed a small number of men to take charge of them then led the rest south in pursuit of the bigger part of the imperial army before long he caught up with aragis the archer ha aragis said i wondered what happened to you fox you disappeared for a while there and i thought i might be the only king left in the northlands but i see it isnt so he plainly wouldnt have been brokenhearted had gerin died but he didnt seem brokenhearted to find him alive either that struck the fox as a reasonable reaction no flies on aragis either the next thing he said was thats not the chariot you started out with today so it isnt gerin agreed they kept trying to kill us out there and they came closer to doing a proper job of it than i would have liked not wearing royal regalia had probably saved his neck ha aragis said again this time evidently intending it for laughter rather than a greeting what they do a proper job of is getting off a battlefield once theyve lost the main fight he waved ahead look at the order theyre keeping if they fought that well in the battle they might win gerin unrolled an imaginary scroll and made as if to read its title the triumphal retreats of the elabonian empire being a relation of the manner in which the said empire was won by its armies going backwards ha aragis said for a third time thats not half bad if only the bastards would go to pieces once we licked them wed drive em over the mountains and be rid of em once for all only if they decided not to reinforce dagref said aragis studied the youth for a long moment then shook his head hes got as nasty a way of looking at the world as you do fox worse gerin answered he glanced toward his son dagref preened that was the only word for ithe unmistakably preened van pointed ahead to the imperial army they are going to break away from us and to your five elabonian hells with me if i see anything we can do about it best thing to do is give up the pursuit if we cant break em gerin said if we spread ourselves too thin chasing them theyre liable to counterattack and then theyd steal a victory on the cheap i hate to say it but i fear youre right aragis said well gather ourselves up and then well hit em another lick in a few days sooner or later they ought to figure out they cant beat us he gave dagref a pointed look dagref as pointedly ignored it that made aragis laugh a genuine laugh to gerin he said he will be formidable wont he i expect so the fox answered of course hes had practice not paying attention to me dagref preened again aragis began shouting orders to bring the army to a halt when he saw they would be obeyed he turned back to gerin where has that ferdulf of yours got to i didnt see much of him in the fight neither did i gerin said he must have been doing something of his own unless i miss my guess hes his ferdulf not mine if you dont remember that hell make you pay aragis grunted ill remember men nowmen you order to do something and if they dont do it you make them how are you supposed to make a demigod pay if he doesnt feel like doing it ive spanked him once or twice gerin said sounding much much more casual talking about it afterwards then hed felt doing it he succeeded in impressing aragis i always knew you were brave the archer said up till now i never thought you were stupid aragis looked gerin up and down maybe i was wrong maybe you were the fox said im allied with you arent i aragis chewed on that for a little while then started to laugh so did gerin why not theyd just won another battle going back to the field gerin found laughter harder to come by the dead back there some of them men hed known most of his life and others not so old men hed known all their livesthey were every bit as dead as if hed been defeated the only consolation he found was that not so many of them were dead as if hed been defeated that might suffice for him he didnt think it would for them nor did victory ease the torment of the wounded they still screamed or groaned or wailed or hissed or stood or lay silent biting their lips against the pain till blood ran from the corners of their mouths there would have been more of them whom the fox knew and liked had the imperials won but that didnt help the ones who had been hurt moreover wounded men whod fought for the elabonian empire didnt look or sound any different from those whod followed gerin or aragis as he had at the earlier battle gerin did what he could to help the wounded extracting arrows washing cuts out with ale despite the curses of the men whod acquired those cuts and once or twice quietly cutting the throat of a man who could not live but would without help be a long slow painful time dying he hated that but hated their suffering more presently he came upon a young fellow with a fuzzy beard who was limping around with a bloody bandage on his right calf no not a fellow though his own arms were bloody to the elbow gerins stomach did a slow lurch maeva he exclaimed hello lord king she said her voice a little wobbly but firmer than a lot of others hed heard they wanted to draw the shaft but i wouldnt let them i know you have a good hand for such things she sat down on the ground pale yet determined ill do the best i can the fox said shed given him a compliment but not one of a sort hed ever wanted to get in the hope that talking would keep her mind off the pain he asked how did it happen she looked at him as if hed asked a very stupid question on reflection he realized he had how do you think she asked irritably i was riding along doing what i was supposed to be doing and my leg started to hurt when i looked down i saw whyan arrow was sticking out of it he nodded of itself one of his hands went to the other shoulder hed felt that same absurd surprise when hed been shot then it had started to hurt he reached down and undid the bandage saying lets see what weve got it was about what hed expected whoever had slapped the bandage on maeva had also cut the shaft of the arrow off short so it wouldnt be in the way that was as it should have been but it kept the fox from gauging how deep in the meat of her calf the arrowhead lay can you pull it out maeva asked id rather not he answered his voice troubled the imperials use barbed arrowheads same as we do pulling it back will make the wound a lot worse what will you do then maeva sounded calm but ragged at the edges she was liable to start screaming any time gerin didnt hold that against her or blame it on her sex hed heard plenty of wounded men scream on the battlefield hed been a wounded man screaming on the battlefield he used his knife to cut her trousers away from the wound so he could feel of it he also cut the checked wool on the inner side of her calf when he gently pressed there he felt something hard under his fingertip he grunted maeva flinched and hissed and let out a small fragment of a shriek before she could bite down on it its almost through he said actually thats pretty good if i push it all the way through the head will be out and then the rest of the shaft will come with it without much trouble he was telling the truth he knew he was telling the truth hed had plenty of practice sounding cheerful with wounded men too somehow this was different it was harder go ahead maeva said her voice more ragged now she set herself gerin had set himself too before they started working on that shoulder it hadnt done him much good he didnt think it would do her much good either he set his hand on the stub of the arrow and pushed hardsoonest over hed found was best maeva did shriek then hed expected she would pain deliberately inflicted was harder to bear than that which came by accident the barbed bronze arrowhead stabbed out through her skin though it was slick with her blood gerin seized it and drew the shaft after it there he said its donewell almost he carried a jar of ale with him when he poured it on both wounds in maevas leg she screamed again and tried to kick him easy he told her now im going to bandage it again he did with fresh rags blood started soaking into them from the old wound and the new maeva took a long shuddering breath thank you she said its better now im sorry i made so much noise i didnt hear anything gerin assured her he knew it wasnt necessarily better yet the wound could still go bad in which case she would be very sick and might even die hed done what he could do and made himself sound reassuring it wont be long before youre on your feet and running hard again it didnt cut the tendon you wouldnt have been on both feet if it had you should heal nice and clean thank you lord king she said that made him feel worse rather than better if he hadnt let her stay and fight she would have been angry instead of gratefulbut she would have been unwounded he knew which way he would rather have had her but as if picking that thought from his mind maeva went on im glad you gave me the chance to fight even if it turned out like this next time i hope ill be luckier gerin looked down at his hands they had her blood on them literally and now he supposed figuratively as well he kept trying to think of her as just another warrior hed had plenty of wounded young men tell him more or less the same thing shed said a moment before try as he would it wasnt easy that thought kept recurring fox a deep voice boomed from over on another part of the battlefield where in the five elabonian hells have you gone and got to now here gerin answered and waved maeva was frantically shaking her head had gerin thought before he waved he wouldnt have done it too late now van was already on the way over crimson horsehair plume nodding above him to make him even more unmistakable than he was already hullo fox he called still from some distance away patching up another by the way the outlanders voice cut off gerin knew exactly when his friend realized exactly whom he was patching up van came the rest of the way at a pounding trot he stooped beside his daughter what happened he demanded a question no more useful than gerins had been arrow she said doing her best to make light of it the king says it should heal well through the meat of the calf gerin said when van looked a query his way no tendon cutim sure of that she should heal clean the gods willing he added to himself maybe saying it over and over would help make the gods more willing van was still looking at him not with a question in his eyes any longer but with rising anger gerin had seen him aim that look at scores likely hundreds of enemies over the years the fox had never had it aimed at him run went through his mind as it was no doubt meant to do van growled if it hadnt been for you fox that gerin had had the identical thought would have done little to console the outlander gerin was sure of it but before van could say anything more maeva broke in sharply leave him be father how old were you when you took your first wound sixteen or so van answered i was lucky for a while ive made up for it since that was if anything an understatement he bore a great many scars gerin wondered how hed ever survived one wound that had gashed his chest and belly well then maeva said as if that said everything that needed saying but van shook his head its not the same chick he said the same thought that had been troubling the fox why not maeva said i fought well enoughoh maybe not so well as you father because im not the size you are even though im not small i kept fighting after i got hurt too it wasnt bad enough to make me quit the field what am i supposed to do van sounded plaintive something he very rarely did he looked to gerin curse it fox help me she sounds like i did when i was the same age and why are you so surprised at that gerin asked shes your daughter after all dagref sounds more like me than i ever thought anyone could he sounds more like me than i ever thought anyone would want to oh aye i can see that van said gerin laughed dagref perhaps fortunately was nowhere nearby van went on but its not the same hed said that before and sounded most sincere he still did dagrefs your son of course hell follow in your track am i not your child because i have no stones maeva asked before van could answer gerin said ive seen men with beards down to their belts who had less in the way of stones than you do maeva thank you lord king she said quietly van glared at gerin fat lot of help you are he growled and stomped off shaking his head thank you lord king maeva said again more firmly this time i think youre a great deal of help i know you do gerin answered the trouble is i still dont know whether im supposed to be helping you or your father he gave her a sudden sharp bow and i have other wounded to help if i am supposed to treat you like a soldierand im still a long way from sure that i amthen i have to go on as i would from another soldier why of course lord king she said as if surprised he could imagine thinking any other way that surprised him in turn and made him begin to believe he might in fact be able to think of her as a soldier gerin sat up on his blanket somethings wrong he said his voice blurry with sleep he looked around the campfires were lower than they had been though sentries still fed them to help hold the night ghosts at baynot that the ghosts hadnt had their glut of blood earlier that day snores rose from sleeping soldiers in an unmelodious chorus injured men groaned against their pain everything seemed to be as it should but gerin had not been dreaming when he thought something was wrong he was sure of that he did not know how he was sure only that he was he looked around again again he could find nothing amiss he started to lie down once more then checked himself he looked around yet again this time for rihwin the fox wherever there was trouble rihwin usually wasnt far away that was especially true when wine was involved gerin hadnt had to worry about wine for a good many years now he did worrying about wine meant worrying about rihwin but no there rihwin lay not twenty feet off snoring as unmusically as anyone else gerin let out a small sigh of relief if rihwin had no part in whatever trouble brewed odds were it wouldnt be so bad years of experience had led gerin to believe as much at any rate he yawned and lay flat again despite the yawn despite rihwins snores sleep would not come somethings wrong he said again quietly this time and got to his feet he would not find any rest till he made sure that prickly feeling of unease in his mind was imagination and nerves he breathed a little easier when he saw dagref too dagref probably would not make trouble on his own he knew precisely what sort of trouble dagref and maeva would make together though he would not have wanted to make that sort of trouble while wounded but with both of them so young who could tell what they were liable to do but they couldnt very well do anything with dagref sprawled asleep on a blanket a sentry was laying branches on a fire he looked up when he heard gerins footsteps is everything all right lord king he asked i dont know gerin answered im trying to find out he prowled on lengyel the wizard was liable to cause trouble too lengyel had already caused trouble as a matter of fact gerin stalked over to where he stayed under guard the guards were alert so was gerin when he saw that lengyel instead of lying there asleep was sitting up looking at him no lord king he hasnt done anything one of the wizards guards assured the fox he wakes up in the night sometimeshas to piss you know hes often a goodish while dropping off afterwards is he gerin gave lengyel a hard stare probably looking for another chance to get away if i found one i should be a fool not to take it the sorcerer said i regret to admit i have not found it your men have been more careful than i had expected he made a sour face very little on this side of the high kirs has been as i expected we never expected to see imperials on this side of the high kirs at all gerin said wed have been just as happy if you people had gone on minding your own business too instead of poking your snouts into ours even as he spoke he wondered if he was telling the truth if the imperial army had stayed south of the mountains he would have been fighting aragis instead by what the men of the elabonian empire had shown thus far the archer would have made a more troublesome foe on the other hand gerin had no guarantee that the elabonian emperor wouldnt send another army over the high kirs to give this one a hand in musing tones he said tell me what this crebbig i is like he chuckled into the darkness thinking how much he sounded like the imperials asking him about ferdulf his imperial majesty is bold and valiant and splendid and terrible beloved of his friends a terror to his enemies wait gerin held up a hand lengyel sounded as if he could go on like that for days without ever saying anything that mattered gerin said lets try it another way is crebbig hildors son if hes not what was he before his backside landed on the throne down there in the city of elabon how could you not know these things lengyel asked in surprise no trouble at all the fox answered very much the same way as you were ignorant about everything that has anything to do with the northlands the difference is i know that i dont know where you hadnt a clue that drew an indignant sniff from lengyel wizards knowing so much about wizardry naturally assumed they knew a lot about everything else too primly the sorcerer said you exaggerate i assure you no i dont gerin held up a hand wait never mind it doesnt matter just answer my questions about crebbig very well lengyel did not and would not call him lord king holding to the official imperial view that there were no kings north of the high kirs only rebels ruling against the authority of the city of elabon the wizard went on no crebbig is not the son of the emperor hildor iii who is now beloved among the gods dead you mean gerin said and lengyel nodded the fox asked did crebbig give him some timely help in becoming beloved among the gods lengyel nodded again this time so did gerin good now were getting somewhere what was the murderous usurper doing before he slaughtered his way to the top of the heap i resent the imputation contained within your words lengyel said i dont care gerin said cheerfully resent all you like you serve him i dont and i wont now answer my question what was crebbig the killer doing before he got to be elabonian emperor lengyel gave him another reproving look for that highly unofficial ekename he ignored it he was good at ignoring such looks having had practice with his children seeing it fail lengyel said the emperor was formerly commander of the elabonian garrison occupying the citystates of sithonia was he gerin said now isnt that interesting crebbig would have had a goodsized army behind him when he rebelled elabon kept a large garrison in sithonia for the good and sufficient reason that elabon needed a large garrison in sithonia down through the centuries of elabonian occupation the sithonians had never given up plotting and scheming and conniving and occasionally rising up against their imperial overlordsand being sithonians had never given up betraying one another to their imperial overlords either it was also interesting the fox realized a moment later because of the sithonian connections in his own life he hadnt actually seen a man from one of the citystates east of the greater inner sea since hed come back from the city of elabon more than twenty years before but since then hed had more dealings with mavrix than hed ever wanted and mavrix had saddled him with ferdulf and father dyaus he whispered and left lengyel so quickly the wizard and the guards all stared after him he didnt care something was indeed liable to be wrong and he thought he finally knew what sort of something too his nostrils twitched when he got close to where he was going he hadnt smelled that smell in a long time but he knew what it was rich fruity he couldnt have mistaken it for anything else guards stood around the wine rihwin the fox had captured from the imperials as guards had stood around lengyel the wizards guards hadnt been able to keep him from escaping once and the guards here hadnt been able to keep somebody from getting into the wine gerins nose told him as much though the guards didnt seem to notice anything out of the ordinary hello lord king one of them greeted him what brings you here trouble gerin pointed dont you see someones got past you and in among the wineskins cant you smell the spilled blood of the sweet grape once he showed them they had been befooled they exclaimed angrily and snatched out their swords before then theyd been oblivious curse the imperial wizard to the hottest of the five hells said the fellow whod greeted gerin his spells must have stolen our wits away thats not lengyel in there gerin frowned all things considered i rather wish it were ferdulf looked up from the wine hed been drinking bother he said glaring at the fox why didnt my glamour take you too its always harder if someone already knows what hes looking for gerin said do you know what youre looking for there with the wine my father ferdulf said i thought wed agreed that wasnt a good idea gerin told him aye we did ferdulf that most unchildlike baritone still as clear as if hed never begun to drink and then i stopped agreeing and i decided to do something about not agreeing what you should have done was come to me gerin said you didn t agree by yourself you shouldnt have broken the agreement by yourself either ferdulf shrugged it takes two to make an agreement but only one to be rid of it youd have tried to talk me out of this and youd best believe i would gerin broke in mavrix was the last personforce godthe fox wanted to see right now no one not gerin not ferdulf probably not mavrix himself could begin to guess what hed do but i dont want to be talked out of it ferdulf said the more i thought about that the more certain i got and so he raised a drinking jack to his lips his throat worked thats very fine it was sure to be only rough army wine barely worth drinking but he cared nothing for objectivity my father certainly made something better here than boring old ale ale suits me well enough gerin answered sincerely though i would be the last to deny wine is fine too ive drunk a deal of wine and drunk it with enjoyment the last thing he wanted to do was offend mavrix if by some mischance the god should be listening and choose to manifest himself here he succeeded in offending ferdulf instead trimmer the little demigod sneered drinking again this is good but that isnt badbah you havent much time mortal man you should be all one thing or all another not a bit of this and a bit of that gerin shook his head i have something of everything in me if i left something out that would be the waste ferdulf stared at him the demigods eyes caught and reflected what little light there was like a cats you dont answer as you should he complained you dont think as you should as best i can tell my father put me on earth where he did for no better reason than to have you torment me i doubt that gerin had always thought mavrix had sired ferdulf on fulda for no better reason than to torment him if ferdulf hadnt drawn the same conclusion gerin didnt intend to point it out to him life with the demigod had proved interesting enough as things were for his part ferdulf was not thinking about about his relationship with the fox i want my father he shouted loud enough that the cry should have awakened the entire campbut only gerin and the guards around the wine seemed to hear him i want my father he poured wine down his throat from a skin almost as large as he was alarm prickled through gerin dont do that he said urgently come on ferdulf give me the skin i want my father ferdulf shouted again the space around the wineskins seemed to expand my son i am here mavrix said back next contents vii father ferdulf cried in delight gerin trotted out his halting sithonian i greet you lord of the sweet grape he bowed low looking at the sithonian god of wine and fertility from under his eyelids mavrix as usual wore supple fawnskin a wreath of grape leaves kept his long dark hair off his forehead ferdulfs eyes had flashed mavrix glowed all over raiment and all the only darkness in him was his eyes twin pits of deepest shadow in his effeminately handsome face well he said now voice echoing inside gerins head as if the fox heard him with mind rather than with ears i have not been north of the mountains in some little while i cannot say this benighted excuse for a country has improved much since i last saw it i must tell you what do you mean now ferdulf sounded indignant im here and i wasnt the last time you came to fox keep well yes mavrix admitted he seemed something less than delighted to make his sons acquaintance even so the gradi dont trouble the northlands these days gerin put in he carefully did not add no thanks to you mavrix had tried to stand against voldar the ferocious chief goddess of the gradi but had not been strong enough baivers the elabonian god of barley and brewing had held off voldar and the rest of the gradi pantheon along with considerable help from the fearsome deities of the monsters under bitons cave gerin wondered whether mavrix despised baivers or the monsters gods more well yes if anything mavrix sounded even less thrilled than he had with ferdulf even so ferdulf ran over to him and caught him by the hand father he cried again mavrix inspected him if the sithonian god was impressed he concealed it exceedingly well yes i am your father he said you summoned me so i came now what do you want he sounded like gerin granting a brief audience to a man for whom he could not spare any more time he wanted ferdulf to come to the point so he could get back to whatever he had been doing ferdulf caught that too here i am the son you got on my mother he exclaimed have you no praise for me have you no words of wisdom words of wisdom were the last thing gerin would have asked of mavrix if the sithonian god had chosen to give him any he would have reckoned true wisdom likely to lie in ignoring them here and now the issue did not arise for mavrix only shrugged the sinuous motion put gerin in mind of a serpent i may be your father the god said but i am not your nursemaid ferdulf reeled back as if mavrix had slapped him however heartless mavrixs words sounded gerin thought they did hold good advice at least they told ferdulf in no uncertain terms that he could not rely on mavrix for anything but his existence whatever else they did they infuriated the little demigod you cant ignore me he shouted his feet came off the ground he shot through the air at mavrix like an angry arrow in his right hand the sithonian god bore a wand wreathed in ivy and vine leaves and topped with a pinecone the thyrsus looked like a harmless ornament in mavrixs hands though it was a weapon more deadly than the longest sharpest heaviest spear any human warrior could carry mavrix tapped ferdulf with the wand ferdulf groaned and crashed to the ground a child who annoys his father gets the stick as he deserves the god said to the demigod ferdulf was used to having more supernatural power than anyone around him he rose into the air again and hurled himself at his sire you cant do that to me he cried oh but i can mavrix answered and tapped his son with the thyrsus again again ferdulf hit the ground more heavily this time than before you need to understand that just because i came when you called you have not the right to abuse me nor shall you ever ferdulf moaned and lay in a heap alert as a longtooth mavrix stood there watching him a faint rank odor of wine lees and old corruption floated from the god making gerins nose twitch slowly with another groan ferdulf sat up why did you come when i called he asked in a voice full of despair i hoped you would see me and be proud of me i hoped he shook his head as if to clear it what a naive little creature you are mavrix said which brought one more groan from ferdulf the sithonian god turned to gerin i should have thought he would have learned better dwelling by you as he does for a mortal you have a moderate amount of sense even if he is a demigod hes only four years old gerin said concealing his own bemusement at hearing anything even remotely resembling praise from mavrix ferdulf heard it too heard it and did not like it how dare you talk to him talk to this this man more kindly than you do to me i dare because i am a god i dare because i am your father mavrix returned evenly by early appearances ferdulf annoyed him even more than the fox did his dark dark eyes stared at stared through his son how dare you presume to question me i am flesh of your flesh blood of your blood ferdulf said if i have not got the right who has no one mavrix answered now be quiet for a little while ferdulf tried to speak but produced only squeaks and grunts not intelligible words gerin was impressed he could do even so much when mavrix commanded silence of a mortal man silence was what he got seeing mavrix relatively welldisposed to him the fox asked lord of the sweet grape what aid can you give me against the elabonian empire at that ferdulf did fall silent he wanted to hear the answer too being anything but enamored of the empire mavrix looked troubled that troubled gerin sithonian legend spoke of what a coward mavrix was but what was on the gods face did not look like fear to the fox it looked like resignation that troubled gerin more i can do less than you might hope mavrix said at last if i could do more than you might hope do you think i would not have done it for fair sithonia rather than for this grapeless and otherwise unattractive wilderness but gerin shook his head you sithonian gods are still very much a part of your own country while the gods of elabon hardly seem to notice this world any more one has to shout to get their attention you might say mavrix nodded that is so and once gained their attention is frequently not worth having he sniffed scornfully as may be gerin said not wanting to disagree openly with the sithonian god of wine and fertility once hed summoned baivers the elabonian god had done more for him than mavrix had in any case that wasnt what he wanted to know he asked with the gods of sithonia immanent in the world while those of elabon are not how have the elabonianshe carefully did not say we elaboniansruled your land so long that is a cogent questiona painfully cogent question mavrix said the best reply i can give is that the folk of sithonia while they have a great many gifts from their gods conspicuously lack that of governing themselves elabonians on the contrary have next to no discernible gifts of any sort save only that of government it would take a stronger god than any known in sithonia to make its people unite regretfully gerin nodded that fit too well with what the imperial wizards had told him is there nothing you can do he said wondering what good is an impotent god especially an impotent fertility god i have already done all you require of me and more besides mavrix answered without my sonwho may by the way speak againyou would have no hope whatever of repelling the forces of the elabonian empire with him you have that hope nothing in the mundane world is altogether certain however either for gods or for men do not be smug do not be overconfident you may yet lose this fight too youre talking in riddles gerin said accusingly i thought you despised biton and so i do mavrix said with a curl of the lip but how am i to speak with certainty when i cannot see everything that lies ahead gerin wondered if he ought to go up to ikos to hear what the farseeing god had to say maybe hed made a mistake not doing that when duren suggested it he wondered whenand ifhed have the chance to leave the army and try to puzzle out one of bitons notoriously ambiguous oracular verses ferdulf said but what must i do to drive the empire out of the northlands i dont know mavrix answered i havent the faintest idea i dont much care either if the truth be known that anyone would be mad enough to wish to live in a land where the grape grows not is beyond me he turned his head toward ferdulf you will manage i expectunless of course you dont a sigh rippled out of him for some reason i am frequently disappointed in my offspring it must be the fault of the mortal women on whom i sire them nothing is ever your fault is it ferdulf said a thought also in gerins mind but one he found it politic not to mention when things go your way you take the credit when they go wrong someone else gets the blame you for example my charming child are entirely to blame for that unseemly temper of yours mavrix returned which to gerin proved only that the sithonian fertility god was not so perceptive as he thought he was ferdulf started to curse him gerin had heard some fancy curses in his time but very few to match the ones spewing from the little demigods lips when the fox closed his eyes for a moment he could easily imagine he was listening to a veteran abusing a man hed hated for twenty years if the abuse bothered mavrix he didnt show it on the contrary he beamed at ferdulf as if proud of him i love you too dear son of mine he said when the demigod finally paused for breath he stuck out his tongue even farther than ferdulf could haveand then he was gone ferdulf kept on cursing for quite some time even though only gerin stood beside him near the wineskins without warning he stopped cursing and burst into tears i was afraid something like this might happen gerin said as consolingly as he could thats why i didnt want you to try summoning your father he didnt care ferdulf spoke in tones of astonished disbelief he just didnt care i am his sonand he didnt care hes a fertility god gerin answered hes had lots of sonsand lots of daughters too he doesnt see much reason why a new one should particularly matter to him i hate him ferdulf snarled ill hate him forever hed better not show his ugly face around here again or ill make him sorry thats what ill do easy gerin said easy you dont want to talk that way about your father no matter who he is you especially dont want to talk that way about your father when hes a god i dont care what he is ferdulf said and then began to cry again ill pay him back for not caring about me if its the last thing i ever do if you try that its liable to be the last thing you ever do gerin said ferdulf ignored him the little demigod kept crying as if his heart would breakno as if it were already broken the men guarding the wine stared at him they were gerins subjects and knew about ferdulf they no more expected this behavior from him than they expected the fox to go on a fourday drunk and rumple every peasant girl he could get his hands on gerin stared at ferdulf too after staring he did what he would have done for any other crying child he walked over squatted beside ferdulf and put his arms around the demigod even as he did it he wondered how foolish he was being like any other crying child ferdulf could do all sorts of unpleasant things if he didnt feel like being held unlike any other crying child he could do all sorts of dangerous things if he didnt feel like being held but all he did was throw his own arms around the fox and bawl till he had no more tears left when sobs subsided into sniffles and hiccoughs gerin said why dont you go find your blanket now i don t think anything more will happen here around the wine tonight he devoutly hopedand that seemed to be the right word toonothing more would happen around the wine tonight all right ferdulf said but i will have my revenge you wait and see if i dont off he went hardly more than half as tall as a grown man but showing a determination few grown men couldor would have wanted tomatch when the fox straightened up his knees clicked he glanced over to the guards who were staring after ferdulf the less you talk about what happened just now the happier ill be he said the happier i am the happier youll be do you understand that aye lord king they chorused as gerin walked back toward his blanket he was gloomily certain the secret wouldnt hold he counted himself lucky mavrix hadnt gone and roused the whole camp that would have created a fine chunk of chaos which the sithonian god often enjoyed he lay down he wondered how he was supposed to go back to sleep after some of that chaosto say nothing of a despondent demigodlanded in his own lap he looked up at the stars and the moons tiwaz and elleb were in the sky both of them moving from full toward third quarter even elleb which had risen after tiwaz floated high in the southeast sunrise couldnt be too far away gerin yawned with his luck he thought hed have just dozed off when the sun came over the horizon and sure enough that was exactly what happened rihwin the fox set hands on hips and looked indignant he had a good deal of practice looking indignant along with innocence no sucking babe could match it was an expression he donned frequently this time though gerin would have been willing to bet at least most of the ire was real you quaffed the wine without inviting me rihwin demanded as if unable to imagine an act more heinous gerin shook his head i didnt quaff a bit of it he replied ferdulf did and sure enough mavrix came did you really want to make his acquaintance again do you think he would have wanted to make yours rihwin brushed that aside with an airy wave of the hand a gesture that came from south of the high kirs wine was quaffed and i quaffed none of it he said where i pray you is the justice in that i found the wine i brought the wine back to the camp i pant after the wine the way an old lecher pants after a young virgin gerin broke in that is what you meant to say isnt it well possibly i might have chosen other words to the same effect rihwin said with a disarming grinanother expression hed practiced and had need to practice but lord king unlike the lecher i have done without for fifteen yearsand now that the wine is a virgin no longer how can you begrudge my having it too i might have known better than to try a figure of speech against you gerin said of course youd turn it upside down and throw it back at me now rihwin looked smug he didnt need to practice that expression it came naturally you cannot in logic deny me he said and gerin nodded youre right i cannot in logic deny you he admitted but im going to go right on denying you just the sameand denying myself and van and aragis and everyone else if mavrix came for ferdulf hes liable to come again and id just as soon he didn t but this is unjust rihwin cried it has behind it no rational force yes gerin said and so rihwin simply stared at him gerin stared back hed had a lot of practice at keeping his features impassive what with rihwin ferdulf his own children fand and many others hed needed that kind of practice rihwin dropped his eyes not smiling gerin said go onget ready to move out were not done with the imperials you know not anywhere close off rihwin went every line in his body proclaimed mute outrage dagref who had been standing by listening to the exchange remarked he will try to get into the wine you know and the sun will come up tomorrow gerin agreed wearily tell me something i couldnt figure out for myself he stayed away from it as long as he did because no one else could get at it either now that ferdulf has but ferdulf is a demigod and son to the god of wine dagref said doesnt rihwin see any distinction between that case and his own the only thing rihwin sees is his own thirst gerin answered that worries me too but i can only do so much about it the best way ive come up with to make sure he stays away from the blood of the sweet grape is to keep him too busy to get near the wineskins that being so he sent rihwin out on patrol with a couple of squadrons of his riders whatever else rihwin was no one had ever accused him of being dullwitted he had no trouble seeing what gerin was doing or why he was doing it and gave his fellow fox a sour look but since gerins order also made perfectly good sense in military terms rihwin could do nothing about it but obey maeva did not ride out with rihwin and the others who fought on horseback gerin would have given rihwin a kick in the fundament had he sent any wounded warrior into action without dire need maeva still looked offended at being left behind how does the leg feel he asked her tell me the truth now a more experienced warrior probably would have lied despite that admonition maeva was young enough and seriousminded enough to heed it sore she confessed he set a hand on her forehead hold still he said when she tried to pull away youre not feverish is your leg hot around the wound a little she said and then in a very firm voice but only a little all right he answered that sounds like its healing as it should stay off it as much as you can the less strain you put on it the faster it will get better and the sooner youll have a scar that will startle your husband on his wedding night he thought or maybe some other young man on a warm spring night a good deal sooner than that if hed said what was in his mind he would have embarrassed them both by keeping his mouth shut he managed to embarrass only himself shaking his head he went off to get the army moving faster as they broke camp he soon saw again that the imperials while they had now lost two battles were still very much in the fight they had so many chariots out to slow down the northerners march rihwin sent a rider back to ask for reinforcements theyll smash us up if you dont send more men forward lord kings the messenger said well send more men forward by the gods aragis snarled well send the whole cursed army forward see if we dont he shouted orders gerin frowned that wasnt how he would have handled things it struck him as sticking his head into a longtooths mouth and inviting the beast to bite down scouts went ahead of an army to develop the opposition to see what was out there moving up with the entire force meant the scouts didnt have the chance to do their job and invited an ambush he started to protest then made himself keep quiet this was what hed bought when he agreed aragis should have command of the whole host he could not claim the archer was holding back his own men and endangering only gerins aragis was sending everyone into the fight he was sending everyone into the fight so aggressively that if the imperials did have an ambush set it might not do them much good he didnt seem to have many ideas as a general but he knew what to do with the ones he had and the imperials proved not to have set a trap after all their chariots had been skirmishing briskly with rihwins horsemen but drew back when so much support for the riders made its appearance thereyou see fox aragis said more than a little complacently we will drive them back to cassat and once weve done that well drive them over the mountains and out of the northlands for good by the gods maybe we will gerin heard the bemusement in his own voice he wouldnt have believed it when the war began but he was starting to believe it now one more victory over the forces of the elabonian empire and he didnt see how the imperial forces could sustain themselves on this side of the high kirs any more of course we will aragis didnt seem to have any doubts aragis never seemed to have any doubts about anything maybe he didnt have doubts because he was right so often maybe he didnt have doubts because nobody dared tell him he was wrong which wasnt quite the same thing whats cassat like these days gerin asked i havent been through it since just after the empire closed off the high kirs you remember what a sad place it was then aragis said remember how it pretended to be the capital of a province that didnt want to have anything to do with it that i do gerin said dyaus only knows what the governor they d sent there had done to get himself shipped into exileno wait i remember it was something to do with getting an army chopped to pieces wasnt it whatever it was he hated everything that had anything to do with the northlands that wasnt quite true the imperial functionary had had quite a yen for elise so had gerin in those days shed disabused the governor with a knife to his throat disabusing gerin had taken longer and hurt worse by the time the job was through too didnt he though aragis said well like i say cassat was a sad place then and that was with traffic going over the mountains into the empire when the imperials closed the pass the place didnt have any reason for being at all what it reminds me of nowadays is a night ghost that wails because it isnt what it used to beit isnt much of anything just the remnant of something that was alive once upon a time gerin gave him a look out of the corner of his eye youd better be careful archer or youre going to end up writing poetry heh aragis said youre a funny fellow order those horsemen of yours forward again and well get on with this business the gods only know how much i want to get back to my own holdings without anybody to keep an eye on em the peasants are sure to be sitting around with their thumbs up their arses they cant sit idle all the time gerin said they have to eat this winter too they know it aye and theyll start thinking of that about two days before harvest time too aragis said meanwhile the weeding and the manuring wont have gone on half so well as they should instead of working theyll be swilling ale and screwing each others wives they might as well be barons the fox murmured van turned a snort into a cough in the nick of time dagrefs shoulders hunched as they would have done at the start of a laugh but he managed to hold it in what was that aragis said sharply never mind gerin told him you already think im too bloody lightminded where do we go from here after the imperials the archer replied without hesitation we bring them to battle wherever they will stand either in front of cassat or behind it we smash them and we run them back over the mountains if they want to come up into our country to trade well and good if they come here again with edged bronze in their hands well give them a new set of lumps and send them home again maybe we will gerin said as he had before listening to aragis made him believe it anyhow aragis certainly believed it we will he declared in such ringing tones that almost everyone within earshot turned his head toward him put your men on the left fox i shall put mine on the right well meet behind the imperials with the circle closed around them well make sure not many ever do get back over the high kirs to tell the tale he had perhaps automatically assigned himself the place of greater honor let it be as you say gerin answered honor mattered less to him and results more than to most of his fellows he was also pleased to see aragis coming up with a plan more sophisticated than the sort of headlong charge the trokmoi might have used he wondered if he should have been pleased to see the archer coming up with better plans even if they routed the forces of the elabonian empire they would still be left looking at each other across a border that made aragis acutely unhappy the more like an idiot aragis performed the happier the fox should have been and so he would have been but for the small detail that aragis ineptitude if any also endangered him he did find one question to put to the archer you dont want to start mixing your men and mine together more theyve fought two battles on the same side by now they should know they can trust one another against the imperials but aragis shook his head i dont want to change whats worked well already your men have brothers and cousins and friends fighting alongside them and so do mine theyll fight better in front of warriors they know and theyll fight better being certain in their bones the warriors close by them will come to their rescue if they get into trouble i think the archer has the right of it fox van said well maybe he does gerin allowed in fact i suppose he does his way the only place well have to worry about the kind of trouble he has in mind is at the join of the two armies just so aragis said besides while your men will obey me and mine will obey you each force will obey its own sovereign better less chance for treachery my way too i dont fear it not after these two fights but i dont care to leave myself open to it either gerin started to tell him he was being absurd but stopped with the words unspoken aragis wasnt being absurd he was being sensibly cautious now that gerin thought about it he didnt want to leave himself open to treachery from the archer either keeping his men together reduced the risk of it aragis saw him start to speak and then stop too the archer nodded as if gerin had proved his point in a way gerin had aragis said we are allies against a common danger not friends i do not see how we can be friends you and i once we drive the empire back south of the high kirs gerin began and then stopped again the two of them would have been rivals had the empire not cleared the passes through the mountains they would have been at war had the empire not done so hed thought as much only moments before if the empire left the northlands what would keep them from being at each others throats once more nothing he could see allies aragis repeated not friends so long as we remember it we should do well enough weve done well enough so far allies gerin agreed did he sound mournful or relieved even he couldnt tell were aragis his friend he might well sleep easier of nights on the other hand who could sleep easy knowing he was the sort of person able to make friends with aragis the archer that evening after the army encamped rihwin fell on his knees before gerin lord king i implore you let me taste of the blood of the sweet grape he cried what in the five hells do you think youre playing at rihwin get up for pitys sake gerin shook his head anyone would think i were a pretty little peasant wench you were trying to wheedle into bed truly lord king i suffer for lack of wine as i would suffer for lack of a friendly wenchs caresses rihwin replied as he climbed to his feet he winked at gerin and as truly i have wheedled a good many pretty peasant wenches into bed with just such words i dont doubt it for a moment gerin said they probably lie down with you just to make you shut up it could be rihwin admitted not a bit abashedbut then rihwin was seldom abashed i did not inquire as to why they did it i confess he gave gerin a sidelong look i would not inquire why you did it either lord king you have my solemn word gerin exhaled angrily to the crows with your solemn word you do know do you not that mavrix came visiting when ferdulf drank of the wine you captured of course you do i told you myself now i ask you again do you want to meet the god yes i do know that rihwin looked troubled i forgot where i heard it though and dismissed it as nothing more than camp gossip of course you did gerin snapped it wasnt what you wanted to hear so you bloody well ignored it you have a way of doing that with things you dont want to hear unfortunately it happens to be true one more time sirrah and answer me yea or nay if you please do you care to try conclusions with mavrix i dont care rihwin said hes taken my magic from me what more can he do short of taking my life and if he should take my life i shall die happy with the taste of wine on my lips its a better way to go than most i can think of that depends on what sort of end he feels like giving you but gerin threw his hands in the air all right by the gods go ahead and drink youve worn me downif i were a peasant girl id be taking off my skirt right now on your head be it though and i hope all your bastards are well provided for if you want to be a cursed foolif you insist on being a cursed fooli dont suppose i have the right to stand in your way rihwin seized his hand and kissed it gerin yanked it back with a startled oath rihwin said you are a prince among menno a king among men he winked will you not come and drink with me that we may greet mavrix together greeting mavrix was about the last thing gerin wanted to do nevertheless he said ill come with you all right if you think i trust you with wine while youre out of my sight youre even crazier than i think you areand that believe me would take some doing rail at me and insult me as much as you like so long as you don t stand between me and the blood of the sweet grape rihwin hurried away to return a moment later with his drinking jack which dripped i have rinsed it in the stream to remove whatever dregs of ale might have remained within good for you gerin said lets go lets get this over with the guards around the wine began to raise their swords to keep rihwin away from that which they protected gerin had given them very firm orders about that then the guards exclaimed in surprise seeing gerin stalking along behind him gerin countermanded the orders are you sure lord king one of the guards asked no im not sure gerin answered the only thing im sure of is that rihwin has wine where his wits ought to be and hes whined so much im going to let him drink some that will settle thatone way or another rihwin sniffed at gerins assessment of him he poured his jack full brought it up to his face and sniffed his expression grew blissful as he savored the bouquet truly i bless thee lord of the sweet grape he murmured he drank gerin waited for the sky to fall or at least for mavrix to appear in all his rather effeminate glory the sky did not fall mavrix did not appear nothing whatever out of the ordinary happened in fact rihwin tilted back his head so as to drain the last drop of wine from the jack he wiped his mouth on his sleeve a slightly puzzled expression stealing over his face well gerin demanded he looked around still no sign of mavrix rihwin kept on looking puzzled he stared down at the drinking jack as if it had somehow betrayed him its very fine lord king he said slowly in sooth i do prefer it to ale as i had been certain i should its very fine indeed as i say and yet his voice trailed off not so fine as you remember it eh gerin said no rihwin said in a small voice in my mind i had built up the idea of what it was like the idea of what it would be like and having gone without for so long i suppose i kept building it and building it until at the last i had erected a structure taller and wider than the foundation of truth would support and it just came crashing down on you gerin had not expected to find himself feeling sympathetic to rihwin any more than hed expected to find himself feeling sympathetic to ferdulf when the demigods encounter with his father failed to turn out as hed hoped but gerins friend seemed so uncharacteristically crestfallen he couldnt help himself rihwin let out a small sad sigh even so lord king have you ever wanted a beautiful woman who would not give herself to you your imaginings of what she would be like grow ever more heated until at last in them she puts to shame astis the goddess of love and if after that you do end up having her after all what do you find out gerin said you find out shes only another woman it has happened to you rihwin exclaimed not since i was very young gerin answered you always expect great things when youre very young he sent rihwin a pointed look most people get over it after a while so kindly rihwin murmured so generous so much like finding a wasp by thrusting your foot into the boot wherein it had chosen to pass the night well i shall have my revenge of course you will gerin said you come out with four times as many outrageous things as i do one of them is bound to skewer me before long but that was not the sort of revenge rihwin had in mind he filled the drinking jack with wine for a second time and instead of draining it himself pressed it into gerins startled hands here lord king you have gone without longer than i taste of the sweet grape and measure it against your memory curse you rihwin gerin muttered if he drank he was liable to draw mavrixs notice which was one of the last things he wanted to do but if he refused to drink he was liable to offend the sithonian god of wine which was another of the last things he wanted to do after a brief mental debate as to which was the worse risk he decided he had better drink i bless thee mavrix lord of the sweet grape he said in his seldomused sithonian and raised the jack to his lips the wine was sweet not sour like beer as rihwin had hed remembered that he did not think it was very good wine what army was in the habit of sending a fine vintage with its troopers but even if it had been good wine it would have been worth trading for but not worth ecstasies he said as much looking around warily again lest mavrix suddenly appear wherever the sithonian god chose to manifest himself he did not spring into being in the camp rihwin sighed again lord king i fear you have the right of it only wine what a sad thing to sayevery bit as sad i think as your only another woman maybe it is gerin said absently he kept looking this way and that waiting for mavrix to appear and do something appalling the god gave no sign of his presence gerin didnt know whether to be relieved or suspicious he ended up being both at once as if someone had shot an arrow at him from arms length and missed rihwin figured out what he was doing rihwin was not a fool no gerin shook his head rihwin was not stupidthere was a difference waiting for the lord of the sweet grape to come and turn us inside out he asked you deserve to be turned inside out gerin snapped he ran his tongue over his lips a few little drops of wine remained in his mustache their taste made him nervous all over again why rihwin said for thinking it would be safe and proving it for taking the chance gerin said the risk wasnt worth the reward you got yourself a jack of wine but you put your neck on the line to get it rather to gerins surprise that succeeded in embarrassing rihwin i thought the wine was worth my neck rihwin said perhapsi say only perhaps mind youi was wrong you got by with it gerin said i dont know that you deserved to get by with it but you did so let it go hearing rihwin admit he might have made a mistake made gerin back off a bit too and then rihwin said now that we know we may safely partake of the blood of the sweet grape what say we empty the wineskins as fast as we can to remove further danger what say we dont gerin answered dryly we dont know we can safely drink wine whenever we want all we do know is we got by with it once rihwin stuck out his tongue gerin ignored him and let out a long sigh and i dont think wed better get rid of all the wine whether by drinking it or any other way we may need to summon mavrix one day and wine is best for that he could hear the reluctance in his own voice but the words needed saying the reluctance got through to rihwin but so did the sense of what gerin said very well lord king let that be as you say my own craving having been slaked once shall not be so desperate as it has been till now heres hoping youre right gerin said but its liable to be as much in mavrixs hands as it is in yours rihwin gave him a horrified look he pretended not to see it and slapped his friend from south of the high kirs on the back lets get what rest we can i think we may fight in the morning they didnt fight the next morning nor the next afternoon either gerin began to wonder if the imperials were going to fall back not just to cassat but through it if that was so they might have given up on their efforts to reunite the northlands to the elabonian empire but then the morning after that rihwins riders came back to report that the imperial army was drawn up in battle array awaiting attack well give it to them aragis declared one more win and theyre gone for good he shouted orders for the advance do you think hes right father dagref asked as he steered the chariot out in front of the warriors who acknowledged gerin as their overlord as a matter of fact i do the fox answered beating an army once and seeing it keep its spiritthat can happen no doubt about it beating an army twice and seeing it keep its spiritwhen the imperials managed it that surprised me if we beat them three times running i dont see how they can keep from running themselves van nodded i think you have the right of it captain i dont suppose ive ever seen soldiers with so much discipline in all my days but discipline only takes a soldier so far if it keeps taking him into fights where he cant hope to win itll break like a dropped pot that does make good logical sense dagref looked back over his shoulder at gerin havent you tried to thump it into my head that battles dont always make good logical sense i think i ought to thump your head on the principle of the thing gerin said keep your attention on where weve going if you please not on where weve been out ahead of the chariots and out wide of them as well rode rihwins horsemen among them was maeva who found sitting a horse easier than walking around gerin almost mentioned her to dagref because that would have made sure his son looked ahead at all times he refrained though not wanting to remind van that maeva was in the fight and had already been hurt once above and ahead of the army of the northlands flew ferdulf the demigod had been subdued since meeting his father he seemed exuberant enough now though stabbing out his hand to show the position of the imperial army and then making several lewd gestures in the direction of the men from south of the high kirs gerins troopers whooped the fox saw the army of the elabonian empire a couple of minutes later he nodded in reluctant admiration the imperials looked as steady now as they had at the first clash theyd lost more men than gerin and aragis had having started with an army about the same size as that of the northlands they were now at a disadvantage they didn t seem worried though as soon as they spied their foes chariotry they began their war cry elabon elabon elabon gerin the men from the northlands shouted and aragis and anything else they could think of the trokmoi who rode with the fox let out a chorus of yips and yowls that might have burst from the throats of wolves maybe those howls were what made dagref say we sound like an army of barbarians and the imperials sound like civilized men gerin asked his son nodded the fox said well maybe they are but ill tell you this a civilized man doesnt smell any better four days dead than a trokm with mustachios that droop down to his collarbones thats a fact van agreed and another fact is youll die just as dead from a civilized mans sword as from a barbariansif the silly bugger knows what to do with it of course also true gerin said he raised his voice to ask dagref what do you think of these new horses they were still using the team from the imperial chariot onto which theyd forced themselves during the most recent fight dagref answered they havent the endurance of the beasts we brought down from fox keepthats certain but i do think they may run faster for a short burst that could prove useful theyre easiertempered beasts than the ponies we had which is pleasant the fox grunted if anything his son had told him more than hed wanted to know that was typical of dagref he loved detail and assumed everyone else did too with gerin that assumption was usually good now though he had too much on his mind to want a whole lot more rattling around in there elabon elabon elabon the drivers of the imperial chariots cracked their whips above the backs of their mounts and sent them bounding toward the men of the northlands gerin admired their spirit in the same sort of way in which he admired the courage of the trokmoi which is to say he admired it without seeing that it made much sense theyd been beaten twice what on earth made them think the result would be any different this time especially since they were now outnumbered whatever it was here they came arrows flew toward gerin and his followers some of his men began shooting back even if they were out of range hed told them not to do that but not everybody thought when he fought nocking an arrow gerin waited for a good target to present itself the imperial officers still persisted in wearing fancy gear to let their men see at a glance who they were that that also let their foes see at a glance who they were never seemed to enter their heads gerin sent two of them tumbling out of their chariots one right after the other men and horses on both sides went down one imperial chariot came to grief in front of another which collided with it and came to grief too along with looking for officers gerin sent shafts at drivers and at horses that last wasnt sporting and he knew it he didnt care if the horses went down the chariots couldnt roll order and discipline didnt hold long once the chariots were in among one another the tactics of the captains on either side didnt matter much it was a melee everyone smashing away at whoever was close by and happened to be shouting the wrong battle cry gerin tried to do something about that yelling for some of his troopers to overlap the end of the imperial line the imperials stretched too and didnt stretch so thin as to let him shatter them his mouth twisted this didnt look like a day on which anything would come easy then ferdulf dived down to horrify the horses of an imperial chariot they ran so wild dagref had to steer smartly to escape a collision van speared the driver out of the enemy car which meant it would keep right on going wild dagref was no demigod but he could also make himself unloved by the imperials horses his lash made them scream and turn aside from the chariot he drove one of the drivers who fought for the elabonian empire drew back his arm to do likewise to the team dagref drove before he could snap the whip gerin shot him in the shoulder he howled and cursed and dropped the whip but somehow managed to hang on to the reins that made gerin curse in turn how are we doing van shouted he looked as if he was doing pretty well for himself his face wore a fierce grin blood trails dripped down the shaft from his long leafshaped bronze spearhead no blood dripped from him doing well i think gerin answered he looked around the imperials are having to bend back to keep us from getting around behind them so their line is a bow nowit isnt a line any more and you can bend a bow only so far after that it snaps aye van peered toward the other wing aragis men seem to be giving the southerners a hard time too say what you will about that fellow the men he leads can fight ive never doubted that gerin said he wouldnt be dangerous to me if he werent dangerous to everyone else who got in his way too he hesitated then admitted i suppose i have to say i didnt expect him to be as dangerous as he is dagref said if he happened to suffer an unfortunate accident just at the moment when the imperials were routed and running for the high kirs i dont think my heart would break neither would mine gerin said then a bit slower than he should have he realized what else his son had been saying if aragis has an unfortunate accident it wont be on account of me all right dagref said equably gerin stared at his sons back the youth could indeed be formidable to everyone around him when he grew up as a matter of fact he was already formidable to everyone around him you keep your eyes open fox van said because i dont think aragis heart would break if you had an unfortunate accident along about the time the imperials were hightailing it for the mountains either and aragis doesnt believe in live and let live not even a little bit gerin could hardly argue with that aragis had about as much forbearance in him as a pike swimming in the niffet any other fish he saw was either his size bigger or breakfast but the fox replied i didnt get to be as old as i am by closing my eyes you know oh yes i do know that van said but if you want to keep on getting older dont shut em now instead of shutting his eyes gerin used them to gape at ferdulf whizzing around the battlefield stirring up chaos in the ranks of the imperials he flew untroubled whatever magics the wizards from the sorcerers collegium were using to try to bring him down they werent working not today and because they werent working the little demigod was making life miserable for the men from south of the high kirs life or at least the battle was pretty miserable for them anyhow gerin and aragis men did not beat them easily but beat them they did both ends of the imperial line bent back and back now gerin began thinking aragis dream would come to pass if his own men met the archers behind the imperials precious few soldiers would have the chance to get back over the mountains and let crebbig i know what had happened to them the officers of the empire realized as much their shouts grew ever more urgent and desperate gerin shouted too press them hard dont let them have a moments breather if we smash them here theyre ruined for good press them press them the men of the northlands did the imperials fought hard but though they managed to press forward here and there overall kept going back and back three arrows one of them gerins hit an officer who was rallying them they all struck within heartbeats of one another the fox was by no means sure his smote first van whooped as he watched the imperial topple from his car hes hit so many times he doesnt even know which way to fall the poor sod youve got your troopers thinking the same way you do captain anyone who cant see that an able officer needs killing is probably too stupid to go on breathing let alone be worth anything in a fight gerin answered with a shrug dagref said it would be a wonder father if your followers havent learned something from you as long as youve been leading them van whooped again have you ever been called old more politely fox thats not what i dagref began never mind i know what you meant his father said i also know van was trying to rattle you not me because he knows youre the easier mark i deny everything van said there dagref was triumphant even van sounds a bit like you father and ill bet he didnt before he came to fox keep that was true van and gerin had remarked on it too neither of them remarked on it now perhaps for fear of making dagref even more insufferable about his own cleverness than he was already then shouts came from the far rear of the bending imperial line gerin leaned forward trying to make out what they were a moment later he let out a shout of his own our men and aragis have joined hands weve got em in the barrelnow we pound em flat his men shouted too as they realized theyd surrounded the army of the elabonian empire most of the shouts were threats aimed at the imperials but the men from south of the high kirs stolidly fought on doing their foes as much harm as they could i think theyre too stupid to know how badly beaten they are van said you could be right gerin allowed if you are though its not the worst way for a soldier to be ferdulf kept on flying above the imperials and diving down to dismay them as before arrows refused to strike him he rose on high and dove rose on high and dove then he rose and instead of diving on the imperials flew straight to gerin watch out the little demigod shouted pointing to the southwest watch out what is it gerin demanded wishing ferdulf had been more specific and then when ferdulf was specific the fox wished he hadnt been theres another imperial army as big as this one or maybe bigger heading straight for us were going to get smashed like a bug between two rocks in remarkably selfpossessed tones dagref said well now we know why the imperials who are already here didnt panic when we surrounded them dont we gerin agreed sourly unlike aragis the general in command of the elabonian empires newly reinforced forces was capable of real strategy hed set out this tempting army here certain the men of the northlands would leap on it like a starving longtooth and the men of the northlands had leapedand now they were going to pay for it ferdulf hovered in front of gerins face like the gadfly he was what are you going to do he screeched what are we going to do were going to get licked thats what were going to do van said ferdulf screeched again this time wordlessly hes right of course gerin said which made ferdulf screech at him ignoring the racket the fox went on only question left now is how badly we get licked ferdulf go tell aragis what you just told me hes on the right hell get hammered harder than my troopers will i dont want to talk to aragis ferdulf stuck out his lower lip hes nasty go talk to aragis gerin shouted ferdulf flew off gerin hoped he flew off in obedience rather than in a fit of the sulks but wouldnt have bet anything he minded losing on it we ought to pull back now dagref said i know but we cant gerin grimaced if we save ourselves like that we leave aragis in the lurch why shouldnt we dagref asked hed do it to us mm i think not not here gerin answered if he goes under altogether or if i do that leaves the other one to face the whole weight of the empire by himself that doesnt strike me as something i want to do well maybe dagref said grudgingly gerin didnt find out whether ferdulf told the archer the second imperial army was on the way it mattered little aragis could not have remained in doubt very much longer the new cry of elabon elabon elabon pierced the rest of the battlefield noise like a knifeblade piercing flesh elabon elabon elabon the surrounded imperials answered the war cry with one of their own as soon as he realized he was trapped rather than trapper aragis pulled away from the battle without the slightest concern for what that might do to gerin the fox was less infuriated at finding his prediction wrong than he would have been otherwise for aragis was the one stuck between the two imperial forces most of the pressure fell on him gerin was able to break off his part of the fight without too much trouble and then having broken off he ordered his troopers forward in one last charge against the imperial force he and aragis had lately surrounded that made those imperials turn aside from their assault on the archer to repel him van sighed helping aragis get loose are you see any better ideas gerin asked the outlander sighed again no but i wish i did youre hurting yourself while youre helping him dont remind me gerin stared across the field aragis did seem to be pulling back not being surroundedthe fate he and gerin and inflicted though not for long enough on the first army from south of the high kirs seeing that aragis men would not be immediately cut off and destroyed satisfied the fox that hed done his duty by his ally now back he shouted now we get away he didnt know how hard the imperials would press his retreating force they had the numbers now to press him and aragis at the same time if they so chose the lunge they made after his men turned out to be halfhearted for one thing they remained intent on trying to break aragis against whom they could bring more warriors to bear than against gerin for another most of rihwins horsemenas many as were ablefell back on gerins force rather than on aragis the imperial chariotry had greatperhaps even exaggeratedrespect for the riders whose feints and countercharges looked to intimidate them and keep them from pressing harder than they did rihwin himself rode back to gerin with an anxious expression on his face i pray the wine is safe lord king he said its not the biggest thing on my mind right now gerin said in lieu of getting down from the chariot to find a rock with which to hit rihwin in the head im more worried about everything else the supply wagons carried most of them were on aragis side of the field without journeybread and sausage and cheese and whatnot were going to have to start foraging all over the countryside if we want to stay alive wine is also important rihwin insisted it being our best conduit as you yourself said to hope and beg for divine aid from mavrix not a good hope gerin said but the comment held enough sense to keep him from again wishing to clout his fellow fox he sighed all right rihwin have it your way i hope the wine is safe too now let me get back to running this retreat if you please rihwin sketched a salute lord king i obey his eyes twinkled when i feel like it i obey he rode off before gerin could find an answer the one thing of which the fox was glad was that his men still showed fight that let him conduct the sort of retreat the imperials had made before a retreat with teeth in it his lines werent so neat as the ones the men from the elabonian empire had maintained but they werent pushing him so hard as hed pushed them that evened things out as the imperials had broken free of his pursuit so his army broke free of theirs where now van asked what now those were indeed the relevant questions gerin took the second one first not because he had an answer but because he didnt i havent the faintest notion of what now except to get away in the best way we can so the imperials still have to do some fighting after the battle we just lost have to see what sort of shape were in have to see what sort of shape aragis men are in have to see if the empire lets us rejoin them maybe i stop being a king and go back to being a baron would you do that father dagref asked some concern in his voice if gerin was not a king dagref never would be i might if i didnt think the empire would nail me to a cross for taking a title they say i have no right to the fox replied being a kingby the gods even being a baronnever meant all that much to me of itself the best part of it always has been that its given me the power i need to make people leave me and mine alone but i don t think his usurping majesty crebbig i will want anyone around whos dared defy his glory and so im better off to keep on fighting thats the way of it van agreed you keep standing till they knock you down and you cant get up any more he looked around we ll be on our feet again before too long nowthe other question i put to you where now northeast the way were going gerin replied without hesitation with all these big villages that are almost little towns around the farmers down here are plainly growing more than they can eat by themselves if we have to forage off the countryside lets forage off countryside thatll give us enough to be worth taking makes sense to me the outlander said besides gerin said even if i dont know whats happened to most of our supply wagons i saw taverns in some of those towns tonight im going to drink something better than water not enough better if you listen to rihwin van said if you listen to rihwin youll hear any number of things that arent so gerin said youll hear any number of things that may be so but probably arent youll hear any number of things that are so but dont matter at the moment and i dont deny youll hear some things that do matter but winnowing the grain from the chaff is often more trouble than its worth you have the right of that van rumbled laughter then his heavyfeatured face grew bleak ive not seen maeva since the fighting started have you set eyes on her captain no gerin answered he did not like the way van looked at himit was as if the outlander were measuring him for a grave but then dagref said shes in the retreat with the rest of us i saw her off on what would have been our left when we were facing the imperial army i suppose its our right now that weve turned our backs on them she must have been one of the riders who got farthest around the flank of the first imperial force before the other one made us break off ah thats good to hear van said and his features cleared sounds like your child too to be at the fore of the fighting gerin said also more than a little relieved it does doesnt it now van looked proud and puzzled at the same time who would have thought a girl child would take after me so though i never did not for a moment dagref looked back over his shoulder if you dont mind my saying so you should have shes been practicing with bow and sword and spear since shes been big enough to hold them in her hands shes kept working with them too to get to be as good as she is why would she do all that if she didnt intend to use them in war one day when you ask it that way lad i have no good answer for you the outlander said with a sigh i thought it was a childish thing in her i suppose and that she would put it aside when she turned into a woman and take up the things of a woman instead that didnt happen dagref said if youd been paying attention youd have noticed shes been a woman for a year and she hasnt come close to putting aside her practice shes worked harder than ever as a matter of fact has she vans tone was surprised not so much at the news perhaps as at how emphatically dagref gave it to him youve been paying close attention havent you well of course i have dagref answered ive been practicing a good deal myself you know if i didnt notice what people did around me i wouldnt be much use to anyone would i van grunted and subsided perhaps he was even convinced dagref had spoken most convincingly he might even have believed what he was saying himself over the years gerin had seen a great many people talk themselves into believing what wasnt so thoughtfully the fox shook his head he was of the opinion that dagref was concealing from van rather than deluding himself he was also of the opinion that dagref had made special note of maeva practicing because she was maeva not because she was practicing hed also caught maeva noticing dagref which made life less than dull the sun sank toward the western horizon the imperials stopped harassing gerins rear guard and drew back he hadnt thought they would do anything else but he hadnt thought they would bring a second army over the high kirs either if aragis had been generous instead of greedy and given the fox the right instead of the left the archer would have had the easier retreat and gerin would have had to contend with two forces at once he wondered if aragis was thinking the same thing at the moment up ahead sat one of those notquitetowns common here close to the high kirs gerin ordered his men to encamp a couple of bowshots from it he wasnt worried about feeding them not tonight most of them would have bread or sausage or something on their persons and those who didnt would be able to get something he did need some sort of sacrifice against the night ghosts though he walked up toward the village dagref at his side van stayed behind to talk with maeva whod come through unhurt dagref had wanted to do that too but vans presence persuaded him to take himself elsewhere when gerin got to the village he wondered if anyone would be there at all his army had passed nearby on the way south and so had the imperials before them to his relief he found that if the inhabitants had fled as warriors briefly approached the place they were back now they were also willing he discovered to sell him a couple of sheep how did you keep somebody from stealing them he asked oh we managed answered the man who had them three words summed up generations of dealing with nobles and warriors always being the weaker but somehow getting through admiring that resilience gerin said well come to the tavern and have a jack of ale with my son and me ill take you up on that the villager said he led the fox and dagref into the tavern which wasnt too clean but likewise wasnt too dirty three ales he told the woman who looked to be in charge of the place he pointed to gerin this fellow here is doing the buying she nodded and filled three jacks she was somewhere in early middle age brown hairbeginning to go graypulled back from her pale face and tied behind her in the growing gloom inside the tavern gerin couldnt make out what color her eyes were she carried the jacks over to the table where he his son and the villager sat she didnt set them down till the fox put money on the table then she nodded and said here you are gerins head came up so suddenly that dagref and the villager stared he knew her voice her eyes were green he still could not see them but he knew hoarsely he spoke her name elise back next contents viii she set the tarredleather drinking jacks on the table very slowly and carefully as if they were cut rock crystal that might shatter at a touch gerin felt as if he might shatter at a touch too here whats this the villager said the two of you know each other how in the five hells do you know each other we manage gerin said his voice still ragged dagrefs eyes were wide as rounds of flatbread aye we do elise sounded as much taken aback as the fox did turning to him she said i didnt know your face i didnt know who you were till i heard you speak nor i you he answered he scratched at his beard he knew how gray it was its been a long long time yes she looked from him to dagref and back again slowly some small question in her voice she said surely this isnt duren he would be older youre right gerin nodded this is dagref my older son by selatre my wife since a few years after you you left did you know that duren is lord of the holding that belonged to your father elise shook her head which meant she was hearing of the death of her father ricolf the red for the first time no i didnt know she answered news moves slowly when it moves at all how long how five years ago now the fox answered a fit of apoplexy from everything i heard it was as easy as such things can be duren has the holding firmly in his hands these days does he elise still looked dazed she had plenty to be dazed about gerin was feeling dazed too he also felt as if hed tumbled twenty years back through time into a part of his life long closed off from that in which he was living now and had been since hed found selatre the villager whod come into the tavern with gerin and dagref gulped his ale well id best be off he said and got up from his stool and hurried out into the sunset dagref by contrast stared in fascination from gerin to elise and back again the fox thought his sons ears curled forward to hear the better but that might have been his imagination he hoped it was quietly he said son why dont you take the sheep back to the camp so theyre sacrificed before the sun goes down but dagref began he stopped then tried again but i want to then he realized that what gerin had phrased as a polite request was in fact an order and one that brooked no contradiction the glare gerin sent his way helped him realize that regretfully resentfully sulkily and very very slowly he did as his father bade him elises laugh was nervous he wanted to hear everything she said of course he did gerin said and once hed heard it hed know it all and be able to give back any piece of it you wanted as near word for word as makes no difference hed even understand most of it he takes after you elise murmured by her tone she didnt altogether intend that as a compliment gerin started to get angry before he let the anger show he saw that half of itmaybe more than half of it no certainly more than half of itwas all the things he hadnt been able to say since shed disappeared now trying to crawl out of his throat at once with an effort he crammed them back how have you been he asked a question that seemed unlikely to throw oil on the fire how do i look she answered everything she said seemed to have a bitter edge to it as if youve seen hard times gerin said she laughed again what do you know of hard times youve always been a baron in a keep or a prince or a king your bellys been full people do what you tell them to do even your son does what you tell him to do and who says the gods no longer give us as many miracles as wed like gerin said once a long time before his sarcasm had amused her now she just tossed her head waiting for him to say something of consequence holding back the anger was harder with an edge in his own voice he said im sorry its been hard for you it didnt have to be you know you could could what elise broke in could have stayed that would have been harder yet why do you think i left my best guess always was that you left because you got bored and wanted something new and didnt much care what it was gerin answered as long as it was new that would suit you you were the prince of the north elise said you were having a fine time being the prince of the northsuch a fine time you forgot all about me i was good enough for a brood mare and that was that one side of gerins mouth twisted in what was not a smile i needed to do everything i did you know if i hadnt done what i did odds are neither one of us would be here hashing this out now the trokmoi would have swallowed up a lot more land than they did thats likely so elise nodded i never said you werent good at what you did i just said you paid more attention to it than you did to meexcept when you wanted to take me to bed of course and you didnt pay all that much attention to me then not fair he said he hadnt seen her for twenty years and yet she knew how to get under his skin as if theyd never been apart i never looked anywhere else i never wanted to look anywhere else of course not elise said why would you i was handy come here elise take off your skirt it wasnt like that gerin insisted oh but it was she said they glared at each other gerin was convinced he remembered things just as theyd been elise obviously was as convinced her memory was straight and his crooked he had no records not for something like that he sighed its done its over you made sure it would be over have you been happier since than you would have been if youd stayed with me i hope so for your sake decent of you to say so though talk is cheap ive seen how cheap talk is over the years she pursed her lips have i been happier than i would have been if id stayed behind every once in a while much happier all together i doubt it the answer held a certain bleak honesty gerin sighed again he was tempted to walk out walk back to the encampment and spend the rest of his life pretending hed never run into the woman whod borne his oldest son but that thought brought up another one one he needed to ask about for durens sake do you have any other children i had two both girls she answered and then looked down at the ground neither one of them lived to be two years old im sorry gerin said so am i she said even more bleakly than before when she raised her head once more unshed tears glittered in her eyes you know you take a chance loving them but you cant help it no you cant gerin said ive had three since who lived we lost one youve been lucky elise said soberly she studied him for a moment then repeated herself in a different tone of voice youve been lucky yes of course i have he replied ive been steady too he could see she didnt understand what he was talking about when hed known her shed been ready to turn her world upside down at a moments notice that was how the two of them had come together he doubted shed changed much since that made her steady in an unsteady way youve been lucky she said yet again you sound as if you were even lucky enough to find a woman whose temper matches yours i didnt think there was any such creature you threw me aside he said of course you wouldnt think anyone else might want me thats not elise paused she was relentlessly honest well maybe it is true but not all true however you like gerin shrugged he could feel how tight a grip he had on his temper it struggled and writhed in that grip too the way van did when they wrestled together as the fox did with van he felt it liable to escape at any moment to try to hold it in check he asked did you find a man who matched your temper several of them she answered given how steadily changeable she was that saddened the fox a little but didnt surprise him elise scowled the latest one threw me over the son of a whore for a woman who couldnt have been more than half his age if he hadnt left this place in a hurry id have slit his throat for him or maybe slit him somewhere else she sounded like fand gerin thought she would have done it if shed got the chance as fand would have he asked how is what this fellow did to you any different from what you did to me he probably shouldnt have said that he realized as much as soon as the words were out of his mouth which was of course too late elise had been scowling at the latest man to disappear from her life now she scowled at gerin i never pretended prillon didnt exist i never pretended you didnt exist gerin returned ha elise tossed her head the tone flayed meat from the foxs bones he hadnt had that tone aimed at him in a long time she went on no one is so blind as the person who thinks he sees everything thats true gerin agreed he saw that she was applying it to him she had not a clue that it also applied to her even after his remark she didnt apply her own comment to herself the fox shrugged he hadnt expected that she would not really it hardly seems fair she said ive struggled all this time and what have i to show for it nothing to speak of and youyouve just gone on and on and on you were the one who left gerin answered with yet another shrug i didnt put you on a boat in the middle of the niffet and heave you over the side i would have he broke off he wouldnt have been happier had she stayed for a little while he might have been over the long haul of years he was happier the way things had turned out her mouth tightened she must have realized what hed been about to say and why he hadnt said it you may as well go she said theres nothing left at all is there no he answered even if that wasnt quite true the thing that had been dead inside him for twenty years stirred like a ghost at sunset but even ghosts drawn by the boon of blood that tried to give good advice only howled unintelligibly like the wind a man who listened to the wind instead of his own mind and heart deserved to be called a fool gerin pretended not to hear this ghost too would you like another jack of ale elise asked with brittle politeness thank you no hed seldom been so tempted to drink till he couldnt see he thought for a moment then said if you like ill send a messenger up to duren to ask if he wants you to come stay at the keep that was your fathers its durens through me elise said angrily why shouldnt i simply go and stay there if i so choose gerin ticked off points on his fingers item i am not the lord of that holding duren is item i do nothing to take a hand in his affairs without his leave item you left fox keep when he was barely able to toddle why are you sure hed want to see you now i am his mother elise said as if to a halfwit gerin shrugged her eyes blazed i remember why i left fox keep too you are the most coldblooded man the gods ever set on the face of the earth gerin shrugged again that made elise angrier to the five hells with you she snapped what would happen if i left on my own and traveled to my fathers holdingmy sons holdingby myself she would put herself in danger traveling alone after the life shed lived she had to know that after the life shed lived she also had to be good at coming through danger and she might find herself in danger if she stayed here too the imperials are liable to be coming through this place in a few days he warned im not afraid of them elise answered i have kin south of the high kirs too you know so you do gerin said if they happen to feel like it i suppose the imperials could give you an escort to the country south of the mountainsmaybe even down to the city of elabon his voice held a sardonic bite elise though chose to take him seriously maybe they would she said why shouldnt they im kin to nobles close to the emperor nobles close to the man who had been the emperor gerin thought how they stand with crebbig i is anyones guess how glad theyll be to see you is anyones guess too they werent very glad when you came calling on them before the werenight he didnt get the chance to say any of those things before he could elise went on and then id be living in the capital of the elabonian empire and youd be stuck here in the northlands how would you like that she was gloating loving the idea she knew how hed longed for the life of the city of elabon when hed been together with her he still longed for it but the longing wasnt a vital part of him any more even if it did stir in his heart now and again like her it had become a piece of his past and he was satisfied to leave it so he said ive spent most of the time since you left me trying to make the northlands into the sort of place where i might want to live up around fox keep i havent done too badly im happy enough to stay where i am if youd sooner go down to the city of elabon go ahead elise glared at him that wasnt the answer he was supposed to give nor the way he was supposed to respond he was supposed to get angry to shout and act jealous elise didnt quite know what to do when he failed to perform as expected he got to his feet im going to go if you like i will send a messenger up to duren i owe you so much at least if you want me to perhaps youd better come along with me he didnt like that not even a little but saw no other choice the gods only know what sort of shape this village will be in after the imperials come through here the only woman in among your army she said coldly no thank you no indeed you wouldnt be the only woman the fox answered vans daughter maeva is along riding a horse under rihwins command that startled elise she could fight gerin knew as much shed never dreamt of making a life of soldiering though after a moment her eyes went hard again no thank you she repeated id sooner take my chances with the elabonian empire have it your way gerin said you were always bound and determined to do that anyhow werent you me elise exclaimed what about you you know what the trouble is the fox said sadly the trouble is were both right thats probably one of the things that helped split us apart elise shook her head dont blame me for that you did it however you like gerin sighed goodbye elise i dont wish you ill if youre still here after we drive the imperials out of the northlands think again about finding out whether duren wants to see you maybe ill ask the imperials to take me up to his holdingmy holding she said theyre going forward youre not his face froze goodbye elise he said again and left the tavern at the edge of the village he looked back over his shoulder she was not standing in the doorway watching him go he hadnt really expected she would be captain why in the five hells arent you getting drunk van demanded something horrible like that happened to me i wouldnt be able to turn both eyes in the same direction for the next three four days when i first set eyes on her i thought that was just what i was going to do the fox answered but do you know what its been so long shes not important enough to me for me to want to do that vans eyes got wide that may be the saddest thing anybody ever said gerin thought about it i dont know not getting over her in all this time would be worse dont you think shes not much like mother is she dagref spoke very slowly picking his words with obvious care he didnt want to offend the fox who had after all fathered his halfbrother on elise but he also didnt want to speak well of her he balanced the one and the other better than most youths his age could have done gerin considered the question as carefully as dagref had asked it some ways yes some ways no he replied at last shes a very bright woman the same as your mother is but i dont think elise is ever happy with what she has if its not perfect its not good enough for her thats foolish dagref said van guffawed this from the lad who if you tell a dirty story twice and say the whore was awkward the first time and then that she was clumsy the next will call you on the difference then and there dagref had the grace to blush or perhaps the embers got a little more ruddy he said actually i think you called her stumblefooted the first time i heard that story didnt you stumblefooted i never van broke off and glared at dagref youre having me on do you know what i do to people who try having me on something dreadful and appalling or you wouldnt be telling me about it dagref returned unabashed what are we going to do about him fox van said to the five hells with me if i know gerin answered the way i look at it its the worlds lookout as much as dagrefs the way i look at it youre right van said dagref didnt rise to that as he might have a couple of years before nor did he let himself be diverted asking if shes different from my mother why did you marry her it seemed like a good idea at the time the fox replied dagref folded his arms across his chest not about to let an answer like that be fobbed off on him it was a pose gerin had assumed many times with larcenous peasants stubborn nobles and his own children having it aimed at him made him chuckle in spite of everything he said you cant always know ahead of time how youll get along with somebody you cant always know ahead of time if youll get along with somebody thats so van agreed take a look at fand and me oh nonsense gerin said glad to be talking about someone else s marriage instead of his own you knew perfectly well that you and fand didnt get along aye true enough the outlanders grin was on the sheepish side but we make a sport of fighting if you know what i mean most of the time we make a sport of fighting i should say some of it now some of it turns real i dont understand dagref turned to gerin why would you want to fight with someone you love someone youre living with why are you asking me the fox said i dont want to do that he does he pointed at van its the first time ive ever heard him say so out loud though to the crows with you van spoke without much rancor you want so much peace and quiet fox you want life to be dull all the bloody time no gerin shook his head this was an old argument and one in which he could take part without bruising i just dont want life to blow up in my face the way a pot of bean stew will if you leave it in the fire with the lid on too tight for too long sometimes life does blow up in your face though dagref said a truth as selfevident as any at the moment what are you going to do about this woman again he took a little thought to find the phrase he wanted nothing gerin replied which made both dagref and van stare at him he went on i wont send her up to duren without finding out whether he wants to have anything to do with her i offered to bring her along with the army so shed find out as soon as i did whether he wants her to come up to his holding but she said no to that van coughed if she hangs around here she wont know for a goodish while what duren has to say because the imperials arent going to stop following us theyll be here day after tomorrow at the latest i dont think that was the biggest worry in her mind gerin answered she has relatives south of the high kirs youve met one of themremember aye now that you remind me of it some sort of fancy noble gave the emperor advice van frowned in concentration valdabrunthats what his name was he had a mistress i wouldnt have minded tasting at all thats the name gerin agreed now me id forgotten about his leman till you called her to my mind you were too busy staring at elise to have much room left in your mind for other women the outlander said gerin would have got angry at him had he not been telling the truth dagref said if her family were advisors to the old emperor what does this new emperor think of them i dont know gerin answered that also crossed my mind i don t think it crossed elises and by then i wasnt going to bring it up if she goes south of the high kirs shes gone thats all i wont miss her not a bit and that was true or almost true hed missed her more than hed imagined possible back in the days just after she first left him occasional echoes of that feeling had kept cropping up through the years even after hed been happily yoked to selatre for a long time was one of those echoes cropping up now if it was he didnt intend to admit it even to himself he waited for van or dagref to challenge him van after all had known elise while dagref had few compunctions about asking questions no matter how personal but neither of them said anything he realized neither of them was going to say anything a small sigh of relief escaped him theyd let him off the hook ferdulf flying above them gerins men rolled north through the village the next morning the fox wondered if elise would come out and watch them go as some of the villagers did he didnt see her once hed passed through he decided that was just as well now instead of screening the armys advance rihwins riders covered the retreat they did a better job of that than gerin had thought when he gave them the duty rihwin came trotting up to him to report the imperials keep dogging us aye lord king but not very hard weve taught them respect i think for they are never sure if we might gallop out at them from some unexpected direction thats good gerin said if wed taught them so much respect that they stopped dogging us altogether that would be even better it would also be too much to ask for rihwin pointed out oh i wasnt asking for it gerin said if i did no one would pay me any attention but it would be better eryes rihwin said and soon found an excuse to rejoin his riders van chuckled that was well done captain not easy to confuse rihwinnot least i expect on account of hes so often confused on his ownbut you managed the outlander lost his smile have to tell you though im a bit on the confused side myself what are we doing now and why are we doing that instead of something else what are we doing the fox repeated were falling backthats what why are we doing it i can think of three reasons offhand he ticked them off on his fingers if we dont fall back the imperials will smash us here thats one if we do fall back maybe the imperials will string themselves out or give us some chance to hit part of them from ambush thats two and as were falling back we re falling back into country that hasnt been foraged too heavily so we wont starve which we would and pretty bloody quick if we stay where we are three aye well there is that van looked around falling back toward land aragis rules if were not on that land already dont know how happy hell be if we take everything that isnt tied down and cut the lashings off what is tied down so we can take that too gerin looked around to the five hells with me if i know where aragis southern border is maybe well find boundary stones maybe we wont to the five hells with me if i care either if aragis thinks im going to starve to death to keep from bothering his serfs precious crops to the five hells with him too over his shoulder dagref said if the threat lay by the niffet hed eat you out of house and home without a second thought well the gods know thats true gerin said now he looked straight ahead north and a little east a thoughtful expression on his face ikos is just on the other side of aragis holdings too i ve never had cause to go to the sibyl by the southern route but maybe i will he nodded more decisively than hed thought he would yes indeed maybe i will dagref said in the learned genealogies they say biton is a son of dyaus allfather but gerin held up his hand but thats elabonians writing for elabonians below the high kirs he finished biton is truly a god of this land here and everyone who lives in the northlands knows it even so dagref said compared to the gods of the gradi baivers god of brewing and barley is a god of this land even though we elabonians brought him here a couple of hundred years ago when we conquered this province because he is a god of this land you were able to use him against the gods of the gradi from that it would follow logically that i might use biton against the elabonian empire gerin interrupted once more yes i thought you might not have seen it dagref said a little sulkily well i did gerin clapped his son on the back dont let it worry you the two of us think a lot alike youre both sneaky van put in thank you gerin and dagref said in the same breath which made the outlander stare from one of them to the other gerin continued as i was saying before we were disturbed by a breath of wind there honh van said the two of us think a lot alike but ive been doing it longer so its likely ill come up with a lot of the same notions you do gerin went on imperturbably that shouldnt disappoint you and it shouldnt stop you from telling me whats on your beady little mind honh now dagref interrupted doing a surprisingly good impression of van gerin talked through him as hed talked through the outlander because you never can tell you might come up with something ive missed he took a deep breath triumphant at finally managing to complete his thought fair enough father dagref heaved his shoulders up and down in a sigh hard sometimes being a smaller less detailed copy of the man youve already become it makes me feel rather like an abridged manuscript no not an abridged one gerin said you just have a lot more blank parchment left at the end of your scroll than i do thats all hmm dagref contemplated that well all rightmaybe so he flicked the reins and urged the horses up to a better pace by the things youve said fox i know what the difference between you and him is van remarked tell me gerin urged dagrefs back expressed mute interest i will van said the difference is fox that your father had no more idea what to do with you than a crow would with a chick that came out of the egg with white feathers instead of black is that so or am i lying its so sure enough gerin agreed my brother was a warrior born everything my father could have wanted my father hadnt the slightest notion what to make of me i might be the first real live scholar spawned in the northlands in better than a hundred years and yet youre a king while your father died a baron so you never can tell van said but my point is dagrefs the second real live scholar spawned in the northlands you have a notion of what you ve got there while your father had never a clue with you ah gerin said well theres some truth in that sure enough how about it dagref do you like it better that i can guess along with you some of the time or would you rather i had never a clue dagref looked back over his shoulder at the fox again i can guess along with you some of the time father what in the world makes you think you can guess along with me van guffawed gerin felt his ears heat riders and charioteers fanned out through the countryside around the village by which gerin had chosen to camp for the night they brought back cattle and sheep and ducks and chickens had to let the air out of a shepherd before hed cough up his beasts one rider said patting his bow so as to leave no possible doubt about what he meant under other circumstances gerin would have been angry at him for alienating the peasantry as things were the fox hardly noticed the comment he had his sword in his left hand and was wondering if hed have to start carving chunks off the village headman who was doing his best to act like an idiot from birth no the fellow said we dont have no grain stored in pits we dont have no beans in pits neither thats very interesting gerin said very interesting indeed i suppose you get through every winter by not eating during most of it seems that way a lot of the time the headman answered sullenly well all right gerins voice was light and blithe i suppose well just have to burn this place down so all these houses here dont get in our way while were searching the headman sent him a look full of loathing and led him over to the storage pits which had been concealed by grass growing over them i thought you had a name for being soft alongside aragis the peasant grumbled only goes to show you cant always trust what you hear doesnt it the fox returned with a smile the village headmans glare held even more hate than it had before having got what he wanted gerin generously affected not to notice keeping his army fed was at the moment more important than keeping aragis peasants happy that was his opinion at any rate he discovered the next day that aragis had a different one a chariot bearing the archers son aranast came jouncing over a side road toward gerins army when aranast had made his way up alongside the fox he spoke without preamble lord king my father forbids you from foraging on the countryside while in lands whose overlord he is does he gerin answered thats nice aranast took off his bronze potlike helm and scratched his head does that mean you will obey this prohibition of course not gerin replied if he can teach me how to subsist on no food while i cross his lands i might try it otherwise though ill do what i have to do to get through them you dare go against my fathers stated will aranasts eyes went round and wide and staring no one in aragis lands had dared go against his stated will for many years though aranast gave signs of being a fairly formidable fellow in his own right he seemed astonished anyone might imagine going against his fathers stated will i just said so werent you listening gerin asked politely hes not my suzerain so im under no obligation to obey him and hes told me to do something impossible which means id be an idiot to obey him do i look like an idiot to you young fellow aranast didnt answer that which might have been just as well his frown did its best to be severe to the point of threatening people were no doubt much more in the habit of calling him things like prince and heir and maybe your highness than young fellow taking a deep breath he said my father entered into alliance with you in good faith he did not enter into it to give you leave to plunder his holdings oh dont be a pompous twit gerin said which flicked aranast on his vanity much harder than young fellow had done the fox went on i told you once i dont aim to let myself starve if i were plundering though id have booty with me wouldnt i im feeding myself and im feeding my men would you like some roast mutton generous of you to offer me what already belongs to my father aranast remarked dagref was much younger but would have done the sarcasm better than aranast even so still the effort was there gerin rewarded it with sarcasm of his own glad you think so that drew another glare from aragis son where is your father anyhow the fox asked west of here aranast answered the imperials still press him hard some of them are between him and you i had to thread my way past them to deliver his word to you and to have you set it aside as being of no account it was a foolish word to deliver and you can tell him i said so he might be better off if more people let him know when he was being foolish gerin said but he sees no hope of linking with me again he does not being too sore beset aranast answered he hoped you might rejoin him and also expressed the hope that you would use your skill at magic to good effect in the struggle against the empire ill do everything i can gerin said with a sigh aragis persisted in believing he could do things he couldnt he held up a forefinger has aragis also forbidden the imperials from plundering his holdings aranast shook his head no for he did not think it would do any good you however are not his enemy unless you choose to make yourself so or unless he makes me one by insisting i do things i cant gerin said a man who asks too much of his friends starts finding out he doesnt have so many friends as he thought he did i will take your words back to my father that he may judge them for himself aranast said stiffly fine the fox told him tell him this too if he wants to fight a war against me after we beat the empire ill be ready the same as i was ready to fight a war against him before i knew the imperials were on this side of the high kirs he kept astonishing aranast you challenge my father aragis son said no one challenges my father ive done it for more than twenty years as hes challenged me all that time gerin answered tell him im doing what i have to do here no moreand no less still scowling still muttering to himself aranast aragis son got back into his chariot and rattled off toward the west toward whatever was left of aragis army well he doesnt lack for nerve thats certain van said eyeing the dust the horses hooves and the chariots wheels kicked up from the track along which it traveled who doesnt gerin asked aragis or aranast both of em now that i think on it the outlander replied gerin watched that receding plume of dust too after a moment he nodded getting livestock and grain from the peasants who lived under aragis rule turned out to be for the most part easier than gerin had expected the majority of village headmen had lived so long under the archer they seemed to have forgotten the possibility of cheating an overlord take what you will lord one of them told gerin whatever you take youd do worse to us if we tried to hide it from you the men and women who came up to listen to him talking with the fox nodded aragis evidently had given lessons of that sort a few villages though appeared to have no substance whatsoever only huts and whatever was ripening in the fields gerins men found no livestock even on searching the nearby woods and the headmen at such places staunchly denied having grain pits anywhere by their huts do what you want with me one said i cant give you what i havent got you should be careful saying things like that gerin told him if you said them to aragis or his men theyd do it the headman pulled off his tunic and stood there in his wool trousers he turned his back on the fox long pale ridged scars crisscrossed it laid the whip on himself he did he said with something that sounded almost like pride he didnt come away with anything here either on account of there isnt anything to come away with after seeing those scars gerin gave up and went on to the next village whose headman proved more tractable the fox remained unconvinced the serfs hed just left had as little as theyd shown but lacked both time and inclination to check as hard as he might have otherwise he also knew a certain amount of admiration for their headman anyone who could stand up to aragis had more than the common amount of nerve every so often the imperials hounding the foxs force would press forward a couple of the skirmishes were sharp but the men from south of the high kirs made no effort to get close to his army stay close to it and hound it to death which was what he would have done to theirs had it not been reinforced he wondered how aragis fared with more imperials after him the archer had sent no more messengers to him after aranasts unsuccessful mission keeps dotted the landscape as they did throughout the northlands most of the nobles who dwelt in them had gone to fight under aragis these days the castles housed striplings graybeards and noblewomen who were often more determined than the menfolk left behind some of the keeps opened their gates to share what they had and let gerin and some of his officers sleep in real beds somevery often those where petty barons wives seemed to be in chargestayed shut up tight against his force as if against enemies if youre friends you wont be offended that we dont let you in because youll understand why we dont one of those women called from the walkway around the wall of the keep she was running and if youre foes masquerading as friendswell to the five hells with you in that case gerin didnt push her any further for one thing he would have had to lay siege to the keep to get inside if she wouldnt let down the drawbridge for another what she said made perfectly good sense from her point of view van thought so too saying by the gods if fand were running a keep thats the sort of defiance she would shout youre likely right gerin raised an eyebrow maybe maeva gets it from both sides of the family aye maybe she van broke off three words too late and gave the fox a dirty look and maybe you talk out of both sides of your mouth maybe i do when theres a need but not this time gerin said ive said the same thing all along here van rumbled something down deep in his chest maybe it was just a discontented noise maybe it was an oath in one of the many languages hed picked up in his travels whatever it was he changed the subject whats the road up to ikos from the south like ive never taken it myself so i cant tell you for certain gerin answered i hear though that its easier than jogging west off the elabon way because it doesnt go through that haunted forest in the hill country there i wont miss that forest a bit thank you very much van said with a shudder theres things in there that dont think men have any business going through on the roads the gods help you if you wander off under the trees or if youre stupid enough to try spending the night there youre right the fox said i wouldnt want to do either of those things sounds like an interesting place said dagref whod never been through the forest van laughed so did gerin as much in awe as in mirth a lot of places sound interesting when you hear people talking about them at a nice safe distance he observed visiting them youll find is a lot less interesting than hearing people talk about them at a nice safe distance youve been into the forest dagref said youve been in it a good many times and you must have always come out the other side or else you wouldnt be here at a nice safe distance talking about it logic gerin agreed gravely but doing it once or even doing it a few times doesnt mean im anxious to do it again unlike some people i could name ive never been wild for adventure for adventure s sake one of the things that make adventure adventure is that somebody or something is trying to kill you and im usually against that oh im against anybody or anything trying to kill me too van said best way to stop it ive always thought is to kill whoever or whatever it is first gerin shook his head the best way to stop it is not to put yourself in a place where anybody or anything can try to kill you in the first place a long life and a boring one van said with a sneer this argument strikes me as being moot seeing that we have an imperial army on our tail and another on our left thats dogging aragisthat we hope is dogging aragis dagref said a long boring life van repeated nothing to do but futter women and sit around drinking ale he paused as if listening to what hed just said then he stuck an elbow in gerins ribs almost hard enough to pitch him out of the chariot well it could be worse aragis holdings ran up close to the southern end of the valley in which lay the village of ikos and bitons shrine not even aragis had been so arrogant as to claim that valley as his own guardsmen from the temple patrolled the road that led up into ikos they did not bother on the road that ran west off the elabon way the strange trees and stranger beasts of the forest through which that road ran guaranteed its safety better than men with bronze weapons and armor of leather and bronze could hope to do here though on an open dirt track they were needed one of them recognized gerin lord king he exclaimed in no small surprise why do you come to ikos by this route after a moment he phrased that differently how do you come to ikos by this route having an army from south of the high kirs on my trail might have something to do with it the fox answered at which the temple guards exclaimed in dismay biton might havesurely would haveseen that but he hadnt told them anything about it gerin went on aragis and i made alliance as you may have heard which is what i was doing down in the direction of the mountains in the first place we had heard you had he had made common cause aye but rumors of the foe have been many and various the soldier answered its the empire even though wed forgotten about it up here it never forgot about us worse luck gerin said the imperials have beaten aragis too and theyre chasing him somewhere off to the west of here how do you suppose the farseeing god would feel about being shoved back into a pantheon headed up in the city of elabon if the empire tries such a thing there will be trouble the guardsman said positively he himself looked to be an elabonian in blood but several of the soldiers with him were plainly of the folk who had lived in the northlands before the elabonian empire first came over the high kirs a couple of centuries before they were slimmer than elabonians with wide cheekbones and delicate pointed chins selatre who had formerly been bitons sibyl at ikos had that look to her one of those men asked and why do you come to ikos now lord king his elabonian was fluent enough but had a halflisping halfhissing accent to it traces of the language the folk of the old blood still sometimes spoke among themselves partly because im in retreat gerin admitted but also partly because i would hear what the farseeing god has to say about thisif lord biton has anything to say about it the guardsman who had spoken first said you cannot bring your whole host into the valley to camp it may be that they shall be permitted to traverse the valley but they may not encamp in it why not gerin asked biton protects his own shrine even if we wanted to plunder we wouldnt dare but bitons protection reaches less certainly to the villages around the sacred precinct the temple guard replied we would not have them plundered surely with your numbers you can overcome us here but what sort of welcome will you have from the god if you do a point gerin said a distinct point very well it shall be as you say id sooner have my men foraging off aragis lands than those here in the valley anyhow so lord king would we the guardsman said you being allied to him i hope you will forgive my saying so but aragis the archer has not always made the most comfortable of neighbors he hasnt always made the most comfortable of neighbors for me either the fox answered and he has fewer reasons to keep from stepping on my toes than to keep from stepping on bitons or rather biton can do a better job of stepping on aragis toes than i can if hes not gone to war with you in all these years lord king he thinks you can do something along those lines the guard said you flatter me outrageously gerin said he enjoyed flattery there was he told himself nothing wrong with enjoying it the trick was not to take it too seriously when you started believing everything people told you about how clever you were you proved you werent so clever as they said he gave his army their orders the men seemed content enough to rest where they were if the imperials try to bring us to battle lord king well make em sorry they were ever born one of them said which raised a cheer from the rest since the bulk of the force from south of the high kirs was chasing aragis the fox thought his men did have a decent chance of doing just that when he started forward up into bitons valley adiatunnus surprised him by coming ahead too by your leave lord king im fain to be after seeing the sybil myself the trokm chieftain said the oracle here was a famous one youll know even back in the days when i and all my people dwelt north of the niffet yes i did know that gerin nodded but theres summat else you might not ha known adiatunnus said back before balamung the wizard the one you slew now back before he led us south over the river some of our chieftains came down to ikos to hear whether twould be wise to go with that uncanny kern but they were never heard of again that i recall puir wights as a matter of fact i knew that too the fox answered they tried to kill me here van and iand elise tookilled all of them but one he decided moving against me wouldnt be a good notion but balamung caught him and burned him in a wicker cage ah i mind me i heard summat o that now that you speak of it adiatunnus said but youll not mind if i come with you the now not unless you plan on trying to murder me inside the temple the way those other trokmoi did gerin replied nay though i thank you for the offer adiatunnus said which made gerin snort adiatunnus went on ive had my chances that i have and the putting of you in the ground for good and all ive found is more trouble nor its turned out to be worth for your sweet and generous praises far beyond my deserts i thank you most humbly the fox said and adiatunnus snorted in turn with a sigh gerin turned to rihwin if the imperials do pitch into us youre in command till i can get back send word to me straightaway and try not to wreck the army till i can come and join the celebration rihwin gave him a sour look for your sweet and generous praises lord king i thank you gerin chuckled and dipped his head conceding the round to his fellow fox when dagref drove the chariot up toward the temple to biton adiatunnus followed close in his own car above them floated ferdulf the temple guardsmen stared up at him with interest and curiosity so did gerin he said are you sure you want to visit the sibyl and the farseeing god biton and your father dont get on well that would do for an understatement till a better one came along which he didnt think would happen soon ferdulf turned a fine semidivine sneer his way why should i care what my father thinks or does he returned since he has no room in his life for me do his views on otherseven other godsmatter i told him he shouldnt have got into the wine gerin murmured to van the outlander rolled his eyes a mans own children dont listen to him why should anyone elses children whose son is that one of the guardsmen asked pointing up to ferdulf mavrixs gerin answered the sithonian wine god got him on one of my peasant women is it so the warriors eyes widened but mavrix and the lord biton worked together in driving the monsters off the surface of the earth and back into the caverns under bitons shrine so they did gerin agreed and it was the most quarrelsome cooperation youve ever seen in all your born days they drove past several neat little villages and the fields surrounding them the peasants in the valley of ikos were all freeholders owing allegiance to no overlord save biton that arrangement had always smacked of anarchy to the fox but he like aragis fought shy of trying to annex the valley if biton tolerated freeholders here gerin would too ferdulf flew down and hovered alongside gerin like a large badtempered mosquito in confidential tones he asked do you think the farseeing god will be able to tell me how to take vengeance on my father i have no way of knowing that gerin said if i were you though ferdulf i wouldnt get my hopes too high hes all god ferdulf muttered its not fair no it probably isnt gerin admitted but i dont know what you can do about it either white against greenery the marble walls of bitons shrine gleamed ahead the earthquake that had released the monsters had also overthrown it but bitons own power restored it at the same time as biton and mavrix recontained the monsters isnt that pretty adiatunnus said and then in speculative tones doesnt look so strong as the wall of a proper keep though and ive heard the god keeps all manner of pretties inside though so he does gerin said and its worth your life to try to steal any of them biton has a special plague he uses to smite people who walk off with whats his ive seen one or two hes killed with it its not a pretty way to go adiatunnus looked thoughtful but no less acquisitive as they drew near the temple compound back in the days when he was newly over the niffet he likely would have assumed gerin was lying and tried to steal he would have paid for it then he would pay for it now if he tried it too gerin didnt think he would be so foolish outside the gates attendants took charge of the two chariots no others waited there the shrine did not draw the crowds it had before the earthquake let alone before the days when folk came from all over the elabonian empire and even from beyond its borders to gain the sibyls oracular responses a plump priest with a eunuchs smooth face led the travelers into the temple compound ferdulf had been drifting along a couple of feet off the ground as soon as he passed through the entranceway he descended to the earth with a thump that staggered him he glared toward the temple ahead hes a full god too he growled resentfully so i have to do what he wants not what i want still not fair adiatunnus and the couple of trokmoi with him paid no attention they were gaping at the treasures on display in the courtyard chiefest among them the statues of the elabonian emperors ros the fierce who had conquered the northlands for the empire and of his son oren the builder who had erected the temple now standing above the entrance to the sibyls cavern both statues were larger than life both starkly realistic and both made of ivory and gold gerins voice was dry as he gave adiatunnus good advice pull your tongue back in there and stop drooling on the grass och tis no easy thing you ask of me fox darling the trokm chieftain said with a sigh his eyes flicked from the statues to stacked ingots to great bronze bowls supported on golden tripods id heard of these riches but the difference between the hearing of them and the seeing of them with the eyes of a man himself its the difference twixt hearing of a pretty woman and lying with her and these wont be all the gauds either im thinking youre right about that too gerin said theres plenty more in the caverns off the route to the sibyls throne adiatunnus sighed again as at the thought of the pretty woman he would never meet he glowered at the frieze on the entablature above the colonnaded entrance to the temple itself it showed ros the fierce driving back trokmoi with bitons aid adiatunnus did not approve of anything depicting elabonians beating trokmoi gerin didnt suppose he could blame his vassal for that they went into the temple adiatunnus and the two woodsrunners with him exclaimed again this time at the rich marbles of the columns the fancy woods that had gone into the pews and the gold and silver candelabra throwing sheets of light over them ferdulf exclaimed too but he was pointing at the cult statue of biton that stood near the opening into the caverns below the shrine the statue was not an anthropomorphic representation of the farseeing god as were the rest of the images in the compound instead it was a column of black basalt utterly plain except for scratches that might have been eyes and a jutting phallus how old is it ferdulf whispered in this place even he showed a certain amount of respect for the god who ruled here i wouldnt even try to guess gerin answered its been a shrine for a long long time even if it didnt used to be as pretty as we elabonians made it after we came up here not we elabonians ferdulf said testily i am no elabonian for which i thank all the gods biton very much included gerin made his voice sweet as clover honey on your mothers side you are he cherished the horrible look the demigod gave him perhaps he shouldnt have yielded to the temptation reminding ferdulf of his background was liable to make him less willing to oppose the elabonian empire turning aside every temptation though made life too dull to stand the priest waved the suppliants to the pews pray to the lord biton he urged pray that your question will be phrased in such a way as to make his answer which shall be true also meaningfully true for you that gerin thought was good advice the sibyls oracular responses were often obscure clearer after the event than beforehand he tried to clear his mind of all his worries so he could ask a question that would have as unambiguous an answer as possible just for a moment he looked up at the cult statue hed done that on other visits to bitons shrine those crudely carved eyes would seem to come alive for a heartbeat to look back into his he wondered if that would happen again it didand then some for an instant no more he saw the god as he had seen him in the little shack back at fox keep where he undertook his sorceries biton might have been a handsome man but for the eye in the back of his head that showed when he twisted his neck preternaturally far and then he was gone back into the basalt that statuethat is the god ferdulf whisperedhad he seen the apparition too thats not his imagethat is the god its how he looks when he isnt thinking about how he looks and when people aren t thinking about how he looks maybe it is gerin said philosophers had always wondered whether gods were as they were because people conceived of them as being that way or if people conceived of gods as they did because the gods essentially were like that the fox suspected such arguments would go on forever have you composed your mind the eunuch priest asked gerin nodded the priest smiled then come with me we shall go down below the ground down to the cave of the sibyl where biton shall speak through her he tried to make it sound mysterious and exotic it was mysterious and exotic but gerin had gone many times into the cavern below the temple to see the sibyland for other darker purposes he climbed to his feet saying lets get on with it the plump eunuch in his fancy robes looked disappointed that the fox and his comrades were not trembling with awe but took a torch and led them all to the mouth of the cave elabonian workmen had put steps down from the cave mouth after a prominent visitor years before tripped fell and broke his ankle soon though gerins feet trod the natural stone of the cavern generations of suppliants seeking guidance from the sibyl had worn a path in the rock but it was a path more visible in torchlight than smooth beneath the feet every so often torches flaming in sconces added their light to that of the burning brand the priest carried a cool breeze made the flames flicker isnt that strange now adiatunnus murmured i always thought the air inside a cave would be still and dead as a corp it is the power of the god the priest said or else its something natural that we dont understand gerin put in the priest glared at him eyeballs glittering in the torchlight gerin looked back steadily biton didnt seem inclined to smite him for blasphemy with a disappointed sniff the priest resumed the journey down to the sibyls cave other paths led off that one other caverns opened onto it biton s priesthood used some of them to store treasures the trokmoi exclaimed at the gleaming precious metals the torches briefly revealed of course they also exclaimed at the beautiful but largely worthless bits of shining rock crystal set here and there in the walls of the cavern and some entrances to sibyls underground chamber were bricked up and sealed not only with masonry but also with potent magical charms some of the bricks baked with round tops like loaves of bread were almost immeasurably ancient ferdulf shivered as he came to one such wall monsters dwell behind these bricks he murmured thats so gerin agreed monsters like geroge and tharma they have an understanding of sorts with us now which is why some of these charms have been set aside here they could come forth but they don t their gods are in our debt for launching them against the gods of the gradi a mad venture the priest said adiatunnus nodded the torchlight made the shadow of his bobbing head dip and swirl since gerin was inclined to agree with them he didnt argue before he was quite ready they came to the sibyls cave bitons priestess sat on a throne that looked as if it had been carved from a single black pearl which glowed nacreously when light fell on it she herself wore a plain tunic of undyed linen the eunuch priest went up to her set a hand on her shoulder and murmured something too low for gerin to catch had the fellow been a whole man he would not have been permitted to touch her not only did sibyls remain lifelong maidens they were not allowed even to touch true men the sibyl looked something like selatrenot close enough to be near kin but plainly of the same blood she eyed gerin with curiosity perhaps the priest had told her who he wasno reason for her to remember his face with his last visit five years in the pastand reminded her that he was wed to the woman whod preceded her on the sibyls throne was she wondering what that would be like if she was she didnt show it you have your question she asked the fox i do he answered here it is how may the empire of elabon be made to give up its claims to the northlands and withdraw its forces south over the high kirs hed phrased it carefully not asking what he could do to make that happen perhaps it would happen without him perhaps it would not happen at all he forced himself to shove that thought aside he had scarcely uttered the last word when the sibyl stiffened she thrashed on the throne limbs splayed awkwardly her eyes rolled up in her head till only the whites showed when she spoke again it was not in her own voice but in bitons a deep virile baritone the foe is strong up to no good to rout him will take bronze and wood you must not find the god you seek twould make your fate a sour reek they snap and float and always trouble but without them fortune turns to rubble back next contents ix as soon as ferdulf left the temple compound he hopped into the air and let out a luxurious sigh of relief my feet were getting tired he said and then to gerin well was that obscure enough to suit you and to spare the fox answered ive had difficult omens from biton and the sibyl before but never one close to that as best i could see it was meaningless not difficult dagref said but can you see as far as the farseeing god gerin asked dagref only shrugged adiatunnus said im with the colt lord king when you hear summat without plain sense in it more often the reason is that its senseless than too clever for words im thinking more often than not gerin would have made the same argument here he said ive seen biton be right a good many times when everyone would have thought he was wrong im not going to say hes wrong here not now why do we hope we dont find a god van demanded if were seeking one shouldnt we hope we do find him and which god would you be seeking adiatunnus added twouldnt be biton his own self or were ruined or ever we start but he wouldna say who it was did you see obscure ferdulf had the right word for it gerin said sooner or later we will have the meaning laid out before us aye likely when its too late to do us any good van said that is the way of oracles sometimes the fox agreed but you never know till you try and now that we have gone and tried and got nothing to speak of for it what are we to be doing next adiatunnus asked shall we bring our army through the valley of ikoson the promise we willna linger mind i dont want to do that gerin said i dont think the god wants us to do that if its that or stay out and be destroyed then i might but not before i still have a fighting chance of beating the imperials and no one who opposes a god straight up will do anything but lose you say that dagref said you who have probably outdone more gods in more different ways than anyone else alive but never straight up gerin said the way to deal with gods is to trick them or else to make them do what you want by showing them it gives them some advantage too even if thats just that it lets them score off a rival or else to use a rival either to beat the god whos angry at you or to distract the other god so he doesnt care about you any more thats what you did with the gradi gods dagref said and gerin nodded so it is he answered the brawl i got them into has worked out betterwhich is to say its lasted longerthan i ever dared hope puts me in mind of something that happened to me a good many years ago back in my wandering days van said as they waited for the attendants to bring back their chariots probably something that didnt happen ferdulf said if its anything like most of your stories van glared at him i ought to pop you like the blownup pigs bladder you are he growled ferdulf rose into the air i am the son of a god and you would be wise to remember it lest we discover who pops whom he was not much more than half as tall as the outlander and couldnt possibly have weighed a quarter as much but that little body held power of a different sort from vans brute strength glaring still van said i dont care whose son you are you bigmouthed little weedid like to see you show that even one of my stories even one mind you has the smallest bit of falsehood in it ferdulf fell a few inches a sign of dismay or chagrin how am i supposed to show that he demanded i wasnt born yet when you were having these adventures you tell lies about and i havent been to the preposterous places where you had them then why dont you shut up van asked sweetly why dont you shut up before you open your mouth so wide you fall right in now ferdulf glared before he could say anything adiatunnus said im fain to hear the outlanders tale hes never dull say what else you will of him his comrades nodded vans stories had long been popular along the border shall i go on then van asked when even ferdulf did not say no go on he did this was out in the weshapar country east of kizzuwatna and north of mabalal the weshapar have the most jealous god in the world hes so crazy he wont even let them call him by his name and he has the nerve to claim hes the only real god in the whole wide world foosh what a fool of a god he is adiatunnus than what does he think of the gods of the folk who are lucky enough not to be after worshiping him he thinks they arent real at allthat the people around the weshapar country are imagining them van answered well i like that ferdulf said indignantly id like to fly over his temple and piss on it from on high maybe he would think that was his imagination too or else i could do you want to say what you would do or do you want to hear what this god and i did do van gave mavrixs son a dirty look the attendants fetched the chariots then everyone but ferdulf got into them he floated along beside the one dagref drove oh go on now ferdulf sounded very much like his father which is to say petulant thank you most gracious demigod from living with gerin van had learned to be sardonic when it suited him it didnt suit him very often which made him more dangerous when it did while ferdulf sputtered and fumed the outlander went on this god of the weshapar put me in mind of a jealous husband he was always sneaking around keeping an eye on his people to make sure they didnt worship anyone but him and wait dagref said if this strange god said none of the other gods around him was real how could people worship them they wouldnt be worshiping anything at all logic i dont think this god ever heard of logic and im starting to wish id never heard of you van said between you and ferdulf we ll be all the way back with the rest of the army before im through anyhow there i was on the way through the weshapar countryits hills and rocks and valleys hot in the summer and cold as all getout in the wintertrading this for that doing a little fighting on the side to help keep myself in food and trinkets when one of the weshapar chieftains got on the wrong side of this god howd he do that gerin asked to the five hells with me if i know van answered a god like that any little thing will do the trick same as a jealous husband will think his wife is sleeping with somebody else if she sets foot outside the front door he sighed maybe he was thinking of fand though he wasnt a jealous husband of the type hed describedand though he gave her plenty of reason for jealousy too gathering himself he went on like i say i dont know what zalmunnathis weshapar chief i was talking aboutdid to get his god angry at him but he did something because the god told him he had to cut the throat of his son to make things rightand to show he really did reverence that foolish god and did this zalmunna spalpeen tell him where to head in adiatunnus asked i would ha done no other thing but that but you and your people hadnt been worshiping this god for who knows how many generations van said zalmunna was in a state ill tell you he was in an even worse state because his son was all ready to let himself be used like a goat or a hog too if the god wanted him he was ready for it readyno he was eager as a bridegroom wedding the loveliest wench in the countryside you would think he would have had better sense dagref said no ladyou would think he had better sense because you have better sense yourself van said what you havent figured out yet is how many people are fools one way or another what you havent figured out is how many people are fools one way and another i wonder why they are dagref said a question aimed not so much at van as at the world around him the world around him did not answer van went on like i say the lad was ready to be offered up like a beast most of the weshapar were ready for him to be offered up too they were used to doing what their god told them he was their god how could they do anything else even zalmunna was thinking he might have to do it he didnt want to you understand but he didnt see that he had much choice we got to talking the night before he was supposed to go into this overgrown valley where that god had his shrine and kill the boy hed got himself drunk the same way you would have if this was happening to you he knew what i thought of his god which was not much so he came to me instead of to any of the rest of the weshapar well since their god was as jealous as he was and as stupid as he was like i say we got to talking when the time came for him to take his son down into the valley i went along his son didnt want me to come he was fussing and fuming like anything sometimes though you cant pay much attention to what these brats say dagref ignored him ferdulf stuck out his tongue at him van grinned miserable little excuse for a shrine this god had toonothing but a few piledup stones and a shabby stone table for the throatcutting business we got there and the gods voice came from out of the stones get on with it he said and he sounded like my old grandfather about two days before he died zalmunna laid his son down on the stone table he took out his knife before he used it though i hit his son in the side of the head with a little leather sack full of sand and pebbles the lad went out like a torch youd stick in a bucket of water id led a sow along too i lifted her up onto the table instead of zalmunnas son and zalmunna cut her throat what happened next gerin asked the god didnt strike you dead he took a long careful look at the outlander at least i dont think he did honh van said what happened was that god said there you see next time youd better pay attention to me he felt zalmunnas son stop thinking you understand and then there was blood all over the place it was just like wed hoped he thought zalmunna really had killed the boy i slung zalmunnas son over my shoulder and carried him back to the weshapar village wed started out from what happened when he woke up gerin asked to the five hells with me if i know van repeated i clouted him a good one he was still quiet as a sack of mud when we got back to the village zalmunna started shouting up a storm about what an idiot their god was and how hed fooled him and how they should all quit worshiping him and on and on and on me i thought that looked like a pretty fair time to find somewhere else to go so away i went and what might that ha been pray adiatunnus asked are you after telling us you were fain to keep clear o the quarrels twixt a god and his folk now that you mention it yes van said the fox will tell you ive done a stupid thing or three in my time but hell also tell you ive never done anything outright daft in all my born days oh i will will i gerin said this i have to let you know is news to me go howl van said anyhow a couple of days after that i felt myself a pretty fair earthquakesay about like the one that turned ikos topsyturvy and let the monsters out though i was right on top of that one and a ways away from the one im talking about now it would have hit hardest in the weshapar country unless i miss my guess you think the god caused it dagref said well zalmunna couldnt very well have done it van replied though he was angry enough to if only he could i cant tell you even now whether the weshapar still follow their nasty little jealous god or whether theyve all gone over to the ones their neighbors follow i would that adiatunnus said if you must be worshiping gods now better to follow the bunch that let you have a good time im thinking dagref had another question if all theseweshapar was itdid fall away from the jealous god would he shrivel up and die for lack of worship its a good question van said but id be lying if i claimed i knew the answer to it for i dont but if its not what zalmunna was hoping for id be astonished its not a good question ferdulf growled not even slightly its a wicked question and a wicked idea gods are immortalits one of the things that make them gods how can an immortal die gerin asked a question of his own suppose youre a god and no one worships you for a thousand years or sohow would you like that would you be hungry if you werent dead wouldnt you rather be ferdulf considered that its not something my father need fear he said at last people will always worship a god who gives them wine a god who gives them the pleasures that go with fertility a god who aids them in all manners of creation thats so gerin said understanding from ferdulfs answer why the little demigod had been so upset the fox thought ferdulfs father would live forever too ferdulf had named good reasons he would stay popular among men wistfully gerin wished dagrefs father would live forever too bronze and wood van touched his sword hilt then set his hand on the chariot rail here we have the one thing and the other now we have to go forth and lick the cursed imperials you make it sound so easy gerin said his voice dry it was easy van said twice in a row it was easy why shouldnt it be once more youre forgetting something gerin replied even more dryly than before the two battles we won aragis and i were together and together we matched the number of imperials we were fighting they have more men now and theyve split us in two attacking when youre outnumbered doesnt strike me as the best idea ive ever heard and have you got a better one the outlander asked and gerin didnt the imperials had not pressed the pursuit so hard as they might have while he wasnt eager to attack them they still werent eager to attack him either those two victories he and aragis had won over them made them wary even with the advantage of numbers even so were going to get hungry pretty soon if we dont do anything but stay where we are van said driving home the point its either knock em back and find some new land to forage over or else fall back into the valley of ikosand farseeing biton isnt going to be happy about that i know now gerins voice was somber his guardsmen couldnt have made that much plainer could they he sighed if its fighting the elabonian empire or fighting the farseeing god theres not much choice is there rihwins riders in the van the foxs army moved out the next day those of aragis vassals who had not gone to war along with their king held their keeps shut tight against gerin they were holding their keeps shut against everyone they no doubt wished gerin and the imperials would all go away and leave them at peace or as close to it as they had known while living under aragis rule no matter what they wished they had not the strength to enforce their wishes the foxs forward move seemed to catch the imperials by surprise the riders drove back the scouts the forces of the elabonian empire had posted to keep an eye on them they killed a few too and captured several more maeva beaming from ear to ear brought one of those prisoners back to the foxand not coincidentally to her father and dagref i caught him myself she said pride ringing in her voice the prisoner looked indignant perhaps at being captured by a woman perhaps at being captured at all the latter it proved for he burst out you cursed rebels are a tougher nut to crack than they told us you were going to be when we came over the mountains they said some of you would want to come back under the city of elabon and the rest wouldnt be able to fight people say all sorts of stupid things gerin answered the trick is knowing whether theyre stupid for instance ill know if you lie because ive already asked these questions to other prisoners how many men have you got he got the answers he wanted they largely agreed with the answers hed had from other imperials his men had captured the soldiers of the elabonian empire outnumbered his own men but not overwhelmingly he had some reason to hope he could knock them back on their heels what will you do with me the prisoner asked what will you do with me lord king dagref and maeva spoke together in the tones they would have used to reprove younger siblings whod said something stupid they looked at each other both seeming surprised and pleased what will you do with me lord king for his part the prisoner seemed grateful enough to be corrected with words rather than with something hard slammed against the side of his head take him back that way maeva gerin said pointing over his shoulder dont do anything to him as long as he behaves himself if he doesnt behave himself well the ghosts will have fresh blood to drink tonight to the captured imperial he went on i dont quite know what well end up doing with you we may let you farm on a peasant village but i wont lie to youyou may end up in the mines it depends on where we can get the most and the most useful work out of you lord king if its use youre after i know something of smithcraft the prisoner said if that turns out to be true you wont go to the mines gerin said and if it turns out not to be true you will for having lied the imperial didnt quail from which gerin concluded he was either telling the truth or had some small practice lying take him away maeva i do thank you for getting her out of the brawling for a while van said youre welcome for whatever it may be worth gerin answered his voice mild he understood what was in the outlanders mind dagref on the other hand spoke to van in the same hectoring tones hed used on the prisoner maeva had taken you do understand dont you that she gets to go out of the brawling now because she was in it before oh aye i understand that lad van said manfully resisting the temptation to break dagref over his knee or offer him some other form of great bodily harm now if you want to ask me whether i like the idea or not i may just have a different answer for you aye i may for a wonder the brittle edge in his voice got through to dagref who suddenly made himself very busy steering the chariot gerin caught vans eye and raised an eyebrow van coughed a couple of times they both laughed stop talking about me dagref said without looking back which only made his father and van laugh harder more prisoners came back as the foxs advance drove in the scouts the imperials had set up to keep an eye on him he was mournfully certain his horsemen and chariots were not capturing all those scouts he pushed south and west harder to hit the main imperial army before the foe was ready for him instead of finding the imperial force concentrated to receive his men he found it scattered in detachments he hit them one after another glad of his good fortune they would skirmish with him and then draw off retreating toward the west every time the peasants in the eastern part of aragis kingdom did not seem delighted to have him foraging from the countryside rather than the soldiers of the elabonian empire some of them in fact probably would have preferred to have the imperials remain being strangers in the northlands and unused to some of the ways of the peasants there the men from south of the high kirs missed stores that gerin and his men had no trouble sniffing out theyd dealt with the local peasants all their lives and knew their tricks flatbread made from coarseground flour baked in the hot ashes of a campfire was not the most appetizing meal but it kept a man going van said we may run those buggers right out of here yet if they keep giving us ground by the gods well take it so we will gerin said gnawing on flatbread he kept looking toward the west his expression was glum van noted that you ought to be glad weve broken out of that cramped little stretch of ground where theyd pinned us back if you are youve not told your face of it i am glad we would have got hungry after a bit but im not delighted you see what theyre doing dont you running van said with a sniff running aye the fox said but running with a purpose van let out an interrogative grunt gerin explained theyre keeping themselves between aragis and us they dont want us joining up with him until their other force has hit him hard unless i miss my guess ah van took a bite of flatbread too he chewed on the bread and the idea at the same time by the look on his face he didnt much care for the taste of either he tried to make the best of things well theyll be the ones with the harder foraging now but the fox shook his head i have my doubts about that if they can bring two armies up over the high kirs theyll have a supply train with em too to keep them fed he listened to his own words a smile slowly stole over his face and theyve gone and let us out vans smile spread till it matched gerins wagons and wagons full of good things to eatthats what youre saying isnt it fox good things to eat gerin agreed probably more wine to help rihwin get drunk probably arrows and such too all sorts of things we could use all sorts of things wed be happier if the imperials didnt have and theyre falling back toward the west to keep us away from aragis the archer dont they realize youd think of the supply train do you know i dont believe they do gerin said to them after all im just a backwoods halfbarbarian he winked but ill tell you something im going to show them theyre wrong this will be grand fun van boomed as the chariot jounced along the stretch of the elabon way gerins counterattack had opened up grand fun for us i should saythe imperials wont like getting a door slammed on their prongs even a little bit wouldnt much care for that myself gerin had all he could do not to clutch at himself at the very idea but aye if it goes as we hope itll do us some good and make life harder for our chums from south of the mountains hed taken as many of rihwins riders as he could while still leaving enough to scout for the main mass of warriors hed left behind hed also taken the chariots with the fastest horses and those with the fiercest crews including a good many of adiatunnus trokmoi set the prospect of booty in front of the woodsrunners and theyd go after it the way a pack of hounds would run baying down the scent track of a stag he glanced east somewhere not far over there beyond forests and low hills lay the village where elise had her tavern gerin wondered what had happened when the imperials went through there after him a rider came galloping north up the elabon way toward his force wagons the fellow was shouting wagons when he was sure the fox had heard him he pointed in the direction from which he had come lets go gerin said and waved his men forward they whooped with glee the troopers in chariots urged their teams ahead the riders booted their mounts up from slow trot to quick sure enough as soon as the paved highway rose a little the fox saw the ox and donkeydrawn wagons coming toward him the riders were already whooping and reaching over their shoulders for arrows the drivers saw gerins oncoming men at about the same time as he spotted them they had a few chariots along to protect them against bandits but not nearly enough to hold back a force like the one gerin had assembled the charioteers did what they could they rolled up the highway in a spoiling attack to try to give the wagon crews time to form a defensive circle gerin was having none of that roll past them he shouted don t let them slow us down once we get in among the wagons well be able to throw the chariots into the bag too arrows flew as the imperials tried to delay his troopers a couple of men on either side tumbled out of their cars but then despite shouts of scorn and dismay from the warriors from south of the high kirs the fox and his followers were by speeding on toward the wagons a fierce grin stretched his mouth wide the circle remained incomplete his men knew they had to make sure it stayed incomplete too they broke in among the wagons some of the men from the chariots dismounted and set upon the wagon drivers the drivers fought back as best they could but they were not armored and many of them carried nothing more lethal than knives pointing to the havoc the dismounted chariot crews were wreaking van said wouldnt be so easy for riders to do that youre rightit wouldnt gerin agreed but men on horses can do things men in chariots cant too more things unless i miss my guess he raised his voice there go a couple dagref see if you can run them down before they make it into the trees aye father dagref steered the chariot after the closer of the two fleeing drivers as it pulled alongside the fellow van swung his mace its wicked spiked bronze head slammed home with a meaty thunk the driver shrieked and crumpled i would have let him yield gerin said mildly he wasnt yielding the outlander answered he was running as if the other driver had heard him he stopped running and threw up his hands gerin waved for him to head back toward the elabon way he obeyed but as soon as dagref turned the chariot aside he whirled and sprinted for the trees and got in among them before the chariot crew could do anything about it gerin shot an arrow at him but missed there you see van said try and be generous and look at the thanks you get hes not as smart as he thinks he is gerin said as the chariot bounced back to the highway if he comes out either well scoop him up or aragis peasants will put paid to him hell have a thin time either way thats not the point van said the point is we should have put paid to him and we cursed well didnt since he was right gerin didnt try to argue with him instead he said lets see if we can keep their chariot escort from getting away and letting the rest of the imperials know weve made their wagons disappear his shouts pulled other chariots from the northlands away from the wagons and into the pursuit he and his men caught up with what he thought was the last imperial chariot a mile or so up the elabon way seeing they would be overhauled the driver and the two warriors with him jumped out and ran for the woods as the wagon drivers had done unlike the wagon drivers they didnt get there now lets get these wagons back to our camp the fox said we havent got time to waste the faster we move em up along the road the less the chance the empire will have of getting them back some of the wagon drivers had surrendered gerin was glad of that because his own men while skilled with horses had less practice with donkeys and oxen the animals obeyed better when they saw what their fellow beasts were doing under drivers who knew how to make them work rihwin rode up alongside gerin i wonder what all weve captured for a wonder he didnt say i wonder how much wine weve captured same sort of things wed have along for our own troopers i expect gerin answered journeybread and sausage and onions and cheeseanything that keeps well dried fruit too maybe theres a name for dried grapes he snapped his fingers raisins thats what they call them raisins rihwin agreed its been a very long time since ive had raisins he still didnt say anything about wine which gerin had made a point of not mentioning gerin eyed him suspiciously as if wondering whether he was coming down with some peculiar ailment maturity gerin wondered trying again to find a name he shook his head if rihwin hadnt caught that yet he probably never would van said have to see what theyve got in these wagons besides food too sheaves of arrows like you said thosell come in handy for us maybe swords maybe metal fittings for chariots too thosed be nice lets move faster gerin said again captain trying to hurry a donkey bothers you more than it does the donkey van said the only way i know to hurry oxen is to fling em off a cliff whats that the trokmoi say dont fash yourselfthere you are were making the best time we can its not good enough gerin fretted he knew his friend was right he couldnt help worrying and barking and snapping anyhow eventually more of his own riders came down to screen the wagons from any possible imperial revenge only then did he relax his troopers cheered when the wagons came into camp when they started going through them they found about what theyd expected including one wagon full of wineskins gerin stalked around that wagon glum as a man with a toothache what in the five hells do we do with it he asked the air dagref was close enough to hear him my view is we ought to drink it if mavrix didnt come up to the northlands in a cloud of purple smoke when rihwin drank why should he care about widin simrin s son drinking or adiatunnus either for that matter i dont know why he might care about widin or adiatunnus the fox answered i havent the faintest idea if he does care though is the risk in drinking worth the chance were taking no way to tell ahead of time of course dagref admitted but then mavrix would surely be insulted if we spill the wine and might be insulted if we dont drink it risks everywhere you so relieve my mind gerin said at which dagref bowed as if to a compliment ferdulf came swaggering up to the wagon walking with his feet far enough off the ground to let him look gerin the the eye youve found more of my fathers spoiled grape juice have you he demanded if thats what you want to call it yes gerin answered cautiously why because i still aim to pay him back thats why ferdulf said and now i know how to do it too wait gerin said and grabbed at the demigod he missedferdulf must have known he was going to try it with a mocking laugh ferdulf floated up into the air gerin leaped after him which proved how alarmed he was he didnt leap high enough or fast enough from above his head ferdulf mocked him you cant stop me this time nobody can stop me this time he pointed a forefinger at the wine and muttered under his breath gerin couldnt hear all of it but part of it was take that father and i hope you choke on it stop it gerin said urgently but ferdulf had no intention of stopping it not for him not for anybody he was going to do what he was going to do and if the fox didnt like it too bad for the fox what if mavrix didnt like it that obviously was what ferdulf hoped would happen he wanted the sithonian god of wine to come up to the northlands maybe he even wanted mavrix to punish him getting a rise out of his father might have looked better to him than the indifference mavrix had shown at their first meeting he drifted down to the ground a brat doing an imitation of a snowflake go ahead he told gerin drink all the wine you like i hope you and your troopers enjoy it what have you done the fox demanded ferdulf gave him a nasty smile youll find out and off he went before gerin could make up his mind to try to shake some truth out of him what do you think hes done dagref asked something horrible gerin snapped what does he ever do i ought to make rihwin open a skin and find out whats gone wrong hes wild for wine so he should be the one to see how wild the wines got doesnt that sound like justice to you dagref his son didnt answer with a question like that a long answer meant no no answer at all meant no too with a sigh gerin went and got a tarredleather drinking jack he took a wineskin out of the wagon undid the tie at the neck and poured the jack full he hadnt raised it to his lips when rihwin called oh no you dont my fellow fox i was all but supernaturally patient not even speaking of the blood of the sweet grape but if youre going to go ahead and quaff justice dagref said and sighed here gerin pressed the jack into rihwins outstretched hand since you want it so much its only fitting that you should have it go right ahead my fellow fox quaff rihwin should have been suspicious when gerin yielded so easily but he wasnt i not only want it he declared i deserve it he took a big mouthfuland then sprayed out as much of it as he could coughing and choking on what had gone down his throat feh he said vinegar well thats something of a relief gerin said i was afraid it would be donkey piss thank you so much rihwin snarled and you went ahead and let me drink it no gerin said i did not let you drink it you insisted on doing it i deserve it you said in my opinion you were correct you did deserve it if you hadnt been so greedy you would have let me taste or you would have let me tell you ferdulf had done something to the wine but noyou went ahead and took what you wanted and enjoyed it less than you might have done id say both as your friend and as your king that you have no complaint coming rihwin wiped his mouth on his sleeve which couldnt have done much good and id say both as your friendfor some indecipherable reason or otherand as your subject that you havent the faintest notion of what youre talking about he wiped his mouth again maybe you should go drink some ale dagref suggested that would get rid of some of the taste aye maybe i should go and rihwin gave gerins son a horrible look you take altogether too much after your father he strode away his back as stiff as an offended cats thank you dagref called after him which only made his back grow stifferit wasnt what hed wanted to hear dagref turned to gerin hell be a while getting over that so he will gerin agreed so he ought to be he scowled at the wagon then let out a long sigh we can pickle all the cabbages and cucumbers we like but were not going to be drinking wine thats so dagref agreed i wonder why mavrix hasnt descended on us in a cloud of fury hes not usually one to ignore insults is he no hes usually one to pay them back gerin answered thats why my heart fell into my sandals when ferdulf decided to take his petty revenge well why isnt mavrix here then dagref demanded as if his father were somehow responsible for the absence of the sithonian god of wine and fertility if i knew i would tell you gerin answered maybe hes finally decided he doesnt care what happens here in the northlands any more that would be nice wouldnt it or maybe hes raising a rebellion down in sithonia and doesnt have time to fret about this part of the world for a while but didnt you say he told you he didnt think the sithonians could successfully rise against the elabonian empire gerin asked yes i did say he told me he didnt think they could gerin answered and stuck out his tongue at his son doesnt mean he wouldnt try to raise one anyhow the sithonians have revolted against the empire a good many times over the years even if theyve always lost if the sithonians are revolting dagref said both thoughtfully and with malice aforethought that could be very convenient for us were guessing you know gerin said dagref nodded gerin went on were guessing with our hearts not our heads he sighed it would be nice but we dont dare believe it its like believing a pretty girl youve never seen will come looking for you it happens every once in a while maybe but not often enough that you can expect it for even a heartbeat i understand dagref said what happens anywhere else doesnt matter anyhow not unless we beat the imperials here thats also true gerin said in fact thats the truth about this war and we were on the point of doing it too till they threw another army into the fight nasty and rude of them if anyone wants to know what i think they want to win too worse luck very inconsiderate cant trust anyone any more can you dagref asked who said i ever did the fox returned the next morning ferdulf was loud and triumphant and obnoxious in other words not far removed from his usual self i gave my father a proper black eye he boasted and he hasnt had the nerve to come do anything to me i guess he sees whos boss in the northlands now youve done better guessing gerin told him ferdulf stuck his nose in the air following that nose the rest of him floated off the ground i do not have to stay here to listen to myself being insulted he said haughtily and drifted away like an indignant dandelion puff he hasnt the faintest notion how big a fool he is van said fools never do gerin answered thats what makes them fools strange thinking of a halfgod as a fool the outlander said but ferdulf gives us plenty of chances to do it so he does gerin said he could easily think of a few gods hed met whom he considered fools but he didnt mention that whether gods were fools or not they were vastly stronger than mortals a man insulted a god even a god as cowardly as mavrix at his peril a demigod insulted a god even a god who was his father at his peril ferdulf hadnt figured that outanother proof ferdulf was a fool what now van asked i dont know what we can do but keep on with what weve been doing gerin answered if we can keep riders moving along the elabon way the imperials are going to have a harder time supplying their armies up here and if we can keep pushing back the outposts of that force that was dogging us maybe well be able to join hands with aragis aye maybe we will van said and maybe once we do we ought to count the fingers on the hand we join with his too gerin once more would have argued with his friend more had he agreed with him less the men from the northlands did drive in a couple of more imperial positions which gave them new land from which to forage the men from the elabonian empire hadnt been on the land long enough to pick it bare nor were they as good at the job as gerin and his followers combining what they took from the land with what they captured from the imperial supply column the warriors from the northlands were for the moment comfortable he ate sausages and gnawed on chunks of journeybread and tried to decide what to do next probably about the same thing as his imperial opposite number was doing he could do one thing his opposite number couldnt he could send riders west to slide around the imperial forces between him and aragis men on horseback could go at least as fast as men in chariots and could go crosscountry on tracks and through fields and woods chariotry couldnt use maeva was not one of the riders he sent toward aragis as she had before when she wasnt chosen for a duty she complained he did his best to look down his nose at her it wasnt easy not when they were very much of a height youre right he said i didnt pick you so what its not fair she insisted i deserve to go into danger the same as any other rider you deserve to have your backside walloped the fox said now truly starting to get annoyed and its not fair is the battle cry children use im tired of it from you if you want to be a warrior act like one when youre not in the middle of a fight not just when you are youre holding me back because im a woman maeva said no im holding you back because youre a girl gerin said she stared at him astonished and furious at the same time he went on this is your first campaign remember take a look at the riders i sent west what do you notice about them pray tell theyre all men maeva said angrily thats right gerin agreed theyre all men there isnt a boy among them theyve all been riding horses as long as youve been alive a couple of them have been riding horses as long as anyone in the northlands has been doing it theyve all done a lot of fighting and a lot of fighting from horseback if youre still in the army ten or twelve years from now if im still alive ten or twelve years from now youll have a real chance of getting sent on a ride like this he wondered how maeva would take that kind of dressingdown fand would have flown into a fury at him van would have been angry too but not with the same sort of deadly rage but gerin had a great many years on maeva which made her take him more seriously than either of her parents would have done very well lord king was all she said before going off disappointed but not obviously irate watching her go the fox nodded in reluctant approval he almost wished she had thrown a tantrum that would have given him the excuse he needed to send her home but she offered him no such excuse however much having one would have pleased him and delighted van all things considered shed taken the tonguelashing like a soldier no sooner had that comparison crossed his mind than he wished it hadnt too late hed started thinking of maeva as a soldier even before he saw how well she handled herself when she was wounded he couldnt very well change his mind now not all the riders he sent out came back before any of them came back he had to try to withstand an assault from the imperials who had begun to concentrate against him once he started rolling up their outposts their commander was about as unsubtle as aragis the archer he simply gathered his force and rolled toward where he thought gerin had the bulk of his army he turned out to have a pretty good notion of that too mounted scouts brought the fox the word they cant be a quarter of an hour behind us lord king coming down that road there one of the riders said pointing west along the dirt road up which hed come well all right gerins grimace held annoyance but no real surprise hed poked the men from south of the high kirs they were going to hit back if they couldand they could he surveyed the ground through which the road ran it was mostly open countrygrain fields and and meadowswith a forest of oaks and elms off to the left well stay right here he said its as good a spot as any and better than most i think youre doing the right thing father dagref said we ve shown that man for man were more than a match for the imperials so we have gerin agreed unfortunately theyve shown theyve got more men than we do he started shouting orders shaking his men out from line of march into line of battle he barely had time to post a couple of dozen chariot crews in among the trees with orders to burst forth against the enemys flank and rear when the time seemed ripe before a rising dust cloud and horn calls through it announced the imperials were at hand elabon elabon elabon the men of the empire shouted as if to leave no doubt who they were gerins men were not in any doubt his riders plied the leading chariots from the elabonian empire with arrows and javelins the horsemen in front of them kept the imperials from charging as ferociously as their commander probably would have liked the men from south of the high kirs were still learning how to face mounted foes one thing theyd learned was that when there were enough of them their foes had to give way archers shooting from tightly bunched chariots put enough arrows in the air to discourage anyoneon foot on horseback or in other chariotsfrom doing much to hinder their passage seeing their numberssure enough they were going to have more men in the fight than he didgerin waved and yelled to extend his line to either side and lap round them if he could hit them from three sides at once those numbers wouldnt do them much good his troopers could slay men in the middle of that rumbling herd of chariots without their having the chance to do him any harm theres a lot of them captain van said id noticed that myself gerin answered we scraped together all the men we could aragis and i the empire of elabon is bigger than the northlands and has more people too theyve sent a bigger force over the mountains than we can hope to equal most places thats a recipe for a lost war for the side that doesnt have the big army the outlander said thank you so much the fox snapped i never would have realized that if you hadnt pointed it out to me glad to help captain van said imperturbably he did not stay imperturbable after an arrow ticked off the side of his helm scratching a brighter line on the brightly polished bronze he cursed and bellowed and brandished his spear at the imperials though he couldnt have had the slightest idea which of them had shot at him gerin started shooting at the soldiers and horses of the elabonian empire in front of him one way to reduce the odds his men faced was to kill or disable as many of the imperials as he could one of his shafts struck the righthand horse of a team square in the breast the horse went down the chariot slewed leftwards colliding with the car and team next to it they slewed away in turn because the main body of the imperial was so tightly packed they ran into the team on their left too one arrow fouling three chariots half a dozen horses and nine men well shot van said seeing what the fox had done thank you the fox sounded modest letting the shot speak for itself come on men he shouted lay into them lay into them the men from the northlands did the imperials charge slowed as collisions and casualties took their toll of the cars in the front ranks the fight became a melee the sort of struggle in which gerins troopers had consistently proved to own the advantage gerin shot an arrow at an imperial officer with a red cloak draped around his shoulders the fellow was inconsiderate enough to lean to one side at the moment the shaft hissed past him gerin cursed how in the five hells am i supposed to get rid of the imperials if they keep trying not to get killed he demanded of no one in particular dagref as usual had an answer pretty rude of them isnt it father they arent behaving the way the enemywhoever the enemy isusually does when the minstrels sing their songs to the five hells with the minstrels too gerin growled he had a couple of reasons for despising minstrels first and foremost was that one who had practiced that calling had kidnapped his eldest son fifteen years before but the way they distorted the truth to fit into what made a good song grated on him too he wondered how the historians who recorded events down in the city of elabon would mention this clash to them of course he and his followers would be that highly variable creature the enemyrebels theyd call the warriors of the northlands and semibarbarians allied to true barbarians he knew their style being the enemy he probably wouldnt get any credit from the historians no matter what he did if he lost that he was the enemy would be enough to explain a great deal if he won theyd chalk it up to guile or trickery not courage as long as he won he didnt care how they chalked it up he wondered what sort of guile or trickery he could use to rouse the future historians ire looking around the crowded field he didnt see much opportunity for anything of the sort his men did have some advantage of position but the imperials had the advantage of numbers they seemed at least as liable to win as did the men of the northlands he sighed he hadnt wanted this particular battle not here not now he sighed again life had given him any number of things he didn t want the trick was to get through them as well and as quickly as he could to have the best chance to return to what he did in fact want he shot at that imperial officer againand missed again at a range from which he should not have missed he cursed in disgust the fellow seemed to lead a charmed life though gerin knew of no magic that would keep an arrow from piercing a man if properly aimed arrows would not pierce ferdulf but ferdulfs immunity was not the sort to which an ordinary man could readily aspire ferdulf swooped down on the officer from the elabonian empire for all the world like a illmannered hawk he shouted in the officers ears he waved hands in front of the officers face he flipped up his tunic in front of the drivers face giving the fellow a charming view of a semidivine backside with such distractions the officer couldnt do much in the way of commanding and the driver couldnt do much in the way of driving both men and the soldier in the car with them did their best to grab shoot or otherwise get rid of ferdulf they paid so much attention to him they didnt notice their chariot was about to collide with another till it did the officer and the soldier fell out the back of the car the driver got yanked over the front rail and under the horses hooves ferdulf flitted off to work more mischief elsewhere on the field gerin looked toward the forest in which hed placed those couple of dozen chariots he wished he had them in the fight either bursting from ambush or simply in the line with the rest of his men the imperials werent doing anything fancy but he didnt have enough men to drive them back that was becoming more and more obvious as the fight wore along all the imperials had to do was stolidly keep on fighting and odds were hed lose unless he came up with something spectacular for the life of him he had no idea what that might be he looked toward the oaks again he didnt want to send a messenger over there that was liable to draw the imperials attention to the wood which was the last thing he wanted a moment later he changed his mind about that truly the last thing he wanted was to be hacked to bloody pulp in the chariot a car full of imperials pulled alongside of his one of them cut at him with a sword the blade turned slightly so that the flat thudded against his ribs he hissed in pain anyhow and snatched out his own sword he and the imperial traded strokes till their chariots pulled apart from each other he thought he would have beaten the fellow had they fought longer being lefthanded he hadnt had to bring the sword across his body as they battled but what might have been didnt matter the truth was the trooper remained alive and hale to fight someone else gerin wondered how hale he was himself breathing hurt but didnt stab so he doubted hed broken ribs he could go on fighting he laughed which also hurt even if he had broken ribs he had to go on fighting dagref snapped his whip at one of the horses harnessed to another imperial chariot drawing near the horse screamed and reared and flinched aside despite the drivers best effort to force an attack you are getting good with that thing van said in admiring tones and then half spoiled the compliment by adding you must have got the practice flaying the hide off folk with your tongue i havent the faintest notion what youre talking about dagref replied with more dignity than a stripling had any business owning i know lad van said thats the trouble dagrefs dignity this time consisted of pretending he hadnt heard he didnt bring that off quite so well as he had the dispassionate answer more seriously gerin said maybe you ought to start practicing with a longer lash than most drivers carry son youre better with it than most that seems plain so you ought to get as much advantage from it as you can now thats not a bad idea father dagref said ive had the same thought myself as a matter of fact had he gerin studied his back which was remarkably uncommunicative maybe he had one thing dagref was never short on was ideas he seldom lied either unless he found an immediately expedient reason for doing so the fox couldnt see one here he also couldnt see anything that looked like victorycertainly not for his side the soldiers of the elabonian empire kept on fighting no matter what he did to them every once in a while in fist fights gerin had seen a man whom no blow would put down sooner or later even if that kind of fellow wasnt a particularly good fighter he would win by wearing down his foe that he thought worriedly was what he faced here he was hurting the imperials worse than they were hurting himhe could see that much the trouble was they could afford it better than he could their captain had brought more men to the battle than hed thought at first and hed known from the beginning he was outnumbered he looked over toward the trees again he waved on the off chance that anyone over there was looking in his direction and could recognize him at a considerable distance through the dust the chariots and horses had kicked up a sudden thrust at the flank and rear of the imperials would be extremely welcome about now the longer the men he d concealed in the forest delayed the greater the effect of that thrust would be he knew as much if they delayed much longer though the battle would be lost van looked in the same direction maybe theyre waiting for an invitation like shy maids hanging back from the dance there wont be any dance left if they dont come soon gerin said then he shouted out from among the oaks burst the chariots hed stationed there on toward the imperials they thundered picking up speed with every lengthening stride of their horses the crews in the cars shouted like men possessed arrows flew ahead of the chariots the imperials shouted too in dismay their whole line shook as gerins men took them from an unexpected direction come on the fox shouted to all his warriors whom the men of the elabonian empire had been pressing back now is our chance to beat those bastards as soon as the words were out of his mouth he wished hed phrased that differently it was all too accurate for comfort hed hoped the flank attack would win him the battle instead it was doing exactly what hed saidit was giving him a chance to win that it was doing no more than giving him a chance told him with unpleasant clarity how much trouble hed been in forward he shouted forward his line went instead of moving back forwardfor a little while then the imperial resistance stiffened had he had a hundred chariots in the wood he might have thrown the men of the elabonian empire into confusion enough to let him crush them but had he had a hundred chariots in the wood he was likelier to have weakened the rest of his force so much the battle would have been lost before they could think about a flank attack dagref drove the chariot past a car full of imperials van speared the horse closest to him spouting blood the beast screamed and foundered dagrefs slash made the driver scream too and clutch at his neck gerin shot one of the archers in the car the other dove out before anything dreadful could happen to him thats as near a clean sweep as makes no difference van said as the archer ran for his life youll talk differently if he shoots you from ambush gerin said if he shoots uncle van from ambush he probably wont talk at all dagref said over his shoulder to the five hells with logic and with both of you too van said he looked around now we get down to it are we going to lick these whoresons or are they going to lick us gerin looked around too what had been an advance was stalled the imperials had managed to contain the band that had attacked them from the forest without much fuss without much style but with plenty of men they pressed ahead with the fight hed mauled them he had indeed hurt them worse than theyd hurt him much worse they kept coming anyhow he didnt know what he was supposed to do about that it wasnt how warfare usually worked up here in the northlands finding foes stubborn enough to keep fighting no matter how badly battered they were wasnt easy anywhere a lifetime of experience and as much reading as hed been able to do convinced him of the truth there he had just reached that unhappy conclusion when dagref said i dont think we can force them back father i dont either gerin said they have too many menthats all there is to it anything even close to equal numbers and wed beat them weve proved that but we havent got equal numbers and we can t get them well what do you aim to do then fox van asked ive got two unpleasant choices gerin answered i can give up this battle admit weve lost retreat and yield the field to the imperials or i can keep on fighting do the best i can and watch them chew my army to pieces one bite at a time youre rightthose are both nasty choices van said if you see any others please let me know gerin said van grunted while he thought then shook his head gerin sighed too bad i was hoping you would dagref said what will you do father what would you do gerin returned the battle was lost one way or the other but he might at least get a lesson out of it it wasnt so dreadfully lost that a moment spent here would matter one way or the other id hold the army together dagref answered at once maybe theyll divide their force or send out detachments we can pick off the way they did before or leave themselves open to ambush if we still have an army we can take advantage of that if we let them grind us here like flour were finished youre my son all right for better and for worse we think alike im going to see if the imperials will the satisfied with a win and let us go gerin raised his voice in a reluctant shout pull back men of the northlands pull back the imperials made no more than a token pursuitcertainly less than he would have made were roles reversed he thought the commander facing him was the one whod led the first imperial force into the northlands the other one with the larger part of crebbig is army had more drive and more imaginationand was facing aragis who while surely a driver imagined very little gerin had scant time to worry about aragis he had scant time to worry about anything except making certain he put enough distance between his army and that of the elabonian empire to let his men camp safely that with some effort he managed adiatunnus came up to him after the army halted and what do we do now the trokm chieftain asked to the crows with me if i know gerin answered back next contents x what the army did over the next several days was retreat gerin fought a number of sharp skirmishes with the imperials he never had any trouble pushing back their advance parties whenever the main force came up to support the scouts though he had to fall back himself before long he found himself with no choice but to abandon the swath of aragis country in which his army had been foraging he cursed at having to do it but it was either that or move south and let the imperials get between him and his own homeland he resolved not to do that no matter what if the elabonian empire wanted him out of his own holdings the imperials would have to come and dig him out one keep at a time just as aragis would have had to do if hed beaten him in the field good thing we stole their supply train van said as he gnawed sausage of an evening anything that keeps us going is good gerin said well have a hard time doing it again worse lucktheyve pushed us a long ways back from the elabon way now see any chance of turning loose a decent counterattack the outlander asked taking another bite i wish i did gerin said this fellow isnt leaving himself open though he doesnt fight like a trokm or one of our crackbrained barons up here i wish he would just charge straight ahead without looking where hes going it would make life a lot simpler but he doesnt want to do that slow but sure thats him doesnt seem stupid anyhow van said he looked back over his shoulder toward the northeast if he keeps coming hes liable to push us back into the valley of ikos whether we want to go there or not that thought had also crossed my mind gerin said unhappily if we have to go back through there well go back through there thats all biton is the farseeing god if he cant see far enough to figure out that were doing what we have to do not what we want to do hes not as smart as i think nor as smart as he thinks he is either van grunted gods arent gods because theyre smart fox theyre gods because theyre strong i wish i could say you were wrong gerin replied the trouble is i know too well youre right he looked around where was dagref last time hed noticed his son the lad had been eating sausage and journeybread not far away he didnt see dagref now hed waited for some pungent comment from him about gods and whether they were strong or smart and now almost disappointed realized hed have to do without a moment later he stopped worrying about dagref for rihwin the fox strode importantly up to him and said lord king im sure i know how all our troubles may be solved rihwin was enough to worry about any time rihwin sure was sure to make gerin worry im glad youre sure he said his voice as polite as he could make it that doesnt necessarily mean youre right of course some people have trouble understanding the difference rihwin looked wounded an admirable artistic effort lord king you have no call to make fun of me why doesnt he van asked in tones of genuine curiosity you leave yourself open to it often enough and to the five hells with you rihwin replied with dignity gerin held up a hand never mind enough wrangling how my fellow fox may all our troubles be solved rihwin raised an eyebrow he knew irony when he heard it for that if not for a number of other things gerin gave him credit but he answered as if gerin had meant his sardonic question soberly we need divine aid against the men from south of the high kirs youre a man from south of the high kirs van pointed out wait gerin forestalled the outlander he fixed rihwin with a baleful stare why do i think i already know the god whose aid you are going to tell me we must seek because he is one of the gods whom you know best perhaps rihwin said because he has come to your aid and to the aid of the northlands before because he is a god who has no reason to love the elabonian empire and a great many reasons to loathe it those must be the reasons you have in mindis it not so lord king mm possibly gerin allowed that mavrix is also lord of the sweet grape and what comes from the sweet grape also enters my mind for some reason or other why do you suppose that might be i havent the faintest notion rihwin replied van guffawed if you were as innocent as you sound youd still be a virgin at your age and that at least youre not rihwin ignored him which wasnt easy lord king he said addressing himself directly to gerin do you deny can you deny mavrix is our best hope among the gods of course i deny it gerin answered so would you if you had any sense though all the gods know thats too much to ask for biton is a god of this country mavrix is even more an imported interloper than we elabonians are biton is also aloof rihwin said the only way you got him to move against the monsters was with selatres help and with the added irritation of an appeal to mavrix he looked triumphant gerin let out a long exasperated breath rihwin if you want another cup of wine take another cup of wine if you think the risk is worth it go ahead if you get away with it well and good if mavrix tears your head off my view is that you bloody well asked for it but dont go wrapping your own desires in a scheme you claim will benefit all of us i should like to drink wine again aye rihwin said but i am no longer mad for it as i was before i slaked my thirst and my desire not long ago and when i slaked my thirst not long ago let me remind you mavrix made no appearance of any sort your jittery predictions to the contrary notwithstanding i propose enlisting him in our cause regardless of whether or not in the accomplishment thereof i once more taste the blood of the sweet grape wella disinterested rihwin now ive seen everything gerin said rihwin lookedno not indignant rihwin looked angry gerin for once did not think the expression was donned for the occasion to be casually discarded at need he thought hed struck a nerve all rihwin said though was are you sure you are disinterested in this matter lord king or are you prejudiced against me because of events now past honh van said who wouldnt be some of the things youve done would make the hair stand up on a bald man but rihwins question brought gerin up short he prided himself on viewing the world around him as disinterestedly as he could anyone who could be anything close to disinterested about rihwin though needed divine detachment not that afforded to mere mortal men slowly gerin said youre like the boy who says that just because hes pushed his sister into the mud half a dozen times theres no reason to think hell do it again not so rihwin said unlike that boy whom some of my bastards assuredly resemble i have learned my lesson i urge you to summon mavrix regardless of whether i play any role whatever in the summoning and also regardless of whether i get to drink wine then or afterwards after a bow to gerin he strode off bugger me with a pine cone van said now ive seen everything too if i thought you were wrong i would argue with you gerin answered he scratched his head much to my own surprise im willing to believe my fellow fox means what he says that brings me to the next question on the list is what he says a good notion or a foolish one having the help of a god is is better than not having the help of a god van said thats a general working rule of course mavrix is the sort of god who has a way of showing you that general working rules arent all theyre cracked up to be isnt he thats putting it mildly the fox said and theres this foolish feud ferdulf has chosen to pick with him too if mavrix does come here its more likely to be to warm ferdulfs backside than to give us a hand against the empire but if he did come to help us van said aye gerin said if he did he looked around again for dagref when he realized why he was doing that he blinked in surprise he admired the wits of few men enough to ask them for their views without his quite noticing it his son had become one of that small select group dagref did come back to the fire mavrix he said when gerin asked him about trying to summon the sithonian god mavrix hmm it was almost as if he had never heard of the god of wine and fertility gerin clicked his tongue between his teeth in annoyance yes mavrix you rememberfawnskins thyrsus tongue like a frogs oh yes of course i remember dagref said but even that sounded absentminded nothing like the sharp comeback he would usually have given he yawned rubbed his eyes and yawned again oh by the gods gerin snapped did you go and jump into an alepot is that why youre acting as if you havent got two sticks of sense to rub together im not drunk dagref said gerin eyed him with some reluctance he decided his son was telling the truth after one more yawn dagref went on i am tired am i allowed to be tired you werent acting that tired before you went off to wherever you went off to the fox grumbled since you werent you can give me an answer to my question before you lie down on your blanket should i seek mavrixs aid or not i dont see why you shouldnt seek it dagref answered you might be better off if you dont get it though thats what the oracle biton gave would seem to mean wouldnt it he hesitated if of course biton was talking about mavrix and not some other god altogether gerin grunted then said all right go to sleep youve earned it youve given me something new to think about i admit dagref unfolded his blanket wrapped himself in it and was snoring very shortly thereafter gerin eyed him and scratched his head his son didnt reek of ale and had spoken and thought clearly enough when he decided to put his mind to it but that mind had been somewhere else somewhere far away the fox let out a puzzled grunt that wasnt like dagref but his son once he chose to pay attentionsome attentionto what he was saying had indeed given him something new to think about the idea of summoning a god in the hope that he would ignore the summons hadnt occurred to the fox he doubted it would have occurred to him either dagref had a sideways way of looking at the world that could come in handy sometimes no doubt about it ah but the next question is what happens if we summon dear mavrix and he does decide to lend a hand gerin murmured that could prove embarrassing biton had plainly saidas plainly as the god ever said anything anyhowhe would be better off if he got no divine help when he asked for it what would he do if mavrix pitched in against the forces of the elabonian empire after some thought gerin smiled if mavrix did decide to aid him he could summon some other god so that his failure there would bring him into conformity with the oracle he glanced over to dagref that had an underhanded quality to it his sleeping son would appreciate then he glanced over at dagref again in sudden sharp suspicion if a young man disappeared for a while and then came back tired and with his mind far away from whatever his father was talking about one obvious explanation sprang to mind that it was obvious didnt make it true gerin looked this way and that to see if he could spy maeva he couldnt which proved nothing one way or the other the only ways to prove anything would be to catch the two of them in the act if there was any act in which to catch them or to have her belly start to swelland even that wouldnt prove who the father was van lay snoring a few feet from dagref for dagrefs sake gerin hoped vans mind didnt work the way his own did next evening rihwins eyes got big and round do you mean what you say lord king he breathed of course not gerin snapped im lying to build your hopes up he snorted in exasperation yes i mean what i say curse it i ve thought things through and ive decided you had a good idea there after all we shall try to summon the lord of the sweet grape to our aid he wished hed looked up before he spoke ferdulf drifting overhead had been close enough to hear the demigod dove down to screech in his face you want my father here again i forbid it you cant forbid it gerin said you can make my life difficultthe gods know you do make my life difficultbut you cant stop me ferdulf i am going to do this what you do afterwards is your affair and mavrixs hell be sorry if he comes here ferdulf said darkly youll be sorry if he comes here and you try annoying him gerin answered hes stronger than you are and youd do well to remember it ferdulf stuck out his tongue im not afraid of him bring him on hell regret it he will gerin shrugged and forbore to argue any more people had an amazing ability to put unpleasant truths out of their minds the fox saw that also applied to demigods for that matter it probably applied to gods too shall we now summon the lord of the sweet grape to the northlands without any further delay rihwin said with a sidelong glance at ferdulf ferdulf sneered ill delay you all right ill turn all the wine you have left into vinegar the same as i did with that wagonload you captured from the imperials no you wont gerin said much as he might have told blestar he wouldnt jump off the palisade walkway back at fox keep and whats to stop me ferdulf said sticking out his tongue again if you turn that wine to vinegar gerin said deliberately i will use the vinegar to call your father it being the best i have for the purpose and i will tell him why i could use nothing better then we can all find out what he chooses to do about that ferdulfs glare came close to scorching him where he stood how could a mere mortal prove so hateful he demanded practice gerin answered come on lets get on with this he had rihwin do the actual honors drinking a cup of wine and imploring mavrix to appear his fellow fox was the one who most wanted the sithonian god to come forth gerin himself would have been just as gladgladderto have mavrix stay down in sithonia the only reason ferdulf wanted to see his father was to harass him we summon thee lord of the sweet grape rihwin called sipping the wine he and his riders had captured from the warriors from south of the high kirs he didnt shudder with ecstasy as he had before he d drunk his first cup of wine in so many years he simply drank without making a fuss about it gerin took that for a good sign well where is he ferdulf said nastily when mavrix did not forthwith appear is he asleep is he drunk is he off buggering a pretty boy or perhaps a pretty lamb you would do well i think to watch your tongue gerin said ferdulf stuck it out farther than any man could have and for good measure waggled the end of it there he said indistinctlyhe didnt bother pulling it back in before he started talking im watching it it isnt doing very much though heh gerin saidthe sound of a laugh without the mirth rihwin drank more wine and called on mavrix again the sithonian god stayed wherever he was he did not come to that part of the northlands rihwin looked unhappy so did gerin though he did not feel that way maybe he wont come maybe he wont hear us rihwin sounded as disappointed as he looked maybe he wont gerin also sounded as disappointed as he looked but again he did not feel that way maybe hes afraid of me ferdulf sounded arrogant he was a demigod he had reason to be arrogant most of the time he did not in gerins view have reason to be arrogant when he was talking about making a god afraid maybe when he was older ferdulf would figure that out for himself maybe he would stay arrogant as long as he lived maybe if he stayed arrogant around gods he wouldnt live so long as he expected rihwin drank yet again we implore thee lord of the sweet grape to favor us with thy presence he said when nothing happened gerin began well all right youve had yourself some wine rihwin but the lord of the sweet grape doesnt and then the lord of the sweet grape did glowing softly mavrix appeared before gerin rihwin and ferdulf the sithonian god did not look happy mavrix in fact looked intensely annoyed well what is it now he asked in a peevish voice you keep bellowing in my ear until i can hardly hear myself think rudeness thats what it is welcome lord of the sweet grape gerin said now that mavrix was here he had to make the best of it we have summoned you to the northlands once more to implore you for aid against the elabonian empire and and to take your muchused backside out of here and never come back again ferdulf broke in is that so mavrix said between that and so he moved from where he had been to right next to ferdulf apparently without crossing the intervening space he seized his son ferdulf squalled and tried to get away but could not mavrix gave ferdulf a harder more thorough spanking than gerin had ever dared administer this is for the filthy tongue in your head after a brief pause he walloped his son again harder than ever and this is for presuming to tamper with the blood of the sweet grapeso much wine wasted so much wine men will never drink in an aside to gerin rihwin muttered id do that to ferdulf for wasting a wagonload of wine too if only i dared mavrix has the power to do it gerin whispered back presently mavrix left off chastising ferdulf who collapsed in a weeping puddle the sithonian god turned his fathomless black eyes on the fox what were you saying before we endured that tasteless interruption lord mavrix i was saying that i hoped you might change your mind and aid me against the forces of the elabonian empire gerin replied no mavrix said he then repeated himself several times at increasing volume no no no does that adequately acquaint you with my feelings in this matter but why not lord rihwin asked why mavrix screechedyes he was exercised and gerin felt a certain amount of relief that rihwin had beat him to the question since this whole summoning had been his fellow foxs idea let the ohsoclever fellow take the heat for it and heat there was mavrix continued high and shrill i am not required to tell you anything you pustule on the backside of this backwoods nest of barbarians i know you are not required to do anything of the sort lord rihwin said for a wonder he had the sense to walk very small i thought you might in your great generosity deign to tell me thats all well mavrix said somewhat mollified by a mortals flattery you are trying but then you are trying too if you take my meaning he stuck out his tongue at rihwin but then drew it back in all right all right if you must know if you must one reason i have no interest whatever in coming to your aid is on account of what this little wretch did he dug his foot into ferdulfs ribs in what was half a poke half a kick i didnt do half of what i wish i could ferdulf snarled mavrix ignored him which was probably his good fortune the sithonian god went on dont you think theres a basic rudeness involved in insulting a deity and then beseeching him for aid dont you lord i did not insult you rihwin said gerin the fox did not insult you we are the ones who seek your aid not your son gerin would have been just as well pleasedbetter than just as well pleasedhad rihwin not mentioned him but when mavrix turned those deep deep black eyes his way he found he had no choice but to nod assuredly lord i offered you no insult he said and that was truehe unlike ferdulf knew better than to insult a god i dont care mavrix said sniffily my son insulted me and he associates with you therefore you might as well have insulted me that was breathtakingly unfair had gerin really wanted mavrixs aid he would have protested loud and long since he didnt he contented himself with saying i myself would never do such a thing and i cannot control everyone who associates with me he gave rihwin a pointed stare i dont care mavrix repeated i am insulted and one of yours insulted me you get nothing from me in return im not one of his ferdulf shouted im yours he showed me a pleasant peasant wench to tempt me to his keep mavrix answered pointing at gerin i let myself be tempted and then i let myself be tempted you ferdulf are the result ferdulfs curses aimed impartially at gerin and mavrix were loud and fierce and vile in point of fact rihwin who had a more intimate acquaintance with the charms of peasant women than did gerin had chosen fulda whod proved tempting to mavrix gerin refrained from mentioning that ferdulf was quite upset enough as things were rihwin said what other reasons have you for refusing lord none i need discuss with you mavrix said haughtily none i intend discussing with you whatever they may be they are mine and no business of yours in any particular hed said pretty much the same thing about his first reason which made gerin whose curiosity never rested ask can we not persuade you to explain yourself maybe mavrix would have explained himself maybe he wouldnt before he could speak though ferdulf broke in can we not persuade you to bugger off can we not persuade you to take a flying futter at fast fomor as the trokmoi say can we not persuade you to gerin did not get a chance to find out what else ferdulf might have wanted to persuade his father to do because mavrix gave the demigod another licking more savage than either of the first two demigod ferdulf might have been but he was not strong enough to withstand punishment from a god he wailed and shrieked and made noises not far different from those any child might have made after a drubbing from its father through that racket mavrix said to gerin you see how it is this north country is unpleasant enough without the insults with them it is intolerable i go and if fate be kind i shall not return he vanished well gerin said to rihwin so much for that eryes lord king rihwin answered i think it shall be some long while before i once more seek to have aught to do with mavrix lord of the sweet grape he sketched a salute and strode off shaking his head that left gerin alone with ferdulf not a position he would have chosen but the choice was not his to make he thought about walking off as rihwin had ferdulf after all had been the author of his own troubles the fox was mildly surprised to discover himself not hardhearted enough to leave the battered little demigod by himself in his pain are you all right he asked ferdulf you can bugger off too ferdulf growled youre laughing at me you hate me everybody hates me not quite everybody gerin answered though that certainly isn t from any lack of effort on your part you seem to go out of your way sometimes to make yourself hateful go away ferdulf said youre not my father i havent got a father as far as im concerned he isnt real he doesnt exist you were scandalized about the foolish god of the weshapar who said the same thing about his neighbor gods gerin said do you think it sounds any wiser coming out of your mouth i dont care ferdulf said i just dont care you had a proper father a father who cared about you gerin burst into laughter so bitterly raucous it made ferdulf stare the fox said what in the five hells do you know about it my father thought he could cure me of books and make me a warrior with the back of his hand it was only when he finally figured out he was wrong that he shipped me over the high kirs to be rid of me but you ended up a warrior anyhow ferdulf said so i did gerin said but that was my doing not hisand i didnt waste his time and mine with a pack of childish tricks and tries for revenge i am not a child ferdulf said i am a demigod you are a demigod the fox agreed but youre also a child thats what makes things so difficult for everyone around you good ferdulf said and drifted away apparently none the worse for wear from the beatings mavrix had given him and just as apparently intent on taking no notice whatever of gerins sermon the fox sighed he didnt suppose he should have been surprised aye lord king thats how it is fandil fandors son said as he rubbed down his horse i got around the imperials with no great trouble but it didnt do me as much good as i would have liked it didnt do you as much good as youd like either he patted the horses neck i will tell you this thoughi had no trouble getting through the bastards and back again wonderful gerin said sourly but once you did get through you found that aragis had gone to earth thats what i said lord king fandil returned to rubbing the horses back gerin sympathized with the animal fandils father had been called fandor the fat fandil was more along the lines of the chubby but gerin wouldnt have wanted to try carrying him on his back he doesnt plan on doing any more fighting out in the open then gerin persisted not if he can help it fandil answered he and his army are holed up in the strongest keeps they can find and he doesnt think the imperials can pry him out of them before winter comes and they get too hungry to stay in the field if they tear up the countryside but then go home what does he care hes ahead of the game his peasants arent gerin said but that only made him laugh at himself as long as the imperials went away aragis didnt care what happened to the peasantry gerin supposed he had to sympathize with that but aragis didnt care what happened to the peasantry any other time either fandil said looks like the imperials are settling down to the sieges too dont know whether theyll try knocking down walls or just sit there and starve the places out one at a timeif they can if they can gerin agreed the one thing im sure of is that aragis wouldnt put his men into castles that are easy to take and he wouldnt put them into castles that dont have plenty in their cellars either you know best about that lord king fandil said but what it looks like to me is were on our own over here gerin sighed it looks that way to me too fandil weve been on our own over here all along and we havent done any too well so far youll come up with something gerin might not have confidence but fandil like a lot of his men did i hope so gerin said to the crows with me if i have the faintest notion what it is though fandil didnt seem to hear that any more than aragis had heard gerin when he said he wasnt a sorcerer not for the first time nor for the five hundredth either he wondered why people didnt pay more attention to what other people said they already had their own ideas and that seemed to be enough for them the next morning he and van and dagref rode out along the picket line of horsemen he kept west of his force to warn him if the imperials decided to come at him again for the moment the men of the elabonian empire were holding back they had pickets out too in chariots to warn of any sudden move gerin might make against them theyre not bad fellows one of rihwins riders said pointing toward an imperial chariot perhaps a quarter of a mile away for business like this they dont bother us and we dont bother them when the time comes to really fight again theyll really go after us i suppose and well do our best to fill em full of arrow holes but whats the use till then none i can see gerin allowed its a pretty sensible way of going about things when you get down to it he glanced over at van in the outlanders younger days odds were he would have thundered out something about killing the foe whenever you found any chance to do it had gerin had adiatunnus with him the trokm chieftain probably would have said the same thing now but van only shrugged and nodded as if to say the horsemans words made good sense to him too little by little he was mellowing a couple of riders farther along the line maeva patrolled a stretch of meadow no lord king she said when gerin asked her i havent seen anything out of the ordinary as the earlier rider had she pointed toward an imperial chariot out of arrow range to the west theyre keeping an eye on us same as were keeping an eye on them all right gerin said right at the moment im not sorry things are quiet we need the time to pull ourselves back together theyre probably thinking the same thing about us lord king maeva answered seriously we had to pull back aye but we bloodied them they have more room to make mistakes than we do though van said by the gods we didnt make any mistakes i could see in that last fight and we lost it anyhow dagref said nothing at all that was unusual enough to make gerin keep an eye on his son as maeva kept an eye on the force from the elabonian empire and as the imperials kept an eye on gerins army for his part dagref was keeping an eye on maeva as best gerin could tell from watching the back of his sons head dagrefs eyes did not leave her she kept looking at him too well well the fox thought isnt that interesting gerin looked over at van again too the outlander was also eyeing his daughter but not gerin judged with that kind of suspicion van was still trying to figure out why in blazes she wanted to take the field and not worrying about anything else life would get even more interesting if maevas belly started to bulge gerin had had that thought before he wondered whether dagref worried about such things he might well not have himself at that age a man and a womanor a boy and a girlcould enjoy each other a good many ways without running the risk did dagref know about them he had little in the way of real experience but who could guess what all he d heard what all hed read who could guess what all maeva knew either still shaking his head gerin tapped dagref on the shoulder let s get moving he said with obvious reluctanceobvious to the fox at any rate and probably to maeva toodagref flicked the reins the horses began to walk and then to trot dagref was not so unsubtle as to look back over his shoulder at maeva gerin however could look back with no fear of rousing vans suspicions and he did sure enough maeva was staring after the chariot maybe that was because it held her father gerin wouldnt have bet on it though not anything he couldnt afford to lose after hed finished the tour of his pickets and convinced himself the imperials werent going to take him by surprise he had dagref drive back to camp when he returned rihwin and ferdulf were in the middle of a screaming row each plastering the other with names that stuck like glue van descended from the chariot and tried to break up the fight with the result that both rihwin and ferdulf turned on him gerin hadnt tried to interfere between his friend and the little demigod knowing that was what would happen if he did hed had a sufficiencyindeed an oversupplyof people shouting at him lately and saw no need to encourage more if van was of the opinion he hadnt been getting his own fair share of abuse he was in gerins view welcome to it vans furious bass roar blended with ferdulfs baritone and rihwins higher lighter voice to produce discord in threepart disharmony dagref rolled his eyes youd think uncle van would have better sense than to get mixed up in that he said aye good sense is hard to come by among these parts isnt it gerin said he didnt think he was being much more than his usual sardonic self his sons mind though worked in the same channel as his own dagref whirled around and gave him a look half stricken half relieved you know dont you he said i know now gerin said id wondered for a while aye you dont think van knows do you dagref asked in some alarmnot enough as far as gerin was concerned but some if he did know the fox answered do you think hed waste his time yelling at rihwin and ferdulf a point dagref said still not happily you had better be careful gerin saiduseless advice to most youths but dagref was notin some ways was notcut from the usual cloth if you get her with child youll think the five hells had come crashing down on you no matter how much fun youre having now another point dagref admitted there are he paused and coughed and might have blushed a little as he searched for words there are ways of doing things where we dont have to worry about that yes i know about those ways gerin said nodding i wasnt sure whether you did eri do dagref said and stopped there gerin was content to stop there too he couldnt very well keep an eye on his son not in this matter he couldnt he couldand didhope dagref and maeva would stay content to stop with substitutes when they found themselves alone together whatever maeva did she threw herself into it wholeheartedly in that she very much resembled both her parents that meant gerin would have to rely on dagrefs good sense and on dagrefs having good sense at a time when good sense was supposed to go flying out the door with any other lad of dagrefs age it would have been the most forlorn of forlorn hopes gerin studied his son he still didnt think the odds were any too good but he didnt think they were hopeless either he sighed whatever the odds were he had no choice but to accept them he rubbed his chin that wasnt strictly true maybe i ought to send maeva home to keep this from getting any further out of hand than it is already dagref looked stricken dont do that father you didnt send her home for anything she did so it wouldnt be fair to send her home for anything im doing unless youre violating her by force which i doubt you would do and doubt you could do youre not doing it altogether by yourself the fox pointed out at which dagref blushed again in musing tones gerin went on maybe i should send you home instead i hope you dont send either of us dagref said if you have to send one of us though send me gerin slapped him on the back thats well spoken for i know you arent trying to get away from the fighting but i do think ill leave you both here he found one other question to ask what will you do if van finds out he didnt think dagref would be able to come up with any answer for that but dagref did and promptly too run well all right gerin said with a startled laugh thats probably the best thing you could do though i dont know if youll be able to run far enough or fast enough have to try dagref risked a wry smile that reminded gerin achingly of himself maybe he wont be able to decide whether to set out after me first or maeva and well both be able to get away maybe gerin laughed again van though was too automatically competent a warrior to dither at a time like that he would settle on one of dagref or maevaprobably dagreffirst and then the other the fox hoped his son wouldnt have to learn that from experience after a few days scouts brought back word that the imperials looked to be getting ready to push forward again gerin clicked his tongue between his teeth far from a happy sound i knew it was coming he said with a sigh id have been happier if it hadnt come so soon though what will we do lord king a scout asked fight i suppose gerin sighed again the only other choice we have is letting ourselves get pushed back into the valley of ikos and i dont want to do that with everything else thats gone wrong in this campaign i dont need to have biton angry at me too we lost the last time we tried to withstand the imperials dagref pointed out why should this time be any different last time they picked the groundor they didnt leave me much choice which amounts to the same thing the fox answered they struck faster and harder than i thought they would we have better warning this time im going to fight where i want to fight by the gods what sort of ground are you thinking of dagref asked i have a place in mind as a matter of fact gerin said its a long thin stretch of meadow with really heavy woods on either side off to the left beyond the woods theres a little hill i intend to screen off with a good many of rihwins riders do you see whats in my mind i think so dagref answered you want to put men back there and trap the imperials between your two forces dont you thats what im planning yes gerin agreed now i have to hope the imperials dont see it as clearly as youve done but the imperials to his loud vehement and profane dismay did see the trap and refused to fall into it when his riders picked off one of the scouts from south of the high kirs he found out why we ve got swerilas in command of us now the prisoner said swerilas the slippery men call him he sent arpulo werekas son back west to take charge of the sieges against gerin im gerin gerin said against aragis then i cant keep you rebels straight the captured imperial said swerilas figured that was the easier part of the job so he gave it to arpulo youve caused arpulo trouble swerilas decided he needed to deal with you himself were it not for the honor he shows me its a compliment i could do without gerin murmured and then swerilas the slippery eh he d be the fellow who was in charge of your second army wouldnt he aye the prisoner said arpulo led the first gerin scowled his life had just got more difficult he had arpulos measure even if hed lacked the manpower to beat him in their latest clash but swerilas an ekename like the slippery was all too close to the fox and swerilas had shown that he had more than a few ideas of his own gerin would have been happier fighting a bruiser who didnt think very well after he sent the prisoner away he decided he might have been lucky that swerilas had stayed out of his trap rather than letting himself go in with his eyes open and then smashing out in both directions at once gerins force was inferior to his in numbers against an average commander like arpulo the fox had no qualmswell few qualmsabout dividing even an inferior force against someone who knew what he was doing as swerilas plainly did dividing his force was asking to be destroyed in detail with another scowl gerin did his best to come up with a new plan against swerilas he had fewer options than hed had against arpulo and swerilas no doubt would be able to think of more unpleasant things to do to him than would have crossed arpulos fierce but unimaginative mind gerin dispatched all his horsemen to harass swerilas scouts to drive them back on the main body of imperials and to disrupt the imperials foraging as much as he could you riders are the one force we have that the imperials dont know everything about he told rihwin the fox well wring every particle of advantage we can out of that aye lord king rihwin said we shall fall on the men of the elabonian empire like a whirlwind we shall trouble them with continuous attacks from all directions until they weepingly regret ever having stirred north of the high kirs that was as grandiloquent as anything gerin had heard lately even from rihwin but rihwin fortunately was almost as long on fighting talent as he was on bombast gerin thumped him on the shoulder aye thats good thats what i want from you the harder he has to work against your horsemen the less leisure hell have to do anything against the main army here i shall think on this with gratitude as the imperials chew my force to pieces rihwin replied bowing go howl gerin said i dont want you to get chewed to pieces im counting on you not to let yourself and your force get chewed to pieces by the gods i dont want to fight a pitched battle with this swerilas i want you to keep him running every which way so hes too busy and hot and bothered to come and fight a pitched battle with the whole army oh i understand you lord king rihwin said whether what you want and what swerilas wants are one and the same remains to be seen thats true in any fight gerin said ill move forward as far as i can with the bulk of my force if you do get in trouble ill support you as best i can he set a hand on rihwins shoulder again do your best not to get in too much trouble would you how can you say such a thing about me rihwin drew back in an artful display of indignation have i ever been anything in all my days save staid and sedate he had an excellent straight face no never gerin agreed soberly both men laughed then rihwin said will you let ferdulf come along with me it will be easier to annoy the imperials if i have the best notion i can of where they are where theyre moving and what they want to try to do to me if you can talk ferdulf into going with you youre welcome to him gerin answered his grin was distinctly sardonic in fact you re welcome to him as a general principle as a general principle i dont want him thanks rihwins grin closely matched gerins didnt you hear us going at each other a few days ago most of the northlands heard you i should think gerin said i daresay you can understand me then as a flying spy though he has his uses whether hell want anything to do with you of course remains to be seen gerin said hes liable not to be very happy with you you know after the rough handling mavrix gave himyou were the one who was bound and determined to summon the sithonian god yes thats what ferdulf was screeching about before rihwin said but ill take my chances now you certainly will gerin agreed at which rihwin gave him a dirty look gerin went on talk with him though if after hes done insulting you some more he decides to go along i think youre righthell be quite useful to you as a flying spy after something close to half a lifetime with you and van of the strong arm i shant let insults from a badtempered baby demigod faze me rihwin said off he went ostentatiously ignoring the sour stare gerin sent after him sure enough he managed to persuade ferdulf to accompany the force of riders after the shouting ferdulf put up when he made the request though gerin wouldnt have blamed rihwin if hed buried mavrixs son upside down in the ground that at least would have made ferdulf shut up watching the little demigod wheel and swoop above the horsemen gerin was also just as well pleased not to be under there in the same way he would have been just as well pleased not to be under a flock of crows with griping bowels the crows would have let flyor let fallat random ferdulf if the evil mood took him could aim van was not watching ferdulf as the riders trotted away he was trying to spot maeva among the warriors on horseback and not having much luck turning to gerin he said i still wish youd made her go home shes doing what she wants to do you know the fox answered you couldnt stop it more than another couple of years at the most that would be good van said in a couple of years likely enough we wouldnt be worrying about the imperials any more unless wed already lost to them of course gerin replied no waiti take your point but we would be worrying about aragis or the trokmoi or the gradi or somebody by the gods if maeva wanted to fight somebody shed find somebody to fight and if you didnt feel like letting her shed fight you maybe maybe the prospect didnt make van look any happier but thats not the only thing i fret about come on foxyou know what soldiers are like well what if i do the fox said anyone who tried to take anything she didnt feel like giving would regret it as long as he lived and that might not be long either weve been over this ground before you know oh aye the outlander let out a long sad sigh why couldnt she have just stayed home and come to notice dagref say we could have married them off and that would have been an end to it gerin didnt gape like a fool he didnt burst into hysterical laughter he didnt even suffer a coughing fit the effort he needed to keep from doing any of those things would have let him lift the temple at ikos over his head and throw it from one end of the valley to the other in an offhand tone that somehow wasnt more elaborately casual than it should have been he answered if they like the idea you wouldnt see me complaining well have to see if we can make it seem as if theyre the ones who came up with it not us truth that van said one of the turns of phrase hed learned from the trokmoi that still occasionally showed up in his speech if anybody older than i was came up with a notion back when i was a sprat i didnt want anything to do with it he cocked his head to one side and studied the fox and you you must have been a terror when it came to listening to your elders who me gerin did his best to look like innocence personified his best evidently wasnt good enough for van guffawed aye you captain he said go on and look sweet all you fancy my guess is you werent any more ready to pay the least bit of attention to what your father told you than dagref is for you my father hit me harder and more often than ive hit dagref gerin said after a brief pause for thought that made me more likely to listen but i think less likely to agree van smacked a fist into the palm of his other hand sometimes youll settle for getting them to listen that way you say that now gerin said what did you say then ahh what difference does that make the outlander replied with a grin i was just a brat then wet behind the ears of course i wouldnt have believed that if anybody told it to me mind you rihwin began sending back prisoners and the occasional wagon pilfered from the imperials and news of what swerilas the slippery was up to the empires general looks to be pulling all his men back into a knot one of rihwins riders reported the same way a snail will go back into its shell if you poke it in one of its little horns he held up a couple of fingers imitating a snail the creatures have their eyes at the ends of those stalks gerin said a fact hed picked up in the city of elabon hed never had occasion to trot it out in all the many years since but his fiendishly tenacious memory hadnt let him forget it now that he finally did get to use it he discovered the horseman didnt believe him with a laugh the fellow said thats funny lord king i mean it gerin said indignantly if those little black dots on the ends of the stalks arent eyes where would a snail keep em how am i supposed to answer a question like that the rider said the whole world knows snails have no eyes but they do the fox insisted he couldnt persuade the horseman he wasnt joking finally in disgust he sent him back to rihwin gerin was still fuming when he turned to van who had listened to the last part of his exchange with the scout can you believe the stubborn ignorance of that man van chuckled he shook his head but not in the way gerin would have wanted oh no you dont captain the outlander said you can try and confuse a rider from some backwoods keep as much as you like but youre not going to do it to me by the gods when you come right down to it that fellow was righteverybody knows snails dont have any eyes gerin snarled a curse and stalked off he snarled another curse a couple of days later when the imperials mauled a detachment of rihwins riders the damage done was bad enough that rihwin felt he had to come back himself to explain they outwitted me he said sounding angry and embarrassed at the same time they had a small band showing making their way through wheatfields but more of them were lurking in the trees as soon as we were well engaged with the decoys out they swarmed thats unfortunate gerin said he looked down his nose at rihwin its also unfortunate that you let yourself be fooled by the sort of trick weve used so often ourselves i didnt expect it of the imperials rihwin said a little sullenly one of the reasons i came north of the high kirs all those years ago if youll remember is because interesting things happen here while all stays stodgy south of the mountains the way the emperors men fought in this campaign had given me little reason to change my view except for the forces commanded by this swerilas the slippery gerin said he beat us when we were almost down to cassat and he did it the same way he did here he stuck out one force and then he struck with another one we didnt expect if bait looks too juicy to be true my fellow fox it likely is but it didnt look too juicy to be true rihwin angrily kicked at the dirt by the gods you would have sent in the riders with no more hesitation than i showed it was a chance encounter nothing more no it seemed a chance encounteror you wouldnt have been ambushed gerin said he must have set it up by gauging where your detachment was which way they were headed and how fast he kicked at the dirt too which means swerilas is very slippery indeed i want another crack at him rihwin said no one does that to me not without paying for it unfortunately someone did do it to you gerin answered and i dont want you charging after the imperials all wild for revenge swerilas will be waiting for something like that for a wonder he got through to rihwin aye belike youre right rihwin said its just what a man from the city of elabon would expect in the northlandslet the locals make fools of themselves and then count on them to make bigger fools of themselves trying to recover of course odds are he didnt know he was facing another man from south of the high kirs gerin said go aheadrub salt in the throbbing wound rihwin struck a pose of affronted dignity then it collapsed and he chuckled speaking of men from south of the high kirs lord king did i tell you weve captured my cousin no gerin raised an eyebrow how did that happen usual sort of way rihwin answered he got wounded in the shoulderdoesnt look too badfell out of his chariot and we scooped him up when i found out his name was ulfilas batwins son i asked about his family because my uncles son batwin is a man of about my age and sure enough we are first cousins once removed youve been removed by twenty years and a mountain range too gerin said he sighed and put an arm around rihwin all right you walked into this one its over dont do it again he laughed i sound as if im talking to one of my sons dont i one of these days maybe just maybe youll grow up one of them has done it and the second is on the way i resent the imputation rihwin looked affronted again go ahead gerin said cheerfully ill probably have to keep right on lecturing you till they shovel dirt over one of us or the other you could shut up instead rihwin suggested they laughed both knowing that gerin shutting up was about as likelyor rather as unlikelyas rihwin growing up ferdulf came flying toward gerins main force here he comes the demigod shouted that cursed horse turd of a swerilas is heading this way and i dont think hes coming to invite you to take ale with him well i cant say im surprised gerin answered he couldnt say he was truly ready to meet swerilas assault either but volition didnt play any great role here how far away is he and how are the horsemen doing at holding him back hell be here in a couple of hours time maybe less ferdulf answered the riders are doing what they can but they cant stop the son of a sow all by themselves hes got too many men hes got too many chariots too i know that gerin said discontentedly hes got too many men and too many chariots for this whole army well what are you going to do about it ferdulf screeched the best i can gerin answered thats not good enough ferdulf said you have to beat him if you dont beat him the northlands are ruined if i dont beat him im ruined the fox said the possibility remains that i may not beat him he clicked his tongue between his teeth if i dont ill just have to go on from there you make it sound so easy scorn laced ferdulfs voice where will you go on from there pray tell i dont know gerin admitted i hope i dont have to find out ferdulf stared at him a trifle irritably he went on im not a god ferdulf im not even related to a god i dont know whats going to happen next all i can do is the best i can and see what happens i told you that already what a sloppy arrangement ferdulf said and what if you would be so generous as to tell me is the best you can do gerin had been thinking it over while the demigod carped at him im going to keep my men in one compact mass and hit the imperials as hard a blow as i can i dont dare divide my army against swerilas he has too many men and too many brains for me to take the chance what i hope is that ill catch him trying to do something fancy and punish him before he can pull all of his forces together he brightened a little go fly off and tell me how hes deploying that way ill have some notion of what im up against youre out of your head ferdulf replied with mournful certainty but away he flew gerin sighed and began shouting orders the men formed up as quickly as he could have wanted none of them showed any particular eagerness for the fight ahead not even adiatunnus trokmoi maybe that meant they were veterans who didnt need to scream like fiends to go out and fight well maybe it meant they had no particular hope of victory gerin hoped it was the one and not the other far faster than he should have given where swerilas force was ferdulf came whizzing back what now gerin asked in alarm had the imperial general stolen a march on him but ferdulf answered if youre going to fight in one large ugly lump are you fain to have me tell rihwin bring his horsemen back so they can take their lumps with the rest of you oh by the gods gerin exclaimed mentally kicking himself for having sent the demigod off too soon yes and thank you ferdulf i m in your debt i admit it youre in my debt you owe your son a promise you owe the imperials a thrashingdo you think you can deliver on any of these ferdulf flew away before the fox had a chance to reply he sent his men forward toward that field hed found that was well suited to the size of his force as the main force advanced rihwins riders began joining them gerin posted the horsemen as a screen in front of the main body of chariotry and on either flank is that maeva van pointed off to the right he answered his own question aye it is he waved then muttered in disappointment she didnt see me curse it dagrefs head was turned in that direction he nodded it is maeva though and she seems all right he was better than he had been a little while before at sounding casual about it gerin looked west down the dirt road that ran through the field he nodded here came the imperials exchanging arrows with the last of his horsemen like his own troops the men of the elabonian empire were already deployed in line of battle sweeping down the road and along the open country to either side catching them in column would have been sweet but swerilas with his sobriquet was too alert to have let that happen elabon elabon elabon the imperials shouted gerin for one was heartily sick of that battle cry his own men yelled the usual northlands assortment of war cries and insults back at their foes forward gerin put everything he had into his own shout he wanted to be moving to receive the imperials charge not standing still waiting to be overrun dagref flicked the reins and cracked the whip above the horses backs they went from walk to trot to gallop one wheel of the car hit a stone the chariot flew into the air and came back to earth with a crash neither gerin nor van nor dagref did anything more than shift weight back and forth gerin looked to see if he could pick out swerilas the slippery among the imperials he couldnt swerilas was slippery enough not to deck himself out in raiment that made him a target the fox shook his head in disappointment he hadnt seen any other imperial officers that canny he started shooting anyhow if he couldnt find the best target hed hit what he could he didnt think swerilas had sent an outflanking party off to either wing if the imperial general had done such a thing ferdulf would have reported itor so the fox devoutly hoped that made it a straightforward slugging match army against army the same sort of fight arpulo had waged like the general hed replaced swerilas had greater numbers but swerilas quickly proved himself a better general than arpulo arpulo had let gerins men get round his flanks and attack his force from three sides at once swerilas by contrast made his own battle line wide and kept trying to lap round gerins force to the right and left very much unlike arpulo he knew what he had and what to do with it unhappily gerin extended his own line he knew what swerilas was trying to do make him thin his force enough to let the imperials find or create a weak spot and punch on through if they did that they could split his army in two and destroy one of the parts at their leisure other than retreat the only counter he could find was doing it to them before they had a chance to do it to him that meant thinning his line even more than hed done already to collect a force with which he could strike crew by crew his chariotry remained better than that of the elabonian empire without that being true he couldnt have done what he did even with its being true he gripped the rail of the chariot hard knowing the risk he took forward he shouted again dagref steered the car toward what looked like the weakest part of the imperial line for a brief shining moment he thought his striking force would break through the imperials still had a respect for the trokmoi just short of dread adiatunnus howling warriors did make them hesitate but swerilas unlike gerin did not have to stint one part of his line to send reinforcements to another he brought enough men in against gerins striking force to keep it from piercing his army through and through well what do we do now van yelled in gerins ear once the attack had plainly bogged down good question gerin answered dagref maneuvered smartly to keep the imperials from getting a chariot to either side of his own at the same time the maneuver brought the horses around so they were facing more nearly the way they had come than the way theyd been going gerin shot an arrow at one of the imperials closest to him and wounded the trooper in the arm but there were still too many soldiers from the elabonian empire close by with a weary curse the fox said now we go back i dont see what in the five hells else we can do not if we want to keep the army in one piece he managed the retreat as well as he could by then hed had more practice managing retreats than hed ever wanted hed never had to manage one against swerilas the slippery before though swerilas did what he would have done himself in the same place pushed hard and tried not merely to beat the army from the northlands but to wreck it gerin had hoped to be able to make a stand back at his camp but the leading imperials were too closely mingled with his rear guard to make that possible they were pressing gerin and his men too hard to make any stand possible for some time gerin had everything he could do to keep the imperials from getting ahead of his men and cutting off their line of retreat he did succeed in doing that muchthat little he thought of it at the timebut swerilas drove him almost to the southern opening of the valley of ikos before the light finally failed by all indications swerilas aimed to keep right on driving him when morning came too he looked north temple guards no doubt waited at the mouth of the valley he didnt care but for ikos he had nowhere to go back next contents xi a guardsman held his shield horizontally across his body to bar the road into the valley of ikos the lord biton forbids the entry of large bodies of armed men into the land surrounding his sacred precinct the fellow said gerin answered if the lord biton punishes me for bringing my army into his land then he will thats all he turned and waved his battered army forward get moving boys the god will know of your action the guard bleated as chariots began rolling past him and his spear hes the farseeing god so of course he will the fox replied hell also know why were doing it which is more than you do swerilas the slippery and the elabonian army are on our tail youre going to have more company than us and worse company than us too biton preserve us the guardsman said that would be nice gerin agreed but dont count on it too much because its liable not to happen the guard glared at him why did you have to lead the imperials here why couldnt you have fled in some other direction than this one its hard to flee straight toward the fellow whos just made you do it gerin pointed out and it was either come here or head off east toward the plains of shanda somehow i dont think im cut out to be a nomad but weve been free of the empire for many years the temple guard moaned will the officious priests from south of the mountains stick their long snouts into the way we run our affairs as i have heard they did in the longago and faroff days very likely they will gerin said thats what theyre good for sticking their noses into things i mean thats what theyll do if they win anyhow but my army is still in one piece even if we have lost some fights we may beat the imperials yet farseeing biton grant it be so the guard answered very well then i give you leave to pass into this valley unless the farseeing god should himself choose to overrule me thanks the fox said hed intended to take his army into the valley of ikos whether the guardsman gave him leave or not if the temple guard had been so foolish as to refuse to give his leave bitons temple probably would have had to get along without him from then on gerin figured he could square it with the god what use would a farseeing deity have for such a stupid guard we shall not grant leave to the imperials the temple guard declared if they enter they shall enter in bitons despite and shall face his punishment will you fight against the men of the elabonian empire gerin asked will you fight alongside us to protect the northlands that will be bitons judgment to make not mine the guardsman said if the god orders it we shall assuredly fight if the god orders otherwise we shall likewise obey him i havent the faintest idea was what he meant though his phrasing was a good deal more polished than that he hadnt come right out and said no gerin supposed that would have to do into the valley of ikos rode his battered troopers had the imperials been a little luckierand he knew it would have taken no more than thathis army would have been cut off before it got to the valley cut off and destroyed the imperials would have more chance to do that soon enough for now though rest time to see to the wounded time to see to the horses and chariots time to curl up in a blanket and sleep a sleep that seemed not far removed from death gerin looked forward to that kind of sleeplooked forward to it with a hopeless longing because he would be too busy to enjoy anywhere near so much of it as his men did as usual after a battle he did what he could for the men who had been hurt he did some horsedoctoring too that was harder and in a way more discouraging his men had a notion of why and how theyd taken wounds to the horses everything was a nasty surprise gerin was washing a cut on a horses rump with ale when rihwin came up to him the horse quivered and let out a whuffling snort but did not try to bolt or kick thats a good fellow the fox said the rider holding the horses head stroked its nose and murmured theres a brave fellow thats my beauty the words meant little the tone much with a sigh gerin turned to rihwin and what can i do for you his tone meant much too but in a far less gentle way rihwin answered lord king i should like to know what our next movement against the imperials will be should you gerin said rihwin nodded with a grimace gerin went on well by the gods so should i the only thing i can think of doing though is to keep on with what were already doing which is to say retreating back toward our own lands you mean rihwin said gerin exhaled in exasperation you must have been listening to that lackwit of a temple guard its very hard to retreat toward the enemy the technical term for that is advance for which wisdom i thank you o font of knowledge rihwin said not about to be outdone in sarcasm but that was not precisely what i had in mind as you know only one road leads from the valley of ikos to lands under your illustrious suzerainty and it is a road perhaps something less than conducive to rapid travel ah gerin said and nodded now i understand youre not happy about the notion of traveling through the haunted woods eh to put with as much abridgment as i can muster lord king no rihwin said are you not so youd notice gerin answered but if its a choice between that and staying here so the imperials can finish wrecking us i know which direction ill go all i can do is hope my men and i come out on the other side if we do maybe we can smash in the head of the imperials column as they come after us that would be good rihwin said without much conviction he didnt think it would happen then better still gerin said in a spirit of experimentation would be meeting the imperials here in the valley of ikos and driving them back plainly gerin didnt think that would happen either yes that would be better lord king he agreed not likely perhaps but better without a doubt how do you aim to produce a victory when lately weve known nothing but defeat i dont know gerin admitted which seemed to nonplus rihwin more than anything else he might have said the best we can hope for now it seems to me is to hope the imperials havent the stomach for a long hard campaign and give up and go home we might have had a better hope for that had we gained the aid of the lord of the sweet grape rihwin said thats not what biton said but then youve never been much interested in any opinion but your own rihwin scowled at him a moment later though the eyes of the man from south of the high kirs widened you demon from the hottest hell he whispered you let me go through the danger of summoning mavrix hoping and expecting i would fail and you said never a word i understand how surprising it must be for you to discover there are people who can on occasion keep their mouths shut gerin replied sweetly you really should try it sometime it can be useful to the crows with utility and to the crows with you too rihwin said his effort to stalk off in impressive fury was hampered when he bumped into van like everyone else who bumped into the outsized outlander he bounced off he kept stalking after that but it wasnt the same van shook his head i see you were rattling his cage again twice gerin answered then he corrected himself no i take that back he rattled his own cage once when he figured out i wasnt too unhappy that he hadnt managed to get mavrix to help us after all what did he do say you were trying to use him as a sacrifice the way the god of the weshapar wanted zalmunna to sacrifice his son he didnt use that example no but that was the general tone as a matter of fact the fox laughed laughing felt good it also let him take his mind off the unpleasant fact that he still had no idea how to stop the imperials but when he stopped laughing that fact remainedand it seemed to be laughing at him laughing and showing fangs as long as sharp as those of a longtooth maybe it was laughing at van too he said come morning that swerilas the slimy is going to start nipping at our tails again slippery gerin said swerilas the slippery no matter how slimy he is but he hesitated then spoke in some surprise i may just know what im going to do about him aye by the godsand by one god in particulari may just sure enough swerilas pushed his men forward not long after the sun came up the temple guards did resist them so did a rear guard of gerins men but the imperials were too many to be withstood for long and in swerilas had a leader who grew angry with anything less than victory gerin fed more men into the fight not so much in expectation of stopping swerilas as to slow him down and had swerilas not already been a suspicious sort failure to try to hold him off would have made him one slowing him down also let gerins main force forage among the prosperous villages of the valley of ikos as they retreated toward the sibyls shrine the temple guards peeled off to defend the temple from its marble outwalls gerin ordered his own men to keep on retreating dagref gave his father a curious look then all at once it vanished from his face bitons temple holds a lot of rich things doesnt it he remarked oh there might be a few in there i suppose gerin answered his voice elaborately casual why do you think that might be interesting to the imperial soldiers and their officers it just might his son said imitating his tone with alarming precision the one thing about which the men of the northlands always complain is how the elabonian empire squeezed wealth out of them like a man squeezing whey out of a lump of cheese biton isnt the sort of god who fancies being squeezed van put in you know that gerin said i know that the question is does swerilas the slippery know that and the other question is if he does know does he care he has wizards with him he has the backing of the elabonian gods or thinks he does maybe he wont care a figs worth and think he can take whatever he pleases wouldnt that be nice van said dreamily weve seen the plague biton sends down on people who try robbing his shrine all those blisters and thingsits not pretty not even a little bit fox dont you think this swerilas would look mighty fine all blistered up since ive never met him i dont know how ugly he is already gerin replied but any old imperial covered in blisters would look pretty good to me right now north of the sibyls shine lay the town that catered to visitors to the valley who came seeking oracular responses the town was not what it had been in gerins younger days traffic for the sibyl had diminished when the elabonian empire severed itself from the northlands and diminished again after the earthquake that loosed the monsters on the earth many of the inns and taverns and hostels that had served travelers were empty some were wrecks that had gone unrepaired since the quake fifteen years before grass grew where others had once stood the innkeepers whose establishments survived viewed the arrival of gerins army with the same delight that serfs would have shown over the arrival of a swarm of locusts and for similar reasons they feared the troopers were going to eat them out of house and home and they were right is this justice lord king one of them wailed as gerins soldiers gobbled bread and roasted meat and guzzled ale probably not the fox admitted but were hungry and were here and were bloody well going to eat if we win this war ill pay you back next yearby all the gods i swear it if we lose you can send the bill to crebbig i the elabonian emperor then ill root for you the innkeeper said you have a good name for not telling too many lies i wouldnt wipe my arse with a promise from somebody on the far side of the mountains not that i even have a promise from the whoreson to wipe my arse with gerin thought it likely the innkeeper would see the imperials at first hand before too long as hed hoped swerilas had slowed his aggressive pursuit of the men from the northlands when he came in sight of bitons shrine rihwins riders had no trouble holding the imperials away from the town of ikos not for the time being taking advantage of that the fox put as many of his men in real beds as he could the summers fighting had worn down his troopers the more rest they got now the better they would perform when they had to climb into their chariots again he slept outside rolled in a blanket himself which perplexed adiatunnus wheres the point to kinging it if you canna be after enjoying yourself the trokm chieftain demanded he hadnt been slow about claiming the pleasures of a bed gerin shrugged im all right some of the men with small wounds need mattresses worse than i do maybe thats so and maybe its not adiatunnus said most o these lads are half your agehalf my age too forbyeand think naught of a night in the open if you say you dont creak of a morning you re a better man than i amor else youre a liar i do creak gerin admitted but i dont creak too badly and half the time ill creak when i get up out of a bed in the morning too im at the age when creaking is part of being alive im used to it i dont love it but i cant do anything about it nor i adiatunnus said sadly nor i but i creak less if im rising from soft straw or wool sure and i do and so ill take a bed when i find one a bed is better when youre after finding a friendly barmaid too however you like gerin said with another shrug like van adiatunnus wenched whenever he found a chance he laughed at the fox now you canna be saying youre so old it stirs in your breeches no more when it does why not let it out to play plenty o girlsd lie down with you just for the sake of saying theyd bedded a king i dont want gerin stopped what hed been about to say wasnt true he wasnt immune from wanting an attractive woman when he was away from selatre what he did or rather didnt do about it was something else again he changed the direction in which the sentence had been going i dont want to complicate my life how many bastards have you got a good many ill allow the trokm answered laughing again not so many as rihwin i expect but i had fun getting every one of em all right gerin said i dont begrudge you the way you live your life why cant you let me lead mine as suits me best adiatunnus scowled again how can i be having a proper quarrel with you when you willna get angry my quarrel is with swerilas the slippery not with you gerin replied youre my ally and my vassal hes my foe he grinned a lopsided grin and when we were young neither of us would have believe that could be so not for a minute we wouldnt truth that adiatunnus said och how we hated the very name of yourself on the far side of the niffet too good you were too good by half at tying us all in knots whenever we thought to raid over the river and then we we did at last lodge ourself on this side who but you did so much against us and kept so many from crossing and now you are my overlord and we have the same enemies as you say aye tis strange and more than strange if i can put up with the likes of you gerin said i shouldntand i dontmind putting up with a blanket on the ground sure it was for your kindness and sweet spirit i first named you king adiatunnus said he walked off shaking his head and laughing the next morning maeva her face glowing with selfimportance came riding back from the line against the imperials with the fat eunuch who had taken gerin down to the sibyls cave he says he must have speech with you lord king im glad enough to speak with him gerin answered and turned to the priest how now awkwardly the eunuch prostrated himself before gerin as if before an image of farseeing biton lord king you must save the god s shrine from desecration he cried get up the fox said impatiently when the priest had risen gerin went on who says i must if you do not save the shrine lord king the arrogant wretches from south of the high kirs will plunder it of the accumulated riches of centuries the priest seemed on the point of bursting into tears for his part though gerin had hoped the accumulated riches in and around bitons temper would make swerilas forget about him for a while and so he repeated who says i must save the shrine is it a command sent straight from biton himself if it was he might have to obey it however little he wanted to but the priest shook his head the loose flabby flesh of his jowls swinging back and forth biton has been mute in this matter he said in his sexless voice but you lord king are well known for the great respect you have always shown the farseeing god if the farseeing god ordered me to try to drive the men of the elabonian empire from his temple i would do it or do my best to do it gerin answered on the whole truthfully since he does not though let me ask a question of my own why do you think i retreated past the sibyls shrine and made my base here in the town of ikos i wondered lord king the eunuch priest replied i thought surely you would defend us with all your power with all my power gerin heard the bitterness in his own voice if i had the power to stop the imperials why would i have retreated into the valley of ikos in the first place why would i have retreated through it why will i have to retreat out of it if the imperials attack me again the priest stared at him but you are the chiefest warrior in all the northlands how could you be beaten more easily than id like as a matter of fact gerin answered when the elabonian empire sends more men against me than i can withstand they beat me nothing complicated about it at all and you can be glad aragis the archer isnt here to hear you call me the chiefest warrior too hed disagree with you and he isnt pleasant when he disagrees he might as well not have spoken the priest didnt interrupt him but plainly didnt pay any attention to his words either the fellow went on and you are the favorite of the farseeing god as well how could it be otherwise when you are wed to bitons former sibyl he sighed perhaps admiring the close relationship with biton he thought being married to selatre gave gerin perhapsas he was a eunuchadmiring gerin for being married at all and where he had not before he gave gerin pause did being married to selatre give him any special obligations it had given him advantages in the past and accounts had a way of balancing even so he hardened his heart and shook his head saying if the farseeing god wants anything from me he can tell me himself ill do what i can then without orders from the god though im not going to throw myself and my army away have you got that the eunuch stared at him out of large dark tragic eyes i have indeed lord king he said i shall take your words back to my comrades in bitons holy priesthood that they may learn nothing shall suffice to rescue them from the rapacious clutches of the elabonian empire gerins children sometimes tried to make him feel guilty by taking that tone of voice it didnt work for them and it didnt work for the eunuch priest either though the fox didnt laugh at him as he often did at his offspring if biton wants his temple to stay unplundered i expect he can manage that without me i console myself with the hope that you are right the priest replied but i have seen little to persuade me of it he turned and waddled south back toward the temple thanks maeva gerin said watching him go you did the right thing to bring him to me even if we cant help him now i wish we could maeva said so do i gerin said but if we could beat swerilas army any time we chose dont you think we would have done it by now go on back and keep an eye on the imperials they did slow down for the temple the way i hoped they would sooner or later theyll start again aye lord king she sketched a salute and rode after the eunuch priest the imperials did not move that day gerin hoped for thunderbolts from the temple but none came glad at least for the respite he wrapped himself in his blanket and went to sleep while he slept he dreamt it might have been the strangest dream hed ever had he kept seeing everything in it from an enormous distance so he could make out nothing clearly at the same time he felt an overpoweringly strong sense of urgency it was almost as if he were seeing the very edge of an important dream truly intended for someone else he kept trying to get closer to the center of the dream to learn why it seemed so important try as he would though he could not his dreamself ground its teeth in frustration he might have stood at the bottom of some deep smoothsided hole too deep from him to climb out of it but he had to climb out of it no matter what when he woke he was on his knees his hands up over his head he stared around in confusion at the inns and houses of ikos and at the campfires around which most of his soldiers slept for a moment they seemed far less real than the dream hed just lost he bit his lip hed missed something important he knew hed missed something important he hated missing anything important in the straits he was in he couldnt afford to miss anything important he couldnt do anything about it though maybe if he lay down and fell back to sleep the dream would return they sometimes did maybe too he would find himself closer to the heart of the matter he bit his lip he didnt like maybes but with no better choice he lay down eventually he slept so far as he remembered he dreamt nothing more for the rest of the night in the morning dagref and ferdulf were missing gerin didnt fret so much over the demigod for one thing he thought ferdulf likely able to take care of himself for another the camp was a good deal quieter without ferdulf around but dagreffor dagref to run off struck gerin as highly unlikely and then all at once it didnt dagref could have had a perfectly good reason for slipping out of camp a reason named maeva that he should have been so foolish as not to come back before things started stirring was another matter one over which gerin intended to have some pointed conversation with him the fox couldnt even lose his temper not so thoroughly as he would have liked unless he wanted to alert van to the reason he was upset the outlander seeing he was worried but not fully grasping why said to the five hells with me if i like the notion of dagref and ferdulf going off together who can guess what mischief theyre liable to get into till they go and do it and that gave gerin something new to worry about hed been thinking so much about dagref and maeva together the prospect of dagref and ferdulf together had entirely escaped his mind that was an oversight on his part he realized you dont suppose theyve gone off to conquer the imperials all by their lonesome do you he hadnt intended van to take him seriously but the outlander said the gods only know what theyve gone off to try and do i dont think they can conquer the bloody imperials by themselves seeing as the whole lot of us havent been able to do that what they think they can dowho knows who knows gerin echoed mournfully dagref was at the age where he thought anything was possible as for ferdulf almost anything was possible around him since his driver had gone off gerin borrowed a horse from rihwin s men and rode slowly and carefully down to the horsemen who were holding the line against swerilas imperials the fox wished hed put in more time on horseback over the years he managed a simple ride well enough but wouldnt have wanted to try to fight while mounted one advantage of going by horse rather than by chariot was that he went by himself without van along he didnt have to come up with fancy and fanciful explanations for why he wanted to see maeva but he got no satisfaction from seeing her nor did it seem that dagref had got any satisfaction from her the night before no lord king she said her eyes widening i havent seen either dagref or ferdulf why do you think dagref would have come to me for the obvious reasons he answered and watched her flush hes not back at the camp and he didnt tell me he was going anywhere my first guess was that that meant a tryst with you if it meant a tryst it wasnt with me now maeva sounded dangerous for reasons that had only a little to do with warfare if it didnt mean a tryst with you i dont think it meant a tryst with anyone gerin said maeva relaxeda little and grudgingly the fox scratched his head if it didnt mean a tryst with you i dont know what it did mean all at once he remembered the peculiar dream hed had the dream where hed been on the fringes of things and unable to figure out what was going on no matter how important figuring out what was going on was maybe hed had to stay on the fringes of things because the dream had truly been aimed at dagref the two of them had both remarked on how much they thought alike gerin didnt find it unreasonable that he should catch the edge of a dream meant for his son that though only raised the next interesting question who or what was aiming dreams at dagref two answers came to mindthe imperials and biton no three for mavrix might have done it too which would or could have accounted for ferdulfs absenceassuming of course ferdulfs absence was connected to dagrefs too much i dont know gerin muttered with a sigh whats that lord king maeva asked is dagref all right i dont know that either gerin said awkwardly he swung up onto the horse and rode back to the town of ikos he hoped against hope dagref would be there when he got back he even hoped ferdulf would be there when he got back if that wasnt a mark of desperation he didnt know what was but neither dagref nor ferdulf was there where in the five hells have they gone what in the five hells do they think theyre doing he asked of van who had already shown he didnt know the answers either well just have to see if the imperials ask us for ransom the outlander said if theyve got ferdulf as far as im concerned they can keep him there are people who would say the same about dagref gerin said gloomily but im not any of them if they have him ill pay what they want to get him back the price they want is liable not to be gold or copper or tin van said its liable to be a bended knee whatever the price is ill pay it gerin answered do you think im so much in love with having people call me lord king that id throw away my son so theyd keep on doing it no van said at once and if you were fool enough to throw your son away no one would call you lord king afterwards anyhow for everybody would sicken at being led by such a man heres hoping youre right gerin said he had his doubts but did not pass them on to the outlander van would surely sicken of being led by such a man but plenty of truly vicious people had gone on to long and successful reigns the fox though had no desire to emulate them he wondered if dagref and ferdulf hadnt gone south after all if instead theyd chosen to head west along the track through the haunted woods back toward lands within gerins suzerainty he had trouble imagining why they would want to do such a thingthe fighting here would be over long before they could bring back reinforcementsbut he had trouble imagining why they would go see the imperials too he slammed one balledup fist into the palm of the other hand what had that dream been if hed been able to see more of it some time in the middle of the morning his son and ferdulf came walking into the town of ikos up from the south not from the forest and hills to the west no one escorted them which gerin took to mean that no one had seen them while they were coming from wherever they had been that was his first to the two of them where were you neither answered right away dagrefs silence was thoughtful silence from ferdulf struck gerin as most uncharacteristic at last dagref said we went down to see swerilas the slippery just like that gerin said you didnt have any trouble getting through my pickets you didnt have any trouble getting through the imperials pickets you went right ahead and walked in to have a chat with swerilas aye we did ferdulf said the unemphatic nod he gave lent credence to his words we did dagref echoed sounding a bit surprised about it we had no trouble doing it i knew we would have no trouble doing it i had a dream that told me we would have no trouble doing it and it was a true dream ha gerin said i was right the dream was aimed at you i had it too or rather the ragged fringe of it did you now dagref looked interested i thought you might have or someone might have i thought someone on the outside was trying to look in you might say i didnt notice anyone else when i had the dream ferdulf said with more than a trace of hauteur i was alone communing with the god which god gerin asked your father not likely ferdulf exclaimed my wretch of a father communes with his hand on my fundament not with a dream in my mind with whom then the fox demanded why with biton of course ferdulf said and dagref nodded he did indeed tell us to go to see swerilas the slipperywho is truly as oleaginous an article as i have ever set eyes onand so we did biton has more power than i could hope to oppose and i daresay more power than my father too gerin didnt know whether that last was true or not either way it wasnt his problem he kept on trying to find out about the things that were his problem and what did you tell swerilas when you saw him why we told him to attack your army of course and not to waste any more time doing it ferdulf and dagref spoke together smilingly confident they had done the right thing you told him what gerin shouted how could you tell him that why would you tell him that it was what farseeing biton told us to tell him ferdulf and dagref chorused only after the words were out of his mouth did dagrefs smile slip on his face i wonder why biton told us to tell him that to ruin me gerin suggested i cant think of any other reason can you if swerilas attacks me hell push this army right along the path through the haunted wood west of here hell probably push us to pieces too trying to get onto that one path how are we supposed to hold him off we havent got the men to hold him off dont you know that we do know that dagref said of course we know that we knew it then too ferdulf nodded it didnt seem to matter then though dagref added in some perplexity and ferdulf nodded again why does biton hate me gerin didnt direct the words at his son and the little demigod but at the indifferent sky he doesnt hate you father now dagref tried to sound reassuring why would he hate you my mother was his sibyl on earth maybe he hates me for taking her away from him but gerin frowned and shook his head biton had never shown any sign of disliking his match with selatre but if this wasnt such a sign what was it he couldnt answer that question so he found another one to ask dagref and ferdulf what else did the farseeing god tell you to tell swerilas nothing much dagref answered we were supposed to make it plain to him that we came with bitons message but we didnt have any trouble convincing him of that ill bet you didnt gerin said he thought for a while then asked did biton tell the two of you to tell me anything why he decided to do this to me might be interesting to learn in a morbid sort of way you ferdulf had some of his arrogance back why on earth would the god want us to speak to you if he had wanted you to know anything he would have sent you a dream but he didnt did he he left you on the outside looking in didnt he no he wanted nothing to do with the likes of you gerin didnt get insulted as he might have done he just shrugged and said well the god might have sent a dream straight to swerilas the slippery too but he didnt choose to do that so i thought id ask about this nothing for you ferdulf repeated nothing do you hear ferdulf you need never doubt that when you say something people do hear you gerin said they may sometimesthey may oftenwish they didnt but they do hed hoped that would make ferdulf glower at him instead the little demigods childlike face took on an altogether unchildlike look of satisfaction as far as ferdulf was concerned the fox had paid him a compliment dagref frowned wait he said there was something i think there was something no there wasnt ferdulf said indignantly i just told him there wasnt i ought to know im half a god myself and the better half at that if i say there wasnt anything there wasnt and thats flat maybe we didnt have exactly the same dream dagref said maybe i got this because im my fathers son maybe you think you have this because whats really between your ears is rock not brains ferdulf retorted and stuck out his tongue dagref remained unperturbed which perturbed ferdulf whatever the reason there was something the youth said he turned to gerin here it is for whatever it maybe be worth its something like pick the right path stay on the right path dont go off the right path no matter what what a stupid message ferdulf said you must have made that up yourself why would a god say anything that foolish i dont know dagref answered ive certainly heard a demigod say a good many foolish things lately ferdulf did glower at that gerin said what path his son shrugged i couldnt begin to tell you until you asked i didnt even know i had any message for you at all maybe its the path through the wood west of here gerin said but then he shook his head i really dont see how it could be theres only the one path through that wood no right or wrong about it youre either on the path or in the forest and if youre in the forest well too bad for you so what in the five hells is biton talking about something youre too ignorant to understand ferdulf said im too ignorant to understand a great many things the fox said why i put up with you immediately springs to mind before ferdulf could find a retort to that a horseman came galloping up from the south lord king he cried lord king the imperials are attacking lord king after that everything seemed to happen at once the fox shouted for his men to form a battle line in front of the town of ikos they were still forming it when rihwins riders came back to them sorry lord king one of the horsemen said wiping at a bleeding cut on his forehead theres just too many of the cursed buggers for us to hold back and theyre coming hard too swerilas has a way of doing that gerin answered absently now what ferdulf exclaimed now what he hopped up into the air anyone might do that while excited ferdulf though was not just anyone he didnt come down again dagref answered him before gerin could now we fight what else can we do even if you float like a pigs bladder you wits should be better than the ones a bladder or even a pig comes with ferdulfs venomous glare showed that even the fox would have had a hard time being more pungently sarcastic aye gerin said now we fight now we his voice trailed away he looked from dagref to ferdulf and back again after stroking his beard for a moment he walked over to dagref and kissed him on the cheek then he did the same with ferdulf what was that in aid of father dagref asked ferdulfs comments were a good deal more pungent but had the same general meaning understanding gerin answered at least i hope its understanding if its not understanding if its anything but understanding im in even more trouble than i was alreadyand here i d been thinking that couldnt possibly happen he didnt say that out loud what he did say was come on we have to meet that templerobbing whoreson of a swerilas with edged bronze before before what father dagref broke in before anything else happens the fox saidnot the sort of reply calculated to satisfy his son satisfying his son was not the most urgent matter on his mind right then though dagref gave him an irked stare youre being as deliberately obscure as the sibyl when biton speaks through her he complained youre and then as his fathers had done his voice trailed away wouldnt that be interesting he murmured what are the two of you talking about ferdulf sounded even more irritable than usual youre a demigod use your semidivine wisdom to figure it out gerin told him while youre at it why dont you fly up and tell me what swerilas is trying to do to us you dont need me for that you can see him from here ferdulf answered which was depressingly true but the little demigod did pop into the air perhaps as much for the chance that gave him to wave his backside at gerin and dagref as for any other reason off he flew i hope youre not wrong father dagref said so do i gerin said believe me so do i before the fox could say any morenot that there was much more to sayvan came rushing up demanding to know why in the five hells he and dagref werent in the chariot yet and why they werent charging forward to smash swerilas into some large number of small pieces we do have to try father dagref added i know we do gerin answered well lets be about it then he stepped up into the chariot where van was already waiting and fuming so did dagref who flicked the reins and got the horses moving van gave gerin a dubious look are you going fey on us captain he demanded do you think were as done as a slab of beef over a fire are you riding out expecting to be killed gerin shook his head no very much the opposite as a matter of fact i dont think were going to win this battle but i havent lost hope for the war in fact i have more than i did a little while ago now the outlanders stare was quizzical after a moment he shrugged all rightyouve got some sort of scheme cooking in that beady little mind of yours i dont need to know what it is right now as long as its something and you havent given up on us ive never quite done that gerin said ive come close a few times over the years but ive never given up ahead of his force of chariotry rihwins riders and some of the temple guards were righting to slow the force swerilas the slippery led elabon elabon elabon the imperials shouted their war cries ringing through those of the men from the northlands lets hit em gerin yelled to his own troopers he plucked an arrow from his quiver let fly and pitched an imperial out of the chariot his men cheered they didnt seem to have any particular hope of victory either but they went into the attack with a will and for a while they drove the imperials back toward bitons shrine temple robbers was the shout bitons guards raised they fought with a fury that made them stronger than their numbers rihwin s riders strove mightily to keep the warriors from the elabonian empire off balance gerin began to wonder what he would do if his army beat the foe that would mean hed been wrong in the way hed thought things would go he shrugged it wouldnt be the first time ive been wrong he muttered whats that fox van asked nothing much believe me gerin answered just out of bowshot of the wall of the temple the momentum of his counterattack faded swerilas had too many men and was too good a leader to let an inferior force beat him his men rallied and began to push not only forward but out to either wing the foxs troopers had to fall back to keep from being outflanked and cut off gerin stayed calmer about this retreat than he had during earlier fights in which the imperials had used their numbers to gain the upper hand you know something van said what is it saying i know something probably pushes things further than they should go the fox answered i have some ideas though ah thats good thats fine van beamed he didnt even ask what the idea were instead he stuck a finger in his friends face there you see didnt i tell you youd come up with something and you walking around with a rain cloud over your head you told me i was wrong you told me i was crazy i dont know whether you were wrong or not gerin said in case youre wondering though i still think youre crazy when he ordered the army to fall back through the town of ikos without making a stand protected by the houses and other buildings van shook his head and said you dont need to wonder if im crazy im the one who needs to wonder whether youre daft maybe i am gerin said well know pretty soon north of the town he had two choices left he could fall back to the top of the valley and try to break out through the rugged hills to either side or he could swing to the west and take the one narrow winding road through the ancient wood that lay between the valley and the elabon way without hesitation he swung his men to the west stay on this path he shouted to the warriors by all the gods and by farseeing biton most especially stay on this path what other path could they go on fox van said theres only the one after all weve been along it going east and west often enough to know take another look gerin suggested van did and his eyes widened as soon as hed finished staring to either side he stared at gerin im not daft the outlander said i know im not daft that particular way anyhow if you tell me there used to be half a dozen roads climbing up toward the forest ill call you a liar to your face i know better they didnt used to be here unless im the one whos gone mad they werent here yesterday gerin answered that doesnt mean theyre not here now though he raised his voice to shout again stay on this road men no matter what happens stay on this road how do you know this is the right one father dagref asked gerin gave him a harried look i dont he answered in a low voice but i think it is and that will have to do he let out another yell stay on this road by the gods but lord king theyre outflanking us one of his men cried in a frightened voice the trooper pointed to either side sure enough swerilas the slippery with the luxury of numbers was dividing his force sending parts of it along the new paths that had appeared to either side of the one on which gerin and his men traveled never having been in the valley of ikos before swerilas did not could not know they were new stay on the path gerin shouted again he looked ahead the wood was getting closer and closer a few imperialsenough to plug the gap should his army try to reverse its coursefollowed the men of the northlands along the road they were using most though hurried along the other paths that led into the wood van chuckled but even the bluff outlander sounded a little nervous now i know what swerilas is thinking he said i know just what hes thinking the son of a pimp so do i gerin said hes thinking these roads will all come together inside the forest hes thinking hell rush men along some of them get ahead of us cut us off and wreck us once and for all if you look at things from his point of view its a good plan its better than a good plan in fact or it would be aye van said in a hollow voice it would be as he spoke dagref drove the chariot in under the trees it was one of the last cars that belonged to the men of the northlands to enter the wood west of the valley of ikos stay on the path gerin called to the riders and chariot crews ahead for your lives stay on the path ride through to the end of the wood and well see what happens then he hoped they heard him he hoped they could hear him he didnt know not for certain sound had a different quality here under these great immeasurably ancient trees the rattle and squeak of the chariot axle the clop of the horses hooves seemed distant attenuated as if not quite of this world he could hardly hear the noise from other cars at all light changed too as it filtered down through the branches interlaced overhead it became green and shifting making distances deceptive and hard to gauge gerin imagined seeing underwater would be something like this the green was not the usual shade it would have been in a forest either the fox could not have said how it was different but it was he noticed that whenever he entered this strange place maybe it was because so many of the trees and bushes in this place grew nowhere else in the world but maybe too it was because the rest of the world did not fully impinge on this place gerin tapped dagref on the shoulder stop the car he said his son obeyed the last few chariot crews who had been behind them went past the men in those cars gave gerin curious and alarmed looks dagref looked curious too and perhaps a little alarmed if we wait here very long father the imperial vanguard will be be upon us he said will they gerin shook his head you may be right but i dont think so listen obediently dagref cocked his head to one side so did van so did the fox he could hear ever more faintly his own men hurrying west through the old and haunted wood that was all he could hear but for a few soft padding noises from beasts he had heard before but of which he had never seen anything save once or twice green eyes where are the imperial whoresons van sounded indignant they should be rattling along close behind us dagref is right they ought to be coming upon us any time now and theyre racing along those other paths too the funny ones to either side of us we should hear them there too by the gods how could we miss em but i dont hear a bloody thing he dug a finger in his ear as if that might help where are they i dont know gerin didnt hear the imperials either as van said he should have nor could he hear his own men not any more all he heard now was his own breathing that of dagref and van and the horses panting and the jingle of their harness turn back he told his son swing the chariot around and go back toward ikos i will father dagref said but only if youre sure you want me to go on gerin said shaking his head a little dagref flicked the reins and clucked to the horses he was obviously reluctant so were the animals they rolled their eyes and snorted and flicked their ears but they obeyed dagref and he obeyed gerin the chariot turned on the path which was barely wide enough to let it do so and rolled back toward the east it did not roll far no sooner had it rounded the first turn in the road than there was no more road trees and bushed blocked the way looking as if theyd been growing there for the past hundred years dagref stared how could we have come up this path if theres no path to come up before gerin could answer van said the trees in this wood aren t to be trusted and thats a fact they move around some kind of wayive seen it before never like this though never like this hes right the fox said ive never seen it like this either though because his voice trailed off something was watching him from the cover of the bushes he couldnt tell whator whoit was he couldnt even make out its eyes as he could sometimes spot those of the strange creatures that dwelt inside this haunted wood but he knew it was there something passed from it to himand to dagref and van it wasnt a message in words had it been though it would have required only two go away dagref swung the chariot back toward the west now the horses seemed glad to run they scurried away from that newrisen barrier gerin blamed them not in the least softly van said i wonder whats going on behind those trees i wonder whats going on other places in the forest something quiet but not something id guess thats making the imperials very happy id say youre likely right gerin agreed no matter how slippery swerilas the slippery is i think hes just run into something hes not going to be able to slip out of again i wish i knew what was happening to the imperials dagref said he had every bit of gerins relentless itch to know he had only a small part of his fathers years to temper that itch still gerin found the right question to ask do you want to know badly enough to step off the road dagref thought that over then shook his head he didnt spend much time thinking either gerin wondered what would happen if quite suddenly the road ahead closed off as the road behind had done whatever it was he didnt think he would be able to do much about it he hoped it would be quick but then he heard the rattle and squeak of chariots in front of him without his saying a word dagref urged the horses up to a quicker trot they soon caught up with the cars at the rear of his force the men in those chariots exclaimed to gerin and his companions lord king one of them said we didnt think youd be coming this way again when you stopped there well here i am the fox answered determinedly making his voice sound as normal as he could now are you glad or sorry oh glad lord king the trooper said and others echoed him how far behind are the imperials would you say dagref and van both looked at gerin he in turn looked for the best reply he could give farther than youd think he said at last and then liking the sound of the words repeated them aye farther than youd ever think the warriors took the literal meaning and missed his tone thats good one of them said maybe the bastardsll take a wrong turning and get lost in these stinking woods maybe they will gerin said again with irony his men did not catch when he spoke again though he was not being ironic at all i only hope we dont get lost in them ourselves dont see how we could a trooper said its just the one road and it looks like it runs straight on through doesnt get much simpler than that gerin didnt say anything he and van and dagref looked at one another again then that trooper spoke once more in puzzled tones i wonder what happened to the rest of the imperials the ones who went down those other paths so do i gerin said solemnly so do i he was relieved when the trooper turned out to be right the road stayed straight and the men of the northlands emerged from the wood into bright afternoon sunshine rihwin who had been one of the first men out was forming them into a line of battle to resist the imperials if we hit them hard he was shouting when gerin came out of the wood well have the effective advantage of numbers for most of them will still be back under the trees are you going to tell him father dagref asked softly gerin shook his head i dont know for a fact not yet he said the event will tell better than i could anyhow ferdulf came flitting over do you know that i had to ride in a chariot like an ordinary mortal all the way through those ugly woods he demanded well do you you seem to have survived gerin answered dryly ferdulf glared then floated off in a snit the army waited and waited and waited at last as the sun began to set the troopers made camp no imperials came out of the wood then or ever when morning came the fox rode into the forest again he had no trouble traversing it it seemed as normal as it ever did perhaps even a little closer to normal than hed ever known it before or perhaps the strangeness that dwelt within was sated for a time presently van said were farther in now than we were yesterday when we turned around and the track was gone arent we aye i think so gerin answered and dagref nodded after a moment the fox added its still here now or rather its here again now anyhow its as if the thing never went away isnt it isnt it though van fixed gerin with an accusing stare you knew this was going to happen didnt you this gerin shook his head i had no idea this would happen i did hope something would happen if the imperials came into this forest and i was lucky enough to be right not if the imperials came into this forest dagref said the proper phrase is if the imperials came into this wood what in the five hells difference does it make van said the forestthe wood so what youre not a bard to complain the one doesnt scan and the other does he paused dagref looked very smug but didnt say anything rare restraint for a lad his age gerin didn t say anything either that extended silence warned van he was missing something though not quite so quick as either gerin or dagref he was nobodys fool after a moment he snapped his fingers the oracle dagref grinned gerin just nodded aye the oracle he said van slapped him on the back almost hard enough to pitch him out of the chariot you sneaky son of a whore he said in admiring tones you sneaky son of a whore when the sibyl talked about bronze and wood i thought sure she meant swords and spears and arrowheads on the one hand and chariots on the other who wouldnt have thought that its what i thought first too and im not ashamed to admit as much gerin said and we kept fighting the imperials and they kept kicking us in the teeth its not surprising when you get down to itthey had twice as many men as we did near enough nothing like being proved wrong over and over again to make you think you might have misinterpreted an oracle dagref observed sounding appallingly like his father you had already fulfilled one condition of the verse when rihwin summoned mavrix but the god refused to aid us even so gerin said nodding one piece of the verse still puzzles me though dagref said they snap and float and always trouble what on earth was the farseeing god talking about there gerin looked at van the outlander was looking back at him he couldnt have said which of them started laughing first dagref let out an indignant snort laughing still gerin said that part of the oracular response seemed pretty plain to me even at the time to me too van added well i dont follow it dagref said getting angrier by the moment and furthermore let me tell you no let me tell you the fox broke in youre doing the snapping now you dont float but someone you know does dagref stopped and stared ferdulf and me he said in a voice much smaller than the one he usually used gerin nodded dagrefs eyes got even wider how did the god find a place for ferdulf and me in his prophecy van laughed youre not the most promising material lad but theres no accounting for what a gods liable to do dagref turned his head to give the outlander a dirty look over his shoulder he opened his mouth by the expression on his face gerin knew what he was going to say something along the lines of you may not think im so much but your daughter has different ideas without the least hesitation gerin kicked dagref in the ankle instead of saying what hed been about to say dagref let out a startled yip on this road of all roads gerin said youd better keep your eyes ahead of you and your mind on what youre doingand nowhere else he couldnt have been much less subtle if hed walloped dagref over the head with a branch for a wonder van didnt notice that he was giving a ponderous hint for an even bigger wonder dagref did then a moment later the fox forgot all about the indiscretion from which hed saved dagref through the clop of the horses hooves though the squeak of the axle and the rattle of the wheels of the car he caught the noise of another chariota chariot headed west straight toward him stop the chariot he told dagref and reached over his shoulder for an arrow his hand shook as he set the shaft on his bowstring his heart pounded cold sweat burst out on his forehead after the disaster that had befallen the army of the elabonian empire in this haunted wood who waswho could beriding through it now or was the right question what could be riding through the haunted wood now on came the other chariot steady and confident as if it owned not just the road but the rest of the wood too van muttered something under his breath it wasnt in elabonian it wasnt in any language gerin understood beneath his sunbronzed skin the outlander was pale he didnt know who or what was liable to be in that other car either and he didnt seem to like any of the possibilities that occurred to him dagref clutched the whip till his knuckles whitened is itthe master of this place father he whispered i dont know gerin whispered back i dont know if this place has any one master if it does i dont know if hes the sort of master who rides in a chariot but i think were about to find out around a slight twist in the path came the other car gerin dagref and van all shouted the instant they spotted it the driver of the other team shouted too in horrified surprise so did his passenger who threw his hands in the air bleating i yield spare me by the gods why its only a couple of imperials gerin said in slow wonder did you lugs come into this wood yesterday could they have survived when all their comrades disappeared but both imperials shook their heads by the gods no the passenger said we are not fighting men we are but harmless couriers gerin stared the imperial couriers hed known had been readyforaughts who delivered their messages come what might these fellows were a disgrace to the breedeither that or it had gone badly downhill over the generation during which it hadnt operated north of the high kirs and what message were you delivering to swerilas the slippery he asked when the couriers hesitated before speaking he went on you can tell me now or we can take the message pouch off your body and read whats inside it he aimed his bow at the drivers face which will it be you havent got much time to make up your minds neither courier was armed with anything more than a knife at his belt they must have thought they were traveling through safe country and that swerilas had crushed gerin by now the fox grinned they hadnt known everything there was to know well talk the passenger said at once the driver might have said something different if he hadnt been looking at an arrow from a range almost short enough to make his eyes cross as things were he nodded glumly the passenger went on youll probably like the news anyhow how do we know till we hear gerin didnt lower the bow speak up and the courier did we were sent here to recall both lord swerilas and lord arpulo to duties more urgent than suppressing these semibarbarous northlands all the empires forces are needed in more vital provinces for the sithonians are risen in furious revolt back next contents xii back at the encampment west of the haunted wood gerin examined the order the imperial couriers would have given to swerilas the slippery the one of them had summed up that order well enough crebbig i was abandoning the reconquest of the northlands because as he wrote the wicked treacherous underhanded sithonians and their effete and effeminate gods have banded together in a malicious conspiracy to overthrow our rule in sithonia an effrontery we do not propose to and shall not tolerate if ever two men had been bewildered the couriers were they that swerilas opponents had captured them was one thing and quite bad enough that swerilas army had vanished off the face of the earth was something else again and a great deal worse too gerin wasted no time on explanations with them for one thing he was far from certain of explanations himself for another he had matters more urgent to worry about than whether a couple of prisoners were contented do you see he said to rihwin the fox mavrix did have other things on his mind besides the northlands no wonder he didnt feel like helping us and no wonder he didnt thank you for jogging his elbow very well lord king rihwin said seen in retrospect you plainly have the right of it but you could not see in retrospect at the time and neither could i why twit me over it when i was doing the best i could that was such a good question gerin didnt answer it he did ask ferdulf what do you think of your father now i think he is an odious sniveling drunken degenerate who chanced to do you a good turn for reasons that had nothing whatever to do with you but only with his own selfish desires ferdulf answered that was nothing if not forthright it was so forthright in fact that it pitched the fox into a coughing fit oh come now he said when he could speak again ive hardly ever heard mavrix snivel ferdulf pondered that for a few heartbeats when he was done pondering it he laughed one of the few laughs gerin had ever heard from him then he floated away a contented little demigodcontented typically because someone else had just been insulted dagref came up to gerin father between our army and aragis we outnumber the imperials and since arpulo is ordered to withdraw anyhow we can beat him about the head and shoulders while hes going gerin broke in yes i intend to do that if the imperials lose one of their armies here in the northlands and have the other cut to pieces its likely to be a good long while before they poke their noses over the high kirs again regardless of whether they put down the sithonian uprising or not ah thats fine thats very fine dagref looked relieved i was just wondering if with so many things going on so fast that one might have slipped past you im glad it didnt no i managed to keep up there gerin answered havent moved against arpulo yet but i do intend to after that i have two other things on the list and then the gods willing i think we can head back up toward the niffet ah dagref raised an eyebrow and those are his father started ticking them off on his fingers first i need to see how things stand with aragis the archer dont forget we came south to fight a war with him not with the elabonian empire if the imperials have hurt his lands enough itll be a good long while before he can think of tangling with us again too if not well start a new verse of the old song next spring dagref nodded aye i saw that one myself its the only one i saw as a matter of fact whats the other i want to send someone to that village off the elabon way and find out what elise intends to do the fox answered if she wants to go to durens holding ill send her if shes gone there on her own shes liable to be aiming to stir up trouble between your half brother and me do you think she could dagref asked wideeyed hed always been slightly in awe of duren as younger brothers often are of older ones i dont think so gerin answered but i dont know nor do i want to be unpleasantly surprised now that i know where she is i want to keep an eye on her he didnt think elise would like that but he wasnt going to lose much sleep over whether she did or not hed finished his explanation but dagref didnt go away instead the youth took a deep breath and said father i know how i want to use the promise i won from you as we were coming south do you gerin said hoping he was doing a good enough job of disguising apprehension as polite curiosity i do dagref sounded very determined hearing how determined he sounded should have made the fox proud as a matter of fact it did make him proud it also made him more than a little frightened i suppose you intend to tell me he said when his son showed no sign of doing anything of the sort oh yes of course dagref snapped his fingers and looked annoyed at himself thats right you do need to know he took another deep breath maybe he too was less steady than he wanted to seem after letting it out and inhaling again he said when the time comes i want you to speak to van about maeva for me is that all gerin asked now trying to hide surprise dagref nodded the fox set a hand on his shoulder ill do it he took a deep breath of his own id do it anyhow if you like you can have your promise back and save it for something else you want dagref weighed that youve been worried about what id ask for havent you he asked the fox nodded he could hardly do otherwise dagref rubbed his chin on which some of the down was beginning to darken and yet youd let me hold on to the promise and still speak to van i just said so didnt i gerin wondered how much hed regret it but dagref was shaking his head that wouldnt be right i gave it up freely for something that matters to mewell you know how much it matters to me yes i do whether it would matter so much to dagref in half a year or in five years who could tell before the event farseeing biton surely but no one of lesser powers dagref made motions as if to push his father away that wouldnt be right he repeated do what i asked you to do and that will put us at quits no now gerin shook his head that will make us square i dont want the two of us to be at quits thats fair enough father neither do i dagref looked at gerin out of the corner of his eye if i did i could easily have asked for something else he didnt say something more not with maeva on his mind but that was what he meant and gerin knew it so you could gerin admitted what he could scarcely deny since you decided not to can we get on with the business of running the imperials back to their side of the mountains oh i suppose we can dagref said so magnanimous his father felt like kicking him in the teeth then they both laughed why not they were both getting what they wanted arpulo werekas son was still in the process of pulling together the detachments he had on aragis lands when gerin struck him the foxs army drove in a series of arpulos bands and siege parties the last thing arpulo had expected was that swerilas and his whole force would completely disappear from the scene whether he had expected it or not though it had happened his withdrawal became an undignified scamper as arpulo fell back from one keep he had been besieging after another aragis soldiers who had been trapped inside those keeps came forth and joined gerin in pushing the imperials ever farther south they accepted the foxs orders without complaint and obeyed him far more readily than his own troopers often did i know why that is van said with a sly grin theyre still used to the archer whod have their guts for garters if they tried telling him no they dont know how soft you are hmm gerin said how am i supposed to take that he held up a hand never mind i dont really want to know ill just ask you this if im so soft why has no one ever raised a successful revolt in twentyoddand a lot of them were very oddyears nothing hard about that captain the outlander answered whod follow a rebel against you whoever the son of a whore was hed be more trouble than you ever were and so everyones been on your side all along oh indeed the fox replied and that of course is why ive never fought a single solitary war in all the time since i became baron of fox keep well van paused to think at last he said not all your neighbors know you as well as they should thats what it is gerin snorted van was unabashed but then van was usually unabashed the next day arpulos men withdrew from around the castle where aranast aragis son was leading the defenders aranast was glad to be able to come out he was glad to join in helping to chase the imperials out of his fathers dominions he was appalled at the way his fathers vassals obeyed the fox you are not their sovereign lord king he told gerin that evening as the army encamped you have no business requiring them to act as you desire fine gerin said cheerfully in that case you can go back to your keep and stay there too that is not what i meant had aranasts back got any stiffer he would have turned to stone these men are vassals to my father king aragis the archer it is fitting and proper for your own vassals to grant you all due obedience it is neither fitting nor proper for the vassals of another sovereign to grant you the aforesaid obedience nor for you to claim it gerin felt like marching around behind aranast and giving him a boot in the arse that being a likelier avenue to admit sense than his ears regretfully abandoning the idea the fox said when we were campaigning against the imperials before i acknowledged your father as the overall commander i wasnt his vassal when i did it the world didnt end it wont end now either if his men obey me for a while my father will not approve aranast said if he has any sense he will gerin replied i dont know how much that proves i will admit besides your father is still besieged down therehe pointed southand so they cant very well obey him for the time being do please remember im the one who got rid of swerilas the slippery and won my half of the war i did that before the imperials retreated before they knew they were even supposed to retreat what did your father do locked himself up in a keep thats what thats unfair aranast said he was heavily beset and facing the larger half of the imperial armyagainst which he struck some strong blows good for him gerin said i have no complaint about anything he did no i take that backfor him to send you to tell me not to presume to forage off the countryside struck me as excessive and does to this day when he comes out of his castle hes welcome to take his men back for all of me in the meanwhile i intend to get some use out of them aranast sputtered and fumed he remonstrated with some of his fathers vassals gerin the fox has a higher rank than yours prince aranast one of them told him if you expect us to obey you shouldnt you also expect us to obey him that made aragis son sputter and fume even more but he gave the noble no answer the imperials had trampled down a good many fields of wheat and barley in aragis dominions and stolen a lot of livestock now that they were withdrawing from the northlands they set fires in the fields behind them both to hamper gerins pursuit and to leave aragis vassals and serfs as hungry and weak as they could aranast cursed arpulo with bitter hatred so did aragis retainers who rode with the fox so did gerin arpulo was conducting a coldbloodedly vicious retreat doing as much harm as he could before he finally went south over the high kirs but only the foxs long experience as a ruler a man whose every action was on display before his fellows let his curses sound sincere inwardly he was something less than downhearted at seeing how much aragis would have to do in the lands he already ruled before he could contemplate going to war against anyone else just before sunset the riders gerin had sent to the village where elise was keeping a tavern caught up with his army you havent got her with you gerin noted did she refuse to come no lord king one of them answered she wasnt there gerin scowled where did she go did any of the villagers know did she go south into the empire or north to durens holding no one knew lord king the rider said one day she was there as shed been for the past little while next morning she was gone the villagers made it plain she was not in the habit of telling them what she intended doing before she did it i believe that gerin said she was never in the habit of telling anyone what she intended doing before she did it he paced back and forth discontented with the world hed hoped to have an unambiguous answer about the woman hed once loved but the world hadnt been generous enough to give him one for her sake and his own he hoped elise had gone down over the mountains not up to her sons holding not only would the road up to durens be full of refugees and brigands and deserters from aragis army and gerins and the imperials and thus dangerous for her she might make the road dangerous for gerin if she reached the keep and inflamed duren against him gerin wondered again if she could do that in the end he had to shrug and shake his head he simply did not know by that time the next day hed stopped worrying about a woman he d seen for an hour or so over a twentyyear span he had more urgentperhaps not more important but more urgentconcerns his army came up to the keep in which aragis the archer had been besieged aragis proved not to be in the castle oh no lord king said the steward a pudgy fellow named wellas therthas son he went south in pursuit of arpulo when the imperials broke off their encirclement yesterday sounds like him gerin agreed he eyed wellas you could have stayed besieged a lot longer before they starved you out couldnt you oh aye lord king wellas answered but how could you have known that to bring it out so sure and certain he eyed the fox too with a mixture of respect and wonder call it a good guess if you like gerin said if wellas was still plump after a good many days shut away from the outside the siege couldnt have caused the defenders too much in the way of hardship gerin didnt want to come right out and say that though having no reason to hurt the stewards feelings the fox rode after his fellow king wellas thoughtfully helped supply the army with journeybread sausage and smoked meat from the castle storerooms proving the keep had indeed been far from running out of supplies gerin was quickly glad to have the extra food the imperials had set more fires behind their line of march and he could have done little in the way of foraging for that very reason he met aragis coming back up the elabon way the archer looked disgusted good to see you fox he growled though good was not a word that would have fit his humor we can do this better together than i could by myselfi havent the men for a proper pursuit and i just went after that bastard of an arpulo as soon as he pulled out didnt realize hed burn everything behind him as he went his lean facenot much leaner than when gerin had seen him lastwas streaked with soot and smoke he does seem to be doing that gerin said nodding a farewell present since he cant stay you might say so i gather aragis looked more disgusted than ever ive been penned up in there away from everything that looks like news what in the five hells happened did crebbig i his ever so illustrious majesty have the generosity to drop dead no such luck im afraid gerin answered the sithonians are revolting again and hes called his men back over the mountains ah is that what it is so well be rid of swerilas as well as arpulo eh aragis nodded too i wont miss either of them a bit and thats the truth his gaze suddenly sharpened what are you doing here fox i mean here in particular why arent you chasing swerilas men instead of arpulos for that matter where are swerilas men why didnt they come down and join their friends they were chasing me gerin answered they tried chasing me through the wood west of bitons shrine in the valley of ikos do you know that wood aragis eyes widened in his filthy face gerin took that for agreement he went on they rode into the wood they didnt ride out he explained the oracular response hed had from bitons sibyl and how he interpreted it bronze and wood aragis repeated i would have taken that to mean swords and chariots or maybe spearheads and spearshafts that the wood might be a wood i doubt id have thought of that i almost didnt either gerin said even when i did think of it i was a long way from sure i was rightbut i was in so much trouble i had nothing to lose by finding out aragis pointed at him did i not say that when the time came you would have some sorcery ready to wreck the foe you said it gerin agreed that you said it doesnt make it true rihwin summoned mavrix except that mavrix didnt feel like being summoned biton gave his oracular responseall i did was hear it when dagref and ferdulf went off to see swerilas i didnt know anything about it if i had known anything about it i would have stopped it if i could i dont know exactly what happened in the haunted wood and i dont think i ever will know by the gods i dont think i want to know either the only thing i did in all of that was ask biton for the oracular response and i didnt know what id get when i did everything you say is truetaken one thing at a time aragis let out a long angry breath but its only true taken one thing at a time put it all together and you were at the center of it the way a spider sits at the center of its web tell me that when rihwin summoned mavrix you werent hoping he would fail go ahead and tell mei want to see how good a liar you are not good enough evidently gerin said if you already know the answers why ask the questions because i wanted to find out if what i thought was true that you were in the middle taking advantage of everything that happened around you he glared at the fox like an angry wolf and you were and i curse you for it calmly gerin folded his arms across his chest i havent taken advantage of every tiny thing that happens around me i hope i am on my way toward doing that though in aid of which shall we discuss the matter of suzerainty over the holding of balser debos son aragis looked around had more of his men been close by than gerins the fox thought he would have ordered them to attack on the instant but more of gerins troopers stood near the two kings and they looked alert aragis earlier glare had been mild to the point of benignity compared to the one he gave gerin now you see what the imperials have done to my lands the archer ground out yes i see that gerin said you see theyve hurt my fighting force worse than yours aragis persisted yes i see that too gerin said nodding and so because i am weakened you think to gain at my expense aragis said of course i do gerin said im not gaining anything i didnt think was rightfully mine beforehand though how hard would you have squeezed me if things were the other way round you know the answer to that as well as i do youd take as much as you could get away with ive said it before aragis unless you make yourself so youre not my enemy youve spend twenty years not believing me will you believe me now because i am hurt here you think to drop the hammer on me aragis said as if the fox had not spoken youre repeating yourself gerin said the words are different the meaning is the same you ought to try listening to me instead if you dont want to listen to me by the gods im tempted to drop the hammer on you just to get you to pay attention for once in your life aragis turned the color of molten copper no one has presumed to speak to me in that fashion for a very long time he growled oh i believe that gerin said youre the sort who hands a fellow his head if he has the nerve to tell you something to your face that will make your vassals shut up around you i must say but itll also make you miss things you ought to hear youre not strong enough to hand me my head if i tell you something to your face so you can bloody well listen to me instead he wondered if he oughtnt to hurt aragis as badly as he could to keep the archer from trying for revenge as soon as he saw the chance the only sure way of doing that though was killing aragis now he didnt have the stomach for it murder was not a political tool he kept in his chest just for a moment aragis hand dropped down toward the hilt of his sword he checked the movement before he touched the hilt like a bear bothered by bees he shook his head slaughtering you might solve the problem but you haventquitedone anything to deserve it he said for which polite qualification i do thank you gerin said i thought about stretching you out bleeding on the ground too he grimaced this being a king is a nasty business sometimes so is being a baron so is anything above being a serf aragis said and being a serf is a nasty business too in a different way its a nasty business all the time with no letup ever if i have a choice between taking orders and giving them i know which ones for me if i had a choice id sooner do neither the fox replied aragis stared at him in blank incomprehension hed been sure aragis would do something like that as the archer himself admitted he liked giving orders with a sigh gerin went on since i dont have a choice id sooner be on the top than on the bottom i wont say different youd better not aragis said and ill tell you one other reason i didnt try to let the air out of you there youd answer to dagref gerin said hed meant it for a joke or mostly for a joke aragis however gave him a very odd look a look as nearly frightened as the fox had ever seen on his face how did you know that aragis whispered how could you know that to you hed be only a youth oh dagref is a youth all right gerin answered but its been a long time since i thought of him as only an anything if i dont strangle him in the next two or three years hell go far that one will he scratched his head did that mean hed made up his mind about the succession maybe he had duren was doing a perfectly fine job as baron of the holding that had been his grandfathers but how much did he look beyond it dagref had a wider view but dagref was also much younger and had never actually ruled a barony or anything else who could tell what hed be like when he was seventeen so maybe gerin hadnt made up his mind about the succession after all maybe back to matters at hand he said as much to himself as to aragis balser debos son wants me as his overlord i have accepted him as my vassal i dont want a war but i was ready to fight to keep that holding as part of my domain before the imperials came and i am still ready so he turned away picked up a long thin broken branch that had fallen out of a load of firewood and used it to draw a circle in the dirt around aragis feet shall we have peace or shall we fight answer me one way or the other before you step out of that circle aragis eyes looked about ready to bug out of his head of all the highhanded he spluttered you have not the right to use me so no one has the right to use me so he started to stride out of the circle but stopped when gerin held up a hand and said i have the right and its one even you understand what is it aragis demanded simpleim stronger than you are gerin answered nowpeace or war if you step out of the circle without naming one or the other we shall have war right now i promise to some degree he was running a bluff he was far from sure that if he suddenly shouted for his men to attack the archers they would obey him but he was also far from sure how many of aragis men would fight hard for their overlord aragis must have been making the same calculations and coming up with answers not far removed from his own you are an arrogant son of a whore he ground out to which the fox bowed as at a compliment may you toast your toes in the hottest of the five hells forever gerin bowed again aragis bared his teeth in another wolfs smile before going on but you are stronger than i am curse you take the holding of balser debos son keep it i hope you choke on it but i will not fight you for it he stepped out of the circle gerin wondered if he was lying if he was he would be made to pay for it that was all he had done as the fox required trying to hold him to moreeven trying to get an oath from himwould be too much in the way of arrogance weve beaten the imperials gerin said now if the time does come we can settle things that have to do with the northlands between ourselvesand if the empire puts down the revolt in sithonia and decides to have another go at us we can still fight side by side remember i am not taking anything that was yours you werent balser s suzerain you wanted him to become your vassal aye but he never did hmp if aragis was mollified he wasnt about to let gerin know it had the sandal been on the other foot gerin wouldnt have let him know it either but the archer had got a better deal from him than he would have got from from the elabonian empire and he had to know as much if crebbig i sent another army north the archer was unlikely to be inclined to throw in with it we arent friendsweve never been friends gerin said but we ve had our borders march for a lot of years without going to war against each other and thats something a good many friends cant say id sooner see it go on than end hmp aragis said again he turned and walked away hed said he wouldnt fight the fox over balsers holding if he meant that everything would be fine if he didnt gerin sighed if he didn t there would be another war that was all another war gerin was mildly amazed at how little the prospect bothered him after so many wars what would one more be and maybe aragis would live up to his word after all stranger things had happened not many gerin muttered but a few they really have he might even have meant it he hoped with all his heart that he did mean it as gerins men began pulling back from the lands over which aragis the archer ruled as king aragis said not another word about his foraging on the countryside gerin took that for a good sign he did not take the state of the countryside for a good sign aragis and his vassals were going to have a hungry time of it over the winter maybe that would leave the archer too weak to fight come spring maybe on the other hand it would leave him with no choice but to fight come spring how will you know father dagref asked oh its a simple enough business the fox answered if he attacks me he does if he doesnt he doesnt thats all yes that is simple dagref agreed but what i meant was how will you know beforehand if he does choose to attack me i may not know beforehand gerin said i may get signs beforehand that tell me he isnt going to war though if his harvest is as it looks now his serfs are liable to rise against him if they do hell be too busy dealing with them to worry about me ill say he will van put in hes been grinding his peasants faces in the dirt for a long time if they rise up theyll try to pay him back all at once some of his vassals may decide to rise against him too gerin went on hes a demon of a warlord but thats not all that goes into the mix for making a good king maybe some of his barons will decide as much anyhow maybe youll help some of them decide as much dagref said hmm maybe i will if i can do it so that aragis doesnt figure out im doing it gerin said he thumped his son on the back one fine day youre going to make all your neighbors whoever they may be very uncomfortable he was liable to make all his friends very uncomfortable too but that was another matter gerin sent riders north to duren not only to let him know what had happened in the war against the elabonian empire but also to tell him the fox had met elise that was of course something duren was liable to know already gerin instructed the riders to bring word back to him if elise was at durens keep he wondered what hed do if she was he wondered whether he could do anything if she was he had his doubts balser debos son received him like a hero gerin listened to his new vassals fulsome praise with but half an ear hed heard such praise delivered many times before and heard it done better too as often as not he knew what balser was going to say three sentences before he said it that let his mind dwell on more interesting things there were some chief among them was the way rowitha the serving girl had come out into the courtyard and was staring so intently at dagref dagref might have stared back at rowitha too if maeva hadnt been standing by van only a few feet away as things were dagref alternated between a polite smile and doing his best to pretend rowitha didnt exist that was a tricky bit of juggling a man three times dagrefs age would have had a hard time bringing it off with aplomb he did about as well as could have been expected better than most his age would have done gerin thought because he habitually showed less of what was in his mind than most maeva was watching rowitha too watching her not much liking what she was seeing and liking it less by the moment shed slept out with the rest of the riders when gerins army was on its way south only a couple of people gerin certainly not among them had known what she was then things were different now but maeva couldnt very well keep dagref from going over and talking with rowitha after balser finally finished blathering not without giving more away to van than would have been wise she had to stand and stare and do her best not to fume too openly her best wasn t so good as dagrefs had been rowitha now rowitha didnt have to hold anything back and she didnt she listened to dagrefs lowvoiced explanation or part of it and then hauled off and slapped him a ringing report that made all heads in the courtyard turn his way he stood his cheek turning redactually his whole face turning red but his cheek turning redderwhile she stomped away haw haw haw van boomed well theres something thatll happen to most men a time or twelve before they shovel dirt on em the lad may be starting a little early but then thinking back he may not too maeva by contrast hurried over and put her arm around dagrefs shoulder remembering his promise to his son gerin spoke to van you said youd hoped her eye might fall on dagref if shed stayed back at fox keep maybe its fallen on him anyhow maybe it has van agreed in tones polite but imperfectly delighted he was probably wondering how long ago maevas eye had fallen on dagref and what might have happened since turning a thoughtful frown toward gerin the outlander continued well have to speak of this further when we get back to fox keep i expect i expect we will gerin agreed he also expected he would have to dicker with fand as if in anticipation his head started to ache dagref came over to him the mark of rowithas palm and fingers still printed on his cheek father he said would you mind if i asked you to spend as little time here in balsers holding as you possible can no i wouldnt mind that gerin hid a smile we do have to head north thats good dagref said thats very good he looked around to see if the serving girl had reappeared not spotting her he relaxed a little you know if you ask balser to make sure your lady loveexcuse me your former lady lovedoesnt come inside the castle as long as youre here hell likely find her something else to do gerin said do you think so dagref looked astonished gerin felt pleased with himself though he didnt show it dagref wasnt used to asking special favors just because of who he was then his son went on would you do it for me gerin was less pleased with that if you do it i said he replied youre the one who wants the wench out of your hair when we were here last i didnt do anything to get any wenches into my hair you are the soul of virtue dagref said sourly besides mother would be in your hair if you did anything like that i didnt have anyone special in my life when rowitha and i he coughed a couple of times finishing but i do now you see gerin only shrugged which left his son dissatisfied maybe dagref talked to balser and maybe he didnt in either case maeva ate in the great hall with gerin and van and dagref and rowitha did not make an appearance there dagref did his best to pretend rowitha had never existed maeva by contrast kept looking around for her she still dressed like a warrior with a sword on her belt maybe rowitha had noticed that instead of getting orders from balser gerin did not inquire it was not his business van kept watching maeva watching out for rowitha he kept muttering things that werent quite words and that didnt quite get past his beard and mustaches he was it seemed drawing his own conclusions and not much caring for the pictures they made every now and then he would glance over toward dagref too and then mutter some more this was a match you said you wanted gerin reminded him continuing to keep his promise i think its a good one too for whatever it may be worth to you eh whatever van had been thinking it wasnt about how good a match dagref and maeva might make now very visibly he did he grunted instead of mutteringprogress of a sort at last he came out with real words oh aye fox i dont doubt youre right or i dont doubt it too much anyhow but good match or bad i didnt look for it so bloody soon that i understand neither did i though i might have noticed a sign or two even back at fox keep gerin slapped his friend on the back there isnt one cursed thing in life that doesnt happen too bloody soon especially when it happens to our children van thought that over hed had enough ale to make thinking take a while slowly and deliberately he nodded tell your fancy sithonian philosophers to go on home fox he said once youve said that you dont need to say any more gerin approached durens keep with more than a little apprehension his riders had come back to let him know elise hadnt been there then but he would still have to tell his son by her about their meeting and strife between duren and dagref was one more thing that was liable to come too bloody soon if it ever came that was too bloody soon for him durens vassal barons had been anything but delighted about accepting him as their overlord gerin had wondered if they would see his own preoccupation with the south as an opportunity to rise against his son that hadnt happened everything looked peaceful as he led his army up the elabon way toward durens keep either durens vassals had thought the fox would win and punish them for rebelling against his son or else theyd figured duren could put them down by himself gerin hoped for the latter who comes to the castle of duren ricolfs grandson a sentry shouted as the foxs army drew within hailing distance the question had a certain formal quality to iteither it was gerin or someone was about to lay siege to the keep but duren not owing his father homage and fealty he treated with him as one equal with another i am gerin the fox king of the north returning from my campaign against the elabonian empire gerin answered again as one equal to another congratulations on your victory lord king the sentry said the foxs messengers would have told of that without any orders gerin heard the drawbridge began to lower enter into the keep of duren ricolfs grandson the baron eagerly awaits you sure enough duren stood just inside the wall he looked to be about ready to burst waiting for gerin to dismount from his chariot when the fox and van and dagref did get down duren couldnt at once ask gerin what was so plainly on his mind either he had to go through polite greetings first then those greetings turned more interesting than duren might have thought they would be he gave dagref a long long look as the two of them clasped hands you were on your way to turning into a man when you came down from fox keep now unless im much mistaken youve gone and done it duren sounded almost accusing dagref answered well now ive done more of the things men do than i had then anyhow he looked at his half brother out of the corner of his eye i even picked up an ekename i dont know if it will stick but i dont know that it wont either what is it duren asked warily he used no ekenamestyling himself ricolfs grandson had helped him gain control of the holding formerly his grandfathers dagref the whip dagref was still holding the lash hed used to urge on the horses and with such effect against the imperials he hefted it to show the source of the sobriquet duren looked something less than delighted then he looked astonished for maeva came up and placed herself alongside dagref in a marked manner gerin who had become something of a connoisseur of astonishment and who had seenand causeda great deal of it over the years judged that durens had at least three flavors seeing maeva there at all seeing her there as a warrior and seeing her there so solidly beside dagref when duren turned away from dagref and maeva he spoke plaintively to his father fall out of touch for even a little while and things go all strange by the time you get another look at them even if you dont fall out of touch things have a way of going all strange behind your back gerin answered also more than a little plaintively father you speak nothing but the truth duren said come into my great hallcome into my great hall all of youand have some ale and thenhe looked toward gerinthen i will hear about my mother he spoke the last word slowly and with some hesitation for which the fox could hardly blame him as they were walking into the castle gerin said elise didnt come up here then she told me she might she didnt now durens voice was flat uninflected he went on if she set out this way she never got here do you suppose something happened to her along the way that would be terrible gerin wasnt convinced it would be so terrible as all that but he understood how his son had to feel the idea that something might have happened to elise when she was on her way to see him for the first time since abandoning him as an infant had to eat at duren as consolingly as he could gerin said shes been traveling through the northlands for a lot of years and shes always been able to take care of herself i think its likelier that she went south to visit her kin down in the empire she was talking about that too he did not mention the other possibility that had occurred to him that elise might have suffered misfortune at the hands of the imperial warriors whod come through her village after his own army retreated out of it some soldiers did whatever they pleased in their foes country elise was no longer young and beautiful but she wasnt ancient and ugly either she might not have goneshe might not have had the chance to goanywhere at all perhaps fortunately durens mind was running in a different channel in an indignant voice he said im her kin too thats so gerin agreed but one thing about your mother was always plain as long as i knew herand now too from the little i saw of herand that is that she was going to do what she was going to do and she wasnt about to listen to anyone who tried to tell her anything different what would she say about you it wasnt duren who asked the question but the avidly curious dagref most likely she would say that i never cared what she wanted to do and that i never wanted to do anything interesting myself gerin answered doing his best to be just would she be telling the truth dagref asked well i dont think so the fox said but i dont expect that she thinks im telling the truth about her now either truth is easy enough to find when youre talking about things you can see or count on your fingers it gets a lot harder when youre trying to figure out why people are the way they are and how they truly are half the time they dont know themselves hmm dagref said plainly unconvinced i always know precisely why i do what i do maeva nodded vigorous agreement as much because he was very young as because she was enamored of dagref gerin and van laughed duren looked thoughtful as if wondering which side was right is that so van rumbled dagref nodded he might not always have been right about such things but he was always sure van cocked his head to one side and said then tell me precisely why youve formed an attachment with my daughter he stared down at the foxs son dagref did precisely what gerin could have done in the same circumstances he spluttered and turned red and said nothing intelligible maeva set her hand in his most times that would have steadied him here it only seemed to make matters worse well father how precisely did you beat the imperials duren asked not everything your couriers told me was as clear as it might have been maybe he was helping ease his half brother off the hook in which case he had more charity in him than his father would have had at the same age or maybe having learned everything he couldsurely not close to everything he wantedabout his mother he was just moving along to the larger events that had taken place down toward the high kirs gerin told him the oracular verse the sibyl at bitons temple had delivered how hed interpreted it and the role dagref and ferdulf had played in fulfilling it that made duren give dagref another sharp look dagref looked back with a bland blank expression he might have stolen from gerins face he wasnt immune to discomfiture but he got over it in a hurry getting no satisfaction there duren turned to gerin and said by what i have seen and heard of dagref and what i have seen and heard of ferdulf the two of them must be lively together and so they are gerin agreed theyre pretty bloody lively apart from each other too i can see that duren gave dagref another measuring speculative stare which his half brother returned duren turned back to the fox we need to talk the two of us the three of us dagref corrected gerin shook his head i need to talk to both of you i need to do it with each one separately my minds not made up about any of these things and i dont expect it to be any time soon it should beim your eldest duren said with no small bitterness he went on but im not your son by moby your wife who raised me i can see how that makes a difference less than you think gerin answered selatre has never once pushed me to shove you aside and put him in your place she knows you d do well and i know youd do well come to that im also coming to know dagref would do well too if no one shortens him by a head he would van put in and what will you do duren asked split the kingdom between us i couldnt find a better recipe for civil war if i brought a cook up from the city of elabon gerin said with a shudder remember the barony north of you that used to be bevons and how all his sons squabbled over it for years whatever else i do i aim to make sure that doesnt happen with or to everything ive spent so long building up what does that leave then duren asked what will one of us do if you leave the whole kingdom to the other it could be that youd stay content with this barony if dagref held the kingdom gerin held up a hand before either of his sons could say anything and it could be that dagref might want to study down in the city of elabon while you took on the burdenand it is a burden believe meof ruling that would depend on what the empire decides to do about the northlands of course and theres blestar to figure into all this dagref said hes only a little fellow now but i was only a little fellow when you went off to take over this holding duren id almost forgotten about blestar duren admitted not forgotten he was there but forgotten he could mean something in all this i hadnt gerin said the gods only know now how hell turn out when hes a man though as a boy hes better natured than either of the two of you was not that thats saying much duren and dagref joined in giving their father a dirty look that didnt bother the fox who wanted the half brothers as united as they could be if in annoyance at him fair enough dagref said do you really suppose father that the empire would let me go down to the city of elabon to study before gerin answered that he let his eyes flick to maeva for a moment by her expression she didnt realize she had a rival in learning very possibly a rival more dangerous than any woman no matter how beautiful no matter how passionate gerin smiled a little if she didnt realize it yet she would before too long and dagref had asked a good question the fox gave it the best answer he could if the empire decides to take another shot at conquering us then you wont be able to go south of the high kirs no but the revolt in sithonia and the drubbing the imperials took up here are liable to make them think twice my guess is thats more likely crebbig i may never recognize aragis and me as kings but i dont think hell come up and try to knock us over again either dagref and duren both thought that over duren said what do you expect from aragis after this i hope hell lick his wounds for a while gerin answered he has plenty of them he also has plenty of vassals whove seen me which means theyve seen that a man doesnt have to be a bronzearsed son of a whore to make a proper ruler if some of them rise up or if the serfs on aragis land decide theyve had enough of being squeezed to bits then aragis will find he has the same sorts of troubles as crebbig youd weep and wail over that wouldnt you van said setting a finger by the side of his nose so i would gerin said dryly id weep till my eyes were all red and swollen he let out an exaggerated sob everyone laughed some time later after roasted mutton and freshbaked bread and berry tarts and a good many jacks of ale duren waved for gerin to walk out from the great hall into the court between the outer wall and the castle itself darkness had fallen tiwaz a mediumfat crescent hung low in the southwest ruddy elleb just past first quarter shone in the south pale nothos nearly full climbed above the eastern wall math would not rise for another hour or two duren said i wish youd found out more about my mothereither more or nothing at all i understand gerin said setting a hand on his shoulder but we do what we can do not what we wish we could do i didnt expect to find out anything at all i didnt even know her till she spoke nor she me he started to add maybe shell turn up one day but decided that would do more harm than good duren was no doubt thinking it too but the gulf between thinking something and saying it yawned wide and deep now i wish id come along with you duren said maybe its just as well you werent there weve all changed a good deal these past twenty years last time your mother saw you you were making messes on the floor that was not his principal concern his principal concern was how much damage elise might do if she turned duren against him he still didnt know whether she could but he still didnt want to find out either ive changed duren said my mother must have changed or she wouldnt have gone away from you honh gerin said borrowing the useful notquiteword from van before he could add anything to it duren went on but you father youve hardly changed at all you only say that because youre watching me with a sons eyes gerin answered im like anybody else im soup in a pot and the years boil away more and more of the water so my flavor gets stronger and saltier the same way my beard keeps right on getting grayer the longer you live the more you go about the business of turning into yourself duren didnt fully follow that gerin hadnt expected that he would duren said i suppose ill have to go on as best i can i don t see what else i can do do you father i dont think there is anything else you can do gerin told him nothing useful anyhow pining away over mighthavebeens doesnt help he clicked his tongue between his teeth other thing ill say is youre elises son aye but youre my son too or you wouldnt think that way remember it i always do duren answered not quite for the first time gerin thought that whatever happened to his kingdom hed leave some good behind dagref urged the horses up from a walk to a trot the chariot swung around the curve in the road that brought fox keep into sight its still there and its still mine gerin said a lot of people have tried taking it away from you van said youve made em all sorry they mostly know better now i wish they did gerin said i wish they had for a long time id have lived a more peaceable life if it were so van snorted a wordless expression of his opinion about what a peaceable life was worth gerin ignored him the drawbridge swung down over the ditch around the palisade as soon as the folk inside fox keep recognized gerin and the warriors who still accompanied him those who did not dwell at his keep had already peeled off and headed for their own homes as he had to durens keep hed sent riders ahead to his own so people knew he was returning if not in triumph at least in something close to it men and womenand geroge and tharma with themcame spilling out over the drawbridge van pointed theres fand he said gloomily now im for it shell have to hear about every time i dropped my drawers for some hussy since i rode out of here and shell make me pay for all of em sure enough fand charged out ahead of most of the rest of the people so far ahead that ferdulf feeling mischievous dove on herand just missed spitting himself on a knife she pulled from her belt and thrust at him he darted away shouting abuse fand screeched back but for once after an army returned from campaign she did not screech at van instead she ran toward rihwins riders and screeched at maeva for going off and fighting without letting her know shed done it well isnt this nice van said beaming i come home to peace and quiet at least aimed at me the smile slipped it wont last it cant last it never lastsbut ill enjoy it while it does maeva plainly did not enjoy it mother she said im home safe ive killed a couple of men and im home safe gerin noted she did not mention taking a wound of her own she did not impress fand either och youve killed have you now if that was all you wanted you could have waited till some lustful young spalpeen tried putting his hands where they dont belong then stuck a knife twixt his ribs whilst he was after trying to stick summat else twixt your legs i have no trouble taking care of myself there either maeva answered no one will ever do anything to me that i dont want van rumbled something deep in his chest in front of gerin dagrefs ears turned pink and fand who though hottempered was far from a fool exclaimed and whos been doing things to you that you do want now maeva did not answer not in front of everyone but gerin had no doubt she would before too longand van knew and a good many others who could tell fand maybe she would approve of the match maybe she wouldnt too gerin would find out in due course ride on into the keep he told dagref easier to sort everything out in there than out here aye father dagref said as the chariot made its slow way forward through the crowd he and gerin both waved to selatre and to clotild and blestar as well van waved to kor his son looked furiously jealous of maeva whod had the chance to go out and fight and kill maeva let her hand fall to the hilt of her sword which only infuriated kor even more gerin whod had his older sibling flaunt privileges too knew a certain amount of sympathy for the boy he jumped down from the chariot as it slowed to a halt not too far away fand was still shouting at maeva why couldnt you go saving yourself for a nice lad like that dagref say instead of letting some rough soldier ha his way with you the shame of it now dagref jumped down after gerin as soon as a stable boy had taken charge of the horses well we wont have too much trouble there will we he murmured not if she wishes maeva had saved herself for me i mean theres always going to be trouble with fand gerin answered also quietly the only question is how much by the sound of that there shouldnt be too much of course when she finds out you and maeva are already well something more than friends therell be a row over that too i expect dagref sighed youre probably rightpeople get so excited over these things before gerin could respond to that selatre and clotild flung themselves onto him while blestar was flinging himself onto dagref gerin kissed his wife and daughter blestar didnt want kisses he wanted every single solitary detail of dagrefs adventures he wanted the details on the spot and not even his older brothers astonishingly retentive memory looked likely to be good enough to satisfy him clotild having got her share of kisses and hugs from her father tried to get some from dagref too which put him off his stride in his narration which made blestar shout at clotild gerin laughed its so good to be home he said selatre laughed too then she glanced at him sidelong i hope youll say that tonight and sound more as if you mean it she said adding if we can find somewhere to be alone that is the library gerin whispered in her ear even if ferdulf is liable to fly up and peek through the window and even if dagref is liable to figure out why we keep that rolledup bolt of cloth in there but the library even so yes indeed he slipped his arm around her waist she molded herself to him dagref will figure that out will he selatre asked gerin nodded his wife clicked her tongue between her teeth time does go on doesnt it doesnt it though gerin said he hesitated then spoke of something he had not entrusted to the riders whod come up to fox keep ahead of him i was passing through a village down in the land aragis rules and i happened to run into elise there just for a heartbeat the name did not register with selatre it was not one the fox had been in the habit of using often then it did and her eyes widened durens mother she said in a voice that showed nothing whatever aye durens mother gerin said i dont know where she is now or what shes doing he explained how hed told elise of ricolfs passing how shed spoken of going south over the high kirs and how she had not come back to the barony that had been her fathers and now was her sons and if you think im sorry that she hasnt youre very much mistaken no i dont think that selatre still held her voice under tight restraint that restraint was revealing in itself after a little while she said i never thought you would see her again neither did i gerin answered and i would have been just as well pleased if i hadnt believe me something in selatre eased the fox hadnt noticed how tensely she was holding herselfalmost like a bow strung and drawntill she stopped doing it she said im sorry but i cant help worrying about these things you did find her before you found me after all his hand still rested on the curve of her hip he squeezed just for a moment and do you want to know what she taught me he asked selatres nod was wary he said she taught me to know when i was well off because she gave me a standard of comparison you might say selatre thought about that for a moment then threw her arms around his neck after she finished kissing him she said you just made me want to drag you up to the library right now why gerin asked innocently did you come up with a new codex while i was away on campaign selatre snorted and planted an elbow in his ribs when you choose you can be most absurd she said best of all and one of the many reasons he was so fond of her was that she made it sound like a compliment how have things been while i was gone on the whole very well selatre answered the weather has been good and the harvest looks promising she and gerin both glanced toward the west the gradi still had their foothold in the northlands out where the niffet flowed into the orynian ocean but theyd stayed quiet since their gods got embroiled with baivers and the gods of the monsters who dwelt in some of the caves below bitons shrine if that fight ever ended the gods of the gradi and the gradi themselves might prove troublesome again it hadnt happened yet though with luck it wouldnt happen for many years to come on the whole you say gerin knew when his wife had things to add even if she tried to paint as bright a picture as she could she nodded now yes on the whole the one worrisome thing i can think of is that if tharma isnt carrying pupsand i dont think she is right nowits not from lack of effort if you understand what im saying gerin sighed loud and long well weve been waiting for that to happen for quite a while so i cant say im surprised the gods only know what ill do about it if she does bear pups or cubs or babies or whatever you want to call them but i cant say im surprised the gods who may know best what you should do if tharma gives birth are busy fighting the gradi gods selatre said oh the monsters gods gerin said and his wife nodded he went on i was thinking of them in a different connection a moment ago i suppose youre right and for that matter maevas luckyor careful onenot to be coming home great with child herself selatres eyes widened you mean fand wasnt just shouting to hear herself shout the way she does so often not this time the fox answered he hesitated then spoke one word more dagref selatres eyes got wider still but hes not old enough shes not old enough either come to that then she counted on her fingers and frowned time does run away doesnt it they could i suppose but i wish they wouldnt so do i gerin said outside of wishing though i havent the faintest idea what to do about it but let it run its course and see what comes of that van and fand both seem to think a match between the two of them would be good and i dont mind one either how about you if its what they want i dont mind his wife said i wouldnt want it right away though they arent old enough to know their own minds lets see what they think two or three years from now that sounds good to me gerin agreed my guess is van and fand wont mind either whether dagref and maeva will put up with waiting two or three more years though is another question if they stay attached to each other theyll just get more attached if you know what i mean i suppose so selatre said when i was their age though i was waiting for the old sibyl to die i was to be a maiden and had no chance to form an attachment to any male she took his arm in hers so that his also brushed against the side of her breast ive made up for it since thats good gerin let it go there he couldnt say he wondered if he would be around in two or three more years because saying as much would bring up the question of the succession and the succession was the one thing hed ever found that he did not care to discuss with selatre no shed never urged him to name dagref over duren he didnt think she would urge him to do that but he didnt want to set temptation in front of her either if dagref kept growing as well as he had latelyand if no one hit him over the head with a rock for being so maddeningly right all the timethe decision might shape itself if dagref made everyone want to hit him over the head with a rock even if no one did the decision would shape itself too the other way if neither of those things happened gerin would have to shape things himself he shook his head he would have to try to shape things himself whatever choice he made by the very nature of things he wouldnt be around to enforce it that would be up to his sons and to selatre if she outlived him and to all his vassals many of them these days the sons of the men whod first given him homage and fealty some the grandsons no matter how long you last he murmured far more to himself than to selatre sooner or later things fall from your hands his wife thought along with him as she often did they dont fall and break though someone catches them and carries on you did when the trokmoi killed your father and your brother she said no more than that she didnt suggest that someone would catch the affairs of gerins kingdom when they did fall from his hands suggesting such a thing was as much as implying that someone should be dagref gerin thought about duren competently running his barony about dagref fighting well and also falling in what might be love with maeva youre right he said one way or another things do go on pretty soon theyll be in someone elses hands not pretty soon i hope and whosever hands theyre in your mark will be on them selatre said he considered that then slowly nodded i suppose it will i helped keep the trokmoi from overrunning all the northlandsand the ones who did settle south of the niffet are mostly my vassals these days i kept the monsters from breaking out too all except geroge and tharma anyhow if i didnt drive the gradi from the northlands i pinned them back against the ocean and i could be wrong but i dont think the elabonian empire will trouble us again any time soon the gods know i havent been perfect but ive done pretty well when you think how things can go for a man ill take that he nodded once more aye ill take that
