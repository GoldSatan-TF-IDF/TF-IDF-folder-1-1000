beyond the gap harry turtledove i when the wind blew down from the north nidaros felt as if the glacier had never gone away two thousand years before the spired city that ruled the raumsdalian empire was a mammothhunting camp at the southeastern corner of hevring lake the great accumulation of meltwater ator rather just beyondthe southern edge of the glacier hevring lake was centuries gone now whatever had dammed its outlet to the west finally let go and the great basin emptied in a couple of dreadful days the scoured badlands of the western marches were the scarred reminders of that flood the glacier had fallen back too new meltwater lakes farther north marked its retreating border these days farmers raised oats and rye and even barley in what they called hevring basin no wild mammoths had been seen anywhere near nidaros for generations they followed the ice north sometimes though mastodons would lumber out of the forest to raid the fields back when nidaros lived by mammoth ivory and mammoth hides and rendered mammoth fat and dried mammoth flesh no one would have imagined forests by hevring lake the glacier was strong then and its grip on the weather even stronger that was tundra country in those days frozen hard forever beneath a frosty sky so it seemed all those years ago anyhow now as count hamnet thyssen rode up toward nidaros he thought about how the world changed while men werent looking he was a big dark heavyset man who rode a big dark heavyset horse over his mail he wore a jacket of direwolf hides closed tight against that cold north wind the head from a sabertooth skin topped his helm the beast was posed so its fangs jutted forward instead of dropping down in front of his eyes his thoughts were as slow and ponderous as his body many other men would get where they were going faster than he did whether the journey was by land or over the stormy seas of thought but if the way got rough or if it petered out altogether many other men would turn back in dismay count hamnet carried on and on and on sooner or later he got where he was going and much good its done me he thought sourly his left hand mittened in bearskin against the wind rose to scratch at the white streak in his thick black beard but for that streak the beard would have hidden the great scar seaming the left side of his jaw he muttered under his breath fog puffed from his mouth and his great prow of a nose if hed thought faster ten years ago he would have realized sooner that his wife was betraying him if hed thought faster he might even have found a way to make her not want to betray him and if hed moved faster in the world her laughing lover never would have been able to lay his face open like that the other man was dead so was his loveor so he kept telling himself anyhow he would have taken gudrid back she didnt want to come where shed left him secretly before she left him openly then and hed never found anyone he cared about since he muttered again gudrid and eyvind torfinn lived in nidarosone more reason hamnet stayed in his cold stone keep out on the eastern frontier as much as he could but when the emperor summoned count hamnet came sigvat ii was a man for whom disobedience and rebellion meant the same thing as hamnet neared nidaros gray stone walls he had to rein in to let a merchant caravan come out through the south gate horses and mules and twohumped hairy camels were laden with the products of the north some carried mammoth tusks others bore horns cut from the carcasses of woolly rhinos many in the southand not a few in the raumsdalian empire believed rhinoceros horn helped a mans virility what people believed often turned out to be true just because they believed it charlatans and mages were quick to take advantage of that which was which hamnet thyssen shook his head he doubted there was any firm dividing line baled hides burdened other beasts still others bore baskets and bundles that hid their contents a few horses hauled carts behind them the ungreased axles squealed the carts bumped up and down as their wheels jounced in the ruts merchants rode with the animals some were plump and prosperous with karakul hats and long coats of otter or marten over tunics and baggy breeches tucked into boots of butterysoft leather or more often of felt others were accoutered more like hamnet thyssenthey were men ready to fight to keep what they owned and the caravan had a proper fighting tail of guards too inside the empire they were probablyprobablyso much swank but beyond the borders bandit troops thrived some of the guards were raumsdalians in chainmail like hamnets armed with bows and slashing swords others were blond bizogot mercenaries out of the north the lancers looked as if they would rather be herding mammoths than riding horses even though they were many and he only one they gave him hard stares as they rode past their cold blue eyes reminded him of the glacier in whose shadow they dwelt he rode through the south gate himself once the caravan came forth a guard stepped out into the middle of the roadway to block his path with upraised hand the fellow said who are you and what is your business in the capital he sounded like what he wasan underofficer puffed up with his own petty authority most men coming into nidaros would have had to bow and scrape before him they might have had to grease his palm before he let them pass too no wonder he was puffed up then the count looked down his long nose at the gate guard i am hamnet thyssen he said quietly i have an appointment with his majesty oh the gate guard stumbled back all but tripping over his own feet pppass on your grace petty authority punctured he deflated like a pricked pigs bladder at another timeor more likely were he another manthat would have made count hamnet laugh here now he just felt sad without another word he booted his horse forward and rode into smoky smelly nidaros he hadnt gone more than a few feet forward before a man sitting on horseback in front of a tavern rode out alongside him good day count hamnet the rider said his voice a light musical tenor god grant you long years i dont know you hamnet s eyes narrowed as he surveyed the foxyfaced newcomer the crowsfeet at their corners deepened and darkened when he did he shook his head no wait ulric skakki or im a bizogot forgive me its been a few years he pulled off his right mitten and held out his hand ulric skakki had an infectious grin as he clasped hands with count hamnet he said dont worry about it your grace im not offended dyou think im a bizogot he might have been a lot of things though he spoke raumsdalian perfectly he might well not have been a native of the empire but a truculent mammothherder from the fringes of the glacier that never count hamnet started forward forgive me but i have business in the city i know ulric said i was waiting for you i have the same business you see do you hamnet eyed him suspiciously with he didnt finish his hand slipped toward the basket hilt of his sword the basket was big enough to let him wield the blade even with a mitten if ulric skakki didnt give him the right answer well no matter what sort of trick the other man had in mind he wouldnt profit from it but ulric skakki nodded yes with the emperor count hamnets hand retreated not quite so smoothly as it had advanced he hadnt known sigvat had summoned anyone else but since he still didnt know why the emperor had summoned him he couldnt be surprised his majesty had also called someone else and ulric was a man of parts no doubt about it just what the parts added up to yes that was a different question lets go then hamnet said roughly and rode on into nidaros yes lets ulric skakkis voice was mild as milk sweet as honey he rode beside hamnet as if he had not a care in the world maybe he didnt some men were born without a conscience or perhaps had it sorcerously removed count hamnets still worked all too well however much he wished it didnt nidaros nidaros was worse than a maze for a maze bespoke intelligent design nidaros was a jumble surely the place where the phrase you cant get there from here was bornand where it had flourished mightily ever since nidaros streets and lanes and alleys twisted back on one another worse than a mammoths bowels in the cavern of its belly the imperial capital was an old town an old old town which helped account for that new cities farther south had their streets arranged in neat grids some running northeast and southeast others northwest and southwest strangers could find their way around in them with the greatest of ease hamnet thyssen knew that was true hed done it by the time a man learned to navigate all the quarters of nidaros he was commonly too old to get around with ease you steered by smell as much as any other way the street of the perfumers ran not far from the palace the butchers and dyers districts gave the southern part of town through which hamnet and ulric skakki rode now a different sort of pungency because those districts were in the southern part of town the wind from the glacier blew their stinks away more often than not the glacier the great shield over the north of the world you couldnt see it from nidaros any more as you had been able to in ancient days but its might though somewhat lessened still lingered and the glacier and the wind from the glacier was the other reason nidaros streets behaved the way they did no one wanted to give the wind from the glacier a running start it was bad enough without one narrow winding streets helped blunt its force nothing could stop it nothing could defeat it the bizogots who lived and hunted out in the open far to the north of nidaros called it the breath of god hamnet thyssen had no love for most bizogots nor they for him but he could not quarrel with them over the name no you couldnt beat the wind if you werent a bizogot if you dwelt within the marches of the raumsdalian empire you did what you could to blunt it streets twisted houses stood tall and almost shoulder to shoulder their steeppitched roofs helped shed snow windows were small and slitlike to hold heat in no house no shop in nidaros had a northfacing doorway walls unlucky enough to face north were almost always blank where owners could afford it they were double to put a deadair space between living and working quarters and the ravening wind rich people on the street wore furs the richer the man or woman the richerand the warmerthe fur poor folk made do with wool folk too poor to keep their capes and cloaks and greatcoats in good repair didnt last long not in nidaros why do you suppose the emperor wants us ulric skakki asked after a long and not very companionable silence well its not for our looks count hamnet answered ulric skakki blinked then laughed loud and merrily enough to make heads turn up and down the cobbled street hamnet had tried to stay away from nidaros since gudrid started her wandering ways he still knew how to get around the city in a rough sort of way but he wasnt as confident as he had been once upon a time he found himself letting ulric skakki take the lead the foxyfaced man didnt hesitate he might be wrong but he wasnt in doubt and he turned out not to be wrong either hamnet thyssens nose told him as much even before he caught sight of the towers of the imperial palace above the rooftops if you smelled musk and sandalwood from distant shores and rosewater in the air you were close to the street of perfumers and if you were close to the street of perfumers you were also close to the palace a deep ditch surrounded the palaces thick walls it wasnt for storing snow though it sometimes filled during the winter it was literally the last ditch if god forbid an enemy broke into nidaros the palace could serve as a citadel till rescuers arrived or chances are till it falls count hamnet thought morosely chances were that piercing the heart of the raumsdalian empire would kill it being as sensitive about omens as any less gloomy man he held that thought to himself a drawbridge spanned the ditch guards at the outer end of the bridge lowered their spears to horizontal to bar the way halt their sergeant called who comes count hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki gave their names we are expected ulric added well just see about that the sentry produced a scrap of parchment and lips moving read through the list on it he might have been cousin to the man count hamnet encountered at the south gatenothing was official till he said it was in due course he did he nodded to his comrades who raised their spears pass on he said horses hooves booming on the planks of the drawbridge hamnet and ulric skakki rode on on the far side of the bridge unarmed attendants took charge of the newcomers horses armed attendants relieved them of their weapons hamnet thyssen surrendered his sword his dagger and a holdout knife in his right boot ulric skakki wore his holdout knife in his left boot which reminded hamnet he was dangerous with either hand hed forgotten that about the other man after the guardsmen disarmed them a mage came up with a knife carved of wood he held it in his left hand and made passes with his right all the while murmuring a spell the language of the charm was older far older than raumsdalian itself not a young speech the wizard used it by rote only a vanishing handful of scholars spoke it with understanding rote or not the charm served its purpose the wizard suddenly stopped and stiffened he pointed to ulric skakki on his right arm he exclaimed growling like dire wolves the attendants seized hamnets companion sure enough he carried a stiletto slim but deadly in a sheath strapped to his right forearm what do you have to say for yourself wretch a guardsman growled the tip of his sword at ulrics throat that among other things i am charged with ensuring that his majestys safety is everything it ought to be ulric skakki answered speak with the first minister use my name if he does not confirm it drink my blood he sounded as calm as if haggling over buttered oatcakes one of the attendants hurried away the others stayed ready to slay ulric skakki on the instant count hamnet watched ulric out of the corner of his eye even if the first minister vouched for the other man that could mean one of two things maybe ulric was telling the truth or maybe he and the first minister were plotting against the emperor together in due course the attendant returned it is as this fellow says he said an unhappy expression on his face he is one of lord dragnars agents hamnet wondered if he ought to speak up before he could the chief guardsman said oh he is is he well lets strip him then and see what else hes carrying they didnt just peel ulric skakkis clothes off him they examined him much more intimately than hamnet thyssen would have cared to be searched and they found a couple of sharpedged throwing disks that could double as armlets as well as a long sturdy pinall objects that escaped the notice of the usual search spell by the scars that seamed ulric skakkis arms and legs and torso hed done more fighting than count hamnet would have guessed by the nasty smile on his face the guards hadnt found everything to him that seemed more important than standing there naked and shivering in the hallway that nasty smile goaded sigvat iis attendants as no doubt it was meant to do at last in a seam of ulric skakkis jacket they found a nasty little sawedged blade all right now youve got all of it ulric skakki said can i have my clothes back its bloody cold get dressed the chief guardsman said if it was up to me he didnt say exactly what would happen then whatever it was count hamnet didnt think he would want it to happen to him ulric skakki dressed without another word if hed told the attendants and the wizard they should have done a better job of protecting the emperor they would have found ways to make himand incidentally count hamnet thyssensorry for it as things were he projected an air of silent reproach that also had to set their teeth on edge come with me one of the attendants said when ulric had his clothes on again on they went the maze of corridors and passageways inside the palace was nearly as confusing as the maze of streets and lanes and alleys outside though count hamnet had not come here for years he found his bump of direction still worked this isnt the way to the throne room he said sharply no its not your grace the attendant agreed but it is the way to his majestys private chambers oh count hamnet said startled in all the years hed come to the palace hed been to the emperors private chambers only once or twice can you tell me what this is about he asked whatever it was it bore even more weight than hed thought when the order calling him away from his castle arrived the attendant shook his head whatever it is his majesty will tell you what you need to know hamnet muttered as he tramped along he had always been a man for whom the emperors word was the beall and endall in life now he found himself dissatisfied with having to wait for it a slight smile pulled up the corners of ulric skakkis mouth almost it seemed in spite of themselves hamnet scowled at him thinking so you know that about me do you ulric skakki looked back blandly the little smile still on his face as if to say well what if i do hamnet trudged ahead he didnt like other people understanding him so well being able to think along with him gudrid had taught him the hard way how dangerous that could be not that he was in any great danger of falling in love with ulric skakki the first thing you had to do around ulric was keep your hands in your pockets or else theyd get picked and how could you love anyone you couldnt trust gudrid had taught him the folly of that too by comparison ulrics being of the wrong gender seemed a thing of little weight a palace servitor fed more charcoal into a brazier braziers and fireplaces scattered through the enormous building heated it somewhat hamnet hadnt walked five paces past this brazier before a frigid breeze slithered down the back of his neck maybe that was just as well in places sealed too tightly against the cold men sometimes lay down by braziers and never got up again not even wizards knew why that happened but no one doubted that it did wait here the attendant told hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki the man ducked through a doorway hamnet could hear him speaking to someone inside but couldnt make out his words yes yes send them in ive been waiting for them havent i count hamnet had no trouble hearing that nor in recognizing sigvat iis voice emperors often had less cause to exercise discretion than ordinary mortals did out came the attendant he gestured to hamnet and ulric skakki they followed him into the chamber rather than on his throne sigvat ii sat on an ordinary threelegged pine stool hamnet thyssen being of noble blood dropped to one knee before his sovereign ulric skakki fell to both kneeshe was only a commoner a tall blond bizogot stood in the room his back to the fireplace his blue eyes blazed contempt bizogots bent the knee before god but to no living man this nomad from the northern steppe wore a cape made from the skin of a shortfaced bear that meant hed killed the animal himself bizogot men would not use hides from beasts they had not slain and anyone whod killed a shortfaced bear would not be likely to have much trouble with mere men the emperor broke into count hamnet s thoughts saying rise gentlemen hamnets knee clicked as he got to his feetone more reminder he wasnt as young as he used to be ulric skakki rose as smoothly as if dipped in bear grease hamnet wished he hadnt had that thought it made his eyes travel to the formidablelooking bizogot again the man scowled at him instead of scowling back at the barbarian count hamnet asked sigvat how may we serve you your majesty however he and ulric skakki were to serve it would involve the bizogot in some way the man wouldnt be here otherwise hamnet found the prospect less than delightfulquite a bit less in factbut knew he couldnt do anything about it there is news from the north the emperor said which was anything but a surprise though hamnet thyssen would never have said such a thing hed long thought sigvat ii had a gift for the obvious sigvat was unlikely to go down in history as one of the great raumsdalian emperors no one five hundred years from now would speak of him in the same breath as domaldi the conqueror or faxi bloodhand or even smiling solveig who hadnt been much of a generalor indeed much of an emperorbut whod passed away in circumstances that proved his personal popularity and what is the news from the north your majesty ulric skakki asked when the emperor didnt go on right away sigvat ii looked a trifle miffed at being pushed but he seldom looked more than a trifle miffed he was a goodnatured man his face round and bland suggested as much but hamnet thyssen saw something in sigvat s eyes hed never even imagined there before was it fear or awe or a bit of both he couldnt be sure it was too unfamiliar i think sigvat said i had better let trasamund here give it to you he found it and he is the man who brought it to nidaros trasamund he added is jarl of the three tusk clan of the bizogots jarl hamnet thyssen said in surprise the clan chief came here himself he spoke to the emperor not to the bizogot i am the clan chief and i came here myself trasamund said in excellent raumsdalian he looked from count hamnet to ulric skakki and back again do the two of you know my clan he used the dual number implying hamnet and ulric were a natural pair that insulted count hamnet by the pained look on ulric skakkis face he liked it none too well either ulric skakkis expression also said he knew something of the three tusk clan before he could parade his knowledge count hamnet beat him to the punch i do he said stressing that ever so slightly you dwell in the farthest north up against the glacier as close as any folk may go trasamund grunted and nodded had the raumsdalians not heard of the three tusk clan that would have been a deadly insultthough few men this far south in the raumsdalian empire troubled to tell one barbarous band from another since hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki did know of his clan and its place in the fierce frigid bizogot scheme of things the jarl accepted their knowledge as no less than his due knowing who we are and our position then you will know also that we travel up the gap as far as we may trasamund rumbled it only stands to reason hamnet thyssen said and ulric skakki nodded for long and long and long the glacier that capped the north of the world had been a single vast sheet scholars claimed it was three miles thick in spots count hamnet had no idea how they knew or how they thought they knew but he wasnt prepared to call them liars hed seen the edge of the glacier himself on journeys among the bizogots those shining cliffs seemed to climb forever when the edge stood not far north of nidaros in the days before the raumsdalian empire rose to greatness the glacier had still been a single sheet but as it drew back over the centuries that followed it drew back not straight north but to the northeast and the northwest thus what raumsdalians called the gapa narrow stretch of bare ground between the two lobes of the glacier the bizogots used a word with the same literal meaning but much earthier associations by god hamnet thyssen said softly by god will you tell me jarl trasamund of the three tusk clan will you tell me the gap has cloven the glacier in two ulric skakki whistled softly a low mournful note count hamnet felt like doing the same there were metaphysicians and more than a few of them who argued that the gap could not possibly divide the glacier for the glacier had to go on forever though no metaphysician himselffar from ithed always inclined toward that view himself so did most men whod actually set eyes on the glacier it was too vast to imagine its having an end but trasamund nodded he also scowled plainly he did not care to be anticipated anticipated he was though and he would have to make the best of it i will tell you this southern man for it is so do you call me a liar if hamnet thyssen did call him a liar one of them would die in the next few minutes hamnet was large and formidable but trasamund was larger still and stronger and younger all the same count hamnet thought he could take the bizogot if he had to here though the issue did not arise for hamnet shook his head not at all your ferocity he invested the jarls title with not even a grain of irony no not at all tell us thenwhat lies beyond the glacier hamnet leaned toward trasamund waiting for the answer so did sigvat ii ulric skakki also listened intently but seemed rather less interested hamnet thyssen wondered why beyond the glacier he might as well have said beyond the moon anything might lie there anything at all some folk said god led men into this promised land and then laid down the glacier to keep evildoers from following them some said the men here were evildoers and god had laid down the glacier to keep them from finding the earthly paradise that lay beyond it some said the men here had always been here and the glacier had always been here and nothing lay beyond it count hamnet had always inclined toward that view too but maybe he was wrong havent been far yet you understand trasamund said hamnet ulric skakki and sigvat ii nodded as one man the bizogot went on what ive seen of the land beyond the glacier looks a lot like what id see on this side just below it its tundra country a cold steppe the animals are strange though buffalo near the size of woolly rhinos big wandering herds of squat shaggy deer wolves bigger than coyotes smaller than dire wolves white bearssmaller than shortfaced bears but i think slier and sneakier too men all three raumsdalians asked the question at the same time i didnt meet any maybe i was lucky not to trasamund answered id say there are some for the animals were wary of me theyve been hunted i have no doubt of that but the way northwest is open if the weather doesnt turn cold enough to make the ice sheets grow together again itll stay open did you see any signany sign at allof the golden shrine sigvat ii asked again the emperor and hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki leaned toward trasamund as if a lodestone were drawing them people who claimed this land south of the glacier was promised to those who lived in it said the golden shrine was what had kept their enemies from following them all those ages ago people who claimed this land was in the hands of evildoers or their descendants said the golden shrine was made to keep them in people who claimed the glacier went on forever mostly didnt think there was any such thing as the golden shrine count hamnet hadnt now how could anyone know what to believe now i saw nothing of that sort myself trasamund answered but its on account of the golden shrine that i came down here to nidaros with the word you raumsdalians know more about old things than we do if its there and if we find it i wouldnt want to touch off a curse you understand not even knowing i was doing it next time i go north i ought to have raumsdalians along too just in case you might say to turn aside any curses hamnet wondered or to make sure we get our fair share of them were bizogots devious enough to think that way hamnet wasnt so sure about most of the barbarians the jarl of the three tusk clan struck him as sly enough and then some here you have two bold men who will go anywhere a bizogot will the emperor said nodding to count hamnet and ulric skakki in turn both have traveled widely in the north of the world and both are presently ah at liberty hamnet thyssen knew what that small imperial exhalation meant as far as he was concerned it meant he would benot happier but less unhappythe farther from nidaros he went hed never dreamt of going beyond the glacier but if that didnt put enough distance between him and gudrid nothing could odds were nothing could and what of ulric skakki why was he so willing to leave the empire for parts unknown was he running away from someone from something was he running toward something in hamnet thyssens experience that was far less common but it wasnt impossible right now hamnet had no answers only questions on the journey if they made the journey maybe the answers would come out maybe they wouldnt do too much harm when they did hamnet could hope they wouldnt as long as he remembered hopes were only shadows that too often vanished in the pitiless light of reality as he was looking at ulric skakki so trasamund the jarl was eyeing him and ulric both yes they may do the jarl said at last the name of hamnet thyssen is not unknown in the north and this other fellow is a likely roguei have heard of him too but will they be enough we bizogots we have likely rogues aplenty we have warriors aplenty toogood fighting men i mean no disrespect to you count hamnet hamnet thyssen bowed i take none you do not insult me or tell me anything i did not know when you say i am not unique one more thing gudrid had taught him if shed found a more painful way to give him the lesson than any bizogot jarl might that only meant it would stick better as trasamund eyed hamnet and ulric so sigvat ii eyed him what would you then your ferocity the emperor asked when we go through the gap again your majesty our band will have a shaman with it the wisest bizogot shaman i can talk into coming along trasamund said but there is wisdom and then there is wisdom the empire has more of it than we do you can afford it you sit in towns and what are towns but stores of things things like books for instance i said it beforeyour memories are longer than ours firmer than ours give us a wizard give us awhat word do you use his big head bobbed up and down as he found it give us a scholar by god now count hamnet studied the jarl in surprise not all bizogots even realized they were barbarians by the standards of the raumsdalian empire most of the ones who did realize it answered raumsdalian scorn with contempt of their own to them raumsdalians were weak and tricky and corrupt of use to the bizogots not for themselves but for their things the things they could make and keep and the northerners couldnt but trasamund plainly was no ordinary mammothherder he grasped something a lot of raumsdalians couldntthat the way writing bound knowledge across time gave the empire a breadth and a depth of thought no bizogot clan could even approach facing the unknown beyond the glacier trasamund wanted people equipped to understand itif any people were sigvat ii seemed taken aback when he did not answer at once count hamnet said your majesty if a wizard and a scholar will go with us we would do well to have them who knows what we may find who knows what we may try to understand the golden shrine ulric skakki murmured hamnet thyssen still had no idea if there was any such thing as the golden shrine an hour earlier he would have laughed at the very idea he wasnt laughing now if the gap had opened who could say what lay beyond the glacier no one nowno one except trasamund and whoever traveled with him and whoever lived beyond the glacier if anyone did trasamund thought so hamnet wouldnt have believed it but so what the opening of the gap made his beliefs and everyone elses in the empire irrelevant belief worked well enough when a man could not measure it against facts but when he could facts crushed belief like a mammoth crushing a vole after a few heartbeats of thought the emperor nodded well your ferocity your grace let it be as you desire sigvat said we shall indeed summon a scholar and a sorcerer to accompany you god grant they prove useful trasamund and count hamnet both bowed the jarl of the three tusk clan said i thank you for your kindness your majesty and for your wisdom it was not my wisdomit was yours sigvat said count hamnet helped me see it count hamnet has a name for good sense the bizogot chieftain said i was glad when you summoned him you have heard of me too you said what do i have a name for ulric skakki inquired in what might have been amusement or might have been something altogether darker and more dangerous trasamund took him literally answering for getting in and getting out again where we are going what we are doing that may be the best name of all to have each of you will be my guest here at the palace till we find you suitable companions sigvat said i will lay on a reception and a feast in your honor tonight so much for wisdom so much for good sense count hamnet thought unhappily now he was stuck in nidaros for god only knew how long stuck in the same town with gudrid and eyvind torfinn he wished he could have got in and got out again and it was his own damned fault he hadnt ii torches blazed bravely they drove night back to the corners of the dining hall even if they did fill the room with a strong odor of hot mammoth fat perfumed beeswax candles spilled out more golden light and fought the tallow reek to something close to a draw a goblet of mead in his hand count hamnet thyssen surveyed the throng gathered at least partly in his honor he tried to imagine some of these gilded popinjays up on the tundra or in the endless forests to the east that was enough to squeeze a grunt of laughter from even his somber spirit so far he hadnt spotted either his former wife or her new lord and master he snorted again more sourly than before he didnt think even a wild bizogot could master gudrid and he didnt think many wild bizogots would be fool enough to try his gaze flicked to trasamund tall and fair and handsome the jarl had already acquired a circle of female admirers the smile on his ruddy face said he enjoyed the attention the ruddiness on his smiling face said hed already had as much meador beer or ale or even sweet wine from the far southwestas was good for him up on the tundra bizogots drank fermented mammoths milk count hamnet had made its acquaintance it was as bad as it sounded no matter how nasty it was the bizogots drank heroically anything worth doing is worth overdoing summed up the nomads view of the world and bizogots wenched as heroically as they drank that mightwas all too like tocause trouble hamnet drifted toward a steward a word to the wise probably wouldnt help he held his tongue this wasnt the first time bizogots had been feted in the royal palace the stewardand the emperorwould know what they were like a serving woman came by with a plate of treatstoasted deer marrow on crackers of barley and maize count hamnet took one the fatty richness of the marrow went well with his mead beer might have been even better but he preferred the fermented honey someonesomeone with long fingernailsrumpled the hair at the nape of his neck he whirled around if the goblet hadnt been nearer empty than full mead would have sloshed out of it onto the rug hello hamnet gudrid said i wondered if you werent noticing me on purpose he knew how old she wasnot far from his own justpastforty she didnt look it or within ten years of it her hair was still black her skin still smooth her chin still single her eyes were almost the color of a lions a strange and penetrating light brown they sparked now in smug amusement she was going to jab at him she did whenever they met she always wounded him too he did his best not to show it that way she missed some of the sport so he shook his head now no i really didnt see you he said truthfully im he broke off he was damned if hed say he was sorry he could still feel her fingers on the skin at the back of his neck his hand tightened on the goblet till he feared the stem would snap somehow the stolen caress infuriated him worse than all her infidelities shed lost the right to touch him that way no she hadnt lost it shed given it up thrown it away she took it back for a moment only because she wanted to provoke him she knew how to get what she wanted she commonly did her smile said she knew shed scored even if she might not know just why her teeth were white and strong too that also made hamnet want to scowl poppy juice and henbane or not hed had a horrid time with a toothdrawer the year before so youre going traveling with the splendid trasamund are you she said eyeing the tall bizogot with admiration unfeigned and unconcealed if she decided she wanted him she would go after him yes she knew how to get what she wanted all right and what would eyvind torfinn think of that hamnet almost threw the question in her face then he saw she was waiting for it looking forward to it whatever the answer was it would have claws in it he didnt feel like giving her the satisfaction so i am he said stolidly and let it go at that eyvind torfinn came up then a winecup in his hand he was a comfortably plump man getting close to sixty if he hadnt already got there maybe he wouldnt mind so much if gudrid satisfied herself somewhere else every now and again hamnet drained what was left of his mead gudrid hadnt played him false because he failed to satisfy her adultery was a game to her and she excelled at it as she did at most things thyssen her new husband said politely torfinn count hamnet returned he had not too much against the older man whod always seemed faintly embarrassed at acquiring his wife dear hamnet is going exploring with the wild bizogot gudrid made it sound faintly disreputable she eyed hamnet ready to finish him off what is it youre going off to look for whatever it was by the way she asked the question it couldnt have been more important than a small coin that had fallen out of a hole in a belt pouch the golden shrine hamnet answered his voice still flat let her make what she wanted of that her lioness eyes widened for a heartbeat looking only human and amazed but thats a fable she exclaimed nobody really believes its up there or wherever its supposed to be oh no that is not so many people do believe it gudrid looked amazed all over again and even less happy than she had a moment earlier count hamnet didnt contradict her eyvind torfinn did i happen to be one of them myself eyvind went on he turned to his wifes former husband why would anyone think the chances of finding it now are any better than they would have been last year or a hundred years ago because the gap has finally melted through trasamunds traveled beyond the glacier hamnet thyssen usually had as little to say to gudrids new husband as he could maybe the mead was what loosened his tongue enough to make him say so you believe in the golden shrine do you earl eyvind why is that as gudrid had a moment earlier he got more than he bargained for eyvind torfinn didnt just believe in the golden shrine he knew more in the way of lore than hamnet thought there was to know his talk went spinning back through the centuries back to the days before nidaros was even a hunting camp back to empires far older than the raumsdalian back to other retreats of the glacierthough he didnt know of any others where the gap actually opened by the way gudrid listened to him he might have been talking about a mistress hed kept secret from her maybe she thought he was and maybe she was right knowledge was like that for some men hamnet thyssen hadnt known eyvind was one of them plainly his former wife hadnt either after a couple of exaggerated yawns didnt make eyvind torfinn dry up she flounced off hips working in the clinging maroon wool knit dress she wore her husband never noticed he was comparing and contrasting modern ideas about the golden shrine with those from bygone days he knew more about ideas from bygone days than hamnet thyssen had thought any living man could and so you see eyvind torfinn said with an enthusiasts zeal there is more than a little consistency about these notions through time not perfect consistency mind you but more than a little enough to persuade me something real lies behind all the guesswork and the legends what hamnet saw was gudrid doing everything but painting herself against trasamund she all but purred when the bizogot stroked her if her gap wouldnt open for him hamnet would have been very much surprised but that was not his worry now for whichsome of himthanked god he set a scarred and callused hand on eyvind torfinns shoulder your splendor he said his majesty was talking about recruiting a scholar to accompany us on the journey north i think you are the man we need i eyvind torfinn said in mild astonishment certainly you know so much about the golden shrine wouldnt you like to put what you know to use wouldnt you like to see the temple with your own eyes if its there to see hamnet thyssen added but only to himself eyvind stared at him i would like that very much he said whether i can make such a journey may be another question beyond the glacier i was not sure there was such a thing as beyond the glacier for all i knew for all anyone knew it went on forever i had the same thought when i learned the gap has melted through count hamnet said but trasamund speaks of white bears and strange buffalo and other marvels hes seen with his own eyes does he eyvind torfinn looked toward the tall bizogot by then gudrid with a sure instinct for selfpreservation no longer clung to him even if she did hover close by seeing her set her present husband down a different thoughtroad he swung back toward hamnet can you stand to make a journey with me your grace i would not be gratefuli fear i would not even be long ungratefulif you set on me the moment we passed the empires borders or perhaps even before we passed them by god your splendor by god and by my honor i will do nothing of the sort hamnet thyssen said you have my oath the strongest oath i can give if it is not enough to satisfy you if it is not enough to satisfy you sir then be damned to you i dont know what else to say if we meet danger i am more likely to prove a liability than an asset earl eyvind said i am not young i am not strong i am not swift or graceful i have not even practiced with a sword for many years let alone unsheathed one in anger you know things hamnet said you know things i did not think anyone could know speak to trasamund though not of your wifeshes not mine now speak to the emperor knowledge is always an asset is it eyvind torfinn raised a bushy gray eyebrow are you glad knowing what you know about the lady who was once your wife am i glad no count hamnet answered steadily would i rather know the truth than live in a fools paradise yes and she played me for a fool and shell play you the same way if she hasnt done it already and you may prove yourself a fool if you dont know that the golden shrine eyvind murmured well maybe if you dont think i would slow you up too much persuade trasamund i have no trouble with riding a little slower than i might have ridden otherwise but im no hotblooded impatient bizogot and you have put horns on me and trasamundi doubt notwill put horns on you and if i should meet trasamunds wife if he has a wife what a jolly gathering we would be then well the golden shrine eyvind torfinn said and he waddled off toward the bizogot jarl sigvat ii was delighted that earl eyvind wanted to fare north and delighted and amazed to discover him a scholar of the golden shrine trasamund was willing to bring him along although amazed and less than delighted to discover him the husband of gudrid hamnet thyssen was resigned he would have had some strong opinions if he thought gudrid was coming along but she seemed furious that eyvind torfinn could find the golden shrine more interesting more attractive than she she will spend my money while i am gone eyvind said to count hamnet when they met two days after the reception to plan what they could on a journey into the unknown they couldnt plan nearly as much as hamnet would have liked no doubt you are right your splendor hamnet replied she will spend your reputation while youre gone too he thought with mournful certainty i hope i have some left by the time i get home eyvind torfinn said maybe your chief of affairs should oversee your funds hamnet said and who would oversee gudrids affairs hamnet thyssen almost laughed at himself no doubt gudrid would take care of those on her own hamnet glanced over toward trasamund did the bizogot jarl speak fluent enough raumsdalian to make that joke or one like it for himself by the smirk on his ruddy weathered face he did earl eyvind was either blind to what gudrid was or resigned to it hamnet hadnt made up his mind which he wouldnt have wanted to be either one though hed stayed blind for too long when she was his wife maybe he hadnt wanted to see considering all the strife that sprang up when he finally couldnt help it he shook his head he didnt want to consider that we still need a sorcerer eyvind torfinn said he was looking ahead again to the lands beyond the ice not to what gudrid would do while he wasnt here to watch her his majesty was wise to suggest one i suggested one trasamund said in a voice like distant thunder did you indeed your ferocity for the first time earl eyvind eyed the bizogot as something more than a dangerous and dubiously tame animal eyvind didnt seem to have imagined a brain might lurk under that handsome wellmuscled exterior he blinked once or twice revising his opinion i did trasamund proudly drew himself up straight all bizogots were full of ungodly gobs of prideso it seemed to raumsdalians anyhow a bizogot jarl was apt to be proud even by the standards of his people having known quite a few clan chiefs among the mammothherders hamnet thyssen had seen that for himself and trasamund was proud even for a bizogot jarl well good for you then eyvind torfinn kept his voice mild even if trasamund wanted to act irascible that mildness left him not the smallest excuse eyvinds gaze swung back to count hamnet and where will we come by the wizard ulric skakki is searching nidaros for the best man hamnet answered you know this skakki dont you eyvind torfinn said i confess i had not met him before he seems versatile a sneak a thief a cutpurse a knife in the dark a pretty song to woo the ladies trasamund delivered his judgment before hamnet thyssen could a good man at your side maybe not so good at your back he mimed taking a knife in the kidney and what do you think your grace eyvind torfinn asked count hamnethe valued a raumsdalians opinion more than the jarls but hamnet said i think his ferocity is a keen judge of men he bowed to trasamund i rode with ulric skakki once we had some business to attend to for his majestythis was toward the end of the first sigvats days he made a sour face it was one of those nasty little things you wish you didnt have to do the kind you dont like talking about afterwards and we took care of it and ulric was everything you said he was trasamund did you let him get behind you the bizogot inquired no id already decided that wasnt a good idea count hamnet answered as long as i could keep an eye on him everything was fine trasamund nodded that satisfied him and hearing his cleverness and judgment praised pleased him no less than it would have pleased a raumsdalian he likes himself pretty well hamnet thought no bizogots were no more immune to vanity than the folk of the empire many people would have said they were less immune to it how far did you travel after you passed through the gap eyvind asked him i stayed beyond the glacier for about three weeks all told trasamund said i wasnt heading out in a straight line to see how far i could go you understand i was wandering here and there wandering wherever i pleased drunkards walk eyvind torfinn murmured by god i wasnt drunk trasamunds cheeks flamed with anger i drank water all through that journeywell almost all through it eyvind held up a plump placating hand no noi meant no offense the drunkards walk tries to answer the question of how far from where you start you will end up if you travel at random for such and such a time trasamunds face remained thunderously suspicious how can anyone know that and why would anyone care it takes a good deal of calculating earl eyvind allowed and why well people like to find out whatever they can havent you seen that didnt you come down to nidaros your ferocity because you knew raumsdalians know more different kinds of strange things than you bizogots do hamnet thyssen added trasamund made a discontented noise down deep in his broad chest he had said something like that so he couldnt very well deny it i meant you people know useful things though he said if he couldnt deny he could deflect count hamnet looked over to earl eyvind he thought the notion of a drunkards walk sounded silly too so he didnt know how to defend it knowledge is strange eyvind torfinn said you never can be sure ahead of time what you may need someone who is going to a strange place will carry different tools on his belt should he not carry different tools in his head as well instead of answering him straight out the jarl of the three tusk clan strode over to a sideboard and poured himself a goblet of mead he drank it down in one heroic draught hamnet thyssen suspected that was an answer of sorts when ulric skakki brought a wizard back to the palace count hamnets first thought was of the drunkards walk eyvind torfinn had mentioned the sorcerers name was audun gilli he didnt look or act drunk he looked like a man drying out after a long binge insteadand not like a man happy to be drying out either count hamnet recognized that look he knew it better than he would have liked hed gone on a bender or two of his own as his troubles with gudrid got worse hed been sober when he killed that was something not much but something of course if he were drunk when he faced gudrids first lover or the first one he caught anyhow the other man probably would have killed him at the time he would hardly have minded now he saw living on without her as revenge of sorts he also saw that audun gilli was in a bad way he shouted for a palace servant bring this man a mug of sassafras tea he said pointing to the wizard no bring him about three by the time he gets to the bottom of the last one he may be a bit better off bring me the hair of the houndsassafras tea be damned audun gillis voice was a sorrowful whine the servant looked toward hamnet thyssen tea hamnet snapped the man bowed and hurried off audun gillis sigh said it was just one more defeat in a lifetime full of them count hamnet paid no more attention to himbut then how many people ever did hamnet rounded on ulric skakki by god ulric which gutter did you drag him out of and why why because hell do what we need thats why ulric skakki answered more to him than meets the eye he sounded very sure of himself from what hamnet remembered ulric always sounded sure of himself that didnt mean he was always right though he had trouble recognizing the difference there could hardly be less to him than meets the eye count hamnet said with something between a sneer and a cry of despair look at him he glared at audun gilli himself the wizard flinched under that fierce stare audun was a small weedy man the sort who didnt stand out in a crowd he had a long weatheredlooking face a scraggly beardbrown going grayand a nose that was his largest but not best feature the whites of his grayblue eyes were yellowish and tracked with red his hands trembled they were a wizards hands but for the tremor hamnet thyssen could not deny that they had narrow palms and long delicate fingersperfect hands for the complex passes some spells required a wizard with the shakes though was like a blind archer he was more likely to be dangerous to his friends than to his foes the servant came in with three steaming mugs on a tray hed taken hamnet literally then good hamnet thought he thrust a mug at audun gilli here drink with a martyred sigh the wizard obeyed he did need more than one mug before hamnet saw any improvement he was on the third one before he seemed to see any improvement himself i never thought id be warm inside again he murmured well that proves he wasnt drinking mulled wine hamnet said to ulric skakki what was he drinking anything he could get his hands on thats plain and why was he drinking it by the bloody wagonload and since he was drinking wagonloads of anything he could get his hands on what in gods name makes you think hes worth even a counterfeit copper as a wizard i dont do this all the time audun gilli protested feebly of course you dont if you did you would have been dead in the gutter where ulric skakki tripped over you not just lying in it count hamnet rounded on ulric now answer meor else ill throw him out on his worthless ear and take the cost of three cups of sassafras tea out of his worthless hide how can you take cost out of something worthless audun asked the first sign hamnet thyssen had that whatever hed drunk hadnt curdled his wits for good hes had a hard time ulric skakki said if youd had that hard a time you would drink too since hamnet had drunk when times got hard for him and since ulric skakki probably knew as much denying that didnt seem a good idea instead hamnet turned back to audun gilli well he made that more a challenge than a question my wife burned down and my house died in the fire the wizard said a pretty good sign not all his wits were working the way they should have it was also a pretty good sign he did deserve some sympathy when did this happen count hamnet asked less roughly than before three years ago audun gilli answered count hamnet could feel his neck swelling easy there ulric skakki said when he dries out hell be fine hes a student of sorceries from ancient days so he should be exactly the kind of wizard we want along if we find the golden shrine ill bet hes a student of ancient sorceries hamnet said hes been pickled from then till now his majesty sent me out to find a proper wizard me ulric skakki replied with a touchor more than a touchof hauteur i say ive found him i say you couldnt find your arse with both hands if you think so count hamnet growled they glared at each other forgotten by both of them like a bone abandoned when two dogs go at each other audun gilli stared at the mugs in which his sassafras tea had come he chanted softly to himself the language he used hadnt been spoken since long before the raumsdalian empire rose but hamnet thyssen didnt notice that in his quarrel with ulric skakki hamnet thyssen didnt notice the wizard at all then two of the mugs started shouting at each other in high squeaky voices that sounded like parodies of ulrics and hamnet s it wasnt ventriloquism the mugs suddenly sported faces too much like theirs the less than flattered models both gaped so did the third mug which looked like a sorrowful ceramic version of audun gilli the wizard chanted again and the mugs were only mugs again you see ulric skakki said triumphantly i saw something however little count hamnet wanted to he had to admit it hes a wizard hes a good wizard and ulric went on pragmatically hell be better the longer he stays sober who says hell stay sober well be drinking ale or beer or mead or fermented mammoths milk as much as we can hamnet said even runoff straight from the glacier can give you a bloody flux have you ever been up in the bizogot country ulric dont you know about that ive been there all right i know ulric said count hamnet wasnt sure he believed him till the other man added well have to pick our way past the lands where a couple of clans range they may remember me a little too well that held the ring of truth why am i not surprised hamnet thyssen said ulric skakki gave back a bow as if at a compliment audun gilli managed a wan smile when he saw it count hamnet threw his hands in the air when you knew you were going to lose a fight sometimes the best thing you could do was give it up before it cost you more than you could afford to spend if only hed figured that out with gudrid earl eyvind torfinn was a friendly man as raumsdalian nobles were supposed to be he was openhanded in his hospitality he lived in a large rambling twostory house on top of a hill in the western part of nidaros from windows on the upper floor he could look out on what had been hevring lake when the great city was but a hunting camp hamnet thyssen knew that because earl eyvind insisted on inviting him to feast with the other members of the upcoming expedition refusing would have been churlisheyvind torfinn seemed to think that his acquiring hamnet s wife was just one of those things certainly not important enough to get excited about visiting that house though dripped vitriol on hamnet s soul gudrid did her best to make sure that it should she wore outfits that clung and revealed she smiled she sparkled much of that was aimed at captivating trasamund the bizogot didnt prove hard to captivate if she could wound hamnet at the same timewell so much the better he set his jaw and tried not to show he was wounded as he would have if hed taken an arrow in the leg gudrid knew better she knew him altogether too well when they were happy together the way she knew him pleased him and made him proud these days it meant he was vulnerable eyvind torfinn seemed oblivious to the byplay count hamnet wasnt sure he was but he seemed that way ulric skakki watched it with wry fascination he didnt seem to interest gudrid maybe that was because he was only a commoner maybe because she recognized that he might be as devious and dangerous as she was herself if less alluring as for audun gilli he took in everything with a childlike wideeyed fascination but a child who drank the way he did would have been in no shape to take in anything trasamund for his part took gudrids attentions as no less than his due that is quite a woman he told hamnet plainly not knowing theyd once been man and wife not as young as she used to be maybe but still quite a woman still plenty tight the jarl leered and rocked his hips forward and back in case hamnet could have any doubt about what he meant is she count hamnets voice held no expression whatever that might have been just as well if he had let it hold expression what would have come out rage bitterness jealousy longing since he revealed even less to trasamund than he did to gudrid the question didnt arise so he told himself anyhow he drank eyvind torfinns wine and beer he ate horseflesh and fatrich camels meat and musk ox and strongtasting mammoth flesh brought down from the north on ice there was ice in the north all right ice and to spare he nibbled on honey cakes and frozen sweetened milk and his stomach gnawed at him and he wished he were anywhere else in all the world sinking into soft asphalt with dire wolves and sabertooths prowling all around next to this lavish hospitality that looked pretty good you hate me dont you gudrid asked one evening after everyone had drunk a little too much by the way her eyes sparkled she wanted him to tell her yes i loved you hamnet thyssen said which was not an answerunless it was the gleam grew brighter and now count hamnet shrugged we all make mistakes some of us make bigger mistakes than others yes thats true gudrid agreed i never should have wed you in the first place you didnt think so then hamnet said and let it go at that if he told her shed loved him she would have laughed in his face he thought she had he was convinced she had in fact but he was just as convinced that sigvat us torturers couldnt tear the confession out of her now we all make mistakes you said it i didnt gudrid was like a cat playing and swiping and tormenting before the kill and what mistake did you make with eyvind torfinn hamnet inquired she breathed sweet wine fumes into his face when she laughed dear eyvind i made no mistakes with him he lets me do whatever i please and you despise him for it count hamnet said gudrid did not deny it she only laughed again stubbornly hamnet went on wouldnt you call wedding a man you despise a mistake of course not i call it an amusement she reached out and stroked his cheek with a soft hand but dont worry my sweet if it makes you feel any better i despise you too and trasamund hamnet asked trying to ignore the way her touch seared his flesh ah trasamund she laughed throatily and batted her eyelashes at him no one could despise trasamund hes much too virile he thinks youre quite something too hamnet said gudrid laughed again this time in complacent amusement hamnet added for someone whos not as young as she used to be even a man with no other tool toward revenge had time on his side now her eyes stopped sparkling they flashed instead youll pay for that she said hamnet thyssen shrugged ive been paying for knowing you for years whats a little more if i tell eyvind to stay home he laughed in her face you hurt the empire if that happensnot that you care im sure but it doesnt worry me at all your husband probably knows more about the golden shrine than any man alive i know he knows more than i thought anybody could hed be useful to have along yes but hes still your husband gudrid if you think i want his company youd better think twice she made what sounded like a lions growl down deep in her throat she didnt like being thwarted didnt like it and wouldnt put up with it shed taken up with eyvind torfinn not long after hamnet killed her earlier lover he judged it was at least as much to show him he couldnt get the better of her as for any attraction earl eyvind held i suppose you know ive had your wizard as well as the bizogot she said her redpainted lip curled he wasnt what youd call magical she told him to hurt him she couldnt have any other reason youre not my worry any more he said it wasnt true she would go on worrying him till his dying day he added youve given us all something to talk about on the way north anyhow gudrid smiledshe liked that something warm instead of the glacier count hamnet shook his head something so cold it makes the glacier seem warm beside it fast as a striking serpent her hand lashed out however fast she was she wasnt fast enough count hamnet caught her wrist before she could slap him or claw him let go of me she said in a low furious voice ive been trying to ever since i found out what you are hamnet thought he opened his hand the memory of her flesh remained printed on his palm she didnt feel cold oh no you had to know her to understand what he meant then again he wondered if hed ever known her at all youre harder than you were she remarked if i am whose fault is that he asked harshly may the bizogots eat you gudrid said the mammothherders didnt eat men even if a lot of raumsdalians thought they did a lewd question rose in hamnet s mind he stifled it she went on may you fall off the edge of the world when you go beyond the glacier may one of the white bears trasamund goes on about gnaw your bones his bow was stiff as a wooden puppets i love you too my sweet he said and tried to match her venom so she wouldnt realize he was telling the truththe painful and useless truth he must have done what he set out to do for her laughter this time was jagged as shattered ice sharp as sabertooth fangs she stalked away if stalking was the right word to use for something with so much hip action even without words she reminded him what he was missing he looked down at the rug as if l didnt know he thought and kicked at the embroidered wool iii riding out of nidaros came as nothing but a relief for hamnet thyssen he could deal with ulric skakki and audun gilli he could deal with trasamund the jarl he could even deal with eyvind torfinn though he would rather not have to as long as he didnt have to deal with gudrid he felt he could do anything the great north road ran from the raumsdalian capital toward the imperial borderand toward the bizogot country beyond it armies had moved up that road more often than hamnet could easily count ready to repel invaders from the north and the barbarians had spilled into the empire more often than he could easily count too its riches and the better weather it enjoyed drew them like a lodestone one of these days hamnet supposed the bizogots would win and either put one of their own on the raumsdalian throne or topple the empire altogether nothing lasted forever it seemed not even the glacier lasted forever although a couple of lifetimes earlier everyone would have thought the glacier the one surely eternal thing god made was god himself eternal hamnet thyssen uneasily looked up into the steelblue sky if god himself might pass away who rose to power after he was gone men intent on their affairs women intent on their affairs gudrid was certainly intent on hers or older darker powers god had long held in check what was the golden shrine anyway ulric skakki chose that moment to remark a copper for your thoughts your grace hamnet was a man who made a habit of saying what was in his mind evenperhaps especiallywhen no one had asked him he told ulric skakki exactly what he was thinking about the younger man blinked whatever he was expecting that wasnt it he reached into his belt pouch and pulled out a copper coin offering it to count hamnet he said well your grace i got my moneys worth hamnet solemnly stowed the coin we endeavor to give satisfaction it doesnt always work mind you but we do endeavor he thought of gudrid again but it wasnt that he hadnt satisfied her he had as far as he could tell shed wanted something else something more from him whatever it was it seemed defined not least by his inability to give it to her did her first lover the one who laughed did eyvind torn torfinn did trasamund did having them give her what she craved was having them what she craved if ulric skakki had chosen that moment to ask him for his thoughts he would have lied without the least hesitation he didnt mind talking about the death of the empire or about the death of the glacier or even about the death of god the death of the one real love of his life that was different farmers weeded their young hopeful crops of rye and oats off to either side or the road barley rarely succeeded north of nidaros even now wheat maize those were crops for softer more luxurious climes the farmers always seemed to have one eye on the north if the breath of god blew against them for long their crops would wither and freeze and fail even here then they would live on what theyd stored in better years and on what they could hunt or they would die it happened in hard years oh yesit happened no one hurried neither trasamund nor audun gilli was any sort of a horseman while eyvind torfinn might have been once upon a time but wasnt any more some of the raumsdalians in the party might not have been anxious to leave the empire behindnot in their hearts anyway no matter what their heads might tell them hamnet thyssen knew perfectly well what lay beyond the border nomad huts on the tundraland crushed flat by the glacier that had lain on it for so many centuries herds of halftame musk oxen and mammoths guidedwhen they could be guidedby halftame men meltwater lakes cold beyond what even nidaros ever knew wind almost always from the north almost always with frigid daggers in it snow and ice at any season of the year and thenthe glacier itself yes it was wounded yes if trasamund spoke truly the gap had at last pierced it to the root not the glacier any more but glaciers divided east and west count hamnet shook his head in slow wonder at that but still any man who ever saw the glacier even diminished as it was knew in his belly what awe meant it went forward and backmore back than forward of latelike alive thing but it swallowed the whole north of the world well most of the north of the world anyhow if the gap ran all the way through it that was why they were here the golden shrine hamnet glanced over at earl torfinn no he hadnt believed in the golden shrine even if he had believed in it what difference would that have made with the glacier between raumsdalia and the golden shrine whether it was real might trouble scholars but not ordinary men count hamnet was not exactly an ordinary man but he was no scholar either and just as glad not to be one ulric skakki puffed on a longstemmed pipe tobacco came up from the warmer climes of the south why do you smoke that stinking thing hamnet asked youll just run out of your precious weed after weve been on the road awhile when i run out ill do without ulric answered cheerfully if you dont like the smell im sorry you can ride upwind of me easily enough you didnt tell me why you smoke it hamnet said well maybe i didnt ulric skakki smiled and shrugged ive got to where i like the taste though i didnt when i started count hamnet made a face ulric laughed tell me you liked beer the first time you drank it he said hamnet couldnt and he knew it ulric went on and the smoke relaxes me and fiddling with the pipe gives me something to do with my hands does that suit you reasonable today arent you hamnet thyssen said with a crooked smile laughing ulric bowed in the saddle ill try not to let it happen again your grace he pointed north is that a serai up ahead hamnet eyed the large low building by the side of the road the lower half of the wall was of stone the upper of timber smoke rose from three brick chimneys its not likely to be anything else count hamnet said well no ulric skakkis smile was so charming it made hamnet distrust him on sightas if he didnt already smiling still ulric went on do you think were likely to come to another one before nightfall mmi daresay not hamnet answered they arent usually set close togetherif they were theyd hurt each others trade then shall we stop ulric said why ask me hamnet thyssen returned he knew why the others were on the expedition trasamund had actually gone beyond the glacier eyvind torfinn knew whatever there was to know about the golden shrine if audun gilli could remember his own name he was a wizard ulric skakki could get his hands on anything that wasnt nailed downand steal the nails if that looked like a good idea which leaves me count hamnet thought he could ride and he could fight and he was glad for a chance to escape the raumsdalian empire all of that was well enough but did it make him the leader ulric skakki seemed to think it did ulric wouldnt want to lead himselfit was too much like work but eyvind torfinn was a belted earl while trasamund was a jarl and as arrogant as anyone hamnet had ever met he didnt much want to lead such a motley crew but then trasamund guided his horse close by hamnet s shall we stop at that serai for the night the bizogot asked hamnet stared did trasamund think he was in charge too he hadnt looked for that but he said yes i think wed better we wont come to another one before the sun goes down trasamund nodded and rode away eyvind torfinn didnt even question hamnets right to decide neither did audun gilli though count hamnet would have been astonished if he had its on my shoulders hamnet thought and when things go wrongand they willthe blame will land on my shoulders too despite the chimneys the common room in the serai was smoky enough to make hamnet thyssens eyes sting some of that smoke came from the hearthfires some from the cookfires back in the kitchen and some from the pipes and cigars on which more than a few of the travelers puffed gnawing on a turkey leg trasamund said this is not a bad place a tall jack of beer sitting beside his trencher of hard barley bread probably went a good way toward improving his opinion so did the smiles hed won from the barmaid whod brought him the jack he had at least some reason to hope hed win more than smiles from her the food and drink suited hamnet thyssen well enough the barmaid didnt interest him he did idly wonder what gudrid would think of trasamunds pursuing another woman so soon after leaving her arms he shrugged chasing a barmaid wouldnt worry him unless the bizogot got killed in a brawl over her which seemed unlikely or came down with an unpleasant disease because of her the odds of which hamnet had no way of guessing eyvind torfinn seemed content with supper even if it was rougher than what he was used to audun gilli ate more than he drank to count hamnet that made the meal a success as far as the wizard was concerned hamnet shared a room with audun the evening was not a success the sorcerer though a small man proved to own a large snore hamnet wondered if there was some sorcerous cure for that then he wondered if he ought to throw a boot at audun the way he might have at a yowling cat ulric skakki and eyvind torfinn had the room to one side of hamnet s the walls were no thicker than they had to behamnet could hear the other two men talking for a long time he wondered what they were talking about gudrid as far as hamnet thyssen knew she hadnt slept with ulric but he didnt know how far he knew on the other side trasamund had a room to himself except he didnt have it to himself for long the bedframe creaked he grunted his companion giggled and then moaned hamnet found himself glad of audun gilli s snores they helped drown out the amatory racket not long after the creaking next door reached a crescendo it began anew the bizogot had stamina by the noises his partner made he also had technique how much of that technique had he had before he came south off the frozen steppe how much had he learned inside the empireor to come straight to the point inside gudrid count hamnet ground his teeth what he had right now was insomnia he also had the firm conviction that god would have had trouble falling asleep in that room just then eventually in spite of everything hamnet did go to sleep what that said about gods chances of doing the same he was too unconscious to worry about a sunbeam sneaking through the slats of the shutter on the southfacing window poked him in the eye he yawned and sat up audun gilli went on snoring away either eyvind torfinn or ulric skakki also owned a pretty formidable snore as for trasamund he really did have stamina that barmaid would probably walk bowlegged for days yawning again hamnet got out of bed hed slept in his clothes as one did on the road instead of throwing his boots at audun gilli he put them on he did take the small pleasure of shaking the wizard awake you snore he said when he saw reason in auduns eyes i do the wizard said around a yawn of his own hamnet thyssen nodded emphatically audun gilli started pulling on his own boots well your grace if i do im not the only one here who does what me count hamnet didnt believe itor didnt want to believe it anyhow he stood on what dignity he could ive never once heard myself snore audun gilli started to answer that then seemed to think better of it he contented himself with shall we get the others up trasamunds been up most of the night hamnet answered which made audun begin and then visibly reconsider another answer hamnet added but we may as well knock that barmaid will have to go to work soon anyhow though i daresay trasamunds worked her harder than the fellow who runs this serai ever did heres hoping she had fun they dont stay till morning if they havent the wizard spoke more practically than hamnet thyssen would have expected hamnet knocked on the door to the room that eyvind torfinn and ulric skakki shared he knocked loud and long hoping trasamund and his lady friend would also hear that actually worked the barmaid scurried out of the bizogots chamber and down the hall toward the common room but when ulric opened the door he looked more than a little put upon what he said irritably is this place on fire earl eyvind appeared behind him seeming similarly aggrieved no fireexcept i hope in the hearth hamnet said which of you snores he does ulric and eyvind both said the same thing they pointed at each other eyvind torfinn added as long as were talking about snoring was that you or audun sawing stone last night yes hamnet let him make whatever he pleased of that im going to get trasamund moving he went on then we ought to eat and we ought to ride earl eyvind rubbed his hindquarters ulric skakki sighed a martyred sigh but neither man said no hamnet thyssen knocked on trasamunds door you hit ours a lot harder than that ulric said yes and i had my reasons too hamnet thought ulric went on scowling trasamund was also scowling as he opened up but when count hamnet said we should be moving the bizogots glower faded moving was something the mammothherders of the north understood they all went off to the common room hamnet thyssen was ready for oatmeal mush swimming with butter or rye crackers or barley rolls or boiled goose eggs or whatever else the seraikeeper served for breakfast the barmaid was already busy hurrying from the kitchen to other travelers waiting for their food count hamnet noticed her only out of the corner of his eye he stopped in his tracks at the entrance to the common room none of his companions tried to push past him into the big hall either from her perch on a bench near a fireplace gudrid waved gaily to them she hadnt come alone half a dozen stalwart imperial guardsmen sat across from her and to either side hamnet wondered how shed talked sigvat ii out of them then he decided he didnt want to know because talking might not have had anything to do with it a heartbeat later he shied away from hadnt come alone too my sweet what are you doing here eyvind torfinn askeda reasonable question and much more mildly phrased than it would have been coming from hamnet still sounding reasonable and reasonably concerned earl eyvind went on is anything wrong down in nidaros no no no gudrid laughed one of her silvery laughs and then count hamnet discovered that hed thanked god too soon for she said i decided id come along with you thats all hamnet stiffened as if taking a sword thrust eyvinds jaw dropped even the unflappable ulric skakki blinked audun gillis eyes widened and trasamund roared laughter himself thats impossible eyvind torfinn said again hamnet would have told gudrid the same thing again he would have used stronger language earl eyvind continued you couldnt possibly make it to the land beyond the glacier why not when gudrid sounded innocent and sweet you were well advised to set a hand on your belt pouch because youre a woman thats why not eyvind answered and so gudrid said if i cant ride better than audun there im a musk ox and i can shootdear hamnet taught me how years ago i dont pull a very heavy bow but i hit what i aim at she did too hamnet thyssen knew it trasamund looked from him to gudrid and back again in surprise no the bizogot jarl hadnt known of any connection between them hamnet hadnt thought he did and besides gudrid went on still sounding sweet and innocent and if you knew her deadly dangerous ill have all you big strong masterful men to protect me wont i and these guardsmen his majesty was kind enough to give me too some of the guardsmen looked mildly embarrassed others smirked how had gudrid persuaded the emperor and why were those men smirking this is most unwise it will not do eyvind torfinn said i agree this journey will be complicated enough without uh complications ulric skakki didnt put that well and knew it but also didnt leave much doubt about what he meant madness hamnet said gudrid fluttered her fingers literally dismissing that out of hand as if youd say anything else she murmured then she fluttered those slim fingers again this time toward trasamund and what does our valiant bizogot chieftain say the valiant bizogot chieftain hadnt said much of anything hed listened to the backbiting with what seemed like immense enjoyment now he laughed once more let the wench come he said why not it will make the journey more entertaining but eyvind torfinn said trasamund cut him off with a slash of the hand i have said she will come and she will come he spoke with a jarls hauteurhe didnt think hamnet was the leader any more then raumsdalia does not have to go beyond the glacier raumsdalia does not have to look for the golden shrine we bizogots can do it alone the way north for you goes through our land earl eyvind made a horrible face not because trasamund was wrong but because he was right when the empires needs clashed with his he scowled at the bizogot and scowled at his wife but in the end he nodded hamnet thyssen by contrast started out of the common room where are you going eyvind torfinn called after him his tone suggested a drowning man watching a spar drift away home hamnet answered the golden shrine can rot for all of me and the gap too gudrids laugh somehow struck him as ominous i knew youd get stuffy about this hamnet i knew it read this she held out a rolled parchment he made sure he didnt touch her when he took the parchment she noticed him making sure and laughed again this time at him he ignored her she thought that was funny too the parchment was sealed in wax of imperial gold and had stamped on it a sabertooths headsigvats seal hamnet thyssen ground his teeth as he broke it most of the message was in a secretarys supremely legible script to count hamnet thyssen from his imperial majesty sigvat ll by gods grace emperor of raumsdalia your graceyou are hereby requested and required to continue on your journey north to the lands beyond the glacier and if possible to the golden shrine notwithstanding the presence on the said journey of gudrid wife to earl eyvind torfinn whose intimate knowledge of conditions pertaining to the said golden shrine conduces to the success of the expedition of which you form a component a scrawled signature unquestionably sigvats lay under the body of the letter you see gudrid said languid triumph in her voice i see hamnet folded the parchment and put it in his belt pouchhe offered no offense to the imperial letter though his first impulse was to fling it in the fire and i tell you this gudrid no matter what this letter says i am not a cursed component i am a manmy own man by god im for my own keep too and the journey can go hang and so my former dear can you he trudged out of the serai and off toward the stable not a man in a hurry but not a man about to change his mind either hed almost got to the stable door when someone behind him called hamnetwait if that had been gudrid he wouldnt have waitedthough he might have drawn sword on her if she tried to insist but it wasnt it was ulric skakki well hamnet growled are you fool enough to think you can make me change my mind if sigvat cant do it you arent likely to i wouldnt dream of trying your grace ulric said hamnet laughed harshlyhe knew a lie when he heard one unperturbed ulric skakki went on i just wanted to tell you one thing before you go well hamnet said what is it say your say then and be quick about it i will ulric said whom he servedbeyond himselfwas a mystery to hamnet he hadnt been in the habit of talking about himself when he and hamnet served together a few years earlier evidently he still wasnt with a small shrug he went on if you leave if you walk away that woman wins had ulric called gudrid by her name hamnet thyssen would have turned his back and gone into the stable and afterwards much would have been different as things were he looked ulric up and down a glower that would have annihilated a lesser man or a less selfassured one ulric skakki withstood it with no external signs of injury as if i care what that woman does hamnet said and then not at all at random have you swived her too the way everyone else has good god no ulric skakki answered no scorpion ever hatched anywhere has a sting in its tail to match hers that held the unmistakable ring of sincerity but then ulric might well be able to sound sincere when he wasnt it was a common gift even gudrid had it for the moment hamnet thyssen chose to assume ulric meant what he said and growled well then you see what my trouble is i dont want to be within miles of that woman let alone riding beside her and i used to love her which makes it worse but we need you on the journey youre the best raumsdalian we have ulric skakki said eyvind torfinn is nice enough but hes an old fool audun gilli is what he is they wont do thyssen theres you count hamnet said why are you acting so modest it doesnt seem your natural state its not ulric agreed but im only a commoner and i have a strange backgroundto say nothing of my foreground was his chuckle selfconscious hamnet had trouble believing it ulric went on earl eyvind wont take me seriously neither will trasamund youve got the blood they respect gudrid might want to see it spilled otherwise it doesnt much impress her hamnet said and there are her bodyguards one of them would likely serve your purpose ulric skakki shook his head louts fools chowderheads the emperor wont send away men he cant afford to lose hell send the ones he doesnt care aboutso thats what hes done i know about these fellows and i know something else what hamnet asked uneasily what ulric said made altogether too much sense i know trasamund hasnt told everything he knows about what lies beyond the glacier and how do you know that hamnet inquired in sardonic tones i suppose youve gone beyond the glacier yourself ulric grimaced yes as a matter of fact i have though its worth my life if you say so where a bizogot might hear its likely worth your life too so you ought to bear that in mind hamnet thyssen stared at the younger man he did not think ulric was lying he wished he did by god how did you manage that he asked carefully ulric skakki answered which had to be the understatement of the year trasamund says he doesnt know if there are men on the far side of the glacier either hes lying or hes not as much of a farranger as hed have us believe there are again he spoke with great conviction and hamnet asked as he was plainly meant to do and theyre dangerous to the bizogots to us maybe even to themselves i am not making this up thyssen i have seen them we need you there then send gudrid back to nidaros ulric skakki shrugged sadly im sorry i cant do that i wish i could but i cant mmrr hamnet made a noise deep down in his chest if you lure me on with this skakki if you dangle a wiggling worm in front of me to make me swim after it ill kill you gudrids first lover didnt believe me when i said something like that id tell you to ask him if i lied but hes too dead to give you a straight answer well you can try ulric skakki murmured count hamnet sent him a sharp stare ulric looked back imperturbably if hamnets words worried him he showed it not at all he didnt seem to believe hamnet could harm him maybe that made him a fool maybe it meant he knew some things hamnet didnt things hamnet might discover if he tried to make good on his threat as if it were never made ulric went on does that mean youre coming then the last word hamnet thyssen thought he would use came out of his mouth hating himself hating gudrid and saving a little hate for ulric skakki too he said yes weather along the great north road seemed to get worse with each passing mile that had to be hamnets imagination spring was advancing the sun staying in the sky longer with each passing day things should have got warmer and finer not darker and gloomier odds were that the cloud over the expedition was fixed above his head and no one elses had he wanted other opinions he would have asked for them he rode apart from the other travelers with them but not of them audun gilli rode apart too but audun gilli was about as sociable as an old root sometimes the noble and the wizard rode side by side but even then they were apart as usual gudrid contrived to make the world revolve around herself the royal bodyguards eyvind torfinn and trasamund all danced attendance on her ulric skakki seemed more loosely attached to that group but attached he wasor so it seemed to count hamnets jaundiced eye at any rate for most of the way north toward the frontier things went smoothly enough the travelers stopped at a serai each night if they didnt have all the comforts gudrid was used to down in nidaros they had most of them gudrid played the part of the cheerful voyager as if shed rehearsed for years whatever went on in the nighttime went on without hamnet thyssen he and ulric skakki usually shared a chamber as far as he could tell ulric didnt go out of nights so maybe the other man had given his true opinion of gudrid and if he hadnt it was his lookout the country got flatter and flatter as they went north till it looked as if it were pressed and so it was the glacier had crushed it till very recently countless shallow ponds and lakes marked the slightlythe ever slightlylower ground the winds mostly blew warm out of the south but snow lingered long in the shade of the spruce and fir woods this far north farmers planted their rye and oats and hoped for the best they didnt count on them though not the way they did in lands longer free of the glacier and in those that had never known its touch they raised hogs and sheep and horses and musk oxen for meat and they hunted imperial garrisons couldnt hope to live on the countryside not in this inhospitable clime supplies came up by riverboat when the streams were open and by sledge when the rivers froze one day the travelers found there was no serai when they needed to stop for the evening the one that should have been there had burned down and nobody had got around to rebuilding it theyd passed a village a few miles backa small sullen place where a lot of the people looked to have bizogot blood hamnet thyssen didnt like the idea of turning back to the south on general principles he especially didnt like the idea of turning around to pass the night in a miserable hole like that up ahead lay well who could say what he didnt see any village close enough to reach before the sun went down no cloud of smoke on the horizon foretold chimneys clustered close together well just have to spend the night in the open under the sky he said this seems about as good a place as any so it does trasamund agreed enough trees to the north for firewood and enough to shield us if the breath of god blows hard tonight too we may shiver a bit but we wont freeze the bizogot jarl laughed next to what well see farther north we might as well still be in a serai gudrid seemed excited about spending the night in a tent she put up with chewy smoked sausage over an open fire she drank beer without making a face though she preferred mead and wine hamnet quietly fumed hed hoped the first taste of rough living would send her scuttling back to the capital that was one of the reasons hed chosen to camp out here beside the ruins of the serai she foiled him again he volunteered for the first watch owls hooted off in the distance dire wolves howled the wind did come from the north from the glacier ragged patches of cloud scudded across the sky now hiding stars now revealing them someone came up behind him he whirled the sword that had been on his belt was suddenly in his hand audun gilli froze you dont want to try sneaking up on me count hamnet remarked it isnt healthy so i see the wizard said i am not your enemy your grace i hope i am not i do not wish to be no you are not my enemynot unless you make yourself so hamnet thyssen said but what are you doing here anyway something besides lying in a gutter clutching a jar of whatever happens to be cheap and strong audun answered whatever happens in the north it has to be better wouldnt you say for you maybe hamnet said for all of us who knows audun gilli studied him for a while before saying anything in the starlight and the dim red glow of the embers from the campfire the wizard was only a shape in the darkness to the noble hamnet couldnt have been much more to audun gilli at least if the wizard was seeing only by the light of the world you are not as hard a man as you make yourself out to be audun ventured at last no eh if youd got a little closer before i heard you i would have cut you in half hamnet said that would have given you something to grumble aboutfor a little while anyway maybe audun gilli said but maybe not too i am not everything a wizard ought to begod knows thats true and so do i but i am not nothing as a sorcerer either ulric skakki had also said audun wasnt a negligible wizard count hamnet was more inclined to believe it from ulric than from the wizard himself whether he was negligible or not yes hamnet remembered those two chattering bickering mugs but that was a bagatelle how audun gilli would do ifno whenthey had to rely on his magic was anybodys guess hamnet thyssen didnt like going into the unknown with a wizard whose true quality was also unknown some sort of proper test seemed reasonableto him anyway he said can you divine for me why gudrid wanted to come north is it just to jab spikes into my liver or does she have some other reason too audun didnt answer right away when he did he said down in nidaros she asked me for a divination about you your grace did she hamnet rumbled what did she want to know what did you tell her i told her that since the two of you were long separated whatever she wanted to know was none of her business audun gilli said as for what it was your grace you dont need to know that and i would not feel right about divining her reasons for you unless you think she purposes danger to the empire a wizard with scruples hamnet thyssen would have imagined the breed long extinct he had a hard time imagining the breed ever existed in fact but here he had a specimen before his eyes or did he was audun gilli a wizard with scruples or only a wizard without strength well find something else for you to do then hamnet said audun nodded if hed divined what hamnet was thinking would he have iv down in the distant south where lands were rich kingdoms and duchies and principalities marked their borders with fortresses and sometimes even walls the northern frontier of the raumsdalian empire wasnt like that there were occasional customs posts but that was about all the empire didnt so much end in the north as peter out past the point where even the hardiest quickestripening rye and oats wouldnt let farmers put in a crop past the broad dark forests that lay beyond the cropland administering the empire grew more expensive than it was worth there werent enough people to build a wall in the north and if there had been the empire wouldnt have been able to feed the soldiers who manned it as for a ditch the northern frontier lay about where the ground started staying frozen all the time you couldnt dig a proper ditch in soil like that no matter how much you might want to every so often then the bizogots broke into the empires northern provinces sometimes the empire mustered an army farther south and drove the barbarians back up onto the frozen plains over which they usually roamed and sometimes the invading bizogots realized they hadnt overrun anything worth having and went back to the steppe of their own accord when the travelers got to or at least near the raumsdalian frontier exactly where it lay in those parts was more a matter of opinion than certain settled knowledgeeyvind torfinn pointed north and east and west and said its just as dreary in every direction he wasnt wrong and it wasnt much less dreary to the south either it wont get any prettier either hamnet thyssen said ulric skakki nodded so did a couple of the imperial guardsmen who accompanied gudrid theyd all been up into the bizogot country before none of them seemed enamored of it audun gilli looked this way and that with curiosity both avid and wary probably wondering where his next snootful will come from count hamnet thought before he could say anythingif he was going totrasamund burst into song the bizogot language was related to the raumsdalian but only distantly to hamnet thyssens ear the tongue the mammothherders used was rolling and guttural and raucous any time a bizogot spoke his own language he sounded full of himself he couldnt help it the language itself made him sound that way how much of the bizogot tongue do you know ulric skakki asked hamnet enough to get by the noble answered theyll never think im a native but one look at me and theyll know im not so that doesnt matter how about you im in the same sleigh ulric answered trasamund was in full flow going on about the breath of god about mammoth dung and muskox meat about hunting lions in the snow about gods curtains which was what the bizogots called the northern lights about fighting enemy clans and leading away their sobbing women after a victory and about everything else that went into a northern nomadall in long rhymed stanzas with perfect scansion hamnet thyssen didnt admire the way of life the jarl extolled but he admired the way trasamund extolled the life so evidently did ulric skakki how does he do that ulric said hes no bard but it just pours out of him count hamnet couldnt answer because he didnt know either but eyvind torfinn said he has little blocks of poetry that he uses to make his big poem ulric skakki scratched his head sorry your splendor but i dont follow that well listen to him when hes talking about mammoths eyvind said if he needs four syllables in front of them to pad out his line theyre always heavybodied mammoths always thats the foursyllable epithet for mammoths but if he only needs two syllables then theyre greattusked mammoths theyre towering mammoths if he needs three and black mammoths if he needs one those are the only epithets youll ever hear attached to mammoths he has others for lions and for fire and for snow and for god and for the rest of the things that go into a bizogots life you see building blocks by god hamnet thyssen said by god he sketched a salute to earl eyvind i thank you your splendor thats been under my nose for years and i never saw it nor i ulric skakki said wizards in the empire will do the same thing audun drilli said it makes spells easier to memorize do you understand the bizogot language hamnet asked no not past a few curses audun answered maybe i will learn more he shrugged or maybe not trasamunds enormous wave encompassed the whole great sweep of land ahead we ride he roared ride they did shrubs dotted the plain hamnet needed a while to see that some were oaks and birches up here with the cold and the wind above and the frozen ground below they couldnt grow into proper trees farther north still near the edge of the glacier they got no bigger than violets or daisies down in warmer climes a bird glided across the sky above them a hawk hamnet thyssen thought but after a moment he realized he was wrong it was an owl a snowy owl they often hunted by day everything up in the bizogot country seemed confused there are folk in the south who say seeing an owl by daylight is the worst of bad omens audun gilli remarked let them come to the north country the free country the great country and they will see they are mistaken trasamund boomed even speaking raumsdalian he sounded as if he were declaiming his song of praise in a low voice ulric skakki said they might think coming to this godfrozen place was the worst of bad omens and if they saw an owl by daylight that would only prove it i shouldnt wonder hamnet replied also quietly to his way of thinking the closer to the glacier a stretch of land was the madder a man had to be to want to live on it the way the bizogots behaved did little harm to his theory he asked whats the weather like beyond the glacier ulric made sure trasamund wasnt paying any attention to him before he answered its not much different from this as a matter of fact you surprise me hamnet said i would have expected worse i expected worse myself ulric said but it seems as if the weather that blows down off the glacier is already about as bad as it can be whether that amounts to a disaster or a consolation depends on your point of view i suppose hamnet thyssen was temperamentally inclined to look on the gloomy side of things any which way hearing that things in these parts were as bad as they could be gave him a somber sort of satisfaction the snowy owl swooped it rose again with something writhing in its claws it wouldnt go hungry for a whileor maybe it had nestlings that would feast on the mouse or vole or rabbit it had caught by the purposeful way it flew hamnet thyssen guessed it was off to share its prey he glanced over at gudrid to his relief she didnt notice him doing it her eyes were on the owl they glowed they sparkled he supposed it was the pleasure of watching the kill that was like her sure enough the chilly wind painted roses on her cheeks she looked uncommonly vivacious uncommonly beautiful in spite of everything hamnet knew his manhood stirred angrily he looked away when the dogs came bounding toward the travelers hamnet first took them for a pack of dire wolves they were as fierce as dire wolves baying and howling and showing their yellow fangs they were almost as big as dire wolves several of them looked big enough to bridle and saddle and by the way they loped forward they were as hungry as their wild cousins too trasamund stood up in the stirrups and roared curses at them in his own language men would have cringed the dogs took no notice on they came ulric skakki proved himself the relentless pragmatist count hamnet thought him to behe strung his bow and nocked an arrow that seemed like such a good idea hamnet imitated it he didnt think killing a couple of these brutes would scare off the rest that could work with men but wouldnt with beasts but the living might feed on the dead which would make them less enthusiastic about attacking the travelers off to one side as usual audun gilli muttered to himself hamnet thyssen thought nothing of it audun spent too much time muttering to himself maybe as consolation for drinking less this muttering though proved different from the air in front of trasamund came a growl that might have burst from gods throat if god happened to be a dog hard on the heels of the growl followed a snarl like ripping canvas then another growl and then some furious barks that almost deafened hamnet and spooked his horse he wouldnt have made a useful archer how was he supposed to shoot when he had all he could do to keep from getting pitched off the horse and onto his head next to him ulric skakki also fought to stay in the saddle it turned out not to matter the onrushing dogs stopped so short they dragged their bottoms on the ground as they dug in their hind legs they seemed to decide they had urgent business elsewherewith their lawyer perhaps or at the tailors they ran the other way as fast as theyd charged aheadand much less noisily a few more growls and woofs right behind them spurred them on their way audun gilli stopped muttering the dog the size of god fell silent too hamnet thyssen was no scholar he left that to eyvind torfinn who was welcome to it scholar or not hamnet recognized cause and effect when he saw them once he persuaded his horse that the godsized dog wouldnt devour it in the next heartbeat he bowed in the saddle to audun that was fine wizardry he said you know ive had my doubts about you but you just buried a lot of them my thanks sweat beaded on auduns face despite the chill the sounds werent hard though getting them loud enough took a little doing but i think the scent worked even better good god ulric skakki said count hamnet noddedhe couldnt have put it better himself what would a dog that sounded like that smell like not having a dogs nose he couldnt fully understand the answer but he had some idea of what it must be anyhow a dog that sounded as if it was the size of god smelled intimidating trasamund pointed north here come the dogs those dogs belong to musk ox clan his curled lip said what he thought of the approaching bizogots the riders wore furs as he did but on their heads they had woolen caps in gaudy zigzag stripes they hadnt made those themselves the caps were products of raumsdalian bad taste but theyd traded for them so they had bad taste of their own next question is are they at war with trasamunds clan or does he just think they wear ugly headgear ulric skakki murmured well find out hamnet thyssen said a sentiment that had the advantageor too often the disadvantageof being true almost all the time who are you people one of the oncoming bizogots shouted why are you crossing our grazing lands count hamnet hadnt heard the bizogot language for a few years he was glad he could still understand it what did you do to our dogs another mammothherder added we drove them off trasamund yelled back better than they deserve too if dogs trouble us we treat them like dogs he didnt quite tell the musk ox men they were dogs themselves but he didnt miss by much either bizogots lacked a lot of things raumsdalians took for granted but not arrogance never arrogance trasamund struck his broad chest with a big fist i am trasamund son of halkel jarl of the three tusk clan these are my friends he threw his arms wide to include his companions from the empire then he pointed straight at the man whod challenged him hinder us at your peril subtle ulric skakki murmured its how bizogots do things hamnet thyssen answered and ulric nodded hamnet went on in his own way trasamund has style ulric skakki nodded again it wasnt the sort of style hamnet would have wanted but that had nothing to do with anything the bizogots from the musk ox clan reined in it didnt look like an immediate fighta good thing too because trasamund and the raumsdalians were likely to lose i am sarus son of leovigild said the blond barbarian who spoke for the musk ox men i am the jarls son he wore a cap with rings of red and deep blue and saffron it couldnt have got much uglier if it tried for a year we have no quarrel with the three tusk men now the concession was grudging but it was a concession we have no quarrel with the musk ox men now trasamund sounded as grudging as sarus and we have no quarrel with the empire sarus added after taking a look at the men and woman accompanying trasamund he didnt qualify that with a now hamnet thyssen wasnt sure trasamund noticed but he did himself eyvind torfinn held the highest rank among the raumsdalians nor does the empire quarrel with the musk ox clan he said in the bizogot tongue speaking slowly but clearly as well as a round man could he bowed in the saddle what did you do to the dogs asked the mammothherder whod put the question before we kept them from troubling us eyvind torfinn answered you have a shaman with you by the way sarus said it it was not a question and why should we not eyvind torfinn spoke in even terms after trasamunds bombast count hamnet wondered if sarus would pay any attention to him eyvind went on the world is full of spirits the world is full of other shamans too are we not allowed to ward ourselves as we would sarus mulled that the son of the musk ox jarl was big and fair like most of the bizogots who rode with him and like trasamund though he couldnt have been older than twentyfive he had a warriors scars and a nose that leaned to the left you will come to our camp he said at last my father will decide it was not a request but a command the only way to say no was not to speak but to fight sarus had more men with him than the raumsdalians and trasamund even if the northbound travelers somehow vanquished sarus and his followers the musk ox men could easily summon reinforcements hamnet thyssen could not prove there were any other raumsdalians north of the illdefined border are we to be guests at your fathers camp he asked before either trasamund or eyvind torfinn could speak people formally admitted to be guests had a special status among the bizogots they couldnt be killed for the sport of it for instance if any of them were female they couldnt be thrown down on the cold ground and gangraped for the sport of it either if sarus said no then fighting to the death now might make a better bet than whatever the musk ox jarls son had in mind but after no more than a heartbeats hesitation sarus nodded yes you will be guests at my fathers camp you will eat of our meat and salt you will drink of our smetyn that was the name they gave to fermented mammoths milkindeed to any fermented milk a raumsdalian would have spoken of bread and salt and beer or if he was rich of wine but the same principle held we thank you for your kindness hamnet thyssen said we are glad to accept should you come to the lands we roam we will gladly guest you there sarus smiled to see a foreigner fulfill ritual so well trasamund bared his teeth at count hamnet in what looked also like a smile but wasnt he did not want ties of guesting to bind him to the musk ox clan want it or not though he was stuck with it unless he wanted to charge saruss clansmates singlehanded maybe he wanted to but he didnt do it hamnet thyssen chuckled down deep in his chest so did ulric skakki audun gilli looked from one of them to the other neither offered to explain in some clanshamnet didnt know if the musk ox was one of themhospitality went further than meat and salt and smetyn some of the mammothherders shared their wives with guests and the bizogots expected visitors to their tents to do the same if they ever appeared as guests themselves every so often a raumsdalian marriage burned like a dry dead fir after a man whod gone up to the frozen plains unexpectedly had to try to meet his obligations to a traveler from the north what would gudrid make of such a demand count hamnet suspected it would depend on what she thought of the individual bizogot she certainly hadnt turned her back on trasamundat least not with her clothes on to hamnets relief sarus son of leovigild said we ride then and wheeled his horse to the northwest the direction from which he and his comrades had come the raumsdalians and trasamund rode after him the dogs that had loped along with saruss followers clung close to their horses they didnt trouble the travelers hamnet didnt hear any more barks from the outsized magical dog but he wondered whether audun gilli was keeping some of the nonexistent animals definitely existent smell in the air no denying itaudun was a wizard when the barbarians passed a herd of grazing musk oxen most of the dogs peeled off to help tend it the musk oxen didnt seem to need much help whenever men or wild beasts approached they formed a circle with the formidably horned bulls facing out on the perimeter cows and calves sheltered within the defense wasnt perfect but what in this world was it was usually more than good enough sarus rode back to the raumsdalians and fell in beside him may i ask you something the bizogot said in raumsdalian not quite as good as trasamunds you may ask i do not promise to answer count hamnet went on speaking the bizogot tongue he wanted the practice maybe sarus did too for he continued in raumsdalian this woman you have with youwho is she what is she doing here hamnet understood his curiosity if anything saying women from the empire seldom came to the frozen steppe was an understatement gudrid is earl eyvind torfinns wife hamnet answered that was true now what was once true didnt concern the bizogot i thought he said that the old man i was not sure it could be so sarus shrugged but then again why not our strong old men take younger women when they can too so he brought her with him to keep him warm when the breath of god blows strong did he it is not as simple as that hamnet said another goodsized understatement i should say it is not sarus exclaimed a goodlooking woman who is not so old when the man who has her is how much trouble has she caused you some hamnet answered less than she might have i suppose but that is not quite what i meant eyvind torfinn did not bring this woman here not the way you think she came north because it was her will that she come north she follows her own will no one elses one more understatement i have heard that you imperials are soft with your women i see it is so sarus said beat her a few times and she will follow her husbands will no one elses he folded one large hand into a hard fist it works for us hamnet had hit gudrid when he first found out she was unfaithful to him she tried to give him hemlock in his beer she tried to slip a knife between his ribs while he slept he hit her again and told her he wouldnt do it any more if she stopped trying to do away with him she did did that mean beating her worked he didnt think so it didnt stop her from being unfaithful not to him and nothing stopped her from being unfaithful to eyvind torfinn either what was he supposed to tell sarus he didnt want to admit gudrid was once hisand his worryso he said you have your ways we have ours some ways work for some folk others for others it could be so the bizogot said politely but what if ways do not work for a folk what then nothing in this world is perfect hamnet thyssen said and smiled a little who would have dreamt that what held true for the defensive herds of musk oxen also held for women he wondered what gudrid would have thought of that not much most likely god is perfect sarus said how could god not be perfect he would not be god god is perfect hamnet agreed but is god in this world or above it sarus grunted that was a different sort of argument instead of taking it up the jarls son said the golden shrine is perfect is it hamnet said i have never known a man who has seen it i have never heard a man who says he knows a man who has seen it he had no idea what if anything trasamund had told the bizogots on his way down to nidaros did they even know the gap had melted through and trasamund had fared beyond the glacier if they didnt hamnet was not about to tell them the golden shrine must be perfect sarus said if god is in the world at all he is in the world there well maybe count hamnet didnt care to quarrel down in the raumsdalian empire we hear all sorts of stories of lands still farther south lands where its like summer the whole year around lands where there are strange animals and stranger birds tales about places you have not seen who knows what to believe travelers tales are mostly lies sarus said mostly but not always hamnet said sometimes the travelers will bring hides with them hides of beasts that do not live in the empire or any neighboring country and do you know of opossums have they come this far north i have seen one or two sarus made a face horrible things like big rats with pointed faces what about them in the olden days when the glacier still covered this country they would not even come up as far as nidaros hamnet thyssen said as the glacier has moved north as the weather has grown warmer opossums have moved north too the people who live south of us say the beasts once came up through their lands and there were times when they did not know them opossums would have been travelers tales in longgone days but now they have their own tails and hang by them he hoped the pun worked in the bizogot language sarus made another face so evidently it did you will believe travelers tales about these ugly animals the musk ox clansman said but you will not believe them about the golden shrine or about god what does this say of you that i believe what i see with my own eyes what i touch with my own hands hamnet answered i already knew this about myself anyone else who deals with me for even a little while comes to see it is true sarus thought about it for a little while then he nodded as if to say he had already seen it and then he rode away as if to say that having seen it he did not find it pleasing hamnet thyssen was unsurprised hed met that reaction before more dogs barked and howled when the raumsdalians and trasamund rode into the musk ox clans encampment but though the big ferociouslooking beasts made halfhearted rushes toward the newcomers they did no more count hamnet glanced toward audun gilli the wizard gave back a smile of sorts maybe his magic held dogs at bay bizogots were another story men women and children swarmed out of their tents of muskox skins and mammoth hides drawn to the strangers like iron to a lodestone they would steal if they saw a chance hamnet thyssen knew that from experience he hoped the bizogots wouldnt have too many chances to steal from his comradeshoped without particularly expecting his hopes would come true instead of poles mammoth ribs and leg bones supported the bizogots tents here beyond the line where trees could grow to a useful size wood was scarce and precious the fires burning in braziers werent from seasoned timber either they were of dried mammoth or muskox dung which gave food cooked over them a certain unique piquancy the bizogots claimed meat roasted over dung fires was especially smoky and juicy and flavorful they claimed mere wood couldnt come close to matching dung in any of those ways travelers up from the south were dubious about their claims hamnet thyssen didnt think joints cooked over dung had any marked superiority over those he was more used to while up on the frozen plains he generally tried not to think at all about how his meat was cooked ulric skakki had also come up here before when he smelled the dung fires one of his eyebrows quirked up in wry amusement he caught hamnets eye and shrugged a shrug half resigned half melodramatic how long will the rest of them need he asked and didnt finish the question sooner or later all the raumsdalians would realize how the bizogots had to cook no one needed long to realize how little the bizogots bathed there hamnet thyssen had a hard time blaming the mammothherders even in summer warm water was a rare luxury here in winter water for drinking and cooking let alone for bathing had to be melted from snow or iceand shedding ones clothes invited frostbite if not worse but even if he understood why the bizogots behaved as they did the strong sour reek that rose from them made his nostrils flare their jarl saruss father looked like a larger older version of the man whod brought the raumsdalians to the camp gray streaked leovigilds greasy hair and shaggy beard thick heavy gold hoops hung from his ears a thicker golden necklace flashed against the gray and dun of his wolfskin jacket and when he smiled glittering gold covered or replaced most of his front teeth many a raumsdalian banker or pawnbroker would have envied his smile he spoke with sarus first to find out what arrangements his son had made with the strangers when he knew he turned to the raumsdalians and trasamund and boomed welcome my guests welcome three times welcome use our encampment as your own while you bide with us we thank you for your kindness we thank you for your hospitality we thank you for your generosity eyvind torfinn said politely come north and use my camp as i use yours now trasamund boomed back he and leovigild stared at each other in what seemed part appraisal part challenge they had come out of the same mold though leovigild was out longer and had seen more hard use you think youre so special traveling along by the edge of the glacier the musk ox jarl said all it means is your clan couldnt get better grazing ground shows what you know you old raven trasamund answered every year the glacier falls back all the new land that shows when it does is mine he made a fist and thumped it against his broad chest mine he thumped his chest again hamnet thyssen had never met a subtle restrained bizogot never once trasamund and leovigild exchanged more brags and barbs they seemed more goodnatured than otherwise maybe that meant they both remembered the obligations guesting gave them or maybe that they didnt dislike each other as men even if their clans did not get on well hamnet accepted the good humor without worrying overmuch about the wherefores behind it his time to worry came a little later when leovigild rounded on the raumsdalians and demanded and you people what are you doing north of the tree line the jarl eyed him and eyvind torfinn in particular he found that interesting audun gilli was easy to ignorethe other travelers did it all the time but ulric skakki was not a man who casually sank into obscurity neither was the leader of gudrids guards a toughlooking captain named jesper fletti and yet leovigild took no notice of either ulric or jesper he took no notice of gudrid either but bizogots were less likely to take women seriously or at least less likely to show they took women seriously than raumsdalians were your ferocity we are explorers come to learn what we may of your excellent country eyvind torfinn said as smoothly as he could in the bizogots language i am a scholar of days gone by we have a wizard with us as well he nodded to audun gilli who looked surprised even alarmedat being singled out leovigild also nodded our shamans will have somewhat to say to this fellow one or two of them speak raumsdalian he plainly did not expect audun to know his language by the look he gave the wizard he might not have expected audun to know anything his attention swung back to earl eyvind what of the others then soldiers help guard and help hunt eyvind said leovigild accepted that with a wave eyvind torfinn continued count hamnet here is an excellent man of his hands and has traveled the cold plains before while ulric skakki he ran down how was he supposed to explain why ulric skakki had come north i know all sorts of strange things your ferocity ulric had no trouble speaking for himself you never can tell when one of them will come in handy and you never can tell which one it will be huh leovigild eyed him strange things about slitting throats and knocking heads together and setting traps and stealing pouches or i miss my guess leovigild waited when ulric skakki didnt deny it the jarl grunted thought so he swung back toward earl eyvind and what about the woman gudrid is my wife your ferocity eyvind torfinn said a touch of sternness in his voice cant fault your tasteshe looks tastable enough in fact leovigild roared laughter at the look on eyvinds face he went on but what is she doing here i suggest you ask her yourself earl eyvind replied never mind leovigild threw back his head and laughed again you just told me everything i need to know eyvind torfinn looked bewildered which only made the bizogot laugh harder hamnet thyssen had no trouble following leovigild he meant that eyvind couldnt tell gudrid what to do the mammothherder wasnt wrong either count hamnet wondered whether anyone had ever been able to tell gudrid what to do he doubted it he knew too well he hadnt she is well able to take care of herself eyvind torfinn said that was true enough it might well have been truer than he knew true or not it made leovigild laugh even more but then the bizogot jarl sobered something you should know he said aiming a scarred forefinger at eyvinds chest something you need to know by god need to know yes the empire is rich the empire has a great plenty of everything is it not so well eyvind torfinn hesitated anyone whod lived his whole life in the raumsdalian empire knew things werent as simple as leovigild made them out to be but anyone whod spent even a little while on the frozen plains of the north knew that from the bizogot point of view the jarl was right and more than right the empire was rich it did have a great plenty of everything it is so leovigild said solemnly and because it is so in the empire you can say this one can take care of himself or even this one can take care of herself there is so much down in the south one person can have enough it is not like that here one person alone here is one person dead here only the clans can go on do you understand this eyvind torfinn does your tastable gudrid understand it i understand your words very well your ferocity earl eyvind said leovigild scowled and turned away hamnet thyssen knew why eyvind torfinn understood what the bizogots words meant yes but they didnt sink in for him not at the gut level where they should have and how much trouble would that cause him in his travels through the north how much trouble would it cause gudrid a woman could be independent down where trees grew and the ground wasnt frozen all the time up here where even a man was more a part of his clan than an individual she might find out the hard way just how different things were leovigild shrugged as if to say it wasnt his worry you raumsdalians are our guests he said even trasamund is our guest eat then and drink and know that the musk ox clan does not stint when the mammothherders ate they ate well by raumsdalian standards they ate monumentally well muskox ribs and liver and chitterlings and brains did not taste much different from the beef raumsdalians ate at home the bizogots made cheese from muskox milk they also made butter and ate it as a food on its own instead of spreading it on breadthey had no bread they used it in their lamps too mammoth had a stronger flavor than musk ox not all of that sprang from the fuel over which the meat cooked the musk ox was roasted over burning dung too count hamnet had never quite got used to mammoth meat and would not have eaten it by choice coming up onto the frozen plains he had no choice mammothmilk cheese also had a tang all its own for treats the bizogots ate strawberries and raspberries and blueberries and gooseberries candied in honey the berries that grew in this clime were small but very sweet bees had to scurry like madmen in the short spring and summer to lay in enough supplies to last through the rest of the year only a little farther north and they could not live smetyn whether made from mammoth or muskox milk even ale was better as far as hamnet was concerned but the sour brews warmed him inside and told him how sleepy he was he rolled himself in a mammothhide blanket and went to bed in a tent that reeked of burning butter v when count hamnet woke he needed a moment to remember where he was hed been on the road for a while now and hed got used to ulric skakkis resonant snores he supposed ulric was used to his too for the other man didnt complain about them any more the lingering smell of the butter lamp told him what he needed to know thats rightthe bizogot encampment he thought in case he needed a further reminder the shaggy hair on the mammoth hide draped over him would have done the job he yawned and stretched a few earlymorning sunbeams managed to sneak into the tent and turn what would have been darkness into gloom one of those sunbeams hit ulric skakki in the eye ulric tried to twist away but the damage was done his eyes opened he sat up and looked toward hamnet thyssen you awake he asked of course not i always talk in my sleep hamnet answered its too early in the morning to be funny ulric complained then he started to scratch and started to swear by god its a bizogot camp all right fleas bedbugsa copper gets you gold were lousy too he scratched some more harder now hamnet thyssen also started scratching all at once he itched everywhere its not a surprise he said trying to sound resigned instead of furious they dont bathe they wander with animals all the time there are all these hides around and scraps of meat no wonder theyve got bugs no no wonder at all ive been through this before i just forgot how much i love it thats all by now ulric skakki was probably scratching hard enough to draw blood that wouldnt help him it would only make him more alluring to the parasites he was trying to kill he said i wonder if audun can do anything about our little friends dont get your hopes up too high hamnet said the bizogot shamans know something about wizardry too and they crawl with vermin just like the rest of the barbarians ulric grunted well you know how to murder a mans hopes first thing in the morning dont you he crushed something between his thumbnails ha got one of the little bastards anyway i just had a thought congratulations i suppose hamnet thyssen said and then oh you expect me to ask you what it is if thats not too much trouble ulric had no trouble being sarcastic either not at all count hamnet said politely so what is this thought of yours maybe the bizogots are so used to getting eaten alive that its never occurred to their shamans that they dont have to maybe thats why they dont have any spells to hold the bugs at bay maybe hamnet said we can find out anyhow if he didnt sound optimistic he wasnt a bizogot dog barked at him when he came out of the tent but not with the same ferocity the beasts had shown before now hed eaten bizogot food and slept under bizogot blankets in a tent lit by bizogot lamps he was bound to start smelling like a bizogot himself the dog would approve of that hamnet didnt but he couldnt do anything about it and when everybody smelled the same way nobody smelled especially bad that was consolation of a sort it was consolation for him at least he wondered how gudrid would like it when she came out of her tent she smelled of attar of roses at least hamnet thyssen assumed the sweet fragrance came from her it seemed unlikely to belong to jesper fletti or the other imperial guardsmen and even more unlikely to belong to the bizogot women some of them were pretty enough in a fair strongfeatured way but they cared no more for raumsdalian notions of cleanliness than their menfolk did they did notice the scent that clung to gudrid though at first they didnt seem sure where it was coming from like flowers only more so one of them said could we do that another asked they liked the sweet smells then even if they didnt know much about making them looking smug gudrid showed off the little glass bottle in which the perfume came the bizogot women made as much of the bottle as of the scent inside that disconcerted gudrid which amused count hamnet to the mammothhunters glass was a trade good rare and costly it was one more thing they mostly did without life on the frozen plains was and had to be pared down to essentials the bizogots made do without pottery too except for what they got in trade from the south they used baskets and hide vessels some of the baskets were so finely woven they would hold water others with clay smeared over them could go into a fire without burning that was as close as the bizogots came to real pots gudrid dabbed perfume on some of the women yes the bizogots liked it two or three of the big blondes tried by sleight of hand to make the bottle disappear gudrid didnt let that happen she didnt mind stealing herselfanything from a new joke to a new husbandbut she drew the line at others stealing from her and she drew it successfully and she didnt make the bizogot women hate her when she did in spite of himself hamnet thyssen was impressed leovigild was not more southern foolishness he rumbled that being the bizogots usual name for anything the raumsdalians could do that they couldnt match but his nostrils flared whenever he got a whiff of the perfume trasamund also did his best not to show the perfume was anything out of the ordinary weve got to be moving he said at shorter and shorter intervals of course hed gone down into the empire hed met perfume before on gudrid and no doubt on others as well hed even learned to bathe sometimes leovigild and sarus both bowed to him god watch over you our guest they said stay safe stay full stay warm may the breath of god blow you here again may it be so trasamund replied to one ritual phrase with another safety and meat and warmth to you as well and may the breath of god bring you to my encampment that i might guest you in answer for your kindness count hamnet would have been angry if a detachment of raumsdalian soldiers took so long to get moving in the morning with so many people who werent raumsdalian soldiers in the party he supposed it could have been worse he suspected days would come when it was worse too the dogs chased them when they rode out of camp count hamnet hadnt expected anything different to a dog going away meant running away and running away meant you were prey audun gilli made the voice of dog snarl at the bizogot beasts maybe he made them smell that fearsome scent too they dashed back toward the mammothhide tents whimpers in their throats and their tails clamped between their legs no sooner were they gone than they were forgotten the plain stretched out ahead of the travelersthe plain and then farther north still the glacier one of the things hamnet thyssen forgotone of the things any raumsdalian forgotwas how wide how deep the frozen plains were a man or woman who lived in the empire knew variety wherever the eye fell here you saw forests there fields here you saw a castle there a village there maybe a town in the east there were hills in the west mountains birds and animals accommodated themselves to the different terrain in which they dwelt people did the same thing a tinsmiths life in a town differed in almost every way from that of a farmer who grew grain to feed his family while a rafter who floated great armies of logs down the broad river toward the rich foreign cities by the warm sea knew yet another way to earn his bread and meat and beer but the frozen plains were the frozen plains once the musk ox clans encampment fell behind count hamnet the wide land stretched out around him and his companions in one vast sweep seemingly identical in every direction when the sun shone bright the travelers might have been insects crawling across an endless plate under an enormous dome of blue enamel and when the wind shifted and blew out of the north when clouds swept down and covered the sky hamnet thyssens sense of being nothing of going nowhere if anything intensified when shadows disappeared the very idea of direction seemed to go with them he might have been moving in any direction at all it didnt seem to matter he rode up alongside trasamund and asked how do you remember you are men when you measure yourselves against this he intended his wave to be as vast as the landscape it tried to take in instead the motion only reminded him of his own puniness would trasamund understand him at all or did the bizogot take his own land as much for granted as a raumsdalian peasant took his farm to hamnet s relief the jarl neither gaped nor sneered at him out here in the middle of nowhere it happens that men forget trasamund said how do you mean hamnet asked trasamund said a word in his own language that hamnet hadnt heard before i am not sure how to turn that into raumsdalian the bizogot went on it means something like to enchant yourself sometimes you will find a fellow staring up at the sky or sometimes out to where the sky and the land meet he has forgotten everything around him sometimes hearing his friends will bring him back to himself sometimes it takes a shaman every once in awhilehe spread his handshis soul flies away for good and who knows where it goes this is a summer complaint you understand hamnet thyssen nodded yes i can see how it would be in winter up here everything closed down a man who spent most of his time inside one of the mammothhide tents with his wife and his children and his dogs and all their fleas wouldnt worry about how wide the world was you say it happens here hamnet went on does it not with men of the three tusk clan oh no trasamund laughed at the very idea oh no raumsdalian these folk have the plain and so do we i will not say otherwise we have the plain too yes but we also have the glacier ah if hamnet were walking instead of riding he would have kicked at the ground in annoyance he didnt like seeming foolish or missing things but he knew he had and then a few hours later the travelers were no longer alone on the plain jesper fietti pointed north are those mammoths the imperial guard captain asked in an unwontedly small voice not at all ulric skakki said blandly those are steppe fleas and if youre not careful theyll step on you jesper grimaced so did hamnet thyssen audun gilli winced trasamund didnt get it for a moment he had to think in his own language and didnt understand raumsdalian as readily when he did he roared laughter steppe fleas is it if those are fleas then the world is their dog maybe it is ulric said only god knows why he made it the way he did maybe one of these days the world will scratch and that will be the end of the fleasand of us too do not tell this to a priest unless you want to burn for blasphemy hamnet thyssen said do not tell this to a shaman either he may decide to sacrifice you to let out the madness in your spirit trasamund said he snorted steppe fleas there were about a dozen mammothsa herd of females with their young males wandered by themselves except during the latesummer mating season when they would use their weight and their tusks to battle one another to see which of them fathered the new generation the rest of the year those tusks pushed snow off the grasses the mammoths ate and broke ice atop frozen streams so they could drink do not go too close trasamund warned otherwise we shall have to step lively to flee the steppe fleas he waved a challenge to ulric skakki grinning ulric waved back yielding him the prize trasamund bowed in the saddle no matter how bad his puns the jarls advice was good hamnet thyssen might have wanted a closer look at the mammoths but he understood they didnt want a closer look at him the travelers got near enough to let him remind himself what marvelous beasts they were the females stood perhaps eight feet high at the shoulder males were biggerhe remembered that they looked like great shaggy boulders shambling over the plain the females were big enough for all ordinary use the knobs of bone they had on top of their heads gave them high foreheads and a look of greater cleverness than their cousins the forest mastodons as far as hamnet knew that look was an illusion it was a powerful illusion though unlike mastodons mammoths also had a hump on their backs they sloped down from it so that their hind legs were relatively short they had small ears and short trunks which made it harder for them to freeze and they had long blackbrown hair that often led them to be called woolly mammoths it wasnt wool it wasnt anything like wool the hairs were thick and coarsethey had to be half a dozen times as thick as a mans hair but they were longsome of them as long as a mans armand they grew close together mammoths like musk oxen could get through almost any weather one of the females lifted her trunk and blew a warning blast it sounded something like a trumpet something like a gargle another female also trumpeted the young mammoths ran behind their mothers they were browner than the adults how do you herd them audun gilli asked trasamund carefully the jarl answered laughing the wizard looked disappointed i hoped for something more than that trasamund almost told him where to head in then the bizogot visibly thought better of showing his annoyance a man who offended a sorcerer could have ail sorts of unpleasant things happen to him well trasamund said a man on horseback is big enough even for a mammoth to notice and a troop of men shouting and waving torches can usually get the beasts to do what they want usually what do you do when they stampede hamnet thyssen asked try to stay out of their way by god try not to get trampled and squashed the bizogot answered he was joking but then again he wasnt after a moment he went on you wave those torches around for all theyre worth too mammoths are like most beaststhey dont like fire i have a question too jesper fletti said he waited for trasamund to nod his way then asked how do you get the females tame enough for milking you bribe them the bizogot jarl spoke raumsdalian with some relish there is a kind of grass that grows on some parts of the plainblueflower we call it in my language the mammoths are wild for it one of the things we do while we travel is pull up blueflower wherever we find it when we set a pile of the dried grass in front of a mammoth she will stand and eat it and the milkers can do what they need to do yes we bribe the mammoths they might as well be people are they as clever as people say audun asked i dont know how clever do people down in the empire say they are trasamund asked they know how to do more things than musk oxen can ill say that and they remember better than musk oxen do too they have trunks hamnet thyssen said those are almost like hands they let mammoths do things other animals cant yes thats so that makes them almost like people too trasamund said one of these days maybe theyll try bribing us instead of the other way around he chortled at his own wit like most bizogots count hamnet had known he wasnt shy about finding himself wonderful in all kinds of ways do any beasts besides men trouble them ulric skakki asked every once in a while lions or a shortfaced bear will take a calf that wanders too far from its mother trasamund replied doesnt happen often but it happens but what really troubles them in the warmer times are bugs in spite of all that hair the flies and mosquitoes drive them wild ive been up here i believe that hamnet said when the frozen plain thawed out in springtimeor thawed out as much as it ever did anyhow endless little ponds dotted the landscape mosquitoes laid eggs in those ponds and then rose in buzzing biting swarms sometimes the clouds of them were thick enough to dim the sun it was as if the soul of a vampire were reincarnated in a million beings instead of just one a baby mammoth came out from behind its mother and took a few curious steps toward the travelers she trumpeted at it when it didnt heed her she walked up and thumped its side with her trunk the blow couldnt have hurt but it sent a message the baby stopped you see trasamund said when the little one gets out of line it gets whacked so too it is among the bizogots we have no spoiled whining folk among us not like some places a man could name that was nonsense as hamnet thyssen knew bizogots pulled together better than raumsdalians that didnt mean there were no spoiled mammothherders and it didnt mean they never whined more often than not hamnet would have argued the point with trasamund today he held his peace not because he felt uncommonly generous but because trasamund was looking right at gudrid when he grumbled about spoiled raumsdalians that would have made hamnet forgive and overlook a lot the expression on gudrids face would have made him forgive and overlook even more yes trasamund went unchallenged hevring lake was dead and gone the scars the draining of its basin left behind would lie heavy on the land west of nidaros for centuries to come farther north new meltwater lakes formed as the glacier retreated sudertorp lake wasnt very deep but spread across a great stretch of the frozen plain waterfowl by the hundreds of thousands bred at the lakes marshy edges foxes and dire wolves and lynxes preyed on that abundance even lions and shortfaced bears didnt disdain geese and great white swans neither did the bizogots the leaping lynx clan was camped near the eastern edge of sudertorp lake at this season of the year they won enough food with their bows and with their snares that they didnt need to wander they had stone huts that they came back to every spring their clothes differed from those of the musk ox and three tusk clans to keep themselves warm they wore jackets stuffed with down in really cold weather they wore trousers stuffed with down too with ingenious arrangements at the knee to make walking easier and others farther up to do the same for relieving themselves in spring they were glad enough to guest travelers coming up by sudertorp lake they had more than they could eat themselves so did the other clans that dwelt along the lakeshore it made them unique among the bizogots the jarl of the leaping lynx clan was a fat man named riccimir hamnet thyssen didnt think hed ever seen a fat nomad before ear eat riccimir said you are welcome oh yesyou are welcome your goose is cooked eyvind torfinn ulric skakki and count hamnet all looked up in alarm when they heard that your ferocity eyvind said riccimir laughed till the tears ran down his greasy face ho ho ho yes i know what that means in raumsdalian a trader taught me it is a good joke yes as long as it is a joke your ferocity it is a good one ulric skakki said it is by god it is but it is the best kind of a jokeit is a true joke we have today a great plenty of cooked goose riccimir said hamnet thyssen ate roasted goose till his belly groaned bizogots used only knives for eating tools by the time he finished his face was as greasy as riccimirs so were those of the other raumsdalians however much hamnet ate the bizogots around him outdid him without effort they were better at going without than civilized men too moderation was not in their nature the way they lived didnt let them be moderate they didnt drink to enjoy themselves either they drank to get drunk downing smetyn that took a lot of drinking they met the challenge with ease hamnet thyssens head was spinning when riccimir pointed to gudrid and said i will sleep with that one tonight i like the way she smells trasamund eyvind torfinn pick women for yourselves you are the leaders it is your right if your friends find willing women that is all right too he spoke in the bizogot language what does he say gudrid asked suspiciouslythat finger aimed at her and the fat jarls leer no doubt gave her reasons for suspicion when eyvind torfinn translated for her she let out an irate squawk no she said and i dont like the way he smells not even a little bit eyvind turned to riccimir gudrid is my wife he said and trading women back and forth is not our custom and so riccimir said you are in the halls of the bizogots now any other jarl would have said the tents here you follow our customs why bed an unwilling woman ulric skakki said smoothly isnt it a waste of time with so many willing they arent much fun after you pin them down either says who the jarl returned sometimes the way they squawk and thrash fans the fire and this one looks like fun pick any woman for yourself in payment eyvind torfinn we have some lively ones you are old but they will know how to make you think you are young once that was translated gudrid squawked louder than ever count hamnet wondered why she spread her favors over the landscape with fine impartiality what was one more unbathed bizogot she was unbathed herself even if she did have that bottle of attar of roses in raumsdalian jesper fletti said tell the jarl we have a strong custom against forcing a woman to give herself he probably almost said something like tell the barbarian hamnet thyssen found it ironically amusing that gudrids bodyguard was indeed guarding her body although no doubt not in the way hed had in mind when he set out from nidaros jesper proved wise to speak politely riccimir answered in fairly fluent raumsdalian saying if you talk about your customs in your land i will listen you have the right to do that but you are not in your land imagine the custom of our land made you do something against your own customs ulric said would you do it just for the sake of fitting in what kind of man was riccimir ulric asked a good sensible question but did the bizogot care about good sensible questions or did he simply want to open gudrids legs if he didnt feel like listening what could the travelers do not muchif it came to a fight they were bound to lose the jarl scowled at ulric skakki when he did hamnet thyssens hopes rose riccimir understood what ulric was saying anyway you are not good guests he grumbled guests should follow the ways of the hosts our women would not raise such a fuss over a small thing a small thing trasamund said dont you have a big thing riccimir i do by god i do riccimir answered laughing we are the leaping lynxes but i am a mammoth maybe i am too much for a woman of the south maybe you are ulric skakki said and the tension eased much help you were gudrid hissed at hamnet thyssen a little later by god why should i help you he asked in honest perplexity i dont want you here i wish youd go back to nidaros i dont feel anything for you any more he wished that were true the hopeless mix of curdled love and fury that coursed through him whenever he thought of gudrid chewed his stomach to sour rags and made him want either to hit somethingpreferably her or stab himself gudrid knew it she enjoyed itshe reveled in it he did his best not to admit it usually his best was nowhere near good enough tonight it served you would have let thatthat savage do what he wanted to me gudrid said shrilly this was one of the chances you took when you left the empire hamnet pointed out anyone with an ounce of sense would know it no doubt that lets you out she swung on him she was very quick but again he caught her wrist before she connected he was much stronger than she was it hardly ever did him any good she said something that would have horrified a drill sergeant it didnt faze hamnet thyssen when she tried to bite him he shoved her away hard she sat down even harder and called him a name that made the first one seem like love poetry by comparison again he scarcely noticed he rubbed his hand against his trouser leg trying to wipe away even the memory of touching her never a dull moment is there ulric skakki said his voice dry why what ever could you mean hamnet thyssen trying to sound arch and coy was as unnatural as a musk ox trying to play the trumpet ulric did his best not to laugh but it was a losing battle sulking riccimir went off with a bizogot woman she was younger and better built than gudrid and at least as pretty even if she didnt wear perfume the jarl stayed grumpy all the same no doubt he would have been glad enough to lie down with her if he hadnt set eyes on gudrid since he had the woman from his own clan wasnt what he wanted any more that made her seem like secondhand goods to him foolishness ulric skakki said everything that goes on between men and women is full of foolishness true enough hamnet said but so what for better or worse were stuck with each other he knew too much about worse and not enough of better well not necessarily ulric sent him a sly sidelong glance although i must say youre not my type he made himself mince far better than count hamnet made himself sound naive those things happen down in the empire not up here not very often hamnet said when the bizogots catch men bedding men they make them into eunuchs and then they burn them not a lot of give to the mammothherders their ways are their ways you step outside them at your peril charming people ulric was also a dab hand at irony arent they there at least hamnet thyssen could match him the leaping lynx bizogots stuffed the travelers with more roast fowl and with boiled duck and goose eggs the next morning riccimir seemed in a better mood than he had the night before maybe the buxom blonde from his own clan pleased him more than hed thought she would whatever the reason he didnt try to hinder the travelers when they mounted their horses to ride away from what was as close to a settled village as the northern nomads came he couldnt resist going after the last word though he walked up to gudrid and said my pretty you will remember last night forever why she said nothing happened between us by the look in her eye she was glad nothing happened too riccimir ignored that look it wasnt easy hamnet thyssen envied his singlemindedness that is why you will remember it he said you will regret that you did not come to know the mighty love of riccimir he struck a pose what gudrids horse did a moment later probably matched her opinion of riccimirs mighty love his clansmates could dry the results and use them for warmth and cooking if she had spoken her words probably would have given them plenty of warmth too as things were her expression was eloquent enough the jarl convinced to the marrow that he was wonderful never noticed are we ready eyvind torfinn said perhaps we should depart then god keep you safe on your journey riccimir said may he bring you back to your homes with wealth or wisdom or whatever you seek and may he bring you to my clan on your way south good will be the guesting on your returnand may the sweet ones heart be softened by then count hamnet didnt see how eyvind torfinn could answer that without landing in trouble with riccimir or with gudrid or with both of them at once earl eyvind showed uncommon wisdomhe didnt try he flicked his horses reins and used the pressure of his knees to urge the beast forward the rest of the raumsdalians and trasamund followed an interesting time audun gilli said riding up alongside hamnet and ulric skakki thats one way to put it hamnet said some interesting times i could live without it wasnt so bad audun said demons take me if it wasnt hamnet exclaimed ulric laughed he didnt mind it thyssen didnt you see him go off with that bizogot wench his hands shaped an hourglass in the air no i didnt hamnet couldnt remember when hed lost track of the wizard audun wasnt what anyone would call memorable so he had trouble when was this you were exchanging compliments with your lady love ulric skakki stopped hamnet thyssen had a hand on his swordhilt he probably also had murder in his eye he didnt mind being chaffed about many things the list was short yes but gudrid headed it ulric hastened to backtrack my apologies your grace when you were quarreling with your former wife i should have said yes you should have hamnet made his hand come off the sword he made himself look away from ulric skakki and toward audun gilli so you lay down with a bizogot woman did you how was it did you have to hold your nose im not so clean myself these days after a bit you stop noticing that audun grinned it made him look surprisingly young as for the rest well the parts work the same way here as they do down in the empire theres a surprise ulric skakki grinned too count hamnet only grunted losing gudrid had soured him on women he still bedded them now and againsometimes his body drove him to do what he wanted to despise but he couldnt take them lightly the way most men did trasamund led them away from sudertorp lake the jarl of the three tusk clan was not in a good humor since hamnet thyssen wasnt either he soon found himself riding next to trasamund the big blond jarl scowled at him when he scowled back trasamund seemed satisfied after a while trasamund said that leaping lynx clan he didnt seem to know how to go on what about them hamnet asked they hardly seem like bizogots at all it burst from trasamund they seemed very much like bizogots to hamnet but he was looking at them from the outside not from the inside the way the jarl was slowly he said the waterfowl give them so much to eat at this season they dont have to wander things are different when you can stay in one place for a long time i suppose so trasamund went right on scowling its wrong though its unnatural they might as well be raumsdalians by the way he said it he couldnt imagine a stronger condemnation i will tell you your ferocity that to a raumsdalian they dont seem much like raumsdalians at all count hamnet said they live in stone houses they have fat people they are like raumsdalians no trasamund had no more idea of what being a raumsdalian meantprobably lessthan hamnet did about being a bizogot he also didnt know that he really didnt know what being a raumsdalian meant arguing with him would only make him angry hamnet thyssen didnt try instead looking out across the frozen plain he pointed and asked whats that all at once trasamund was back in his element he forgot about the bizogots of the leaping lynx clan thats a godcursed dire wolf is what that is his voice rose to a shout close up close up weve got wolves archers string your bows weve got wolves to hamnet thyssen it was only a moving squiggle at the edge of visibility but he wasnt at home here any more than trasamund knew all the ins and outs of life in nidaros or even in the distant keep where hamnet would rather have spent his time accepting that trasamund knew and he didnt hamnet braced himself for an onslaught he didnt have to wait long just as the bizogot recognized a distant moving squiggle as danger so the dire wolf saw distant moving squiggles as meat it couldnt take their scent the wind was with them but before long a formidable pack of dire wolves trotted purposefully toward the travelers dire wolves were half again as big as their cousins that skulked through the eastern forests their fur was thicker and of a paler gray so as not to stand out against the snow some people said timber wolves were smarter than their larger cousins hamnet thyssen didnt know about that one way or the other people also said dire wolves ate more carrion than timber wolves did count hamnet thought that was true but it didnt mean dire wolves turned up their noses at fresh meat if count hamnet hadnt known that he would have found out now the pack leader stood there right at the edge of bowshot eyeing the travelers the dire wolf grinned a doggy grin at them long pink tongue lolling out of his mouth even at that distance though hamnet could make out the animals teeth long and sharp and yellow dire wolves needed to be wary around men any animal bigger than a bedbug needed to be wary around men but men needed to be wary around dire wolves too after a moments appraisal the dire wolf lifted its head and let out a howl if it were speaking a human tongue hamnet would have thought that howl meant all right lets try it and see what happens and it seemed to mean just that the dire wolves trotted forward again they might have been trying to cut a weak musk ox or a baby mammoth out of the herd almost of their own accord hamnets eyes went to gudrid that was a tempting thought but he didnt suppose she would appreciate it shout at them trasamund called sometimes you can scare them off hamnet yelled at the top of his lungs so did the rest of the travelers some of the dire wolves skidded to a stop a few even went back onto their haunches but the rest kept coming seeing their comrades advance the frightened wolves got up and went on too it was as if they didnt want their friends to think them cowards in some ways dire wolves were much too much like men vi trasamunds bowstring twanged an arrow hissed through the air it just missed the lead dire wolf and stood thrilling in the ground the wolf kept coming without so much as a sideways glance dire wolves werent just like men the pack leader wasted no time dwelling on what might have been it dwelt only in the real world hamnet thyssen didnt know whether to pity it or envy it he and ulric skakki let fly at the same instant half a heartbeat behind trasamund both their arrows struck the pack leader one in the snout the other not far from the base of the tail well shot they cried together at the same time as the dire wolf let out a startled yip of pain the wolf didnt know how the men had hurt it but it knew they had it turned and ran from them the rest came on they werent hurt and then in short order several of them were their anguished howls persuaded their fellows this was not a good place to be when trasamund led the horsemen forward against them everyone still shouting the dire wolves took it as a challenge they didnt care to meet unlike people they wasted no time on useless heroics if the travelers werent prey the wolves wanted nothing to do with them one dire wolf struck in the eye lay dead on the ground heres meat for tonight trasamund boomed gudrid made a revolted noise some of the imperial guardsmen looked a trifle green hamnet thyssen had eaten dire wolf before nothing on the frozen plains went to waste its not so bad he said just think that its food not where it comes from his countrymen didnt seem convinced jesper fletti rounded on audun gilli youre supposed to be a wizard arent you the guard captain said why didnt you magic away those dire wolves we were doing well enough without wizardry audun answered it takes a toll the same as any other hard work does if we needed it i would have tried something since we didntwell thank god i say youre a lazy wizard or a weak one jesper told him no doubt audun gilli said mildly but from now on will you ever dare turn your back on me again you take your chances you know insulting even a lazy wizard or a weak one jesper fletti turned red im not afraid of you then youre a fool hamnet thyssen said and that will be enough of that who do you think you are to tell me what i am jesper demanded glowering at hamnet and who do you think you are to tell me what to do im a man who recognizes fools id betterive been one often enough hamnet looked toward gudrid as he answered she deliberately looked away from him he hadnt expected anything else as for telling you what to do he went on well lets see for one thing i outrank you you should say who do you think you are your grace for another ive been up here in the north before have you and for a third i hope i know better than to get any wizard angry at me jesper fletti glowered and spluttered whatever he was feeling he didnt try to put it into words hamnet thyssen had landed too heavy a load of truth on him he looked away from hamnet too gudrid did it with more panache i thank you your grace audun gilli said in a low voice youre welcome ive seen you arent lazy or weak count hamnet answered if he asked if you were drunk or hungover i would have had less to say to him auduns mouth tightened dont you think saying something like that might make a wizard angry at you i hope not hamnet replied a man who gets angry at the truth will have a hard time in life dont you think it could be so audun gilli answered after considering the question longer and more seriously than hamnet had looked for yes it could be so of course you might say the same about a man who gets drunk whenever he finds the chance yes you might hamnet agreed far be it from me to deny that but theres a simple answer dont you think an obvious answer too for almost every problem there is an answer that is simple obvious and wrong audun said hamnet thyssen pondered that then inclined his head the wizard left him with no good comeback trasamund got down from his horse tossing the reins to ulric skakki he walked over to the dire wolf and butchered it anyone but me want a chunk of raw liver he asked holding up the dripping purplish organ plainly he was ready to laugh at effete raumsdalians when they told him no gudrid gulped when she looked away this time she wasnt acting or posing she was truly revolted but audun gilli said give me some what better way to take in the spirit of this land ill eat some too hamnet said the dire wolf would have gnawed my liver the least i can do is pay him back now thatthat is spoken like a bizogot by god trasamund said count hamnet knew the jarl meant it for praise if it felt like an insult he could keep that to himself ill eat wolf liver why not its meat ulric skakki said he might well have eaten it before but he didnt want trasamund to know this wasnt his first visit to the frozen plains trasamund turned to eyvind torfinn what about you your splendor with respect your ferocity i will decline eyvind answered i have my own land and do not wish to become mystically attuned to this one besides unless starving and without choice i prefer my meat cooked the jarl took it in good part saying well you know your own mind anyway he ate his gobbet with every sign of relish then passed another one to audun gillithe wizard was the first raumsdalian volunteer audun screwed up his face and stuffed the bloody meat into his mouth he chewed could be worse he said once he got it down at least that wasnt tastes like chicken ulric skakki murmured direwolf liver didnt taste like chicken hamnet thyssen had no time to point that out to ulric for trasamund handed him his own chunk of stillwarm meat he ate it without thinking about what he was doing and swallowed it without too much trouble when he saw gudrids mocking expression he smiled back at her with his mouth still full that made her turn away in a hurry ulric skakki ate his ragged slice of liver without any fuss jesper fletti and the rest of gudrids guardsmen declined to partake they were less smooth about it than earl eyvind but trasamund didnt harry them on account of that hed got three raumsdalians to try his delicacy which was probably three more than he expected trasamund went back to his butchery he wrapped the meat in the dire wolfs hide and tied it on a pack horse the animal snorted and rolled its eyes at the scent of blood and the smell of dire wolf but did not try to bolt trasamund left the wolfs entrails steaming on the ground lets go he said maybe the others will come back to feed on their friend i think not ulric skakki pointed up into the sky are those just ordinary vultures or are they teratorns teratorns eyvind answered before trasamund could you can tell by the pattern of white and black under the wings by the size too when they get lower trasamund added but they wont not while were hanging around the offal sure enough when the travelers rode north the three or four teratorns spiraled down out of the sky to squabble over the bounty trasamund left behind they were enormous birds with a wingspan as wide as two tall men and down in the south hamnet thyssen had heard there were bigger teratorns still their grotesque naked heads wattled and striped in shades of blue and yellow all vultures were ugly those southern teratorns seemed to take ugliness to an almost surreal level one where even grotesqueness took on a beauty all its own do bizogots also eat teratorn meat eyvind torfinn asked if we have to if we are starving otherwise trasamund shook his head it is a foul bird it eats filth and carrion its flesh tastes of its food the same as any vultures he made a nasty face did that mean he was once or more than once hungry enough to have to eat flesh like that hamnet thyssen wondered but he didnt ask like the totem animal for which it was named the vole clan was small but the jarl of the clan a burly fellow named wacho had more than his share of pride oh yes voles are little beasts he said but the frozen plain would die if not for them who feeds the weasels who feeds the foxes who feeds the lynxes who feeds the snowy owls the vole give the vole its due hamnet thyssen tried to imagine someone down in nidaros singing the praises of the house mouse he couldnt do it for one thing folk in nidaros had plenty of other things to worry about for another the bizogots were more closely attuned to nature than his own people to raumsdalians house mice were nuisances to be trapped or poisoned or hunted with cats to bizogots voles were part of the vast web of life that spread across their land who was right who was wrong hamnet shrugged life for the mammothherders was harder than it was in the empire by the nature of things it had to be hed grown up in the raumsdalian way himself and he preferred it but sometimes the question was one of difference rather than right and wrong he thought that was so here as usual when a clan guested the travelers they feasted till they neared the bursting point i think the idea is to give us a layer of blubber like a mammoths ulric skakki said gnawing the meat from yet another muskox rib thats all very well hamnet said but if we dont fit into our clothes the blubber wont do us enough good to make up for it audun gilli started to say something he wasnt a big man but he had a respectable pile of bones in front of him before he could speak someone new came into wachos tenta fantastically dressed bizogot whose jacket and trousers were elaborately embroidered and fringed so that he seemed almost to be wearing a pelt the resemblance was only strengthened by the bear claws at his wrists and ankles and by the bearskin mask now pushed back from his face this is witigis wacho said he is the shaman of the voles witigiss gaze was quick and darting more the look of a wild animal than a man shamans said they had closer ties to god than raumsdalian priests dreamed of winning hamnet thyssen wondered if witigis was a holy man or simply a madman his vacant features didnt promise much in the way of brains but when his gaze fell on audun gilli he stiffened so did the raumsdalian wizard they stared at each other without looking as he took it witigis grabbed a rib and started chewing on the meat grease glistened around his mouth his eyes never left audun gillis like calls to like ulric whispered maybe count hamnet answered but if thats so which one of them did you just insult ulric laughed for all the world as if he were joking witigis began to sing it wasnt an ordinary song even an ordinary bizogot song it had words in the mammothherders tongue but they werent words that made sense at least not to count hamnet it also had hums and growls and barks and sounds that perhaps should have been words but werent not in any tongue hamnet knew and as witigis sang he changed at first hamnet thyssen rubbed his eyes not sure what he was seeing but there could be no doubt witigiss fringed regalia became real fur the bear claws he wore were no longer ornaments they grew from his fingers and toes as if they always had after he pulled the mask down over his blueeyed visage his mouth opened wide to show fangs that never sprouted from any merely human jaw nor did his growl spring from any human throat there he crouched on all foursan undersized but otherwise perfect shortfaced bear wacho looked proud of his shaman trasamund nodded as if to say he had seen the like but admired the performance the raumsdalians all seemed a little uneasy or more than a little all but audun gilli he too began to sing a calm song that might almost have been a lullaby count hamnet had nearly as much trouble understanding him as he had with witigis auduns words were raumsdalian but in a dialect so old that it came close to being another language hamnet needed so long to grasp one bit that several others would slip past him uncomprehended till he seized on another small clump of familiar sounds eyvind torfinn nodded whatever the wizard was singing it was no mystery to the old earl hamnet thyssen didnt suppose that should have surprised him any man who went searching for the secrets of the golden shrine would naturally come to know the old the all but forgotten audun sang on and little by little the shaman lost his bearishness his fur coat became embroidery and fringes once more the claws he wore were only ornaments not parts of himself an ordinary handdirty but ordinarypushed back the bearskin mask that was only a mask and under it lay his face when he opened his mouth to speak he showed a mans ordinary face but hamnet thyssen knew what he had seen he knew it was true transformation too not illusion he didnt know how he knew but he did yes you too have the power witigis told audun audun gilli did not speak the bizogot language no one would ever have known it from the way he inclined his head in raumsdalian he answered your strength is not small maybe he understood with the heart if not with the head witigis had given no sign of knowing raumsdalian nor is yours he said now in his own tongue the two of them the barbarian with the bear in his soul and the drunken product of a formidable civilization bowed respectfully to each other well well wacho said i have never seen witigis brought out of bearness save when he himself wished it how do you know he did not your ferocity ulric skakki asked the jarl sent him a sharp glance as if to chide him for joking about a serious business but ulric was not joking and wacho saw as much a point southern man the bizogot said yes a point how do i know i do not know he glanced at witigis i wonder if he knows himself when i am a bear i know little of what i do witigis said nosay not that i do not know say that i do not care as a bear would not care when i am a man again i see what my bearself has done i see and as often as not i marvel a bear will do what a man would not the lesson is this does not always make the bear wrong does it always make the man wrong hamnet thyssen didnt know if audun gilli would have asked that question whether the wizard did or not count hamnet wanted it answered witigis blinked and looked quite humanlythough not bearishly amazed do you know outlander i never thought of that i never thought about it he said think about it he did with a concentrated intensity that startled hamnet more than a minute went by before he continued no the man is not always wrong sometimes a man is a fool sometimes a bear is a brute that struck hamnet as basically honest i thank you he said when you change from a man to a bear do you think god enters into you eyvind torfinn found a different kind of question to ask in answering the bizogot shaman didnt hesitate not unless god comes in the shape of a bear he answered when i am a bear i am a bear not only in body but also in spirit do you still feel your human spirit when you are a bear ulric skakki inquired and when you are a man do you feel a bears spirit pawing around at the bottom of your soul witigis smiled you have a way with words ulric modestly shook his head again the bizogot thought hard before answering both could be so when i am a bear i suppose i am a smarter bear than one who never walks on two legs and when i am a man he shaped his hands into paws and looked at them as if surprised the bear claws dangling from his sleeve were not part of him all the time when i am a man sometimes i would rather bite and tear than talk hamnet thyssens laugh was not particularly pleasant from what i have seen of men my friend you need not have a bear in your soul to make this so if you have a bit of bear in you even when you are a man do the women like you better for it ulric skakki grinned a sly grin gudrid made a disgusted noise hamnet wondered why some of the men she was drawn to were brutes even if not shapeshifterstrasamund sprang to mind did she think that was all right for her but not for someone else hamnet wouldnt have been surprised gudrid always thought rules were for other people as for the shaman he grinned back now and again i have seen this to be so not always but now and again some women like one thing some another you never can tell no you cant its almost as if they were people isnt it ulric said witigis scratched his head at first that was simple puzzlement then it turned businesslike he squashed something between his thumbnails gudrid made another disgusted noise count hamnet silently sighed he was lousy now himself and fleabitten and also bitten by bedbugs the bizogots took all that for granted with their attitude toward bathing they could hardly do anything else when you go from man to bear do you leave human fleas and lice behind he asked witigis if you stay a bear do you get a bears bugs you people find interesting questions by god the shaman said i always wondered why im bitten less than most people now maybe i know maybe you do hamnet said later as leather drinking jacks of smetyn passed from hand to hand he saw witigis talking with wacho and pointing his way he couldnt make out what either the shaman or the jarl was saying which annoyed him coming right out and asking would have been rude instead he drank more than he might have otherwise wacho talked with a bizogot woman she nodded then she came over and sat down beside count hamnet im marcatrude she said hamnet gave his own name she nodded again she couldnt have been much past twenty she was pretty enough and nicely shaped if she was no cleaner than bizogots usually were well hamnet thyssen wasnt much cleaner than bizogots usually were either she said wacho has given me to you for the night if you want me if count hamnet had drunk less he might have said no if he hadnt gone without a woman for such a long time he might have said no too but he had and he told himselfdrunkenlyrefusing the jarls kindness would be impolite where shall we go he asked bizogots worried less about privacy than raumsdalians did if this was going to turn into an orgy he didnt think he could keep up his end of the bargain but marcatrude didnt seem to expect it to she set her hand on his even if he was drunk he noticed she didnt have the smooth supple skin of a pampered raumsdalian womanof say someone like gudrid hamnet shook his head he didnt want to think about gudrid now if he did he might also fail to keep up his end of the bargain if marcatrudes palm was callused and rough from work even when she was so young then it was that was all she would be soft other places soft where it mattered when he got up and left the jarls tent with her he felt gudrids eyes boring into his back absurdly he felt guilty as if he were being unfaithful to her considering everything shed done that was ridiculous which didnt make the feeling go away he and marcatrude had another mammothhide tent to themselves they lay down together on the cured hide of a shortfaced bear i can blow out the lamp if you like marcatrude said as he began to undress her drink and lust made his fingers clumsy no let it burn he said and then feeling that wasnt enough youre so pretty youre worth seeing she smiled she had very white very even teeth you say kind things she told him what kind of men are outlanders before long he was naked too she eyed him and nodded you are man enough without a doubt she seemed surprised when he teased her and stroked her instead of just opening her legs and taking his pleasuresurprised but not unhappy far from unhappy in fact she purred with pleasure that pleased hamnet and heated him too oh the bizogot girl said softly when he went into hera sound he thought was likely the same in any language he brought her to the peak an instant before he spent himself he stroked her cheek and told her how wonderful she was the afterglow didnt last longit never did what had been delight quickly turned to disgust it wasnt that marcatrude had a strong smell or that her hair was greasy and matted hamnet thyssen took no longlasting pleasure in raumsdalian women either hed scratched an itch and now it wouldnt trouble him for a while that was how he looked at it if a woman wasnt gudrid she wasnt worth bothering with and if a woman was gudrid she wasnt worth bothering with either he wondered where that left him nowhere good was the only answer hed ever found while true it didnt seem helpful would you like to go again marcatrude asked thank you dear but no hamnet answered to make her feel better he added once with you is like twice with anybody else you do say sweet things she told him so at least he was a successful hypocrite she didnt seem particularly put out with him for not rising to the occasion again he had gray in his beard so how surprising was it that once sufficed for him marcatrude asked will you spend the night with me was that fondness or did she aim to steal what she could while he slept i will he said but in the morning if anything of mine is missing i will make you unhappy i know how to do that too do you believe me if she were a man he would have insulted her by being so blunt but a man even one who wasnt a mammothherder himself could speak as he pleased to a bizogot woman marcatrudes nod said the thought of thievery did cross her mind if i dont steal will you give me something to remember you by she asked maybe i already did he said and she made a wry face at him she might remember him very well indeed nine months from now but that wasnt what she meant and he knew it he went on i willif you dont i said that she told him and pulled more skins over both of them enough to keep them warm even though they were naked then she blew out the lamp the darkness that had been hovering at the top of the tent and near the edges spread its wings and swooped he couldnt recall the last time he actually slept with a woman marcatrudes smooth warmth proved a bigger distraction than he expected and in that darkness absolute she could have been anyone anyone at all even his arms tightened around her she laughed deep in her throat maybe shed had that in mind too after the second round they both fell asleep almost at once hamnet woke up sometime in the night marcatrudes arm lay on his shoulder her legs were twined with his she murmured when he disentangled them but didnt really rouse he lay awake a long time himself when morning came he checked carefully but found himself unplundered he gave her a silverpiece with sigvat iis beaky profile on it bizogots didnt mint coins but they used the ones they got in trade from lands farther south i thank you she said may your travels farewell i will remember you and i you hamnet thyssen told the truth as he usually did he joined with women seldom enough these days to make each of them stand out in his mind when the travelers rode north gudrid guided her horse next to hamnets he didnt want her attentions when he tried to steer away from her though she rode after him well she said a certain malicious relish in her voice well what he asked if she got it out of her system maybe she would go away and leave him alone how was it touching her with one hand and holding your nose with the other he looked at her he looked through her better than attar of roses he said if she slapped him this time he intended to deck her if jesper fletti didnt like it hamnet intended to deck him too or do whatever else he needed to do but gudrid only laughed who would have thought youd turn into a liar she said and rode off count hamnet stared after her she wasnt altogether wrong and yet even if he wasnt immune to her he knew she was poisonous and the bizogot girl wasnt in that sense hed told gudrid nothing but the truth as they drew closer to the glacier they found theyd outrun spring sooner or later the warm winds from the south would make it up to the very edge of the ice a new meltwater lake was forming there where the glacier retreated grass and shrubs and flowers would burst forth from the ground for a few weeks streams would melt midges and mites and mosquitoes would buzz and breed with desperate urgency and when the season ended the glacier would have moved a few feet farther north than it had been the year before but spring wasnt here yet by the look of the ground and the feel of the air it wouldnt get here any time soon either thick gray clouds blowing down from the north hid the sun snow lay on every northfacing slope and on some ground that didnt face north the hares that dug through the snow for dead grass from the last brief summer stayed white though their cousins farther south were going brown the foxes that hunted them were also white wolves remained gray the travelers saw a small pack of dire wolves trotting along in search of anything they could eat from rabbits to musk oxen the wolves saw them too or scented them and came over for a closer look unlike the pack the travelers had met earlier these wolves seemed to decide right away that they were more trouble than they were worthor maybe these wolves werent so hungry and didnt need to press an attack after shadowing the travelers for a while the dire wolves loped off across the frozen plain i am not sorry to see them go the miserable skulking things jesper fletti said neither am i ulric skakki said if they had lawyers instead of teeth theyd be as bad as people jesper gave him a puzzled look whats that supposed to mean what it says i commonly say what i mean dont you ulric was the picture of innocence jesper fletti scratched his head but decided to let it drop do you enjoy baiting him hamnet thyssen asked some ulric answered hes not as much fun as you are because he hasnt got the brains to shoot back id think that would make him more fun not less count hamnet said no no no ulric skakki shook his head no sport to it i see hamnet bowed in the saddle so glad to provide you with amusement if you ever get bored with me you can always pull the wings and legs off flies he slapped at himself enough of them at this season of the year too many in fact ulric slapped too way too bloody many if anyone wants to knowwhat i think they dont just take pain either the way jesper doesthey give it out too that makes it a fair fight if you want to be on the receiving end you can always quarrel with dear gudrid hamnet said no thanks ulric answered id be the unarmed one there his shiver had nothing to do with the chilly weather meaning no disrespect your grace but i dont know what you saw in her well i know what you saw shes a finelooking woman even now but i dont know how you put up with her as long as you did everything was fineeverything was wonderfultill all of a sudden it wasnt that was as much as hamnet thyssen had said about the downfall of his marriage since gudrid left him he scowled at ulric skakki wondering how the other man tricked the words out of him ulric stared back blandly as if to say he had nothing to do with it and listening to himself hamnet thyssen realized hed been a fool to believe that then and was a bigger fool if he still believed it now things couldnt have been all right between him and gudrid even if he failed to notice anything wrong a happy spouse didnt start running around for no reason at allwhich could only mean gudrid hadnt been happy long before he realized she wasnt how many lovers did she have that he never suspected maybe things would have been different if shed had a child or two in the first few years they were married well things certainly would have been different if she had maybe they would have been better hed never know now off in the distance a bull mammoth wandered by itself the bad bulls were probably the most dangerous animals on the frozen steppe they were fierce and clever and swift and strong and very hard to kill ulric skakki kept looking from the woolly mammoth to hamnet and back again that almost made hamnet laugh he was strong and swift and could be fierce he dared hope he was hard to kill clever hadnt he just proved himself a fool in his own eyes didnt a teratorn a bird that needed no more in the way of brains than what was required to sneak up on a corpse have wits sharper than his so it seemed to him anyhow may i ask you something else your grace ulric said harshly hamnet thyssen nodded go ahead do you know why your ah formerly beloved took it into her head to come up here by god i dont hamnet exploded because she does what she pleases when she pleases and worries about it later if she ever worries about it at all any other questions why didnt you kill her you must have had your chances the answer to that seemed much too clear because im a fool soon now trasamund said soon we enter the grazing grounds of the three tusk bizogots the grandest land god ever made he sat up straight on his horse and puffed out his chest he felt grand himself and he wanted the world to know he felt grand hamnet thyssen on the other hand had to work to hold his face straight he didnt know exactly where the grandest land god ever made lay but he thought it had to be somewhere south of the raumsdalian empire the empire was far enough south for farming to be possible through most of it though its northern reaches lay beyond the limits of agriculture its strength lay less in its soil than in its people they were tested by adversityand by raids from the bizogots from farther north still were the rest of the raumsdalians here thinking the same thing count hamnet didnt see how they could think anything else yet not a one of them not even jesper fletti not even gudrid said a word for one thing whether this was gods country or not it wasnt theirs they needed help from the bizogots if they were to keep on pushing north up through the gap for another for another whether this was gods country or not spring did eventually reach it warmwell warmerbreezes blew up from the south driving back the clouds and mist and spatters of snow and sleet that had dogged the travelers for so long the sun shone from a blue sky if the blue was watery if the sun didnt climb as high above the southern horizon as it did even down in nidaros those were details when the clouds receded when the mist retreated when the sun shone the travelers got their first clear look at something they never would have seen if they stayed down in the empire the glacier that wall of ice to the north might have been a mountain range it stood as tall as many mountains did it reach a mile up into the sky two miles three hamnet thyssen couldnt say here and there storms blew dust and dirt over it so that from a distance it looked as if it might be made of rock and soil but then the sun glanced off a bare patch and that coruscating flash proved the glacier could only be the glacier a chill and awful majesty clung to it what must it be like ulric skakki murmured to always look over your shoulder and seethat how do you get used to it dont you think its going to fall on you i would count flamnets shiver had nothing to do with the weather which was well better than it had been one enormous difference between the glacier and ordinary mountains was that the latter ascended gradually through uplands and foothills to the peaks at the heart of the range the glacier by contrast rose sheer which made those frozen cliffs seem even taller than they were a herd of woolly mammoths no doubt belonging to the three tusk clan ambled along over the snowy ground in the middle distance by any ordinary standard mammoths were enormous gigantic titanicmammoth against the glacier ordinary standards failed against the glacier those mammoths seemed like nothing more than what ulric skakki had called them farther southfleas on the hide of a whitecoated world hamnet thyssen eyed trasamund with sudden new respect the bizogot jarl hadnt said the land over which his clan wandered was the best or the most fertile god ever made he said it was the grandest looking north from the abruptly dwarfed mammoths to the glacier hamnet thyssen decided he might be right after all vii trasamund did not know where in the large territory they roamed the rest of the three tusk clan would be it depends on the beasts he said it depends on the hunting it depends on the weather later in the year they may go some way up the gapbut not i think so soon hamnet thyssen looked ahead toward the glacier he imagined it not just in front of him but to either side the thought was not comfortablewas anything but comfortable in fact wouldnt he feel like a bug between two hands waiting for them to slap shut and smash it between them the rational part of his mind insisted that couldnt happen in spite of the rational part he sent apprehensive glances northward then he had a new thought what would it be like with the glacier not just to either side of him but behind him trasamund had seen that so had ulric skakki the mere idea made hamnet dizzy wouldnt he think the whole world had turned upside down while he was looking at the glacier eyvind torfinn was peering east eyvind pointed isnt that a horseman he asked everyones head swung that way count hamnet was angry at himself for letting the scholar spot something before he did himself earl eyvind would be worth his weight in gold when and if they found the golden shrine till then the learned noble was so much excess baggage so hamnet had thought anyway by the chagrin on trasamunds face he was having similar thoughts or would they be so similar hamnet hadnt slept with gudrid since she married eyvind torfinn trasamund had and hardly bothered hiding it if eyvind noticed he didnt let on but maybe it was more a case of not letting on than of not noticing if it was did he contemplate vengeance on trasamund what kind of vengeance could an overeducated raumsdalian earl take against a bizogot jarl here on the frozen plain hamnet thyssen couldnt think of any that didnt have to mean eyvind torfinn couldnt though whatever earl eyvind might be he was no fool before the riderfor a rider he certainly wascame much closer trasamund said i know him thats gelimer he is of my clan how can you tell audun gilli asked by some sorcery no no by his size by the way he sits his horse trasamund answered shaking his head do you not know your brother at some distance gelimer is my brother every man of the three tusk clan is my brother did that make every woman in the clan his sister hamnet shook his head not in that sensebizogots could marry within their own clan even if they often didnt and as hed seen they werent shy about sporting with women from their own clan either who comes to the land of the three tusk clan gelimer shouted when he came within hailing distance he was alone and facing many strangers but seemed fearless after a moment count hamnet shook his head gelimer wasnt so much fearless as righteous he seemed certain he had every moral right to demand answers from anyone he found on the land his clan roamed hail gelimer your jarl has returned from the lands of the south trasamund shouted back he urged his horse out a few paces do you not know me you had better know me his tone warned by god i do your ferocity the other bizogot warned these folk with you are friends and guests then they are trasamund said they will go north into the gap with me they will go north beyond the gap beyond the glacier with me they will see where god draws in his breath to blow it out for a moment hamnet took that as no more than a figure of speech then he thought of the golden shrine somewhere out there beyond the glacier if god dwelt anywhere on earth wouldnt he dwell in or somewhere near the golden shrine no hamnet was never a particularly pious man but every days travel to the north took him farther from the mundane world of the raumsdalian empire and deeper into the land of legend and myth how could he afford to disbelieve considering where he was bound other thoughts ruled gelimer s mind looking over the southerners he said only one woman for so many men trasamund laughed ulric skakki smiled a small tight ironic smile eyvind torfinn stiffened slightly and gudrid stiffened more than slightly seeing that hamnet thyssen thoughtfully pursed his lips he hadnt thought gudrid understood the bizogot language maybepretty plainly in facthe was wrong shes not a common woman trasamund said she belongs to the old shaman here he pointed toward earl eyvind he was polite enough not to throw gudrids infidelities with him into eyvinds face his language had no real word for scholar shaman came closer than any other gelimer shrugged be it so then he saidit wasnt his worry but what is she doing here the jarl laughed again what why whatever she wants to of course he might not have known gudrid for long but he grasped her essence he went on where is the encampment is all well with the clan we are that way about two days ride gelimer pointed back over his shoulder toward the east and yes all is well enough we skirmished with the white foxes two months past when we found them hunting west of the third frostheave he told that story in some detail hamnet listened with half an ear a border squabble between two bands of mammothherders interested him about as much as a quarrel between two coachmakers down in nidaros would have interested trasamund to the jarl though this was meat and drinkliterally he plied gelimer with questions and finally grunted in satisfaction you did well you all did well he rumbled the white foxes will respect that which is right that which is true from here on out they have a new jarlhis name is childebert gelimer said i dare say he wanted to see what he could get away with especially with you not here to lead our clan you showed him by god trasamund said we are bizogots better we are bizogots of the three tusk clan do we need a jarl to tell us we let no one infringe on our rights we do not we did not gelimer said they wont trouble us that way again any time soon which is as it should be trasamund sketched a salutenot really to gelimer hamnet thyssen judged but to the three tusk clan as a whole the jarl went on guide us back to the tents of the clan we have things to do before faring north again just as you say so shall it be gelimer replied of course trasamund said complacently sigvat ii emperor of raumsdalia could have sounded no more certain the encampment of the three tusk clan was a bizogot encampment hamnet thyssen was long familiar with them even if he werent the journey up across the frozen steppe would have taught him as much as he needed to know mammothhide tents sprouted here and there scattered higgledypiggledy across the ground horses were tied nearby by raumsdalian standards bizogot horses were shortlegged and stocky and shaggy they needed to be to get through the long hard winters in these parts some of them would wander with the clans musk oxen during the winter to forage on whatever they could dig up others would winter in and near the tents feeding on hay the bizogots harvested while the weather was good and on the frozen grasses the nomads found beneath the snow so it went in good winters anyway when times were not so good the bizogots ate horse and rebuilt their herds as they could for the moment the camp boiled with excitement the nomads would not eat horse any time soon theyd killed a cow mammoth not long before trasamund and the raumsdalians rode up and were butchering the mountain of meat they would roast and boil what they could and eat it on the spot the rest would be cut into thin strips and salted and dried in the sun and the wind hamnet thyssen eyed ulric skakki heres to gluttony he said are you up for it ill try my best ulric answered but any civilized man will explode if he tries to keep up with the bizogots theyre better at stuffing themselves than we are theyre better at doing without than we are too hamnet said on average i suppose its about the same but they swing further in both directions than we do even the arrival of their jarl even the arrival of strangers from the south distracted the nomads only a little they greeted trasamund with bloody handclasps he took it in good part he knew meat mattered more than he did women scraped fat from the back of the mammoth hide some of them used iron knives that had come north in trade others flint tools that might have been as old as time or might have been made that morning the bizogots never had as much iron as they wanted and eked it out with stone tools dogs danced and begged by the edge of the hide every so often a woman would throw some scraps their way the dogs yelped and snapped at the food and at one another the women laughed at the sport they carefully saved the rest of the fat some of it would get cooked in the feast the rest would be pounded with lean mammoth meat and berries to make cakes that would keep for a long time and would feed a traveling man once the hide had not a scrap of fat or flesh clinging to it the women rubbed it with a strongsmelling mix audun gilli s nose wrinkled whats that stuff he asked piss and salt to cure the hide count hamnet answered oh the wizard looked unhappy why dont they use tanbark the way we do both hamnet and ulric laughed at him think about it ulric said audun did oh he said again this time in a small voice tanbark required oaks and all the oaks grew well south of the tree line what is the news trasamund asked who has died who still lives who is born who is well who is sick or hurt he had a lot of catching up to do and was trying to do it all at once in the empire that would have been impossible the three tusk clan was small enough to give him a fighting chance who are these mouths up from the south a bizogot asked him that was how the raumsdalians seemed to the localspeople who had to be fed as long as they were here hamnet thyssen wondered how he liked being called a mouth not very well he decided trasamund named names which would mean little to a clansman he called most of the raumsdalians warriors styling audun gilli and eyvind torfinn as shamans the three tusk shaman easily identifiable by the same kind of fringed and embroidered costume as witigis had worn eyed them with interested speculation what about the woman another bizogot called actually he said what about the gap that made hamnet look north toward the gap between the two great sheets of ice that had once been one this time gudrid didnt show any signs of understanding is she just yours or can we all have her still another mammothherder asked a woman gave him an elbow in the ribs was she his wife or just jealous of competition she is the old shamans woman trasamund answered count hamnet glanced over to see how eyvind torfinn liked hearing that again and again by the fixed smile on his face he didnt like it much trasamund went on they are all our guests they are not to be stolen from ha ulric skakki said hamnet thyssen nodded guestfriendship would keep the raumsdalians persons safe while they stayed with the three tusk clan their personal property no having so little themselves bizogots were born thieves my guests will you feast with my folk trasamund said we will answered hamnet ulric and eyvind the only three raumsdalians who spoke any useful amount of the bizogot language we thank you after the raumsdalians dismounted bizogot youths led their horses off to the line where those belonging to the mammothherders were tied the shaman made a beeline for audun gilli and spoke to him in the bizogot tongue his eyebrows leaped a woman he exclaimed in raumsdalian i thought you could tell the difference before they talked hamnet thyssen said dryly shes got no beard and thats a pretty good hint the shaman turned to him you speak your language and you speak ours will you interpret for me if i can hamnet answered if you speak of secret things i will not know your words for them and i may not know ours either i am no spellcaster she looked at him you think not do you while he was wondering what to make of that she went on ask his name for me please and tell him i am liv he is audun gilli hamnet said he translated for the wizard tell her i am glad to meet her audun said tell her i hope we can learn things from each other i hope the same liv eyed hamnet again and who are you he gave her his name she shook her head with poorly hidden impatience i did not ask you for that i ask who you were it is not the same thing hamnet thyssen scratched his head he wondered if the shaman for trasamunds clan was slightly daft or more than slightly i am a soldier a hunter a loyal follower of my emperor did she know what an emperor was think of him as a jarl ruling many clans yes yes liv brushed the explanation aside she looked at him again she didnt just look at himshe looked into him with the same disconcerting directness a raumsdalian wizard might have shown lie tried to look away he had the feeling she was seeing more than he wanted her to but those cornflowerblue eyes would not release his until all at once they did he took a deep breath and then another one facing up to her felt like running a long way with a heavy pack on his back but all she said was you are not a happy man no hamnet agreed i am not she didnt need to be sorcerer or shaman to know that anyone who spoke with him for a little while realized as much he waited for her to ask him why not but she found a different question instead inquiring why did you come to the bizogot country you will know of the golden shrine he didnt quite make it a question he didnt quite not make it a question either almost everyone on both sides of the border agreed that raumsdalians and bizogots worshiped the same god everyone on both sides of the border agreed they did not always worship him the same way but liv nodded oh yes what of it i came to seek it along with your jarl oh if he thought that would impress her he was disappointed later he found that very little impressed her and that she admitted to even less for now she looked into him again he scowled he didnt like it even if it was somehow not the violation it could have been after a bit she asked what do you look to find there i dont know hamnet thyssen frowned he hadnt worried about that finding the ageslost golden shrine seemed worry enough truth knowledge happiness god yes audun gilli said softly when hamnet remembered to translate that for him maybe liv said yes maybe but why do you think these things are there where else would they be hamnet burst out liv didnt answer not in words instead she smiled hamnet thyssen gave back a pace and he was not a man in the habit of retreating from anything or anyone sober liv was another bizogotstranger than most but apart from that nothing out of the ordinary when she smiled her whole face changed it was as if the sun came out from behind the clouds and hardly less dazzling for a heartbeat altogether in spite of himself he fell in love angrily he turned away from her wizards and shamans had their tricks yes try as he would he couldnt imagine one more monstrously unfair than that he saw he was not the only one turning away audun gilli couldnt face her either she has more strength than she knows the wizard whispered she has more strength than she even dreams of what such a one would be in raumsdalia what would she be but gudrid hamnet thyssen snarled audun flinched as if hamnet had hit him hamnet didnt care he would rather have hit liv no nothing could be crueler than reminding him of love little by little hamnet thyssens temper eased filling his belly helped even if he wouldnt have filled it on mammoth meat mushrooms fried in muskox butter and berries back in the empire getting somewhere close to drunk helped too although he would have used beer or ale or mead or even wine to do the job farther south if smetyn was what the bizogots had count hamnet would drink it he kept a wary eye on liv despite his full belly and muzzy head she didnt do anything especially noteworthy she ate she drank she talked with her fellow clansmen and women and with some of the raumsdalians who could use her language she left hamnet alone that suited him fine or better than fine he wanted to ask trasamund how long it would be before they fared north he wanted to yes but the newly returned jarl was otherwise occupied trasamund ate enough for three hungry raumsdalians and drank enough for five when he went off to the tent the bizogots had run up for him he went with three big blond women from the clan mammoth hide might be thick enough to keep out cold but it couldnt keep in the moans and sighs that came from that tent hes been away from his own people a long time ulric skakki remarked well so he has hamnet said by the sound of things hes making some more people in there right nowor trying his hardest anyhow his hardest indeed ulric murmured and hamnet swallowed wrong with a swig of fermented mammoth milk ulric had to pound him on the back to get him to stop choking youre a demon you are hamnet wheezed ulric skakki batted his not very long not very alluring eyelashes you say the sweetest things my dear count hamnet almostalmostsent another swallow down the wrong pipe gudrid was left all alone worseshe was left with eyvind torfinn trasamund at least for the time being had forgot all about her now that he was back in the three tusk clan he preferred his own women that had to be a bitter pill for gudrid to swallow youre not indispensable after all my not so dear hamnet thought yes the only one who cares right now is your husband such a comedown catching his eye on her gudrid snapped out something he was too far away and too drunk to make out he smiled at her which didnt make her look any happier eyvind said something to her probably doing his best to calm her down she snapped at him too he drew back a wounded look on his usually placid features if god had given her a sabertooths fangs chances were she would have bitten his head off in truth not just as a figure of speech what is the trouble liv asked eyvind somehow hamnet heard her clearly even though gudrid s words were just noise to him maybe that had to do with her being a shaman maybe it had to do with how much hed poured down drunks had selective hearing and drunk he was the raumsdalian noble only shrugged my wife is out of sorts he answered well so she was but did he know why did he know how regularly gudrid cuckolded him what would he do when he found out anything that was an interesting question count hamnet was glad it wasnt his worry or wouldnt have been if he didnt worry about gudrid all the time all things considered id rather share a tent with you he told ulric skakki when the two of them snuggled under skins for the night what me instead of three pretty girls who aim to please i didnt know your tastes ran in that direction my dear ulric batted his eyelashes again it made him look ridiculous which was bound to be what he had in mind no count hamnets ears heated his tastes didnt run in that direction and ulric did know it i was thinking of he didnt even want to say her name of liv ulric skakki seemed bound and determined to be as difficult as he could id like her better if she bathed but the bizogots mostly dont up here i mostly dont either id like me better if i did too he held his nose hamnet thyssen wouldnt have minded a bath himself but he missed bathing less than he thought he would when he set out from nidaros he didnt smell any worse than the people around him which was all that really mattered as for liv shes strange of course shes strange shes a shaman and she wouldnt be if she werent ulric paused to work out whether that really said what he wanted it to deciding it did he went on doesnt mean shes not pretty she has a nice smile dont you think i didnt notice hamnet didnt like to lie but telling ulric skakki how much he noticed livs smile would only leave him open for more ribbing instead he said i wasnt really thinking of her anyway that was true enough who then ulric didnt need long to answer his own question gudrid by god you dont want to think about her do you i wouldnt if i were you no i dont want to hamnet answered but what you want to do and what you end up doing arent always the same beast i always do what i want ulric skakki said which had to be a bigger lie than the one hamnet told him he added what i want to do now is go to sleep good night he blew out the lamp the smell of hot butter filled the tent in moments ulric was snoring he did what he wanted then anyhow hamnet thyssen lay awake broodingbut not very long people outside the tent were shouting at each other the racket pried hamnets eyes open one of the people shouting was jesper fletti the other gelimer hamnet understood both sides of the quarrel yawning he needed a moment to realize neither of them was likely to keep your hands off me you barbarous hound jesper yelled what do you think youre doing fool of an outlander gelimer shouted back hamnets breath smoked when he sat up he pulled on his boots not far away ulric was doing the same thing quirking up an eyebrow ulric said maybe we ought to let them kill each other jespers no great loss if he hurts gelimer the bizogots will want to murder all of us hamnet answered i suppose youre right what a pity ulric skakki stood up so did hamnet the shouting outside did nothing to improve the headache he discovered on waking neither one of them understands the others language he pointed out just as well ulric said if they knew what they were calling each other they would have gone for their knives long since count hamnet hadnt thought of that we really ought to calm them down if we can he said youre no fun ulric told him but they left the mammothhide tent together whats going on here hamnet said first in raumsdalian then in the bizogot tongue jesper fletti and gelimer gave up shouting at each other instead they both shouted at him that didnt do his head any good this lemmingbrained idiot keeps wanting to bother the jarl gelimer said doesnt he know trasamunds in his tent screwing like theres no tomorrow at the same time jesper fletti said this fleabitten savage wont let the lady gudrid talk to trasamund oh hamnet thyssens head pounded anew for an altogether different reason oh for gods sake ulric skakki said in about the same tone of voice hamnet stepped between gelimer and jesper he set both hands on jespers shoulders the imperial guardsman bristled at the liberty but grudgingly allowed it from a raumsdalian noble go back to gudrid hamnet said tell her she cant see trasamund now tell her she cant see him now even if shes seen every single inch of him before tell her it doesnt matter if shes a noblewoman tell her shes a guest among the bizogots and what they say goes tell her that if she causes any more trouble shes liable to get you killed and shes liable to get herself killed tell her that if she causes any more trouble that involves waking people up the bizogots may not be the ones who kill heror you ulric skakki added and who will try to do this jesper asked softly setting a hand on the hilt of his sword you and who else im the who else hamnet said jesper fletti looked horrified hamnet went on tell gudrid she cant get away with playing the spoiled brat up here she wont hear that from me no matter how true it is maybe shell listen to you or maybe she wont listen to anybody half the time she doesnt jesper fletti looked from him to ulric to gelimer abruptly the guardsman spun on his heel and stalked away he ducked into a tent count hamnet heard his voice from inside but couldnt make out what he said then gudrid let out a screech like a lion impaled on a woolly rhinos horn she stormed out of the tent she didnt stop when she saw hamnet but she did slow down he looked around to make sure he still had ulric skakki at his back ulric might have borrowed some magic from audun gilli for hed just vanished count hamnet sighed up to him was it well if it was it was why cant i see trasamund gudrid demanded because hes still with the women from his clan hamnet answered cant you figure that out for yourself or are you just being difficult for the sake of being difficult do you think i care about that yes i think you care about it very much but i dont think you understand bizogots as well as you think you do this isnt your land youre a guest here good guests have all the privileges of clan membersand more besides because theyre forgiven if theyre ignorant and clansmen and women arent if they go past ignorant though if they get to annoying god help them in that case because no one else will he wished ulric skakki hadnt ducked out on him if ulric intoned something solemn like hes right it might help make gudrid believe him or maybe nothing would do that trasamund will listen to me gudrid said with her usual assurance why because youre special do you think youre any more special than any of the women hes with now hamnet asked before gudrid could answer or even nod he went on do you think he thinks youre more special than any of them if you do youre fooling yourself even worse than usual by god you are a hateful man gudrid said anyone who tells you anything you dont want to hear is a hateful man hamnet answered and anybody who tells you anything true you dont want to hear is even more hateful so i suppose i qualify yes he bowed gudrid snarled something foul he bowed again as if at a compliment gudrid whirled and stormed off count hamnet had no idea if hed convinced her if he hadnt he wouldnt be sorry she would but she didnt bother trasamund for that her former husband was duly grateful because whether gudrid did or not he knew he hadnt been joking or even exaggerating the danger sometimes you measured progress not by what people did but by what they didnt do as far as hamnet thyssen was concerned this was one of those times in due course trasamund emerged from his tent he looked indecently pleased with himselfthat struck hamnet as the right word sure enough gudrid went right on staying away from him she probably thought she was punishing him hamnet was convinced he either didnt notice she was avoiding him or thought it was funny if he did as long as neither of them actually did anything though that was all right hamnet had no qualms about approaching trasamund when do you plan on traveling north again your ferocity he asked ive been going into gaps all night long the jarl threw back his head and laughed now you want me to worry about another one after a dutiful grin hamnet said you were the one who came down to nidaros you will know best how important you think this journey is the farther north we go the shorter the time the weather will stay goodor even tolerable i am not a child you are not my mother you do not need to tell me things a mother would tell a foolish little boy trasamund said this is my clan and i have been away for a long time i have a lot of things i need to set straight before we fare forth again is that what you were doing last night count hamnet murmured trasamund laughed again by god raumsdalian youve never seen anything straighter and hard it was hard as that jespers head had gelimer already talked with him or had he come to his own conclusions about jesper fletti while traveling north with him hamnet wouldnt have been surprised he thought the guards officer on the rockheaded side too but no matter what hamnet thought about jesper that wasnt the point if we know when were leaving we can be ready on the day he persisted if we dont have a day well just waste time sending a sour stare his way the jarl said youre as stubborn as that woman you used to sleep with arent you almost hamnet answered its one of the few things we have in common ha thats what you think trasamund said oh really of itself hamnet thyssens hand slid toward his swordhilt if the bizogot thought he would stand there and let himself be insulted that was the last mistake trasamund would ever make hamnet had stopped caring whether he lived or died after gudrid left him honor was a different story he would uphold his own even knowing the three tusk clansmen would slay him after he killed their jarl but trasamund answered yes by god youre both annoying and youre both here count hamnet relaxed he even smiled a crooked smile the truth by the very nature of things couldnt be an insult he couldnt very well deny he and gudrid were both annoying he couldnt deny they were both here either however much he wished gudrid werent then one corner of his mouth turned down did trasamund think gudrid was a nuisance when they were both in nidaros he chuckled under his breath what was that phrase the barristers used an attractive nuisance that was it chances were that summed up just what the bizogot thought of her i am here yes hamnet thyssen agreed but i didnt come north to be here your ferocity i came north to pass through the gap and go beyond the glacier i thought you came north for the same reason trasamund turned red he took a deep breath but before he could start roaring at count hamnet someone behind the raumsdalian noble said he is right you know your ferocity that wasnt ulric skakki ulric was still nowhere to be seen it was liv the three tusk shaman trasamund glared at her but he didnt roar that spoke volumes about how well respected she was this is none of your business the jarl growled oh but it is liv shook her head her golden hair flipped back and forth so did the amber pendants that dangled from her earlobes hamnet eyed those with a certain queasy fascination raumsdalian women wore earrings that clipped to their ears the bizogots bored holes in their earlobes through which to hang their ornaments they are barbarians he thought how is it your affair how trasamund demanded we will go north when decide we will go north and when we do you will stay with the clan you will stay among the tents is that plain enough more than plain enough your ferocity liv was the picture of politeness but she shook her head again all the same even some of the fringes on her shoulders and above her breasts moved when she did it is more than plain enough but it is wrong whaaat trasamund stretched the word out so he could pack the most possible scorn into it what do you mean i mean what i say your ferocity i commonly do i will not stay with the clan i will not stay among the tents i will go beyond the glacier with you by god i will livs face shone in the morning sun like a lamp like a torch like a bonfire by god i said and by god i also meant do you not travel to the golden shrine if i cannot learn of god there where in all the world will i you cant do that trasamund said hamnet thyssen had rarely seen him taken aback he did now the jarl looked as if someone had landed a solid punch on the point of his chin i can liv said i will i must i hardly slept in the night your ferocity i took divinations instead trasamund had hardly slept either but he wasnt taking divinations liv went on the answer was always the same this is meant to be god wills it trasamund looked as if he wanted to say something unkind about god whatever he wanted to do he didnt do it not even a bizogot jarl dared blaspheme right out loud you never could tell if god was listening or what he would do if he was chances are you read the signs wrong he said instead that put the blame on liv not god she shook her head i did not your ferocity shall i do it over for you then you will see for yourself and can have no possible doubt let me get the knucklebones and i will ask the question aloud before i cast them never mind trasamund said quickly for a moment that surprised hamnet thyssen but then he understood if the jarl did see for himself he couldnt possibly argue and he plainly didnt believe liv was making up what she claimed he tried a different tack having another woman along will cause nothing but trouble how can i possibly cause more trouble than the woman who is already traveling with you liv asked count hamnet snorted he didnt intend to it was startled out of him trasamund sent him a baleful stare ail the same liv eyed the jarl well you are being impossible trasamund grumbled i am following the will of god the shaman said can you tell me the same i can tell you trasamund broke off what could he tell her that the land beyond the glacier was no place for a woman then what of gudrid scowling trasamund said i can tell you that you dont fight fair when i fight i dont fight to be fair i fight to win liv said trasamund turned away shed won this time viii trasamund was still muttering into his beard when the travelers rode north four days later liv perched on a dun gelding paid no attention to him she rode with audun gilli and hamnet thyssen a lot of the time she wanted to talk shop with the raumsdalian wizard that left hamnet as interpreter and left him fuming quietly hed warned them he didnt know how to translate magical terms very well either way but they both blamed him when they couldnt make themselves clear he tried talking with liv about other things besides sorcery or shamanry or whatever the right name for it was to him the scenery was magnificentthe two great cliffs of ice one to the northwest the other to the northeast once theyd joined together and crushed all the north under their unimaginable bulk they were still magnificent still awesome still terrifying to count hamnet to liv they were part of the landscape shed seen every day of her life barring fog or rain or blizzard she took them as much for granted as anyone could its only the glacier no hamnet thyssen shook his head for me there is no only the bizogot woman laughed this is very foolish she said it is always here it will always be here why get excited about it if it will always be here why is the gap open now when it was closed whenever hamnet said the name in the bizogot language he felt he was being obscene but liv took it in stride seeing as much he went on why is there a gap between the eastern glacier and the western at all there didnt used to be she frowned thoughtfully these are good questions i have no answers for them maybe we will find the answers at the golden shrine maybe hamnet thyssen started to ask her something else before he could she asked audun gilli a question hamnet had to translate as best he could having fun ulric skakki asked him a while later how did you guess count hamnet answered so sourly that ulric laughed want to take over for me hamnet asked you speak both languages and youll probably have more luck with the technical terms than i am if its all the same to you id rather pass ulric said it wasnt all the same to hamnet but he couldnt do anything about it ulric skakki gave an extravagant wave of the hand you never get tired of this scenery do you you do if youre a bizogot hamnet answered its only the glacier liv had said well im bloody well not thank god ulric skakki said ive got plenty of things wrong with me but that isnt one of them only then did he eye liv she doesnt speak raumsdalian does she no of course not you wouldnt be translating if she did no but dont forget shes a shaman hamnet said she may not need to understand what you say to understand what you mean now theres a cheery thought ulric glanced at liv again she wasnt paying any attention to him but keeping flies off her horse with a mammothhair whisk he looked relieved in a lower voice he said she wouldnt be bad if she cleaned herself up that was true of a lot of bizogot women hamnet thyssen shrugged it worked out the other way around the bizogots never got clean people who came among them got dirty then his own thoughts went in a different direction whats it like passing through the gap where its narrowest its like being born again ulric answered seriously that startled count hamnet who hadnt thought the muchtraveled adventurer had room in him for figures of speech it really is ulric insisted you come out on the other side and everything is different well lots of things are different anyhow and besides going through yes tell me about that hamnet said ulric skakki shook his head i cant there are no words youll see for yourself before too long and you wont be able to tell anybody else about it either its like being in love what the hamnet thyssen pulled savagely at his horses reins jerking the animal away from ulric skakkiand incidentally away from audun gilli and liv ulric started to go after him then saw the black scowl on his face and forbore what did you say to him hamnet heard liv ask beats me ulric shrugged an elaborate shrug can you explain about the law of contagion in the bizogot language audun asked i doubt it ulric said i cant even explain the law of contagion in raumsdalian he rode off whistling audun muttered under his breath whatever he said it didnt change ulric skakki into a lemming on the spot hamnet thought that was too bad he rode by himself ulric rode by himself so did trasamund so did eyvind torfinn and so did gudrid audun gilli and liv rode together but they couldnt talk to each other the knot of raumsdalian guardsmen followed gudrid but far enough away to keep her from screaming at them were a happy bunch hamnet thought a teratorn circled high above them with the air blowing down off the glacier the way it did what were the wind currents like for birds here the huge scavenger had no trouble staying airborne anyhow audun gilli watched the great bird soar for a while then he asked liv do you suppose its an omen hamnet thyssen had no trouble understanding him the shaman however spoke no raumsdalian what are you talking about she asked in her own tonguewhich audun couldnt follow the wizard threw up his hands in frustration then after casting a glance of appeal that count hamnet stonily ignored audun pointed up into the sky at the teratorn liv pointed at it too they agreed on that muchand on no more audun tried to use gestures to explain what he meant they didnt seem to mean anything to liv to no one in particular ulric skakki said wed better find the golden shrine and wed better find it soon we arent fit to have anything to do with one another unless we find it unlike the wizard and the shaman he spoke the bizogot language and raumsdalian and put his plaintive comment into both languages that is well said eyvind torfinn said first in one tongue and then in the other yes true enough trasamund used his own language first then unbent enough to say the same thing in raumsdalian several travelers eyed hamnet thyssen he realized he was the other one who knew both the empires language and the bizogots liv had only the nomads tongue gudrid might understand some of that but she showed no signs of speaking it while audun and the guardsmen knew only raumsdalian count hamnet didnt want to say anything he would rather have ridden along stewing in his own juices but those stares wore him down faster than he thought they would yes yes he said grudgingly first in one tongue then in the other thank you audun gilli said maybe to him maybe to ulric skakki maybe to all the men who could use both languages the wizard added will someone please translate for me at almost the same time liv said will someone please tell me what the southern wizard is trying to say about the teratorn ill do it hamnet said heaving a sigh ulric skakki raised an eyebrow in surprise hamnet caught his eye with malice aforethought he went on better to translate than never ulric flinched so did audun gilli what did you tell them liv asked after a moments thought hamnet was able to duplicate the pun in her language the bizogots tongue and raumsdalian werent close enough to let wordplay go back and forth between them all the time or even very often he felt a certain somber pride at managing here by the look on livs face she would have been just as well pleased if he hadnt or he thought so anyhow till she winked at him that startled him into a smile of his own and now about the teratorn she prompted will you tell her what i meant audun gilli asked at the same time i can translate as long as you dont both talk at once count hamnet told each of them in turn he glanced up toward the teratorn but it had flown away even so he explained what the wizard said liv considered that then replied if it was an omen if it was a shadow over us it is gone now and we go forward without it hamnet thyssen found himself nodding out on the frozen plain hamnet thyssen had felt as if he and his companions were so many ants walking across a plate here between the riven halves of the glacier he had a different feeling and one even less pleasant those great cold cliffs might have been the sides of two crates and as the travelers went farther and farther north someonegod maybewas pushing the crates closer and closer together if god shoved once too often better not to think about that but the thought got harder to avoid as day followed day at its southern outlet the gap was more than fifty miles wide when the travelers rode into it they had the glacier on the horizon to either side of them but they could look back over their shoulders and see open land behind and while the glacier serrated the horizon to east and west there was plenty of sky above it with each days travel thoughsometimes with each hoursthe glacier grew higher and higher those sheer towering cliffs ate more and more of the sky days were shorter than they would have been otherwise for the sun needed extra time to climb above the glacier to the east and sank below the glacier to the west all too soon and with each days travel the ground got squashier and the bugs got worse meltwater poured from the ice on both sides of the glacier more and more as days lengthened pools and ponds and puddles creeks and rills and rivulets were everywhere midges and flies and mosquitoes mated madly their offspring rose in ravenous bloodthirsty hordes gudrid veiled herself in fine almost transparent cloth that meant she got bitten less often than the others it didnt mean she kept all the buzzing biters at bay by god now i know another reason why the bizogots breed such shaggy horses hamnet thyssen said smashing a fly on the back of his hand what do you mean ulric skakki asked the bites blotching his face made him look as if hed come down with some horrid disease well the longer their hair the better they do in the winters up here thats plain count hamnet said and ulric nodded the nobleman went on but the longer their hair the more trouble the bugs have getting at em too maybe thats another reason woolly mammoths are woolly too ulric said after a moments thought but who bred them they had to be here long before the bizogots started herding them theyre still closer to wild than tamed maybe god bred them hamnet said maybe he did ulric agreed it would give him something to do with his time anyway in another tone of voice he would have sounded blasphemous as things were he seemed to find the idea reasonable when he slapped a moment later he did sound blasphemous and so did hamnet thyssen when something that probably specialized in piercing mammoth hide bit him in the back of the neck he didnt get the bug which made his language fouler still finding dry ground to sleep on got harder and harder trasamund and liv had oiled mammoth hides to unroll beneath them as groundsheets the raumsdalians werent so lucky if youve been this way before you should have warned us it was a bog hamnet said to ulric in a low voice i couldnti didnt know ulric answered everything was nice and hard then he looked around to make sure trasamund and liv couldnt overhear you came through here in the winter hamnet thyssen asked what was it like cold ulric skakki said with feeling colder than well cold what didnt he say colder than gudrids heart hamnet wouldnt have been surprised does the glacier grow in the wintertime hamnet asked ulric nodded oh yes oh yes you can almost watch it happen the way the glacier goes forward when its cold you wonder how it ever goes back bad winters it does come forward and stay there for a while i know that hamnet said on balance though its been moving back more than forward otherwise the bizogots would be herding mammoths where nidaros stands you mean they dont ulric skakkis eyebrows arched in artfully simulated surprise and all this time i thought all this time i thought you were a chowderhead count hamnet said and here i see i was right your servant your grace ulric bowed in the saddle and few clammier places have i ever been than this ow hamnet thyssen mimed squashing him like a mosquito ulric skakki bowed again count hamnet muttered to himself for the next quarter of an hour in a way that was a measure of how bad ulrics pun was in another way it was a measure of how good hamnet forgot about the journey even forgot about gudrid for a little while he supposed that was good too when someone shook count hamnet awake in the middle of the night his first confused thought was that the northern sky had caught fire curtains and sheets of coruscating red and yellow and ghostly green danced there oh he realized muzzily the northern lights they showed themselves only rarely down in nidaros he saw them more often as he traveled through the bizogot country here in the gap hed come a long way north indeed and they burned more brightly than hed ever seen them before all the same he didnt think whoever was shaking him awake wanted him to enjoy their beauty the shifting multicolored light they shed let him see audun gilli crouched to one side of him and liv to the other that made him reach for his sword he didnt think theyd roused him to tell him they were running off with each other theyd better not be he thought that would infuriate him for any number of reasons what is it he asked first in raumsdalian then in the bizogots language needing to ask twice was one more inconvenience someone audun gilli whispered out there liv agreed pointing north and east hamnet peered in that direction he saw nothing who he said in a low voice how far away again he repeated himself so both audun and liv could understand we dont know who audun answered at the same time as liv said im not sure how far away but out there swearing under his breath count hamnet said well what do you know can you tell me if its a bizogot out there or is it a raumsdalian we dont know the wizard and the shaman said the same thing at the same time in two different languages then they did it again adding whoever it is its a magician that made hamnet thyssen wonder if the sword would do him any good he held on to it it was the only weapon he had handy and the familiar feel of the leatherwrapped hilt in his hand was reassuring how do you know he asked the touch of magic woke us audun and liv said the same thing once more well is it bizogot magic or raumsdalian magic count hamnet asked testily i dont know audun gilli said while liv answered im not sure they were different there if not very then liv said it might not be either one that made hamnets annoyance at being roused in the middle of the night fall away ulric skakki had said he thought people dwelt beyond the glacier hamnet didnt think ulric had told that either to audun or to liv and if trasamund believed the same thing he was keeping quiet about it hamnet had trouble imagining the bizogot jarl keeping quiet about anything for very long which meant well who could tell what it meant what does she say audun asked muttering in annoyance at having to go back and forth hamnet translated audun gilli looked thoughtful he nodded why are you bothering me if this stranger is a wizard hamnet asked as the new thought occurred to him why didnt you deal with him yourselves we tried liv said in her language we couldnt audun said in his so it comes clown to the sword after all hamnet thoughtsweatstained wearsmoothed leather against callused palm well ill go if you can guide me toward him he saidthe last thing he wanted was to try to stalk an unfriendly wizard by the flickering fluttering glow of the northern lights ill come with you liv said at once hamnet thyssen wondered if he wanted a woman beside him but if the other choice was audun gilli he decided he did this was the bizogot shamans country if anyone could move through it smoothly and quietly she could audun had shown himself to be a pretty fair wizard but he couldnt move anywhere without stumbling over his own feet and that was when he was sober when hed had a bit to drink or more than a bit you stay behind hamnet told him if you hear anything wrong or sense anything wrong wake ulric skakki and trasamund to hamnet s way of thinking they were the two men likeliest to do him some good in a pinch audun gilli nodded count hamnet put on his boots and got to his feet lets go he said to liv they hadnt gone far before she stepped in some mud and pulled her feet out with horrid squelching sounds so much for smoothly and quietly hamnet thought it would have been funny if it didnt endanger them both liv wasnt laughing she swore as foully in the bizogot language as trasamund could have how far away is this wizard or shaman or whatever he is hamnet asked again with no plants taller than the middle of his calf he would have a demon of a time sneaking up on the stranger if the fellow had a bow he wouldnt need to be a wizard but at that thought count hamnet shook his head he wouldnt have wanted to try to gauge distances with only gods curtains to help him and he couldnt believe any other archer would either out beyond bowshotthats as much as i can tell liv replied shall i throw our shadows to confuse him about how were coming after him throw our shadows what do you mean count hamnet asked instead of answering liv began to chant softly hamnet thyssen started for it seemed as if two manlike shapes sprang into being about fifty feet off to the left he will notice them he will not notice us liv said but then she added unless he is a better shaman than i think he is count hamnet wouldnt have minded not hearing that the sorcerous shadows or doubles paced along to the left of the real raumsdalian and shaman will they have any better notion of where this strange wizard is than we do hamnet whispered liv grinned wryly i wish they would lightning sizzled along the groundnot a great bolt such as god might hurl down from the edge of the glacier but enough to fill the air with the smell of thunderstorms and enough to make the magical shadows jerk and twitch like real people caught by that brilliant lash hamnet thyssen admired livs artistry he blinked again and again trying to will sight back to his dazzled eyes liv pointed in the direction from which the lightning bolt had come there she said we will find him there quick she ran forward she was lightfooted and fast as most men hamnet thyssen lumbered after her doing his best to keep up she let out what sounded like a lynxs crywhat sounded so much like one hamnet wondered whether one of the beasts really spoke from her throat he wouldnt have been surprised bizogot shamans and wild beasts had mystical connections he understood only dimly peer as he would hamnet thyssen saw no man standing or even crouching there on the frozen plain but suddenly he heard a great thunder of wings some large birdin the glow from the northern lights he saw it was an owl as white as an arctic fox or hare in winterstreaked off to the north liv dug in her heels and skidded to a stop count hamnet charged past her then stopped himself the plain was empty now he could feel it our man has flown liv said sadly flown hamnets echo sounded foolish even in his own ears flown the shaman repeated did you not see the snowy owl just then i saw the owl hamnet thyssen said i saw no man oh yes you did liv told him the owl was the manis the man well he is flown now wherever he lands so long as it is far from us he will take back his own shape he will tell his friends whoever they are whatever he learned of us his friends again hamnet used her words for his own who are his friends is he another bizogot shaman why would he fly north if he is he is not a bizogot i was not sure before now i am liv sounded very sure she went on i do not know what he is i do not think he comes from your folk eitherat least his magic feels nothing like audun gillis are there people beyond the glacier maybe there are yes maybe hamnet couldnt say more without telling her that ulric skakki had come this way before for that matter how could he be sure himself that ulric was telling the truth he couldnt and he knew it for him if not for the adventurer maybe was nothing but the truth the shaman looked north in the direction the snowy owl had flown toward the narrow part of the gap toward whateverand whoeverlay beyond if there are people beyond the glacier they are not gods people she sounded disappointed gods people wouldnt need to spy count hamnet hadnt thought of it like that when he did he nodded and if they are not gods people if they are people like the rest of us what does that say that they will steal whatever they can and take whatever they can liv replied at once startled hamnet nodded again he wouldnt have put it that way which didnt mean he thought the bizogot shaman was wrong liv had a habit of saying exactly what was on her mind hamnet thyssen tried to do that too which was one reason so many raumsdalians were perfectly content to see him stay in his castle off on the edge of nowhere he laughed softly as he and liv walked back to the encampment he was much closer to the edge of nowhere here in the gap than he could be anywhere inside the empire and with the gap melted through he and his companions could go beyond the edge of nowhere go into lands no one from the south could have reached for thousands of years the people on the other side couldnt have come down into the south for thousands of years either sigvat ii didnt seem worried about that neither did trasamund hamnet thyssen wondered why not he knew he was when the spy flew away what did you sense he asked audun gilli when he got back is that what happened the wizard said as if much was now explained thats what happened hamnet said he translated for liv who nodded liv made the very pretty shadow spelli know that audun said it fooled him too or he wouldnt have thrown the lightning at the doubles he would have sent it against you but then when he realized you were still coming forward yes it must have been a shapeshifting spell but not one i ever met before nothing like any i ever met before in fact he is right liv said after hamnet thyssen translated again shamans can take the seeming of a bear or a dire wolf or a lion or a musk ox or a mammoth sometimes it is more than a seemingeven you folk from the hot lands will know this count hamnet didnt think of the raumsdalian empire as a hot country but it was when measured against the bizogot plains liv went on this magic was new to me too it was quicker and more complete than any i have known before the spy did not take on the seeming of an owl he was an owl after hamnet turned that into raumsdalian for audun gilli he asked how will he stop being an owl then he used both languages someone will have to make him into a man again liv said even in owl shape he will know enough to go back where he came from what does she say audun asked when hamnet told him he said yes it would have to work like that and the spy will have to hope he knows enough to go back where he came from otherwise hell catch rabbits and voles and lemmings for the rest of his days now liv had to wait for the translation when she had it she sketched a salute to audun gilli that can happen to bizogot shamans too she said some people say shortfaced bears are as sly as they are because they have mens blood in them blood from shamans who never went back to mens shape count hamnets shiver had nothing to do with the chilly night he tried to imagine living the rest of his life as a beast slowly forgetting he was ever a man only one thought occurred to him how gudrid would laugh trasamund grunted when he heard the folk from beyond the glacier had spies on this side of the gap after a bit he unbent enough to say if we catch them well kill them his large hard hands opened and closed several times he seemed to look forward to it were going up to spy on them ulric skakki murmured when he and hamnet rode a little apart from the rest of the travelers why shouldnt they come down to spy on us put that way it seemed logical enough fair enough but it didnt feel fair to hamnet thyssen what the empire was doingwith some help from the bizogotswas only fitting and proper so it looked to him anyhow for other folk to come down into those familiar lands though if that wasnt an invasion what was it when count hamnet said as much ulric skakki smiled one of his sardonic smiles of course were not invading their lands when we go north of the gapeh your grace were not invading hamnet waved an arm at the bizogots and raumsdalians riding north does this look like an army to you ulric laughed well no he said but does one man who turns himself into an owl look like an army to you thats different hamnet thyssen insisted how ulric sounded genuinely curious try as hamnet would he couldnt come up with a good answer the only one that came to him was because its on this side of the gap it was an answer plenty good enough for him he was sure as sure could be though that ulric skakki would only laugh some more if he brought it out and so he rode along in glum silenceand ulric skakki laughed at him anyway after a while ulric said theyll have a demon of a time trying to bring an army through here that touched on count hamnet s professional expertise oh yes he said without a moments hesitation its not just the narrow gate theyll have to pass through how will they keep a host of men and beasts fed nobody can raise enough to keep a host fed till you get down into the empire where crops will grow ulric agreed the bizogots would be a lot more trouble than they are if they were hosts instead of bandsand theyre trouble enough as is really i never would have noticed count hamnets voice was dry when ulric laughed this time it was with him not at him hamnet thought so anyhow closer and closer together came the two cliffs that marked the edges of the glacier once upon a time within the memory of chroniclers and bards though certainly not within that of living men the glacier had had only a southern edge would it really keep melting till the gap was a broad highwaytill perhaps there was no glacier at all only bare ground hamnet thyssen tried to imagine that tried and felt himself failing even somewhat diminished as it was the glacier still seemed to him a natural and all but inevitable part of the world as those tall cliffs of ice drew closer they also towered higher into the sky count hamnet was not a nervous man or not a man who showed his nerves but his voice wobbled a little when he asked trasamund are there ever avalanches up here he couldnt imagine how many tons of ice might come thundering down on him im sure there arethere must be the bizogot jarl answered ive never been in one though he chuckled if i ever was id be too flat to talk to you now er yes hamnet said that marched too well with what he was thinking and then the next morning he couldnt see the edges of the ice at all he couldnt see anything mist shrouded the campsite it was cold and gray and thick thicker than hed ever known mist to be down in the raumsdalian empire the air he inhaled felt soggy when he exhaled he added his own fog to that which swirled around him which way is north he asked his voice sounded strangely muffled north ulric skakki said from not far awaybut count hamnet couldnt see him in this i have trouble being sure of up and down that would have been funny if it didnt hold so much truth the air above the air all aroundthe same shade of gray everywhere it was like being in the middle of a wet sheeps wool and when hamnet thyssen looked down he could barely see his own boots i ran into this myself the last time i came north trasamund said from somewhere in the fog i was stuck for two or three days because i couldnt tell which end was up of course i didnt have a shaman with me and now weve got two i know a spell for finding north audun gilli said an iron needle floating in a cup of water will show you the way what does he say liv asked from farther away count hamnet translated for her when he finished she said i know this spell a raumsdalian trader showed it to me it may work down in your country but not so well up here he said it lied more and more the farther north he went thats so by godive seen it too trasamund agreed also in the bizogot tongue inevitably audun gilli asked what they said with a mental sigh hamnet translated for him too the wizard let out an indignant sniff how can a spell that works well in one place not work in another the idea is ridiculous trasamund of course understood raumsdalian it may be ridiculous but its true if you go the way you think north is youll smack your nose into the glacier instead of heading on up into the gap i dont believe it audun said fine trasamund told him dont believe it work your magic go the way you think is north but watch out for your nose he laughed audun gilli sniffed more indignantly than ever laughing still trasamund went on go ahead try your spell well come along why not well be going somewhere even if its in the wrong direction hamnet thyssen hadnt known a needle would float on water but audun was rightthe thin one he used did and it pointed steadily in a direction he insisted was north off the travelers went moving slowly through the impenetrable fog calling to one another again and again to keep from getting separated when the ground under the horses hooves grew muckier than ever hamnet began to suspect trasamund knew what he was talking about wetter ground meant more meltwater and more meltwater meant they were getting closer to the glacier the mist did thin a little as the day wore along and a swirl of breeze showed the great cliff of ice dead ahead and seeming unimaginably tall you see trasamund sounded as if he would tear audun gillis head off if the wizard denied seeing but audun didnt i see he said sadly he sounded chastened we went more west than north did we not eyvind torfinn said plainly audun gilli sounded more chastened yet but we should have gone north was he staring at the needle as if wondering why it betrayed him he was only a dim outline to hamnet thyssen but the nobleman knew he would have stared at the needle that way eyvind torfinn by contrast sounded cheerful if we know the needle points somewhere close to west instead of north then if we go in the direction the needle says is somewhere closer to east than north well really be heading toward the true north after all wont we a considerable silence followed from both audun gilli and trasamund when audun said by god your splendor i think we will he seemed amazed trasamunds laugh might almost have blown the fog away by itself by god your splendor youve worked a magic to make any shaman jealous he boomed youve made a liar tell the truth in spite of himself well done what do they say liv asked plaintively she was the only traveler who knew no raumsdalian count hamnet translated for her ah she said when he finished the old man is clever she forgot earl eyvind was fluent in the bizogot language i am not as old as all that wise woman he said in her tongue or at least i hope i am not hamnet thyssen couldnt see her turn red either but he would have bet she was blushing i crave your pardon she said in a small voice come onlets get going trasamund told audun gilli your precious needle can lie as much as it pleases you will tease the truth out of it even so maybe i will i really think i will audun seemed astonished but happy a wizard ought to travel about with a charmed needle and compare what it calls north to what the sky shows at a great many places once a chart was made anyone would be able to use the needle anywhere and have it tell him the truth that sounds like a good idea the bizogot jarl said it sounds like a good idea for somebody with all the time in the world as much as i would like to have so much time i dontand neither do you audun took the hint he murmured the charm over the needle once more perhaps to encourage it then he began to ride this way he called he was dimly visible through the thinning mist but hearing him did help the others follow and eyvind torfinns notion worked hamnet thyssen saw no logical reason why it shouldnt but plenty of things went wrong even when he saw no reason why they should ix oh liv whispered looking first to one side then to the other she shook her head in awe and wonder oh she said again hamnet thyssen couldnt have put it better himself they were passing through the narrowest part of the gap the ground between the two titanic ice mountains was soggy almost saturated with meltwater the horses had to pick their way through the mud as carefully as they could that meant their riders had to pay close attention to what they were doingexcept they couldnt because the spectacle to either side was too magnificent the gap had melted through yes but not by much the gap in the ice was only a few hundred yards wide here it towered up and up and up to either side how far up was it to the top of the glacier a mile two miles three hamnet didnt know he couldnt begin to guess a clever geometer or surveyor might have been able to figure it out but he was neither far enough to be dauntingfar enough and then some except near noon the shadow of one half of the glacier or the other shrouded the gap the ice smoked as ice did in warm air but this wasnt just icethis was the glacier fingers of mist swirled and curled about the travelers now obscuring the frozen towering cliffs now leaving them fully visible eyvind torfinn doffed his fur hat to trasamund i thank you eyvind said in the bizogot language by god your ferocity i thank you from the bottom of my heart i might have died without ever seeing this marvel ive lived many years but nothing else comes close to it what does he say audun gilli asked ulric skakki rode closer to him than hamnet did and translated eyvinds words into raumsdalian the wizard nodded oh yes he said i am younger than eyvind torfinn but i do not expect to see anything to match this again it is a wonderno doubt of that ulric said though hed seen it before he had no trouble sounding impressed again what would this passage be like in winter one word immediately occurred to count hamnet it would be cold it would be narrower in the wintertime too as ice melted back when the sun swung north in the sky so it grew again as days shortened and days this far north would be short indeed come winter with a crack like that of a breaking branch but immensely larger a housesized chunk of ice broke off from the eastern glacier and thudded to the ground hamnet thyssens horse snorted and sidestepped nervously if he were on his feet he thought he would have felt an earthquake the broken piece hadnt rolled and fallen more than a bowshots distance either what would have happened if it had started halfway up the glacier he shivered though they werent shrouded in mist just then an avalanche would have happened that was what jesper fletti s head kept whipping back and forth back and forth too the guards officer didnt seemed awed by the spectacle of the glacier to either side of him he acted more like a trapped animal its like being in a box he said hoarsely in a box and it was with the opening ahead so narrow some people didnt like being closed in who did really but it had to bother jesper more than most people hamnet wondered how he liked sleeping in the tight enfolding blackness of a mammothhide tent maybe it worried him less if he couldnt see it count hamnet might have asked another man he might have consoled another man he might even have consoled jesper fletti under different circumstances he had nothing against jesper as a guards officer sigvat ii needed able men and jesper plainly was one but hed come north to protect gudrid and that meant hamnet had as little to do with him as he could ulric skakki also looked to left and right there in the narrows of the gap what else could a man do unless he chose to look up and up and up at one half of the glacier or the other hamnet thyssen had tried that once he didnt do it any more it gave him the uneasy feeling he would fall up the glacier he knew he wouldnt but what he knew and what his eyes told him were two different things and any man had trouble disbelieving his eyes i think the gap is a little wider here than it was an hour ago ulric said are we really past the narrowest part as soon as he asked the question the travelers all started making the same calculation i do believe we are trasamund said jesper fletti drew in a loud deep breath as if being past the narrows meant his chest wasnt squeezed as tightly as it had been before he probably thought it wasnt that was as much in his mind as hamnets fear of falling up the glacier but in many ways what felt real was real by god audun gilli exclaimed if we keep goingwhen we keep going i meanwell put the glacier behind us well have to look south to see it that seems unnatural it may seem unnatural but its soive done it trasamund said and believe me raumsdalian its much stranger for me than it ever could be for you ive always had the glacier to the north of me whenever i turned my head the glacier wasisthe northern horizon for me when i rode down to the empire and it disappeared behind me the sky looked wrong the world looked wrong seeing it in the souththats worse than wrong its he paused groping for the word in raumsdalian perverted gudrid suggested the bizogot jarl nodded yes thats what i wanted to say i thank you seeing the glacier behind me is perverted translate for me liv said to hamnet thyssen what do they say count hamnet did the shamans eyes widened the glacier behind us she whispered i hadnt thought of that its wrong its impossibleand its going to happen isnt it if we keep going how can it help but happen hamnet replied he found the word gudrid had used the most fitting to describe what that would be like he also found it much too fitting that she should have been the one to come up with that particular word it seems mad liv said when you have a fever when the world whirls round and round so you dont know whats real and whats a dreamthen you might think youd gone north of the glacier otherwise she shook her head not a chance except youre going to do it hamnet thyssen said were all going to do it maybe this is the part of the world where everything goes mad look at audun gilli s enchanted needle yes that was strangeis strange liv agreed if we go far enough north of the glacier will the needle point south when its trying to tell us north hamnet blinked he hadnt thought of that maybe it will he said then he turned the thought into raumsdalian and passed it on to audun it made the wizard blink tooblink and then start to laugh who knows he said what i want is the chance to find out little by little the space between the two halves of the glacier widened as it had narrowed before jesper fletti became his old self again i dont feel as if everything is pressing in on me any more he said i dont feel as if i have to do thishe made pushing motions with both hands to hold the ice mountains apart that wouldnt do you any good count hamnet pointed out oh i know your grace i know it here jesper tapped his head but i dont know it here or here his hand went to his heart and then to his belly when will we see something different gudrid said everything looks the same as it did on the right side of the glacier however much hamnet wanted to quarrel with his former wife he couldnt not because of that everything on this side of the glacier looked the same to him as it had on the other side too but trasamund shook his head oh no he said and then oh no again as if to stress how much he disagreed some of the flowers and plants hereive never seen anything like them down in the lands we know marsh plants gudrid sniffed i dont care anything about marsh plants i want to see something interesting where are your white bears where is the golden shrine she rounded on eyvind torfinn where is the golden shrine youre supposed to know about these things she talked to her husband the way she might have talked to a majordomo back in nidarosas someone who did know about things yes but who had better not presume to be her equal and eyvind torfinn put up with it gudrid had ways of making men put up with things earl eyvind coughed and said you must understand my dear this is the first time a real exploring party has come north of the glacierthis is the first time an exploring party could have come north of the glacier we dont know just where the golden shrine is truth to tell we dont know its here at all we hope to find out that made good sense to hamnet thyssen he thought it would quiet gudrid down but she only sniffed again what nonsense she said all we need to do is grab somebody up here and squeeze him on this side of the glacier theyll know just where the silly old shrine is count hamnet stared so did ulric skakki eyvind torfinn looked as amazed as if a teratorn were writing in the sky with characters of fire even trasamund who had his full measure of straightforward bizogot brutality seemed taken aback but then he guffawed youve got all the answers dont you my sweet well this isnt a very hard question gudrid said trasamund laughed some more earl eyvind held his head in both hands hed spent most of his life looking for lore about the golden shrine he knew how much he didnt know gudrid had no idea about any of that instead of untying a knot she wanted to slash it through with a sword maybe that would work on the other hand if we grab a local and squeeze him that wont make his clan love us ulric skakki observed but nothing fazed gudrid she waved the worry aside who says he has to get back to his clan we leave him out for the dire wolves or whatever they have here i would not care to approach the golden shrine with blood on my hands eyvind torfinn said if we cant find it without doing whatever we have to do then well do it thats all gudrid sounded very sure of herself she commonly did remember the owl audun gilli said whoever lives here has powers of his own we are only visitors we would do well to remember that she looked down her straight nose at the wizard who here is the man and who the woman audun blushed like a child but even jesper fletti shook his head the sorcerer is right he said were a long way from the bizogot country even and a demon of a lot farther from the empire we couldnt fight a war up here keeping any kind of army supplied as it goes up through the gap he shook his head i wouldnt care to try it gudrid only sniffed again she didnt worry when someone disagreed with her because she was always sure she was right what are we going to do she said turn around and go home without finding the golden shrine i dont think so hamnet thyssen feared they would have to do exactly that summer didnt last long up here the bizogots knew how to winter next to the glacier but he and his countrymen didnt theyd never had to before they froze and starved they would need to head back to a more tolerable clime the golden shrine he looked around as if expecting to spy it on the northern horizon that made him laugh at himself they werent even out of the gap yet this ground had lain under the glacier for years uncounted wherever the golden shrine might be it wasnt here and he had no idea what it would look like if and when they did find it it would presumably be white past that past that who could say he pictured it as standing all alone on something that looked like the frozen plains where the bizogots roamed he pictured it that way yes but he knew his picture might be wrong maybe it would be the center of a town maybe even the center of a city like nidaros then like jesper he shook his head that seemed unlikely how would you feed a townhow would you feed anything more than a band of nomadsin country like this despite all his logic he scanned the northern horizon again he stiffened in the saddle his finger stabbed out whats that lion said ulric skakki who rode not far away i suppose so hamnet said that small shape in the distance did move with a sinuous feline grace its seen us trasamund said sure enough the big cat trotted toward the travelers the closer it got the more they stared at it by god audun gilli said thats no lion it isnt jesper fletti agreed what is it its no sabertooth eitherit doesnt have short hind legs the way they do it is something new eyvind torfinn said it is a creature from beyond the glacier awe suffused his voice a creature from beyond the glacier that was plenty to awe hamnet thyssen too and itwasasingularlydeadlylookingcreaturelt looked more like a lion than anything else but it was bigger than any lion hamnet had ever seen it was so big it surely had to be a male but it did not bear a mane audun gilli was rightit was no lion instead of a tawny coat it had a pale golden one broken by dark stripes that helped confuse its outline till it came quite near when it yawned it displayed formidable fangs but more like a lions than a sabertooths it trotted alongside the travelers for a while but showed no inclination to attack in fact it showed no inclination to come within bowshot of the horses hamnet thyssen had seen similarly wary lions down in the south it knows men he said it knows what weapons can do looks that way ulric skakki said well no great surprise not after some of the other things weve seenand not after your magical owl not mine hamnet said liv woke me up so i helped chase it away thatll do ulric pointed out toward the big striped cat do you suppose they hunt in prides the way lions do i hadnt thought about that hamnet said well find out where theres one of those things there are bound to be more well youre right about that ulric skakki said they might as well be tax collectors except they dont take such big bites heh count hamnet said for all the world as if ulric were joking the striped cat studied the travelers with as much curiosity as they showed it coming up from the other side of the glacier did they smell strange hamnet knew he smelled bad all the travelers did and got worse by the day but he had no reason to believe anyone on this side of the ice was any more fragrant after a few minutes the striped cat seemed to decide the humans were too alert to make good prey it trotted purposefully off toward the northwest leaving the horses behind the animals seemed glad it was gone whatever the travelers smelled like to the cat it smelled like danger to the horses was that a real cat trasamund asked or was it a man in cat shape spying on us like the owl he spoke first in his own language then in raumsdalian both liv and audun gilli looked surprised i felt nothing out of the ordinary the bizogot shaman said audun looked a question at hamnet thyssen who translated for him audun nodded i thought it was an ordinary animal too he said hamnet translated that into the bizogot tongue for liv im glad to hear it trasamund said again in both languages and by god i hope youre right theyd come so far north full darkness never descended on the world not long before midnight the sun sank below the horizon in the far northwest not long after midnight it rose again in the far northeast during its brief journey below the edge of the earth the northern sky stayed light nothing deeper than twilight settled over the land and only a few of the brightest stars came outand then not for long ulric skakki made a joke of it saying they wont be afraid to see owls by daylight here no they likely wont hamnet dropped his voice but you were up here in the wintertime before whats it like then ulric turned and pointed almost due south with a melodramatic shiver he said the sun comes up there then he swung his arm from slightly east of south to slightly west and it goes down there and it never gets higher in the sky than this he held thumb and forefinger a couple of inches apart its like two or three hours of late afternoon in the middle of the day its dark the rest of the time dark and bloody cold you see by the stars and the northern lightswhen there are northern lightsand the moon when the moon is full in wintertime it does what the sun does in high summer so its in the sky a lot better than nothing i suppose the further from full it is the shorter the time it stays up hamnet thyssen tried to imagine darkness spread across the landscape for almost the whole day you must have slept a lot he said well what else is there to do ulric asked in reasonable tones you ride and you hunt and you roast what you kill and you sleep you dont even have to hunt so much in the winter because the meat doesnt spoil you just have to make sure the wolves and the bears and the foxes and the big striped cats dont steal it that must be fun count hamnet observed oh sometimes ulric skakki smiled crookedly then he nodded to hamnet you ought to come up here in wintertime yourself your grace just to see it it might appealdarkness suits you eh whats that supposed to mean hamnet asked ulric skakkis shrug was a small masterpiece of its kind however much hamnet fumed he didnt ask the other man to explain himself again he knew too well what ulric had to mean darkness crouched at the center of his soul it had for years he feared it always would hed never been a cheery outgoing man he never would be he didnt need sardonic ulric to remind him of that but what his former wife did to his spirit was like a wound that wouldnt heal the spiritual pus that leaked from it infected his whole spirit i know what you need ulric said hamnet thyssen scowled at him i need you to shut up and go away he growled you need to fall in love ulric went on as if he hadnt spoken the adventurers grin was bright charming and altogether infuriating i really need you to shut up and go away hamnet thyssens laugh came harsh as a ravens croak you damned fool what are the odds he tried to imagine himself in love again imagining himself wringing ulric skakkis neck was much easier ulric laughed again too a light airy sound that made count hamnet wonder how such different things could have the same name you wont do it if you dont go looking for somebody thats for sure he said and if i do go looking for somebody whatll she do hamnet demanded betray me the same way gudrid did thats what well maybe you ulric skakki broke off not from fear but from a certain selfprotective caution you have murder in your eye your grace perhaps you should put it back in your pocket or wherever you usually keep it you were going to say maybe you had it coming werent you hamnet said thickly why shouldnt i kill you for that you son of a whore because it may be true even if you dont like it ulric sounded as light and carefree as usual but his hand hovered near his swordhilt hamnet thyssens hand dropped to his you lie he said i didnt do anything to deserve having horns put on me no one ever does ulric skakki said no one ever does if you listen to him tell it or herplenty of women sing the same sad song no i didnt do anything but people get horns put on them every day of the week every week of the month every month of the year meaning no offense your grace but maybe doing nothing was your problem what nonsense are you spewing now hamnet said ulric sighed i might have known youd see it that way by god i did know youd see it that way sometimes you have to try whether you think itll do any good or not he turned awaybut he kept an eye on hamnet thyssen even so doing nothing hamnet muttered in disgust as if that meant anything gudrid played eyvind torfinn for a fool too did that mean he was doing nothing too count hamnet glanced over toward eyvind at the moment he was trimming his nails with a clasp knife and making heavy going of itthe years had lengthened his sight so he had to work at arms length with what kind of man would gudrid be happy count hamnet couldnt imagine by all the signs gudrid couldnt either hamnet glared at ulric skakki he thought he had all the answers did he well he wasnt half as clever as he thought he was was he north and west north and west hamnet thyssen hadnt realized there was so much land beyond the glacier hed thought the ground on the far side of the ice would be an afterthought an appendage to the real world the world he was familiar with after all the raumsdalian empire the bizogot steppe and the lands to the south of those that sigvat ii ruled added up to a vast sweep of terrain why would anyoneor even godneed more of the world than that it all seemed perfectly logical it probably wasbut how much did logic have to do with truth not as much plainly as hamnet would have wished do you have any idea where the golden shrine is he asked eyvind torfinn when they camped one evening waving a hand as if to say it might be anywhere i dont believe its on the other side of the world earl eyvind answered past that im afraid i cant begin to tell you how do you know its not on the far side of the world hamnet asked because once upon a timegod only knows how long agowe went there and we remembered eyvind said i dont think we could have got to the temple if it were so far away from the lands we know count hamnet grunted well i suppose that makes sense he said and then surprising himself what does gudrid say about the journey i think she wishes she never came eyvind torfinn took the question in stride i told her back in nidaros she would feel this way he shrugged no one ever listens to advice so the best advice i can give is not to give any if i take it i prove i listened hamnet said but if i advise anyone else to take it eyvind torfinn looked at him blinked and started to laugh he tried to stop but seemed to have some trouble oh dear he said and laughed some more oh dear finally with a fit of coughing he made the laughter break off well well i never expected to come up with such a neat paradox i should be proud of myself liv walked up to the two of them why did the old man have a fit she asked hamnet thyssen that made earl eyvind cough some more if not so comfortably im not as old as all that he told the bizogot shaman in her language she was somewhere in her late twentiesso hamnet guessed anyway to her earl eyvind probably was as old as all that to her im getting on toward being an antique myself hamnet thought uncomfortably though he wasnt far past forty the idea annoyed him more than it had any business doing then liv bowed to eyvind torfinn i cry your pardon she said i meant no insult and i forgot you knew the bizogot tongue so very well you thought you could talk behind my back in front of me the raumsdalian noble said an indulgent note in his voice well i forgive youand i think i just made another paradox the key word came out in raumsdalian the nomads didnt have the idea another what liv asked frowning a paradox is something that says two things at the same time when they both cant be true at once eyvind torfinn answered count hamnet eyed him in admiration knowing he couldnt have defined the word so well in the bizogot tongue but the shamans frown deepened show me what you mean she said all right by god i will eyvind torfinn said i have heard bizogots say raumsdalians lie all the time you will have heard this too im sure i do not believe it liv said politely you are kind you are gracious but suppose it is true can you do that eyvind waited till liv nodded then he smiled all raumsdalians tell lies all the time always right liv nodded again eyvind jabbed a thumb at his own chest i am a raumsdalian i say i am a liar but when i say i am a liar am i telling the truth yes liv said and then at once i mean no she paused a little longer i mean yes her blue eyes started to cross its maddening its mad she exclaimed it goes round and round like a musk ox with the staggers where does it stop good question hamnet said his eyes were starting to cross too it stops wherever you want it to stop eyvind torfinn said or else it doesnt stop at all thats what a paradox is what do you use it for liv asked earl eyvinds smile got wider why for whatever you want for confusing people hamnet thyssen said it can do that liv eyed eyvind torfinn with more respect than she usually showed him you say you made up one of these horrible things two of them as a matter of fact he answered not without pride you bear watching liv said and walked away would you rather bear watching or watch bears count hamnet asked yes eyvind torfinn said hamnet walked away too deer trasamund pointed west a herd of deer hamnet thyssens eyes followed that outthrust finger the deer he knew didnt travel in herds they were mostly solitary creatures that lived in the forests east of the raumsdalian empire every so often they came out and fed in orchards and fields hed hunted them often enough to savor the taste of venison slowly simmered in ale and herbs these he saw at a glance were beasts different from the ones hed known down in the south the warm south he thought although he hadnt conceived of the empire as such a warm place before his travels in the north it was warm enough up here now with the sun in the sky almost all day long but what it would be like come winter better to think about the deer they were thickerbodied and shorterlegged than the ones he knew and of a pale dun color that blended in well with the ground over which they wandered their antlers were large and sweeping but didnt have such sharp tines as those of the forest beasts hed hunted and are they all stags he asked the deer i know the does have no horns more likely the does here do grow antlers eyvind torfinn said count hamnet found himself nodding he couldnt imagine such a large herd of male animals ambling along so peacefully well eat well tonight by god trasamund said with a nomads practicality hamnet thyssen nodded again with so many of these strange deer going by they would surely be able to knock over one or two and they did the animals seemed untroubled unafraid as the men approached them getting into archery range was the easiest thing in the world jesper fletti looked up from butchering one of the slain deer his arms crimson to the elbows its as if they never saw people before and didnt know we were hunting them he said either that or theyre already tame and dont worry about people because theyre used to having them around ulric skakki said i dont think so naturally the guards officer liked his own ideas better than someone elses count hamnet looked sharply at ulric skakki whether jesper did or not hamnet knew ulric had come beyond the glacier before did you meet these tame deer in the wintertime he asked in a low voice ulric nodded i did they act like musk oxen on the bizogot plain they scrape up the snow and eat whats underneath and do people herd them the way the bizogots herd musk oxen and mammoths hamnet asked i cant prove that i didnt see people with them ulric answered but there are people here unless that owl you and the sorcerers flushed turned back into a white bear instead and i dont think white bears herd deer however much they might want to no doubt youre right hamnet thyssen looked around i dont see any signs of herders though neither do i ulric said we must be on the edge of the country they usually wander but that owl says we arent the only ones who know the glacier really has broken in two at last there was a disturbing thought hamnet looked around again the only people he saw were the travelers with whom hed come so far but what did that prove all we can do is go on hamnet said nowe could go back ulric said we might be smart if we did weve seen theres open land beyond the glacier what more do we need what about the golden shrine hamnet asked well what about it ulric skakki returned if you know where the bloody thing is your grace lead the way you know i dont hamnet thyssen said irritably yes i know that ulric said and i know i dont know where it is neither does eyvind torfinn however much he wishes he did neither does trasamund neither does audun gilli and neither does the bizogot shaman liv hamnet said thats right ulric skakki nodded and if i dont know and if they dont know then nobody up here from the other side of the glacier knowsand nobody down there on the other side of the glacier knows either and what are the odds of finding something if you dont know where in blazes to look for it rotten if you ask me so why waste time up here and maybe get caught by the weatheror by the folk who herd these deer better to take what we know and head back isnt it hamnet thyssen frowned he might be the nominal leader of the raumsdalians here but he knew too well what a painful word nominal was eyvind torfinn had a higher degree of nobility than he did and a mulish scholarly autonomy audun gilli might obey or might go off and pick wildflowers or look for something to drink ulric skakki listened to himself and no one else jesper fletti and his guardsmen listened to gudrid first as for gudrid if she listened to anyone under the sunby no means obvious she didnt heed her former husband then there were the bizogots whom hamnet couldnt even claim to command no one commanded trasamund who was as much a sovereign as sigvat ii hamnet thought that if he told liv to do something she might if she decided it was a good idea wonderful that may make one hamnet sighed do you really suppose i could persuade the others to turn back he asked how do you know if you dont try ulric skakki replied count hamnet sighed again that sounded sensible reasonable both men knew it wasnt which only made it more irritating ill try hamnet said thatll teach you the smell of roasting meat brought another striped hunting cator maybe the first one the travelers sawback to investigate they yelled and threw things at the animal and frightened it away but it didnt go far it skulked around out of bowshot as if to say it claimed the scraps after hamnet bit into a rib he was willing to let the beast have them the meat was tough and not very tasty what flavor it had he didnt much care for the deer had been feeding on something that left it unappetizing hamnet had found the like in gamebirds but never before in deer he used the poor meat to help make his point now that weve found out what this country is like shouldnt we head back to our own side of the glacier and let the people there know he said waving the rib bone for emphasis makes sense to me ulric skakki did what he could to support the argument hed proposed himself everyone else metaphorically tore it limb from limb we have not found the golden shrine yet eyvind torfinn declared as if it were right around the corneras if this vast flat plain had corners you have not seen a white bear yet either trasamund added theyre fine hunting better even than the shortfaced bears back on our own side of the glacier considering how dangerous shortfaced bears were hamnet thyssen was anything but convinced that he wanted to meet anything worse if he did it was liable to end up hunting him not the other way around no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than gudrid said besides we havent met the people who live beyond the glacier all the more reason to leave now wouldnt you say count hamnet replied ulric skakki nodded no one else could see it liv couldnt understand it because the discussion was in raumsdalian hamnet wondered what excuse his countrymen and trasamund had were they merely foolish or were they willfully blind he glanced over at gudrid people would have asked the same thing of him when she first started being unfaithful no doubt they had asked it behind his back in those days no one could have persuaded him she was anything but true here in the longshadowed summer evening of the land beyond the glacier he himself could not persuade the others danger might lie ahead x defeated and depressed hamnet thyssen strode away from the campfire the sun had set at last but he was in no danger of getting lost the northern horizon remained white and bright the light was still good enough to read by but he didnt feel like reading even if hed had a book he wished he could keep walking and leave behind the fools who didnt want to listen to him hamnet thyssen as liv often did she spoke his given and family names as if they were part of the same long word please wait she added after a moment he did she hadnt ignored him she hadnt understood a word he was saying well save for ulric skakki neither had the rest even though they and he used the same language not your fault he admitted what was the argument about she asked adding no one would slowdown and translate for me i really have to learn raumsdalian dont i it might help hamnet said if i can learn your language i dont think theres any reason you cant learn mine as for the argument i thought we should turn around and go home while the going is good ulric skakki thought i was right everyone else thought i had a mammoth turd where my brains ought to be the bizogot shaman laughed you have an accent when you speak our tongue hamnet thyssen but that is something a man of my clan might say what that we should go home he misunderstood her on purpose no about the mammoth turd and liv broke off her eyes flashed you are teasing me do you know what happens when you tease a shaman nothing good or you wouldnt want to tell me about it hamnet answered tell me something else insteaddo you think we ought to head back probably liv answered what else can we do here unless we happen to stumble over the golden shrine he stared at her he thought she was the most wonderful woman in the world of course he didshe agreed with him by god he exclaimed i could kiss you liv waited when nothing happened she said well go ahead he stared at her again in a different way she wasnt a badlooking woman not at all but he hadnt thought she would take him literally nohe hadnt thought she would want to take him literally since his troubles with gudrid hed had trouble believing any woman would be interested in him carefully so as not to offend he kissed her on the cheek she raised an eyebrow she was grimy and none too fresh but he hardly noticed all the travelers himself included were grimy and none too fresh well he said when she stood there looking at him with that eyebrow halfway up her forehead not very well as a matter of fact liv told him you can do better youd better do better lurked behind the words he managed a crooked smile of his own who knows what youd do to me if i told you no you were just talking about how its dangerous to anger a shaman in saying he didnt want to anger her he managed to do just that her frown put him in mind of a building storm i do not force you to this hamnet thyssen she said if you care to you will if you dont she didnt go on but he had no trouble filling in something like be damned to you angry at himself and her both he did kiss her not much caring if he was gentle or not well he said again tasting a little blood in his mouth that is better liv paused different anyway count hamnet bowed thank you so much my pleasurea little of it anyhow the bizogot woman could be formidably sarcastic the one person except ulric who thought the same way he didand here he was quarreling with her how much sense did that make not much and he knew it too well he fought his temper under something close to control will you tell trasamund you think we ought to go south he asked is this what you ask after you kiss a woman liv snapped would you ask gudrid the same question after you kiss her i would never kiss gudrid hamnet s fury kindled for real and if god forbid i did i would ask her who shed just kissed before me and who she planned on kissing next he spat at livs feet he thought that would infuriate her in turn instead it sobered her like a bucket of cold water in the face oh she said in a small voice i did not mean to tease you either i am sorry let it go hamnet said roughly justlet it go but do talk to the jarl because that really is important liv bit her lip and nodded it shall be as you say then without a backward glance she went off toward the camp slowly hamnet thyssen followed the bear the travelers saw scooping salmon from a stream was not white it was brown it was also the biggest bear hamnet thyssen had ever seen oh some shortfaced bears might have been as tall at the shoulder as this monster but they were longlegged and quick this beast was built like an ordinary woods bruin but on an enormous scale it showed formidable teeth when the riders drew near with a little coughing roar it stood between them and the fish it had caught it doesnt trust us ulric skakki said maybe its met men before audun gilli said maybe it just knows what were likely to be like count hamnet said trasamund eyed him sourly and now youll go its a great big bear we should all turn around and run home hamnet thyssen looked back his eyes as cold as the glacier demons take you your ferocity he replied in a voice chillier yet no one talks to me that way trasamund had no more control over his temper than a sixyearold ill kill the man who talks to me so after sliding down from his horse count hamnet bowed with ironic precision you are welcome to try of course and after you have tried the demons will take you in truth he was not afraid of the bizogot trasamund was big and strong and brave but not from everything hamnet had seen particularly skillful and even if he were hamnet thyssen would not have been afraid because whether he lived or died was a matter of complete indifference to him trasamund also dismounted he drew his sword a twohanded blade that could have severed the great bears head from its shoulders a blade like that could cut a man in halfif it bit hamnet s own sword was smaller and lighter but he was much quicker with it ulric skakki rode between them gentlemen this is absurd he said you are quarreling over the shadow of an ass by no means hamnet thyssen said he intended to add that he saw the ass before him the more furious trasamund got the more careless he would act he was proud of being a bizogot like any other that a raumsdalian might goad him into foolishness because he was so typical never once crossed his mind it crossed ulric skakkis though that will be enough from you he snapped before hamnet could speak then he rounded on trasamund and as for you your ferocity you owe his grace an apology i will apologize with steel the jarl swung his sword in a whirring whirling glittering circle of death you are a bloody fool ulric said shall i kill you too trasamund asked i do not mind take your place behind that other wretch and i will dispose of you one at a time if i have to i will ulric skakki said personally i dont think youll get past count hamnet if by some accident you should i know you wont get past me count hamnet i believe fights fair i promise you your ferocity i dont waste time on such foolishness do you want to die trasamund sounded genuinely curious if you do i promise i can arrange it get out of the way ulric hamnet thyssen said believe me i can take care of myself he had no intention of backing downor of dying surprises happened accidents happened but he didnt think any would this time trasamund seemed to realize for the first time that he was not only serious but murderous that he wasnt just fighting to save his honor or to keep from seeming a coward but because he expected to win you are making a mistake raumsdalian the bizogot jarl warned i dont think so hamnet answered and theres been too much talk already he trotted toward trasamund ready to dodge around ulric skakkis horse hold that cry didnt come from ulricit came from liv the shaman pointed one forefinger at hamnet the other at trasamund they might have been drawn bows you are both behaving like men who have lost their wits either you are mad or some sorcery in this country has struck you daft whichever it is you shall not fight no one tells me what to do no one by god trasamund growled he set himself to meet hamnet thyssens onslaught or perhaps to charge himself i will curse the man who strikes the first blow i will doubly curse the man who draws the first blood and i will triply curse the man who slays liv sounded as determined as the jarl bizogots didnt commonly do things by halves eyvind torfinn was murmuring a translation for audun gilli the raumsdalian wizard said my curse also on anyone who fights here we need to stick together i fear no curses trasamund said but the wobble in his voice belied his words hamnet thyssen really did fear no curses he was already living under a curse and shed chosen to travel with him to the land beyond the glacier but ulric skakki guided his mount between hamnet and the bizogot again i think liv is right i think this land must be ensorceled he said otherwise his ferocity would see he needlessly insulted a man who was only trying to do what he thought rightwould see that and make amends for it he looked toward trasamund so did hamnet thyssen who didnt care whether the bizogot apologized or not one way or another hamnet would go forward all paths felt the same to him and all had only darkness at the end the bizogots had a word for that where raumsdalian didnt the mammothherders called it fey maybe that word was in trasamund s mind when he said this hamnet dares to offer himself to my sword to let it drink his blood that being so he cannot be such a spineless wretch after all if i said something hasty my tongue was running faster than it should have and i am sorry for that your grace ulric said part of count hamnet wanted to fight in spite of everything but hearing trasamund back down was startling almost shocking it shocked him enough to make him ground his sword that will do he said with poor grace and turned away good eyvind torfinn beamed very good was it hamnet wasnt convinced he wondered whether hed stopped a fight with trasamund or just put it off for another day trasamund muttered to himself as he slid his sword back into its sheath was he wondering the same thing they went on but not so far not so fast it was as if the quarrel about whether to go on or turn back had wounded the urge to advance without quite killing it the plodding pace left hamnet thyssen less happy than either a forthright advance or a retreat would have well never find the golden shrine at this rate he said to eyvind torfinn i dont know if it will matter whether we go fast or slow if we go north or south or east or west earl eyvind said whats that supposed to mean your splendor hamnet asked it sounds mystical he didnt feel like trying to penetrate another mans mysticism to him mysticism was even more opaque than magic which after all had practical uses eyvind torfinn didnt help when he went on the golden shrine will be found when it is ready to be found till then we can search as hard as we please but we will pass it by when we are ready when it is ready we will know and it will be found wait count hamnet said scratching his head wait the glacier has blocked the way north for how many thousand years i dont know for a good many eyvind said calmly what of it well how could the golden shrine know anything about us hamnet thyssen asked we hardly know anything about it till i heard the gap had melted through i wasnt sure i even believed in the golden shrine im still not sure i do dont worry about whether you believe in the golden shrine eyvind torfinn said the golden shrine believes in you which is all that really matters instead of answering him hamnet thyssen jerked his horses head to one side and rode away if earl eyvind wanted to talk nonsense he was welcome to as far as hamnet was concerned if he wanted anyone else to take him seriously when he did that was another story altogether or was it count hamnet found himself looking in every direction at once if the golden shrine was somehow sneaking around out there keeping an eye on him he wanted to catch it in the act rationally that made no sense at all he needed a little while to realize as much but eventually he did yet out here beyond the glacier things werent necessarily rational were they he saw nothing that looked like the golden shrinenot that he knew what the golden shrine looked like the country was the same as it had been since the travelers came through the gapa steppe for the moment green and spattered with flowers but with all the signs of winter to come here and there snow lingered on slopes that didnt see much of the sun here and there frost heaves made miniature hillocksthe only real relief in the landscape you call those pingoes dont you hamnet thyssen asked liv pointing to one that reared a good hundred yards above the surface of the plain a thin coating of dirt and clinging plants protected the ice core from melting in the sun that is a pingo yes she answered pingo is the name for such things in our language that pingo is taller than most of the ones in bizogot country i wonder what makes them hamnet said they are the shaman responded how can they be made except by god sudertorp lake is a lake because of meltwater from the glacier hamnet said yes of course liv nodded god made it so many many years ago nidaros the capital of the empire sat by the edge of hevring lake hamnet said hevring lake was a meltwater lake too then it broke through the dam of earth and ice that held it and it drained and it made a great flood you can still see the badlands it scoured out one of these days sudertorp lake will do the same thing it maybe so but what of it the bizogot shaman said stubbornly hamnet thyssen answered the land does what it does for reasons men can see i can understand why hevring lake emptied out i can see that sudertorp lake will do the same thing when the glacier moves farther north i dont have to talk about god to do it so what shaped a pingo liv looked at him speak to me of the glacier without speaking of god speak of why it moves forward and back without speaking of god speak of how the gap opened without speaking of god speak of the golden shrine without speaking of god count hamnet opened his mouth but he did not know what to say you see liv told him not in triumph but in the manner of someone who has pointed out the obvious well maybe i do he admitted or maybe i simply dont know enough about the glacier to speak of it without speaking or god i know what your trouble is she said hamnet didnt think he had trouble or at least not trouble along those lines no matter what he thought the bizogot woman went on you live too far south too far from the glacier you do not really feel the breath of god in the winter when it howls down off the ice if you did you would not doubt bizogots always spoke of the breath of god count hamnet had gone up among the mammothherders in winter but never in a clan like trasamunds that lived hard by the glacier he wasnt sorry the cold hed known was bad enough that he didnt want to find out about worse it was as cold outside as it was in my heart he thought could anything be colder than that he didnt believe it he wouldnt believe it but he didnt want to quarrel with liv either and so he said well you may be right i am she had no doubts she reached out and tapped his arm tell me thisdoes your shaman that audun gilli does he think terrible thoughts about god too if he does how can he make magic work i do not know what audun gilli thinks about god hamnet answered i never worried about it you never worried about god you never worried about what he thinks of god liv sounded disbelieving you southern folk are strange indeed if you want to know someone from the south who thinks about god talk to eyvind torfinn hamnet said liv rolled her eyes which told him she already had he tells me more than i want to hear she said he says now one thing now another till i dont know whether my wits are coming or going you see we cannot make you happy hamnet thyssen said that is not so liv said i am happywhy shouldnt i be but i am confused about what you think of the two of us you are the unhappy one she wasnt wrong hamnet tried to avoid admitting that saying what i think about god has nothing to do with whether i am happy or not did i say it did the bizogot shaman returned all i said was that you were not happy and i was right about that i am sorry i was right about it people should be happy dont you think that depends count hamnet said some people have more to be happy about than others do you want to be happy she asked and then with bizogot bluntness do you think i could make you happy at least for a while he couldnt very well mistake the meaning of that he could and did shake his head before he even thought about it thank you but no he said women are what made me the way i am now i do not believe the illness is also the cure liv looked at him for a moment i am sure you were a fool before a woman ever made one of you she said coolly and swung her horse away from his even if shed stayed next to him he had no idea how he would have answered her when liv made a point of avoiding him after that it came as something of a relief she gave him the uneasy feeling she knew things he didnt know and not things her occult lore had taught her either he wondered just how big a fool she thought he was he didnt feel like a fool not to himself all hed done was tell her the truth if that was enough to anger her then it was that was all after liv stayed away from him for a couple of days gudrid rode up alongside him he tried to pretend she wasnt there it didnt work its your own fault she said sounding as certain as she always did you dont know what youre talking about hamnet thyssen answered stonily but under the firm words lay a nasty fear that she really did her rich throaty laugh only made that fear worse oh yes i do she said i dont know what you see in that bizogot wench but plainly you see something god couldnt tell you whyshe smells like a goat so does everybody up hereincluding you hamnet said just then as if to mock him the breeze brought him a faint whiff of attar of roses if gudrid smelled like a goat she smelled like a perfumed goat he couldnt even make her angry she just laughed some more as if you care she said you chased her too hard and you went and put her back up and it serves you right hamnet thyssen gaped that was so wrong on so many different levels that for a moment he had no idea how to respond to it you really have lost your mind he said at last i dont think so gudrid in fact sounded maddeningly sure i know you better than you know yourself oh you do do you hamnet scowled at her then why didnt you know what youd do to me when you started playing the whore gudrid yawned i knew i just didnt care he wanted to kill her but if he did she would die laughing at him and he couldnt stand that you came all this way to torment me didnt you gudrid buffed her nails against the wool of her tunican artful display everything she did seemed carefully calculated to drive him mad well i wasnt doing anything else when eyvind decided to come she answered cursing hamnet thyssen rode away from her he really might have tried to murder her had she followed she didnt but her laughter pursued him as they did south of the glacier woolly mammoths roamed the plains here the travelers gave them a wide berth hamnet would not have wanted to go mammoth hunting with the men and weapons they had along if they were starving if no other food presented itselfthen maybe as things were he found the great beasts better admired at a distance mammoths make me believe in god trasamund said one bright midnight the bizogot jarl was roasting a chunk of meat from one of the swarms of deer that shared the plain with the mammoths they truly do how could mammoths make themselves god had to do it you could say the same thing about mosquitoes eyvind torfinn punctuated the observation by slapping you could even say god liked mosquitoes better than mammoths because he made so many more of them no trasamund smiled but he wasnt in a joking mood any old demon could come up with your mosquito a mammoth now a mammoth takes imagination and power isnt that so thyssen hamnet started he sprawled by the fire for no better reason than that he didnt feel like sleeping i dont know what god does or why he answered if he tells me i promise youll be the first to hear ulric skakki thought that was funny whether trasamund did or not if god talks to anybody hell probably talk to you your grace he said me i dont wonder so much where these mammoths came from i wonder who herds them and when the herders are going to show themselves havent seen anyone yet trasamund said and the mammoths seem wild how can you know that eyvind torfinn sounded curious not doubtful he usually sounded curious one of the ways we tame themas much as we do tame themis to give them berries and other things they like the jarl answered theyre clever animalsthey soon learn we have treats for them they sometimes come up and try to get treats from us whether we have any or not back in nidaros my cat will do the same thing eyvind torfinn said i dont think i would want a woolly mammoth hopping into my lap though that did make trasamund laugh but he said these mammoths dont seem to think we have berries for them so i would guess no one tames them ulric skakki made a dubious noise liv didnt look convinced either they were speaking the bizogot language so she had no trouble following along hamnet thyssen also had his doubts could people tame mammoths some different way ulric asked trasamund looked down his nose at him people could do all kinds of things the bizogot replied they could waste their time with foolish questions for instance thank you so much your ferocity ulric skakki murmured any time trasamund was too blunt to recognize sarcasm or maybe too sly to admit to recognizing it we know there are people here liv said either that or the owls in the land beyond the glacier are sorcerers in their own right she understood what sarcasm was about even if not all bizogots did trasamund refused to let it bother him maybe there are we havent seen any people here thats all i can tell you we have not seen the golden shrine either eyvind torfinn said nevertheless we are confident its here somewhere well people are probably here somewhere too trasamund allowed with a show of generosity i dont think theyre anywhere close by though you worriers are just trying to use this to get me to turn around and go back he glowered at hamnet thyssen dont look at me that way count hamnet said i didnt even take sides in this argument you know more about mammoths than i do you ought to your hide and your skull are thick enough even though he didnt say that out loud trasamund sent him another suspicious stare the bizogot was clever enough to know when someone was thinking unkind thoughts about him why wasnt he clever enough to know they were thinking those thoughts because he was acting like a fool instead of going back they went on though at the slow halfhearted pace theyd been using for quite a while one day seemed much like anotherbroad plains ahead behind and to all sides people said the sea looked that way too count hamnet couldnt speak about that hed never seen the sea he did know the low flat landscape bored him almost to the point of dozing on horseback one herd of deer one herd of mammoths one flock of ptarmigan or snow buntings came to look much like another too the travelers didnt see many of the great striped cats or enormous bears he wasnt sorry about that not even a little another reason days all seemed the same was that they blended into one another so smoothly a stretch of bright twilight for a couple of hours bracketing midnight and then the sun came up again you could travel whenever you pleased rest whenever you pleased sleep whenever you pleased and then almost before hamnet consciously realized it real night returned to the world the sun didnt come up quite so far in the northeast didnt set quite so far in the northwest it stayed below the horizon longer and dipped farther below hamnet got reacquainted with stars he hadnt seen for weeks birds sensed the change before he did the sky was a murmur sometimes a thunder of wings flocks from even farther north began coming down upon and past the travelers they knew winter was on the way though the sun still shone brightly and days were if anything warmer than they had been when summer first began when the deer began to grow restless even trasamund acknowledged that the time to think things through had come we should turn around and head for the gap again he said as if no one had ever suggested that before we are not going to find the golden shrine time to put away things of legend and remember the real world ulric skakki shook his head what a foolish idea i think we should keep on wandering west through this godforsaken country till we come to the edge of the world and fall off it trasamund glared at him is that a joke i dont hear anyone laughing then maybe its not a joke ulric answered maybe turning around is a good idea maybe it should have seemed like a good idea to you before this afternoon i know when to turn back the bizogot jarl rumbled i always said i would know when to turn back people say all sorts of things ulric skakki observed sometimes they mean them sometimes they dont you never can tell ahead of time glaring still trasamund said when we set out again come morning i will ride south and east others may do as they please anyone who wants to fall off the edge of the world is welcome to as far as i am concerned nobody will miss a slicktalking raumsdalian not one bit some folk are too clever for their own good some folk are too stupid for their own good but hamnet thyssen shook his head trasamund whatever else you could say about him was nobodys fool some folk are too stubborn for their own good yes that fit the bizogot better hamnet wondered whether trasamund would have decided to turn around sooner if he himself and ulric and liv hadnt kept trying to talk him into it he wouldnt have been surprised trasamund was just the man to dig in his heels and try to go in the direction opposite the one other people urged on him count hamnet was that kind of man himself so he recognized the symptomshere perhaps more slowly than he might have that night was the darkest one hamnet remembered since passing beyond the glacier maybe his own gloom painted the sky blacker than it was maybe the moons being down added to the way the heavens seemed uncommonly unreachable the stars small and dim and lost and maybe he was feeling something that was really in the air audun gilli and liv both woke screaming around midnight that set gudrid screaming too she only wanted to know what was going on which seemed reasonable enough but she made an ungodly lot of noise trying to find out too late audun said much too late liv agreed they stared at each other their eyes enormous and seeming filled with blood in the dim light the embers shed hamnet thyssen needed a moment to remember that neither of them understood the others speech the knowledge sent ice stabbing through him that had nothing to do with the enormous walls of ice hed passed between do you hear them your ferocity ulric skakki asked id have to be deaf not to trasamund answered which was true enough they both had nightmares so what he was not going to be impressed no matter what happened he wouldnt behe was too determined no by god count hamnet said they didnt have nightmares they had the same nightmare do you think thats good news i dont think i can do much about it any which way trasamund said and that was also true he yawnednot quite theatrically but not quite naturally either about the only thing i can do that will help at all is go back to sleep so i will if the rest of you let me he rolled himself in his blanket and turned his back on the fireand on the rest of the travelers what was it hamnet thyssen asked liv who lay closer to him than audun gilli did whatever it was it shook her enough to make her forget their quarrel it was bad she answered it was coming for us i dont know what it would have done i didnt want to find out maybe i was lucky i screamed myself awake maybe you were hamnet said if it comes onus in the waking world can we get away so easily the waking world and the other one are less separate than you seem to think the shaman said they touch they blend they mingle you cant always say for sure that something is part of the one but not of the other being a man who liked things neat and orderly with each one in its proper slot hamnet thyssen would like to have argued with her here in this land beyond the glacier here with the chill of winter in his heart he found he couldnt he couldnt sleep again either despite the snores rising from trasamund the bizogot jarl headed back toward the gap faster than hed gone before no matter what he said there in the darkness he worried about what audun gilli and liv sensed too everything seemed normal for the next couple of days trasamund swore when a herd of mammoths crossed the travelers path a moment later he swore again in awe and amazement the great beasts carried men atop them xi when trasamunds curses ran dry he said but they cant do that hamnet thyssen was inclined to agree with him the idea of herding woolly mammoths was astonishing enough from a raumsdalian point of view the idea of taming them to the point where they could be ridden count hamnet didnt know whether to be impressed or appalled he ended up both at once a stew of emotions that left him queasy some of the mammothriders carried lances long enough to skewer someone in front of their enormous mounts count hamnet wouldnt have wanted to try thathow much did one of those things weigh others had quivers on their backs still others seemed unarmed after a bit hamnet saw that they were the men actually in charge of controlling the mammoths they had irontipped bone goads with which they whacked the enormous animals to get them to do what they wanted what they wanted right then was to get a closer look at the travelers from the far side of the glacier the column of woolly mammoths swung into a line and bore down upon the raumsdalians and bizogots as smoothly as one of the emperors cavalry squadrons will you look at that trasamund murmured will you look at that he sounded as overwhelmed and as full of yearning as a boy on the edge of manhood staring at a beautiful woman and contemplating wonderful things hed never imagined before his eyes were as big and wide as the youths might have been too hamnet thyssen did not expect he would ever master the art of riding mammoths he didnt feel he was suffering any great loss either his attention focused not on the shaggy beasts but on the men who rode them he did not like their looks the closer they came the less he liked it they were not unhandsomejust the opposite in a fierce halfeagle halflion sort of way they had swarthy skins big scimitar noses proud cheekbones and gleaming dark eyes they wore their black beards in elaborate curled waves that rippled halfway down their chests and their hair in neat buns at the napes of their necks those gleaming eyes though hamnet hoped his imagination was running away with him but he did not like what he thought he saw in them the bizogots were hard they had to be living where they did where so many things were so scarce they mostly werent cruel for the sake of cruelty hamnet thyssen wasnt so sure about these strangers one of the men cupped his hands in front of his mouth and shouted something to hamnets ear it was just guttural nonsense i am sorry my friends but i dont understand you eyvind torfinn answered in raumsdalian do you speak my tongue trasamund called in the bizogot language more harshsounding gibberish came from the strangers eyvind and the bizogot jarl both spread their hands to show they could make no sense of it ulric skakki rode up alongside count hamnet and said i wonder if they would understand if audun or liv hooted like an owl i wouldnt be surprised hamnet answered one of the strangers got down from his mammoth and approached the travelers from beyond the glacier he used the beasts long hair for handholds the mammoth let him which impressed hamnet of itself the man wasnt very tall but he had some of the widest shoulders hamnet had ever seen he was built like a brick all muscle everywhere he wore furs and leather as the bizogots did but there the resemblance ended the bizogots wore clothes that fit tightly while his jacket and trousers were loose and baggy perhaps to let him stuff in extra padding if he wanted to he had on enormous felt boots into which he tucked the bottoms of his trousers with footgear so large his gait was more waddle than walk but it was an impressive waddle he stopped about twenty feet in front of trasamund and said something i dont understand you the bizogot jarl said hamnet thyssen didnt understand him either but he had a pretty good notion of what the stranger was saying if it wasnt something like who are you and what the demon are you doing on my land he would have been very surprised the stranger paused and scowled he looked as if he hated everyone in the world but especially trasamund he said the same thing over again louder this time he seemed to think everybody ought to understand his language and ought to speak it too i still dont understand you trasamund told him this time the noises the stranger made were different they seemed angrierno mean feat when his whole vocabulary sounded angry either he was calling the jarl several different kinds of idiot or he was swearing at himmaybe both at once audun gilli rode forward a few paces the stranger snarled something that sounded vile at him too and jumped back and drew a long straight sword its highly polished edge glittered in the sunlight he stood ready to fight and kill ready to attack even though audun was surely the most inoffensivelooking of the travelers no no audun even sounded inoffensive which trasamund might not have you misunderstand my friend i come in peace he held up his right hand palm opena gesture anyone on the far side of the glacier from the bizogots to the folk who dwelt in the hot countries well south of the raumsdalian empire would have understood if this stranger understood it he didnt want to let on he growled something that sounded unflattering he brandished the sword again but didnt rush the wizard he looked even more scornful than he had when he was snarling at trasamund maybe that was because audun seemed so inoffensive the bizogot at least pretty plainly knew how to take care of himself then audun said i am a sorcerer if hamnet thyssen had known he was going to do that he would have tried to stop himhe didnt want to show these people too much or anything at all before he had to he was briefly relieved to remember that the stranger seemed to know no raumsdalian maybe i can find a spell to let us understand each other audun went on as if doing his best to give count hamnet heart failure hamnet wasnt the only one who wished audun would keep his mouth shut hes a trusting soul isnt he ulric skakki whispered hes a trusting fool is what he is hamnet didnt bother keeping his voice down if audun gilli heard him he paid no attention that the mammothriding strangers could be dangerous didnt seem to cross the wizards mind he just saw them as people with whom he couldnt speakand maybe as a way to let him seem important to his comrades im a sorcerer he repeated this time he showed the badtempered barbarianso hamnet reckoned the man anyhowjust what he meant behold i shall become invisible he said as if the stranger could understand him and hamnet had no sure proof the man could not audun reached into his belt pouch and drew forth an opal the stone sparkled in the sun showing glints of red and blue and silver the wizard began to chant the opal seemed to draw more and more sunlight to itself as the spell went on it sparkled brighter and brighter before long it grew too dazzling for hamnet thyssen to look at he had to turn away and since he could not look at the stone he could not look at the man who held it either audun was effectively if not actually invisible looking away from audun gilli count hamnet looked toward liv she watched the raumsdalian wizard with avid interest her lips moved silently perhaps in a charm of her own that let her go on looking at audun and the opal after hamnet thyssen and the others close by had to avert their gaze then hamnet glanced in the strangers direction he screwed up his face and squinted at audunbetter that he seemed to say than to admit he was dazzled but at last narrowed eyes availed him no more he had to turn away when he did he shouted back toward his comrades who still sat on their mammoths one of them stirred they were more than a bowshot away so hamnet thyssen could not tell exactly what their wizard or shaman or whatever he was did whatever it was it served his purpose the opal in audun gilli s hand shattered into fragments the dazzling coruscating light that flowed from it died you see the stranger said in the bizogot tongue you think you are so high and mighty but in truth you are only a maggot like all your foul kind audun gilli stared at his hand and at the tiny bits of opal still left in it the mammothriders speech meant nothing to him because he did not speak the bizogots language but it meant something to trasamund who do you call maggot dog the jarl demanded i asked if you knew my speech and you would not give me a yes or a no i give you nothing the stranger said it is what you deserve soon enough it is what the rulers will give all who are not men trasamund turned red you say i am no man he growled the stranger nodded what am i then trasamund asked his voice suggesting bloodshed would follow if he didnt like the answer the stranger only yawned if he was trying to be offensiveand no doubt he washe was succeeding vermin he said why you flyblown son of a mammoth turd trasamund shouted he started to climb down from his horse by god ill kill you for that wait both of you eyvind torfinn said in the bizogot tongue we are newly met we should not war there is no quarrel between our folk there is a quarrel between this wretch and me trasamund said no there is no quarrel the stranger said the rulers do not quarrel with lesser breeds how could we we do not quarrel with dogs either i parshhe jabbed a thumb at his own broad chestsay this and i speak the truth we do not waste our time lying to lesser breeds either and i eyvind torfinn say you are provoking us on purpose parsh yawned in his face i care nothing for what you say soon enough your folk whoever they are will bend the knee before the rulers if they do not we will destroy them as easily as samoth there destroyed your silly wizards stone these are the people who hold the golden shrine ulric skakki whispered to count hamnet not much bothered ulricor if it did he didnt let it showbut he sounded scandalized now hamnet wasnt surprised the notion horrified him too maybe they dont he whispered back we dont know where the golden shrine is and we dont know how much land these uh rulers rule maybe they just talk big talk big they did you will come to our encampment parsh said my chief will want to see what manner of lesser men you are and if we dont care to come with you eyvind torfinn asked however you please parsh shrugged broad shoulders but in that case we will have to kill you here now he didnt sound boastful he sounded matteroffact like a man who had to talk about getting rid of mice hamnet thyssen eyed the mammoths and the men riding them he didnt like the idea of fighting warriors aboard such immense animals they outnumbered the travelers from the far side of the glacier and audun hamnet called in raumsdalian how good is their sorcerer i heard you have more than one kind of animal grunts parsh said in the bizogot tongue well that wont do you any good either he is not weak audun gilli answered reluctantly that would have been hamnets guess but he didnt want to have to go with a guess here he wanted to be sure now that he was he said lets go with them we need to learn more about them before we decide what to do when we get to wherever they camp i will take care of this parsh trasamund saidin raumsdalian the man from the rulers caught his name even if he didnt understand the words surrounding it his grin displayed strong white teeth hamnet thyssen couldnt decide whether his canines were uncommonly sharp on their own or theyd been filed to points neither notion seemed attractive to contemplate we will go with you to your camp eyvind torfinn told parsh oh what an honor parsh said the vole consents to travel with the the last word was one in his language he bowed mockingly thank you most gracious and generous vole hamnet thyssen had disliked parsh on first sight the more he saw of the stranger the more he despised him he was sure that was exactly the impression parsh was trying to create well parsh knew how to get what he wanted all right to travel with the what earl eyvind asked with the tiger parsh repeated the big striped cat are you too ignorant to know of tigers by the gods you must be fools indeed fools for putting up with your noise trasamund said he might have been less enamored of parsh than count hamnet was come the man of the rulers said come now or be killed where you stand they came the camp was not like anything hamnet thyssen expected hed looked for the same sort of dirt and disorder that always marked a bizogot encampment he didnt find them tents stood in neat rows mammoths and deer were tethered in neat lines some of the deer had saddles and reins the rulers didnt seem to ride horses come to think of it hamnet hadnt seen any horses except for the ones with his party since traveling beyond the glacier parsh hadnt shown any curiosity about them but parsh didnt seem to show curiosity the only thing he showed was arrogance that irked count hamnet it infuriated trasamund as soon as he got down from his horse he roared parsh where are you parsh you bastard child of a rabid fox and a palsied rabbit come get what you deserve he didnt have long to wait parsh marched up to him and bowed here i am creature how do you care to die name your pleasure and i will oblige you bizogot standdown trasamund said at once i do not know what foolish games barbarians play parsh said scornfully tell me what this is so i know whether it is fitting we stand here trasamund said one of us hits the other in the face then its the second mans turn last one who can still get up and swing wins for the first time since hamnet set eyes on him parsh actually looked pleased this is good sportvery good sport for a savage how generous of you to give me the chance to amuse myself so he shouted in his own guttural language his countrymen sounded interested and approving even if hamnet couldnt understand a word they said parsh returned to the bizogot tongue to ask how do we decide who goes first go ahead trasamund said as men of the rulers gathered to watch the standdown hamnet thyssen saw no women in the encampment do your worst hound and then you will see what a nothing it is hamnet wouldnt have said that not against a foe as plainly powerful as parsh he would have tried to claim the first blow or at least an even chance at it parsh actually smiled your funeral he said and likely meant that in the most literal way talk is cheap trasamund said what do you do to back it up parsh hit him hamnet thought that blow might have felled a mammoth let alone a man blood poured from trasamunds nose he swayed but quickly straightened well when will you begin he asked you fool i did parsh said oh that i thought you sneezed the bizogot jarl said samoth the wizard or shaman or whatever he was turned trasamunds words into the language of the rulers the strangers buzzed among themselves they clearly werent used to outsiders as proud as themselves trasamund went on well then ill just have to hit you back parsh didnt flinch from the blow he did stagger he bled from the nose too his seemed to have changed shape but he managed a laugh a mosquito bit me he said any that did would sick you up afterwards trasamund jeered parsh hit him again his head snapped back he spat blood and a tooth keep at it he told parsh you may wake me yet he slugged the man from beyond the glacier parsh lurched and blinked a couple of times a love pat he said thickly and then he too spat red you dream trasamund said for i love you not then lovethis parsh threw another right trasamund went to one knee slowly he got to his feet he shook his head as if to clear it parsh looked quite humanly surprisedhe hadnt thought the bizogot would be able to stand up trasamund shook his head i love it so well ill give you one like it he shook his head again no ill give you one better he smashed his fist into parshs face the man from the rulers swayed but stayed upright even so the nasty light in his eyes went out he wasnt enjoying the game any more only hoping to get through itas trasamund was it went on for a long painful miserable time both trasamund and parsh went down repeatedly each man struggled to his feet each time parsh kept punching with his right hand after a while trasamund switched to his left trasamunds traveling companions stayed quiet through the contest the men of the rulers cheered parsh at first as it became clear the victory wouldnt be easy if it came at all they subsided into uneasy silence too one of trasamunds eyes was swollen shut he could open the other one a little he peered through what had to be a blurry slit at parsh who was in no better shape here the bizogot mumbled through pulped and puffy lips this time he cocked his left fist parsh watched it with fearful concentration maybe he saw that trasamund was putting everything he had left into this one blow for as the bizogots left fist shot forward parsh started to duck he wasnt quick enough not after the punishment hed already taken the blow caught him square on the point of the chin he crumpled and lay motionless aii trasamund groaned i think ive gone and broken my other hand now that would have mattered had the fight gone on but parsh could not get up for a moment hamnet thyssen wondered if he was dead only the slow rise and fall of his chest said life still smoldered in him trasamund turned away wait the wizard from the rulershis name was samothsaid in the bizogot tongue what for trasamund could hardly stand on his own feet let alone talk his wits had to be scrambled hed taken a fearful beating that hed given a worse one seemed almost beside the point you beat him samoth said now kill him what the demon for trasamund said this wasnt to the death it was last man standing here i am god knows how but here i am he almost knocked my head off a couple of times there now that hed won he could pay tribute to a formidable foe but samoth shook his head when we fight we fight to the death anything less is a disgrace he would have killed you you would do him a favor by killing him that he should lose to a lesser breed he translated his words into the gutturals his own folk used their fierce faces somber the men of the rulers nodded no trasamund shook his headand almost fell over on account of it thats his worry not mine i dont want his blood now i just want to wash mine off my face and to tie up my hands where have you got some water and maybe some cloth or some leather lashings i will take you samoth said reluctant respect in his voice come with me trasamund walked with the rolling lurching gait of a drunk that he walked at all amazed hamnet thyssen after what the bizogot jarl had taken his being alive amazed count hamnet maybe id better go along ulric skakki remarked just to make sure everything is on the up and up not a bad idea hamnet said silent as a snowy owl ulric slipped away hamnet waited by parsh curious to see what would happen when the savage woke up and found he had lost after a quarter of an hour one of the rulers poured a mammothhide bucket of water over parshs head parsh moaned and spluttered and jerked his eyes came open he looked around and realized he was lying on the ground horror on his smashed face he did his best to stand he needed three tries before making it to his feet even then he swayed like a tall tree in a storm where is the bizogot he asked blurrily did he fall if he didnt i will hit him again no one answered when he spoke the bizogot tongue increasing alarm in his voice he asked what was probably the same question in his own language one of his countrymen gave back a few scornful words parsh shook his head he said something else the other man of the rulers turned his back on him parsh swung toward hamnet thyssen is it so can it be so he asked in the bizogot language did he beat me how could he beat me he beat you hamnet answered your chin was strong but his was stronger one of the lesser breeds cannot beat a man of the rulers it cannot be done parsh said his own battered state was proof positive that it could be done but he seemed to be talking about laws of nature not particular cases he shook his head then grimaced after the beating hed taken he had to wish he were dead hamnet thyssen had reason to remember that thought it cannot be done parsh repeated it was count hamnet said instead of answering parsh looked at his countryman who kept on giving him his back that seemed to make up his mind for him it cannot be done he said for the third time i must make amends he pulled his belt knife from its sheath and stared at the blade if hed tried to go after trasamund count hamnet would have stopped him hamnet didnt think that would be hard parsh could barely walk and speak let alone fight but the man of the rulers did nothing of the sort he spat between his own feet a gesture of vast contempt then he looked up into the skyand then before hamnet or anyone else could stop him he slashed the knife across his throat blood spurted scarlet in the afternoon sun parsh crumpled no one could hope to stanch that wound the man of the rulers thrashed on the ground for a little while then lay still in death only after he died did his comrade deign to turn around and acknowledge him again the other man of the rulers closed the dead and staring eyes he said something in his own language i dont understand you hamnet thyssen said which was true on every level he could think of parshs countryman spread his hands to show he knew nothing of the bizogot language trasamund and samoth returned a few minutes later samoth eyed parsh without surprise redeemed himself did he the wizard said by god trasamund muttered you are a hardhearted folk he looked down at his bandaged hands and a hardheaded folk too do you want his weapons samoth asked such is the rule when one of us beats another i do not know what the rule is when someone of a lesser breed beats a man of the rulers i do not think it happens enough for us to need a rule that was a compliment of sorts maybe the bizogot jarl would have been wiser to show he saw as much or maybe not the rulers arrogant themselves seemed to appreciate arrogance in otherswhen those others could back it up trasamund had i didnt mean for him to die he said peering through puffed and slitted eyes at parshs gory corpse i only wanted to wipe out an insult what better way to wipe it out than in blood samoth returned trasamund shrugged then he grimaced even the little motion had to hurt had trasamund not beaten parsh hamnet thyssen wondered if the rulers would have fed the bizogots and raumsdalians as things were the men from beyond the glacier treated the travelers if not like themselves then at least with a certain circumspection we may be beasts count hamnet thought but weve shown were beasts with claws and fangs the meat came from the deer that roamed these plains maybe the rulers were fancy cooks in encampments that held women and children here by themselves the warriors cooked about the same way bizogots or raumsdalian soldiers would havethey roasted their meat over flames the flames came from a fire of dried dung as they would have in the bizogot country instead of holding the meat on sticks the men used skewers made from mammoth bone again the bizogots would have done something similar though they sometimes got wood in trade from the empire hamnet thyssen judged no trees grew anywhere close to lands the rulers ruled they did have salt perhaps the edge of a sea lay not too far off or perhaps it came from an outcrop of rock salt and they had spices the likes of which none of the travelers had ever tasted the black flakes the curlybearded men sprinkled on the meat reminded hamnet thyssen of chills because they bit the tongue but their flavor was different eyvind torfinn thought so too what do you call this spice he asked the leader of the rulers a hawkfaced middleaged man named roypar roypar scratched his cheek and then tugged at the gold hoop he wore in his left ear none of the other men of the rulers wore such an ornament was it a badge of rank a sign of wealth was there a difference count hamnet wasnt sure about that even among raumsdalians among the rulers he could only guess is name of pepper roypar answered he spoke only a little of the bizogot tongue in any case the important word came from his own speech pepper earl eyvind repeated the unfamiliar name several times roypar nodded over meat he seemed less ferocious than his fellows had before do you raise this yourself eyvind inquired or do you trade for it trade roypar said is come from far away he pointed south and west far far away many days many months i see eyvind torfinn said gravely and how far in that direction do the rulers rule long way very long way roypar replied was he clever enough to dodge eyvinds probe or too naive to notice it was a probe at all hamnet thyssen couldnt tell that made him guess roypar might be clever even if he had no proof eyvind went on and do you have it in mind to stretch your rule to the south and east now that there is a way through the glacier now roypar looked at him as if he were a witling well of course said the chieftain or officer or whatever he was of course we are the rulers where we can reach we rule anyone who tries to rule the bizogots will be sorry trasamund said his voice was still a thick mumble through split and swollen lips maybe you can kill us maybe we kill you instead the roasted venison was tough he chewed slowly and carefully and on the side where he hadnt just lost a tooth maybe that wasnt roypar it was samoth the sorcerer you are strong you are fierce but your magiche sneeredyour magic is nothing much audun ciilli had no idea what he was saying the raumsdalian wizard knew nothing of the bizogot language liv of course understood samoth well enough shed said next to nothing herself up till then now swallowing a bite of meat she looked across the smoky fire at samoth and hooted three times like an owl he jerked as if bitten by a mosquito the size of a falcon so you had somewhat to do with that did you he growled his comrades who could follow the bizogot tongue sent him curious looks maybe he hadnt told them hed had to fly from the travelers magic down in the gap liv gave him a sweet smile why yes she said all innocence we did samoth muttered into his curled mat of beard hamnet thyssen sent liv a small nod he thought shed found a fine way to prick the rulers pomposity they were so very very sure of themselvesanything that made them doubt was bound to be on the right track ulric skakki was sitting next to audun when the wizard whispered to him he provided a translation he hadnt spoken long before audun gilli twitched as violently as samoth had nothing much audun said in raumsdalian by god ill youll shut up is what youll bloody well do ulric said much more sharply than he was in the habit of speaking audun blinked at him and then did shut up though his eyes said he didnt understand why ulric required it of him hamnet thyssen did ulric skakkis little finger understood more of intrigue than all of audun gilli put together if audun showed samoth how good a wizard he could be that would alert the rulers to a problem they didnt know they had right now and hamnet thyssen also saw something he wasnt sure whether either ulric or audun did if audun tried to impress samoth and failed again as hed failed with the opal that would give the travelers a serious problem so you aim to bring our folk under your rule do you eyvind torfinn asked roypar now the count frowned wondering if the other raumsdalian noble wasnt pushing too hard is right roypar said complacently the rulers ruled other folk to him that was a law of nature voice elaborately casual eyvind torfinn went on perhaps you would do well to let us return to the south then so the bizogot jarls and my emperor apprised of your imminent arrival can prepare for you the most appropriate and honorable reception count hamnet suddenly stopped thinking of eyvind as an old man wise only in the things that had to do with books he was an intriguer in his own right ulric skakkis abrupt alertness argued that he was thinking the same thing by the smug look on roypars face he thought eyvind torfinn meant the bizogots and the raumsdalian empire would get ready to surrender as soon as they found out the rulers were on the way hamnet thyssen would have been mightily surprised if that was what earl eyvind really had in mind would parsh have seen otherwise he was much more fluent in the bizogots language which argued that he had understood foreigners better than his superior it didnt matter now though not when he was deadhe hadnt understood trasamund or at least the strength of trasamunds jaws and of his fists well enough samoth stirred the wizard said something in the language of the rulers have to learn that tongue if i can hamnet thyssen thought roypar snorted and shook his head samoth spoke again more urgently this time he saw that eyvind torfinn wasnt as submissive as he seemed he saw it yes but he couldnt make roypar see it the chieftain sounded angry when he answered this time samoth bit his lip he muttered into his beard then subsidedfor the moment a couple of men of the rulers stirred and eyed roypar in exactly the same way hamnet thyssen would have eyed him if hed belonged to their folk a leader who got a wizard angry at him was either a man of extraordinary personal qualities and confidence or a blustering blowhard which was roypar hamnet admitted he couldnt know judging a man hed just met a man from a folk with whom he was not in the least familiar a man who barely had a language in common with him was a fools game well arent i a fool hamnet asked himself with wry amusementthe only kind he knew these days his gaze flickered to gudrid she was watching roypar with the sort of fascination that raised count hamnets hackles he quickly looked away his eyes went to the chieftain too he thought a clever man would have seen through eyvind torfinns ploy so maybe hed been wrong before samoth had seen through itand much good it did him you go south yes roypar said you go you tell your folk the rulers come you tell bring out gold bring out women bring out fine mammoths fine deer for rulers to take deer eyvind torfinns frown said he wasnt sure hed understood the stranger deer roypar nodded for riding deer oh of course deer butter wouldnt have melted in earl eyvinds mouth no the rulers knew nothing of horses hamnet thyssen didnt know much of the deer they rode either but the animals werent as large as horses and didnt seem as strong on the other hand the rulers could do things with mammoths that even the bizogots only dreamt of strangers hamnet thought it was a truth he always had to bear in mind the bizogots were cousins to the raumsdalians all the folk south of the glacier were in effect their neighbors if not their kin but had his folks ancestors ever had anything to do with the forebears of the rulers surely not since the glacier last ground down out of the north how long ago was that how many thousands of years had gone by since count hamnet had no idea eyvind torfinn might be able to make a pretty good guess so might audun gilli come to that sorcerers needed a better notion of the distant past than most people it was a long long long timehamnet was sure of that roypar pointed toward the travelers horses which were tied alongside the riding deer the rulers used why you cut horns off your big deer he asked you no use horns to fight with no he didnt understand about horses at all neither did samoth who said and how did you remove the antlers so neatly there is no trace of a scar after we rule you that is a trick your leeches must show us he had as much confidence as any other man of the rulers there is no trick i fear hamnet thyssen said the animals are born without antlers he didnt see how the truth could hurt here samoth smiledunpleasantly i might have guessed not likely that the lesser breeds could know anything important that we do not none of the travelers said anything even if they had samoth and the rest of the rulers there wouldnt have heeded them the rulers knew what they knew and didnt want to know anything elseeven if it happened to be true later in the evening hamnet thyssen noticed roypar trying to talk to someone who spoke even less of the bizogots tongue than he did hamnet took a couple of steps toward the chieftain thinking to be helpful then he heard gudrids throaty chuckle and drew back without drawing roypar s notice or hers he slept not a wink all night xii we will ride south and east eyvind torfinn said no irony audible in his voice we will let the other bizogot jarls and the raumsdalian emperor know that the rulers follow behind us we will make sure our lands are ready to meet you as you deserve is good roypar said is very good by samoths expression he didnt think it was very good but he held his peace roypar led here anyone else challenged him at his own peril parshs body lay where it had fallen will you burn him hamnet thyssen asked what is your custom with your dead he will lie there till the foxes and bears and tigers have feasted on him samoth answered he failed as a manhe deserves nothing better than to feed beasts no doubt his spirit when it is born again will be born into the body of such a one you believe in reincarnation then eyvind torfinn asked eagerly have you evidence to support your belief trasamund and hamnet thyssen had to drag eyvind away from the wizard of the rulers if they hadnt he would not have ridden south and east he would have stayed there and plied samoth with questions for as long as the sorcerer could stand it hamnet glanced over to roypar the chieftain looked unmistakably pleased with himself the rulers thought of themselves as conquerors beyond compare had he lain with a woman of a lesser breed the night before hamnet guessed he had gudrid showed nothing one way or the other she was good at making her indiscretions discreetunless she dropped the mask and showed them off hamnet looked away she laughed softly so she knew what he was thinking did she shed always been good at that hamnet thyssen turned his back which only made her laugh again louder this time too bad he thought roypar really did let them ride away that surprised count hamnet it seemed to surprise and dismay samoth who muttered into his thicket of beard the way he muttered sparked suspicion in hamnet even before the rulers encampment dropped below the horizon behind the travelers he rode over first to audun gilli and then to liv asking each of them is the wizard back there tracking us by magic are we taking along some little spell that lets him spy on us he had to repeat himself using raumsdalian and then the bizogots language lie wished the two people among the travelers who knew sorcery could understand each other as happened too often in life what he wished for had nothing to do with what he got ulric skakki understood him both times he asked the question you have a nasty distrustful turn of mind your grace ulric saidin the bizogot language a choice hamnet found interesting i only wish id thought of that myself dont worry hamnet said you would have before long that kind of spell is possible i suppose audun gilli didnt seem to think samoth had actually done such a thing liv did yes of course a sorcerous flea you might say coming along with us maybe it will bite too when the time is right can you find it count hamnet asked can you kill it again he had to use the mammothherders language and then his own so did ulric skakki when he added can you find it and kill it without letting samoth know its gone hamnet thyssen thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand now he was angry that ulric had an idea before he did who knows what all shamanry the strangers have liv said they think it is stronger than ours they may be rightremember how samoth shattered auduns opal but we can try what does she say audun gilli asked i heard my name in that whatever it was when count hamnet translated for him he sniffed i am sure i could have stopped samoth if id been looking for him to do that liv worries over nothing now the bizogot shaman wondered why audun was using her name hamnet thyssen turned auduns words into her tongue she sniffed on a note almost identical to the one the raumsdalian sorcerer had used he says i worry over nothing does he well he thinks there is nothing to worry about and that worries me it worried hamnet thyssen too having the two sorcerers squabble again also worried him the more so since they had to do their squabbling through him or through ulric hoping to distract them he said the flea first in the bizogot language then in raumsdalian trust a bizogot to think of fleas audun said since he was scratching as he spokehe didnt seem to notice he was doing ithe proved raumsdalians werent immune to the pests count hamnet s itches already told him that never mind the snide cracks ulric said can you find the magic now he used raumsdalian and didnt translate for liv she sent hamnet a look of appeal he didnt translate either she glared at him if it is here it should be simple enough to find audun gilli said please go ahead and do it then hamnet thyssen said and then to liv i would also like you to check by now he was resigned to going back and forth between languages i will do it if audun fails the bizogot shaman glanced over at the raumsdalian wizard i wish we could understand each other it might mean much if we have to work together would you teach me raumsdalian hamnet thyssen if you like count hamnet answered you will have to learn the fancy magical terms from audun though i might make mistakes and mistakes in that kind of thing can be dangerous i am no wizard but at least i know it youre right liv said i should have started learning your language a long time ago but you and i didnt always get on well ulric skakki could have taught you or eyvind torfinnor trasamund come to that hamnet said i think you are more patient than they are liv said hamnet doubted whether anyone in the world was more patient than eyvind torfinn he didnt want to say so not when liv paid him such a compliment audun gilli meanwhile was rummaging through the pouches he wore on his belt he muttered and mumbled as he rummagedall in all he might have posed for a picture of a distracted wizard at last though he came up with what he needed and seemed to come back to the real world here is the dried head of a plover he said and held it up hamnet thyssen looked away from the sunken eye sockets audun gilli went on it has the virtue that if used with the proper spell it prevents deception what does he say liv asked hamnet translated for her she nodded though a little doubtfully we use a different bird for what sounds like the same charm she said and a certain stone as well she shrugged well let us see what his shamanry shows audun gilli held up the plovers head in his left hand he made passes with his right while chanting in raumsdalian almost too oldfashioned for count hamnet to understand a moment later hamnet blinked were the birds eyes suddenly bright and shiny and full of life so it seemed and the dead dried plovers head cried out tooa shrill piping such as the live bird might have used when frightened well well audun gillis voice rose in surprise we do have ourselves a flea you might say where hamnet thyssen asked that will take another charm the wizard replied he might have asked the plovers head a question and it seemed to answer him and to twist in his hand to point the way it pointed straight toward the horse gudrid was riding well well audun gilli said again this could be ah awkward yes hamnet thyssen was even less eager to break the news to his former wife than audun seemed to be liv couldnt do it she and gudrid had no language in common hamnet looked at ulric skakki would you be so kind as to ill remember you in my nightmares ulric said with a grimace but he rode over to gudrid she accepted his arrival as no less than her due the way she looked at the world everything revolved around her and paid her tribute ulric spoke hamnet thyssen couldnt make out exactly what he said despite morbid curiosity the raumsdalian noble didnt go close enough to eavesdrop count hamnet did note the exact instant when ulric shifted from pleasantries and small talk to the reason hed gone over to gudrid she stiffened in the saddle then started to laugh but thats ridiculous she saidhamnet had no trouble hearing her shaking his head ulric skakki went on talking quietly doing his best to explain why it wasnt ridiculous his best wasnt going to be good enough hamnet knew his former wife well enough to be sure of that and he was right gudrid shook her head too i dont know where you get your ideas she said but you can go and put them back there again because you dont have the faintest notion what youre talking about she made as if to ride away from ulric skakki he was not so easily detached unlike gudrid he still didnt make a lot of noise but he did point in eyvind torfinns direction earl eyvind was chatting with jesper fletti and not paying any particular attention to gudrid at the moment hamnet thyssen had a pretty good notion of what ulric was saying dont be difficult or ill tell your husband what you were doing last night if that wasnt it count hamnet would have been astonished gudrid was astonished but not in any pleasant way you wouldnt dare she said shrilly that was the wrong answer to give ulric skakki he twitched the reins and guided his horse away from hers toward eyvind torfinns wait gudrid screeched courteously ulric did wait the look gudrid sent him was anything but courteous ulric was either made of stern stuff or a fine actormaybe bothbecause he seemed undamaged do what you want to do gudrid snapped and she might have added and demons take you afterwards again ulric affected not to notice he bowed in the saddle and said something else too low for hamnet to catch then he turned and called liv sweetheart would you do the honors here he used raumsdalian even though liv didnt speak it but she had no trouble with his comehither gesture and gudrid of course understood both the gesture and the words she had plenty of reasons for disliking liv chief among them that the bizogot shaman was the only other woman in the party and now liv was going to do something sorcerous around her and she couldnt stop it she had to hate that hamnet thyssen almost sent ulric a formal salute the adventurer had found a very smooth way to avenge himself liv smiled at gudrid and kept the smile although gudrid didnt return it even without a language in common liv was bound to know some of what gudrid felt what did she feel herself hamnet had never had the nerve to ask her for the moment the bizogot woman seemed all business she murmured to herself and made several swift passes at gudrid and the horse ah she said brightly there it is hamnet and ulric understood her gudrid didnt liv pointed at gudrid s tunic she gestured take it off what gudrid didnt speak the bizogot language but that wasnt all that kept her from understanding ulric skakki translated for her what she said again take off my clothes for this chit of a girl no if you didnt take off your clothes for the ruler we wouldnt have this worry now hamnet thought he almost said it out loud to his surprise he didnt he liked eyvind torfinn better than hed ever imagined he could and didnt care to shame the older man liv had no trouble figuring out what no meant even if she knew hardly any raumsdalian she didnt argue with gudrid she just dragged her off her horse gudrid let out a startled squawk both women thumped down on the dirt gudrid tried to fight back but shed never really learned how liv knew exactly what she was doing gudrid screamed and swore which helped her not a bit the bizogot shaman quickly and efficiently stripped the tunic off herand if she gave her a black eye and a split lip while she did it wasnt she entitled to a little fun gudrid was bare beneath the thick wool tunic hamnet thyssen set his jaw and looked away he knew what gudrids breasts were likeknew them by sight knew them by touch knew them by taste he also knew he would never touch or taste them again and he had no interest in seeing them again under such circumstancesor maybe he couldnt stand to look liv seemed to care about as much for gudrids charms as she would have for those of a musk ox she murmured a spell over the tunic suddenly she stiffened here it is she said just a little fetish but it will do what on earth is going on eyvind torfinn said ulric skakki and audun gilli did the explaining despite his regard for earl eyvind hamnet didnt have the heartor the stomachfor the job he also wanted to involve himself with gudrid as little as he could she screeched at her husband but warily she didnt want him to know what shed been doing the night before no one else seemed eager to tell him but that didnt mean no one would eyvind torfinn plucked at his beard this would have been easier if youd given the shaman your tunic without kicking up such a fuss my dear he said at last but she was rude she was horrid gudrid said liv meanwhile had detached the fetish and was eyeing it with what looked like professional admiration an ermines eye and a young hares ear she said the spell that animates them is not one i would use but i am sure it will do the job samoth has no trouble spying on us as long as we carry this no trouble at all he will know just where we are are there any more charms on the tunic eyvind torfinn said in the bizogot tongue if there are none will you please give it back to my wife and let her dress oh very well liv plainly didnt think gudrid deserved to wear the tunic she all but threw it at the raumsdalian woman gudrid pulled it on the look she gave liv would have melted lead you may want to be careful hamnet thyssen said in the bizogot tongue you have embarrassed her she will look for revenge she is welcome to look liv said indifferently people look for all kinds of things whether they find them that is another story audun gilli came up and examined the fetish slowly he nodded oh yes not one i recognize in detail but the principle is plain he scratched his head as often happened what started as a thoughtful gesture turned into a hunt after crushing something between his nails he went on we should not destroy this he is right liv said after hamnet translated that samoth would surely sense it if we did audun gilli began to whistle the tune was strange and discordant hardly a tune at all hamnet thyssen thought till a shorteared arctic fox walked up to audun the wizard patted the animal as if it were a dog it let him touch it it even wagged its tail then he took a rawhide lashing and tied the fetish around the foxs neck that done he whistled a different tune the fox suddenly seemed to realize where it was and the company it was keeping with a horrified yip it dashed away not bad liv said not bad at all the shaman of the rulers will realize something is wrong when he tries to listen with the hares ear but that may take a while we spoke mostly raumsdalian here and he does not know that tongue after translating again hamnet thyssen said their wizard does not admit to knowing our tongue anyhow does roypar speak raumsdalian gudrid no she answered automatically then she backtracked i mean how the demon do i know whether he does or not you have a better chance of knowing than any of the rest of us count hamnet said in a voice with no expression at all to it the glare gudrid sent him made the ones shed given liv seem downright loving by comparison eyvind torfinn looked as if he wanted to ask questions if he had hamnet wouldnt have lied to him though he knew the older man might not believe everythingor anythinghe said his home truths would have made gudrid even happier than she was already but earl eyvind seemed to think better of it maybe he would question gudrid in private maybe as he looked to have done before he would decide he didnt really want to know whatever his reasons he stayed quiet the travelers resumed their journey toward the gap samoth could not spy on them any more hamnet thyssen hoped he couldnt anyhow summer up in the bizogot country was a brief and fragile flower one that bloomed late and withered early even in and around nidaros the breath of god could blight crops in almost any month of the year knowing all that hamnet was still shocked by how fast the weather turnedand turned on the travelershere beyond the glacier birds streaming south were the first warning only a few days after they fled the earliest snow flurries dappled the plain the sun came out again and melted the snow but more fell a couple of days after that the sun came out once more this time though the snow stuck longer hamnet thyssen could see his breath even at noon something in the sky had changed leaden was too strong a word but he could tell at a glance it would not be warm again for a long time trasamund took snow in stride but even he kept looking north we want to get as far as we can before the first blizzard catches us he said blizzards gudrid made it into a curseblizzards did curse this northern country why did i ever decide to come here to drive me mad hamnet thyssen thought that was not mere sarcasm he was all too sure he had the right of it but shed finally had more discomfort and danger than even tormenting him was worth she should have thought of that sooner they were still on the far side of the gap she might need to go through quite a bit more before they got back to the bizogot country let alone anything resembling civilization the travelers had to stop to let a herd of buffalo pass in front of them as trasamund had said back in sigvats chambers these were bigger beasts than the ones that roamed the prairies of the raumsdalian empire they were a lighter brown than theircousinson the other side of the glacier and their horns at least three times as long as those of the animals hamnet thyssen knew swept out and forward instead of curling up we dont want to spook them ulric skakki said his foxy features twisted in distaste that could be unpleasant theyd squash us flatter than a herd of mammoths could trasamund said there are a lot more of them packs of wolves trotted along with the buffalo prowling after stragglers again as trasamund had said the wolves on this side of the glacier were smaller than dire wolves but they seemed quicker and more agile like woods wolves back home hamnet thyssen also saw a a tiger the rulers had called it it might be able to pull down a buffalo all by itself but it moved aside when the wolves came too close it could kill several of them without a doubt just as certainly it was no match for a pack an hour and a half went by before the last stragglers from the buffalo herd ambled past well eyvind torfinn remarked we have all the dung we needor we would il it were dry trasamund didnt see the joke plenty more thats been on the ground for a while when it came to survival he was altogether singleminded and he was right the travelers had no trouble finding fuel for the evenings fire as usual they set out sentries all around maybe roypars wasnt the only band of rulers in this part of the plain maybe other kinds of men lived around here too strangers couldnt be sure better to take no chances one of the guardsmen whod come north with jesper fletti and gudrid shook hamnet thyssen awake in the middle of the night sorry your grace the man murmured but im glad to get some sleep myself its all right hamnet said around a yawn well its not all right but its necessary he yawned again and climbed to his feet to make sure he didnt go back to sleep he went out and took a position a bowshot away from the fire it was cool out there but not really cold they seemed to be between storms but another one was coming the gibbous moon wore a halo that meant rain or snow down on the other side of the glacier he had no reason to think things worked differently here and the air smelled and tasted damp tomorrow afternoon maybe tomorrow night that was his guess off in the distance a wolf howled and then another and another and another till it sounded as if a chorus of demons were howling at the haloed moon these wolves had voices higher and shriller than those of the dire wolves he was used to which to his ear only made them all the more unearthly i suppose theyre wolves he thought uneasily with only his ears to guide him he couldnt prove they werent demons but hed seen wolves trailing the longhorned buffalo and he hadnt seen any demonsor he couldnt prove he had anyhow the chorus of yowls and yips and howls quieted then picked up again even louder and wilder than before it went on and on hamnet thyssen looked back toward his comrades how anyone could sleep through that hellish racket was beyond him but they seemed to have no trouble once he thought he heard an owl through the wolves din that really alarmed him where the wolves only annoyed him the wolves might possibly be demons but even if they were he had no reason to think they were more interested in the travelers from the far side of the glacier than in say the rulers a seeming owl though might be samoth the wizard in owls plumage flying out after the travelers on discovering his fetish had failed hamnet thyssen peered into the night looking now this way now that try as he would he couldnt spot the owl if owl it was he muttered to himself wondering what that meant was it just an owl that called once and then fell silent or was it samoth mocking him mocking all the travelers and trying to spook him if it was the wizard he was doing a good job hamnet chuckled mirthlessly even if it wasnt the wizard he was still doing a good job because count hamnet was searching for the owl that might or might not have been there he didnt notice soft footsteps behind him till they drew very close then he whirled hand flashing to the hilt of his sword who the he blurted and then went on oh its you he felt foolish yes its me liv said quietly im sorry i didnt mean to startle you its all right hamnet said you shouldnt have startled me i should have heard you coming sooner now he was angry at himself not at the bizogot shaman the wolves woke me she pointed back toward the fire which had died back to embers the others are snoring away i dont know how they do it i was thinking the same thing not long ago count hamnet said did you hear the owl too liv nodded i hope it was only an owl hamnet almost told her that thought matched his too but judged her too likely to know it already she went on i think it was but even if it wasnt weve made samoth work harder than he expected to showing him were not to be despised cant hurt i hadnt looked at it that way hamnet said of course hell despise us anyway we arent of the rulers so how can he help it they make much of themselves sure enough livs voice was troubled i hope they dont have good reason for their bragging and boasting and preening from what ive seen people who brag a lot are usually trying to convince themselves even more than other people hamnet said yes thats so its one of the things shamans find out about people liv cocked her head to one side how did you come to see it by getting to be as old as i am and keeping my eyes open hamnet answered with a shrug i dont know what else to tell you plenty of people older than you who never notice such things the bizogot shaman said hamnet thyssen shrugged plenty of people are fools he laughed harshly im a fool too but not that particular way you can be a fool all kinds of different ways how are you a fool livs voice was serious she really meant the question but hamnet thyssen only laughed some more on an even more bitter note than before how do you think shes asleep over there by the fire liv glanced back toward the rest of the travelers how long since the two of you parted sometimes it seems like a thousand years sometimes it seems as if it happened this afternoon he said sometimes it seems like both at once its worst then she is liv paused looking for words if she were a bizogot she wouldnt last long you raumsdalians have more room for useless people than we do gudrids not useless hamnet thyssens mouth twisted ask eyvind torfinn if you think im wrong ask trasamund ask audun gilli go back and ask roypar god you can ask me too he remembered the last time hed lain with her he hadnt known it would be the last then i should have he thought she yawned when we finished and she wasnt sleepy shed slipped out of the castle the next day he hadnt seen her since only heard about her till sigvat ii summoned him to nidaros in the pale moonlight livs face was unreadable you never found another woman after that plainly she said i sleep with women now and again you know i do hamnet said that isnt what i meant she said you never found one who mattered to you no i never did hamnet thyssen agreed i cant say ive looked very hard though if things go wrong once thats bad if things go wrong more than once if things go wrong more than once why do you go on living why do you think they would go wrong liv asked why because they already did once i have practice being stupid you might say hamnet tried to make a sour joke of it even with that he was surprised to be saying as much as he was not all women are like gudrid liv said no doubt youre right he answered but how do i tell beforehand i didnt think gudrid was like gudrid either you know do you think i am like her liv asked quietly he laughed once more this time in sheer surprise no he answered i can think of a lot of things i might say about you but that isnt one of them well then she said well thenwhat but he needed only a heartbeat to realize he was being thick he put an arm around liv she sighed and pressed herself against him are you sure he asked how can anyone ever be sure she said the chance seems good though and if you dont bet how do you expect to win hamnet thyssen didnt look at things that way to him not betting meant you couldnt lose he hadnt even thought of winning he still didnt not really he wondered how badly he would get hurt some time later on but later didnt seem to matter not right this minute he bent his head to livnot very far because she was a tall woman nothing either one of them did after that was surprisingonly the things men and women have done as long as there have been men and women they surprised each other a few times because neither of them knew the other that way those werent bad surprises they were both trying to see what pleased the other easy there hamnet whispered after liv dropped to her knees not too much of that or she paused i wouldnt mind i would he said and laid her down on the clothes theyd shed she inhaled sharply when he went into her and wrapped her arms and legs around him he thought he would spend himself almost at once especially after what shed been doing but instead he went on and on almost as if he were outside himself livs breath came short her back arched he covered her mouth with his when she started to cry outthat might have brought the other travelers on the run her joy came and then a moment later his she kissed him on the end of the nose then she said youre squashing me sounding well squashed sorry he took his weight on his elbows and then leaned back onto his knees all at once he noticed it was chilly it must have been chilly all along but hed had other things on his mind wed better get dressed he said yes i suppose so liv seemed sorry which made him feel about ten feet tall then she remarked that woman was the fool which made him wonder why he didnt float off the ground and drift away on the breeze he glanced back toward the fire no one was stirring around it either the other travelers hadnt noticed what was going on or they were too polite to let on that they had which didnt matter to hamnet thyssen hardly anything mattered to him right then there you see liv effortlessly picked up the conversation it just makes things better for a while for a while hamnet admitted liv laughed thats all it does she said im not trying to steal your soul or anything like that no eh hamnet thyssen wanted to laugh too and happily which didnt happen every dayor every month either you may have anyhow he meant it for a joke it didnt come out like one she shook her head that wouldnt be good i have enough trouble taking care of myself i dont want to take care of anyone else youd better be careful he said why if you arent well end up getting along who knows how much trouble that might cause oh liv smiled she squeezed his hand ill take the chance and now i think id better go back by the fire before anyone else wakes up and notices im gone good idea but i think people will notice anyway before long hamnet said do you why should they because im going to be wandering around with a foolish grin on my face and ive never done that before he answered i dont care who knows liv said i wouldnt have done it if i did do you when gudrid finds out shell try to find some way to spoil things for a moment count hamnet sounded as mournful as he usually did what can she do liv sniffed scornfully hamnet thyssen only shrugged liv sniffed again and stood on tiptoe to kiss him and walked back toward the fire he didnt want to let her go but the moon and the slowwheeling stars said he had to stay on watch a while longer before he went back clouds rolled out of the northwest and hid the moon and stars after that he was on his own guessing the hour the storm hed seen coming in the halo around the moon was here before hed expected it he went back when he thought it was midnight and cautiously shook ulric skakki awake being cautious when waking ulric was a good idea the adventurer had a habit of rousing in a hurry and with a weapon in his handsometimes with a weapon in each hand here he just grunted and groaned and yawned much as hamnet thyssen might have is it that time already he asked around another yawn somewhere close anyhow hamnet waved at the cloudy sky were going to get the bad weather sooner than i thought it has that look doesnt it yawning one more time ulric skakki got to his feet well if it starts snowing too hard to let me see my way back here ill just scream my head off you do that count hamnet said ulric clapped him on the back and trudged away from the dimmed remains of the fire theyd both been joking and not joking at the same time snowstorms like that werent impossible up here any more than they were in the bizogot country or in the northern reaches of the empire hamnet didnt think this storm would be one of thosethe wind didnt have that sawtoothed edge to itbut you never could tell you never can tell he told himself as he rolled himself in his mammothhide blanket of all the things he hadnt looked for finding happiness even if it proved only a few minutes of happinesshere beyond the glacier stood high on the list looked for or not here it was and he would have to figure out what to do about it so would gudrid no matter what liv thought she hadnt left him to make him happy shed left for her own sake well too bad he mumbled and fell asleep xlll it was snowing when he woke up the next morning fat white flakes danced in the air nothing else in all the world moved like snow on the breeze if he hadnt seen too much of it he might have marveled more im old and jaded he thought his joints creaked as he climbed to his feet and stretched but he didnt feel old and jaded when he looked over toward liv she was already awake and talking to trasamund she broke off to nod and smile and wave to hamnet he smiled back he no doubt grinned like a fool as hed thought he might he didnt care when had he last made love with a woman who mattered to him as a person who wasnt just a willing body when his urges got too strong to ignore the last time he made love with gudridthat was when hed had nothing but relief since hed nearlymore than nearlygiven up hope of ever having anything more than relief almost of themselves his eyes went to gudrid who was toasting meat over the fire someone must have built it up again while he slept gudrid was watching him too her gaze swung from him to liv and back again she laughed a light mocking laugh and held her nose for a moment ever since gudrid left him shed been able to make his blood boil without even trying every woman hed lain down with since he compared to her every one of them hed found wanting in some way or other now now he smiled at gudrid too and waved to her and blew her a kiss he didnt care what she thought and in not caring he felt as if a curse were lifted from his back he and liv would do what they did go where they wentif they went anywhereand that would be that and if gudrid didnt like it well so what up till this moment hed never been able to think so what about gudrid not since she first went to bed with another man he shook his headthat wasnt right not since he found out shed gone to bed with another man if liv let him finally not care about what gudrid had done what she was doing which gift could be more precious he didnt even turn his back on his former wife he didnt have to all he had to do was not take her seriously hed needed too longmuch too longto realize that and gudrid must have seen the knowledge on his face shed always been able to read him like a codex that unfortunately wouldnt go away as if it were a lifted curse her eyes narrowed so did her lips hamnet thyssen sighed and fog burst from his mouth and from his nostrils gudrid could put up with anything but being ignored ulric skakki came up and greeted hamnet with a yawn i hope your watch was more exciting than mine he said and yawned again well yes hamnet thought but that wasnt what he said you dont want a watch to be exciting he remarked most of the time that was true but there was excitement and then there was excitement you dont want to think youll fall asleep every bloody minute either ulric said i hope i can doze on horseback today yet another yawn split his foxy face lets get going trasamund said the sooner were back on our own side of the glacier the better if our wizards were worth anything they could talk with people there while were still here gudrid said i suppose thats too much to ask though she sneered at audun gilli and twice as hard at liv the bizogot shaman couldnt understand what she said but didnt like the way she said it liv glared back at her that of course was just what gudrid wanted come my sweetbe reasonable eyvind torfinn said if that wasnt a forlorn hope hamnet thyssen had never heard one eyvind went on no wizard can keep in touch with colleagues over such a distance ill bet the rulers can do it gudrid said if they can theyre even more dangerous than i think they are that wasnt eyvind torfinn or count hamnet or ulric skakki it wasnt audun gilli or trasamund either it was jesper fletti and the guard chief hardly ever let loose an opinion let alone one that went against the woman he was charged to guard the look gudrid sent him was nearly as poisonous as the one shed aimed at liv jespers right eyvind torfinn said which failed to make him the apple of his spouses eye these new barbarians seem to be pretty good at war at least i never imagined anyone could ride a mammoth neither did i trasamund said this is something i must try when i get back to my clan grounds and finish healing to ride a mammoth that would be better than anything now he was the one gudrids gaze scorched since hed ridden her hamnet understood why she might be miffed she went right on fuming as they started south and east she hadnt managed to make the rest of the travelers resent audun or livparticularly liv if hamnet was any judge at all the snow went right on falling hamnet wondered if it would stop any time before spring that wasnt his worry though all they had to do was get back on their own side of the glacier ahead of the rulers and he thought they could the mammothriders did not seem to have neared the gap in any large numbers roypar and samoth and the rest would probably have to go back to their main camp or heartland wherever that was and persuade their superiors that theyd found something interesting and important that wouldnt happen in a day or a week or chances were a month either the bizogots and the empire would have some time to get ready and how will we use it hamnet wondered would the bizogot clans join together under a jarl of all jarls would the bizogots let raumsdalian soldiers come up onto the chilly plain would sigvat ii see a threat from the land beyond the glacier not long before people had doubted there was any such thing as land beyond the glacier hamnet thyssen had doubted it himself now he had a new doubtthat the bizogots and raumsdalians would do anything about the rulers till urgent danger forced them to when he said as much to ulric skakki ulric only shrugged the sun will come up tomorrow too he remarked curse it im not joking count hamnet said neither am i ulric replied no one gets excited about a danger he hasnt seen himself he was probably right no he was certainly right hamnet thyssen knew human nature too well to think anything else he wished he could have another view of thingsit would have given him more hope for the empires safety a herd of deer like the ones the rulers rode made the travelers hold up it wasnt as large as the herd of buffalo had been not long before but hamnet still started fidgeting before it passed them by nor was he the only one are the rulers trying to slow us down audun gilli murmured what does he say liv asked count hamnet theyd ridden close together since leaving camp gudrid sneered and tossed her head hamnet pretended to ignore her he taught liv bits of raumsdalian as shed asked him to do most of the time though he simply enjoyed her company he wasnt used to doing anything like that now he translated for her she thought it over then shook her head i dont believe it weve already been through the reasons why the rulers couldnt reach the gap ahead of us no matter how much they might want to and this is the time of year when animals are on the move looking for better pasture now audun asked what does she say again hamnet did the honors adding i think shes probably right well of course you do that wasnt audun it was gudrid but what would you think if you used your head and not your crotch you would know more about that than i do hamnet said audun gilli ignored the sniping hamnet thyssen abstractly admired him for that it took concentrationor possibly blindness yes i suppose she is likely to be right the wizard said hamnet translated that into the bizogot language for liv who smiled on came the deer emerging from the snow like materializing ghosts and then vanishing into it as if expelled from the everyday world once more they knew where they were going whether the travelers did or not so hamnet thought for a little while anyhow but then he shook his head it might not be true at all chances were that one deer at the front knew and the others simply followed or maybeand here was a frightening thoughtthe deer at the front had no idea where he was going but the others followed anyhow were deer that much like people hamnet thyssen wouldnt have been surprised at last they were gone but for their tracks and dung but for the receding footfalls that the snow and wind soon muffled they might not have been there at all come on trasamund said lets get moving well go till it gets dark it definitely did get dark now even on days when skies were clear days shrank and nights stretched and grew before long the sun would become no more than a midday intruder peeking up over the southern horizon and then disappearing again the travelers hadnt ridden long before gudrid held up her hand and said i think were going in the wrong direction shouldnt we be heading that way she pointed toward what count hamnet thought was the northeast no thats not right i fear trasamund said i believe the bizogot is correct my sweet eyvind torfinn added gudrid wasnt convincedor wasnt about to let herself be convinced she pointed again im sure the gap lies there were going the way i think is proper by god and well keep on doing it now trasamund had a harder time staying polite that hed bothered even once said gudrid had a hold on his affections affectionsthats one word for it hamnet thyssen thought with a wry grin the bizogot jarl went on besides ive been here before and nobody else has if i dont know the way who does ulric skakki stirred but didnt say anything he did smile at hamnet who nodded back we know something you dont know went through hamnet s headone of the simple pleasures any man could enjoy but gudrid wasnt mollified maybe she really thought they were going in the wrong direction or maybe she just wanted to be the center of attention youre going to get us lost she said shrilly lost in the middle of all thisthis nothing her wave took in the whole world on this side of the glacier really my dear trasamund knows more about these things than you do eyvind torfinn said in tones no doubt meant to be soothing youre against me too gudrid burst into tears what is her trouble she sounds like she needs a kick in the arse said liv who had a straightforward view of the world even for a bizogot she thinks were going in the wrong direction hamnet thyssen said he didnt think that was gudrids only trouble but it was the only one he felt like talking about liv rolled her eyes up to the heavens she couldnt find her way back to the gap by herself if someone soaked the path in mammoth fat and set fire to it shes making noise for the sake of making noise hamnet thought she was doing that too he shrugged if eyvind torfinn wants to calm her down hes welcome to ay and good luck to him too he added but only to himself earl eyvind did his wellmeaning but ineffectual best really my love i have every confidence in trasamunds sense of direction he is righthe knows this terrain better than you do and he is more familiar with traveling over roadless country in the snow oh youre a fine one to talk about a sense of direction gudrid said in a deadly voice you cant even find up her sneer and the way she gestured left no one wondering what she meantnot even liv who spoke no raumsdalian hamnet didnt know what he would have done after an insult like that eyvind torfinn swung his horse away from gudrid s when you can be civilized perhaps well talk some more he said perhaps the repetition told how wounded he was gudrid just then cared for no ones wounds but her own i still say its wrong she cried well be lost enough trasamund thundered if you were my wife it would have been enough a while ago let me tell you when did you ever get enough gudrid jeered trasamund turned the color of hot iron hamnet was amazed the snowflakes striking him didnt steam if your sense of direction was as bad there as it is here why dont you go your own way if youre so set on it ulric skakki asked gudrid before anything worse could happen the rest of us can go with trasamund and well see who gets to the other side of the glacier first he smiled as if he meant the suggestion seriously the look gudrid sent him should have sunk him deep underground even though the world up here was frozen solid not far below the surface of the travelers he was or at least affected to be most nearly immune to her you hate me she shouted everyone hates me she burst into tears eyvind forgot her gibe and did his best to soothe her his best wasnt nearly good enough hamnet smiled at liv she smiled back a certain knowing look in her eye she might guess he was thinking she wouldnt throw a tantrum like that and if she did she was right audun gilli meanwhile fiddled with his ensorceled needle floating in a bowl of water chanting his spell and watching the way the lodestone swung he nodded to himself the magic confirms it he said the gap is that way he pointed the way they were riding the way gudrid questioned she rewarded him with a sneer a mustachioed stage villain in a melodrama would have been proud to claim for his own oh yesa lot you know about it she said the last time you tried that spell you almost ran us straight into the glacier if i remember right you do audun said steadily ive learned where i made my mistake can you say the same now she gaped at him in astonishment mixed with fury she couldnt have thought he had enough spirit to talk back to her since hamnet thyssen hadnt thought so either he couldnt blame her for that enough of this blather trasamund declared i am riding on toward the gap anyone else is welcome to come along anyone who thinks im heading in the wrong direction is welcome to go where she pleases as friend ulric said that she made gudrid scowl all over again the bizogot jarl plainly thought no one else thought him misguided and he was right everyone rode along with himeven gudrid though she bit her lip in anger and humiliation hamnet wondered what she would do next to show how important she wasand how much trouble it would cause the snowstorm didnt seem to want to end even this early in the season it claimed the land beyond the glacier for its own hamnet thyssen didnt mind he was used to snow himself though neither liv nor trasamund would have been much impressed with his claims that wasnt the only reason he didnt mind so much he was sleeping warmer of nights than hed ever imagined he would be there was little room for privacy in the encampments the travelers set up liv didnt mind there was little room for privacy in a bizogot camp either he woke up mornings with a smile on his face he wasnt used to that it made muscles that hadnt been used much for a long time ache from the unaccustomed exercise ulric skakki teased him about it saying what have you got that i dont a lady friend count hamnet suggested the idea bemused him too well yes i know that mock indignation filled ulrics voicehamnet hoped it was mock indignation anyhow but why have you got her for the beauty of my plumage and the sweetness of my song hamnet suggested ulric looked at him then slowly shook his head you havent just gone around the bend he said youve gone right past it you have he steered his horse away from hamnet as if afraid whatever the noble had was catching hamnet doubted that in his experience happiness wasnt contagious he certainly hadnt caught much of it himself now that he had a little he kept taking it out and picking it up and looking at it from all angles as if it were some strange animal that lived on this side of the glacier but not on the one with which he was more familiar doing that he discovered something he would perhaps rather not have knownthe thing he was examining proved not to be quite perfect after all it wasnt that he didnt enjoy making love with liv a man would have to be dead not to enjoy that but what they did had something missing compared to what hed done with gudrid something he worked at that as a man might work at a piece of meat stuck tight between two teeth trying to find it almost drove him mad as the meat would have when it didnt move whatever it was it wasnt the pleasure of the act itself liv was at least as good a lover in those terms as gudrid something listening to gudrid bicker with eyvind torfinn over roasted deer ribs one evening all at once made hamnet stare and stare gudrid noticed she usually did whats your problem she snapped she could go from scolding her new husband to scolding the one shed discarded without missing a beat its nothing really im sorry hamnet thyssen answered and looked away that made gudrid blink he shot back more often than not but with a shrug that was almost a wriggle she returned to making life difficult for earl eyvind they werent really squabbling about anything they were just going back and forth the way gudrid did with any man with whom she was involved hamnet thyssen meanwhile still stared but not at gudrid anymore he looked into the fire marveling at his own blindness so thats it he thought when hed made love with gudrid especially toward the end when the two of them were falling apart hed always had to win a fight before she gave in it wasnt physical sometimes it wasnt even verbal but it was always there between themthe idea that he had to overcome her before she yielded herself to him hed got used to it to the point where it became part of what he thought of as lovemaking with liv it wasnt there it didnt need to be there as far as he could tell she really wanted him she didnt have to be persuaded or coerced or whatever the right word was she just wanted him and if the missing frisson of winning the fight stayed missing well goodbye to it hamnet muttered if that was what his trouble was he didnt need it not one bit like mountain ranges farther south the glacier didnt waste much time shouldering its way up over the horizon as soon as the snowstorm blew through and clear weather returned there it was the sweep to the south that marked the gap lay almost exactly in the direction where trasamund and audun gilli had said it would gudrid maintained a discreet silence a shorteared fox trotted along just out of bowshot of hamnet thyssen then streaked off after a hare both beasts were losing their summer coats and going to winter white before long only their noses and eyes would mark them against the drifted snow every night seemed longer and darker than the one before the northern lights began to dance higher in the sky than hamnet thyssen had ever seen them i wonder what makes them he murmured to liv as they lay side by side under a mammoth skin we say god warms his hands with them liv told him he liked the poetry of the answer he also liked the way liv found to warm her hands a little later if they were cold they would have heated that part of him lately had felt as if it were on fire he hadnt realized a man his age could do so much of course for several years he hadnt wanted to do much at all birds went white for the winter too a snowy owl swooped down on a ptarmigan the next morning and carried it away count hamnet hadnt noticed the ptarmigan but the owl did higher and higher rose the glacierand then it vanished as another snowstorm blew down on the travelers from behind this one would have been a formidable blizzard in nidaros but the bizogots took it in stride that made the raumsdalians try to do the same lest trasamund and liv think them soft was it like this when you came up here before hamnet asked ulric skakki with the wind roaring and moaning the only way to talk was to ride close together and bawl in each others ears no ulric answered it was worse by god hamnet said how ulric skakkis hat came down over his forehead a wool muffler covered his mouth and nose only his eyes were exposed to the weather people said eyes by themselves didnt show much theyd never seen his believe me your grace it had no trouble at all he said the wind doesnt always blow toward the glacier sometimes it comes down off it sometimes the wind blowing toward it runs smack into the wind coming down off it if you think this is bad imagine a tornado full of snow id rather not hamnet thyssen said down in the southern part of the raumsdalian empire tornadoes could level a town or scatter a castles stones across the countryside some of those stones had to weigh as much as a mammoth the savage winds picked them up and flung them anyway no wonder weatherworkers have so much trouble hamnet thought how could a mere man hope to control anything so strong ulric skakkis thoughts ran in a different direction when we get down to the right side of the glacier he said do you think anyone will believe us when we tell people what weve found the bizogots will hamnet said they dont complicate things that dont need to be complicated or sometimes even things that do ulric said and the bizogots move by clan not as one folk even if they do believe how much good will it do us theyll spend more time quarreling among themselves than doing anything about the rulers as far as hamnet thyssen was concerned the bizogots disunity was a boon for the empire if they ever found a jarl who could unite them all they might prove deadly dangerous to raumsdalia they might also prove deadly dangerous if they decided to join the rulers instead of fighting them will his majesty pay attention to the word we bring ulric skakki persisted he sent out this expedition he let some of his guardsmen come along with it hamnet thyssen said and how had gudrid managed that did she sleep with sigvat to persuade him hamnet forced his mind back to the question at hand if the emperor isnt convinced were all in trouble ulric finished for him maybe maybe not too hamnet said all we know about the rulers is from their bragging and the little we saw they dont just herd mammoths they really tame them the way we tame horses ulric said samoth is a stronger wizard than audun gilli dreams of being well yes hamnet thyssen looked around to make sure audun was out of earshot but how much does that say about the one and how much does it say about the other ulric skakki gave him a dirty lookand well he might have when hed dragged audun gilli from the gutter for the journey beyond the glacier audun will be fine when we really need him i hope so we all hope so count hamnet said but the rulers are a problem and youre rightno one who hasnt seen them can understand how big a problem they could be well that may take care of itself ulric said hamnet frowned how do you mean by next year chances are that everyone will have seen them dont you think ulric said hamnet only grunted like a man who takes a fist in the pit of the stomach ulric skakki seemed to think that a full answer and so perhaps it was before long hamnet thyssen wondered whether he and the other travelers would make it back to the gap let alone through the narrow opening that was the only way home the two sides of the divided glacier shaped a funnel with that opening as the sole outlet all the bad weather beyond the glacier seemed to pour into the funneland had no way out snow piled up thick on the ground this sages said was how the glacier formed in the first placesnow that fell faster than it melted that never melted from year to year that hardened into the solid glacier as the weight of more snow above it squeezed out the air finding or forcing a way through got harder by the day are we going to have to wait till the blizzards stop hamnet asked trasamund i hope not the bizogot answered hamnet thyssen had wanted more maybe his face said as much for trasamund went on this is new for me too you know im used to weather that has more ah room to move around think on the bright side jesper fletti said if we freeze to death or starve to death up here chances are the rulers will too oh joy hamnet thyssen did not like jesper and so he took a certain sour pleasure in showing up the other man that isnt so anyhow the rulers arent likely to come through the gap during winter chances are theyll travel when the weather is goodor as good as it gets up here like the rest of the travelers jesper was bundled up so only his eyes and a bit of his forehead and the bridge of his nose were exposed to the air by the way his rimewhitened eyebrows came down and pulled together at the center count hamnets dart hit home one way or another well manage trasamund didnt sound worried but how a leader sounded and what he really thought could be two different things as hamnet knew full well the bizogot continued if we have to well build shelters from snow blocks and wait it out weve got plenty of deer flesh on the horses backs have we got enough fodder to keep the beasts alive for long hamnet asked knowing the answer was no by the way trasamund grimaced he knew the same thing can we go forward on foot if the horses die hamnet continued we can yes trasamund said it wouldnt be fast and it would be dangerous hunting in thick snows not easy and you need to eat a lot or the weather sucks the strength out of you like a vampire you have a way with words your ferocity by the way jesper fletti said it that wasnt necessarily praise we hope for the weather to get better thats all if bluff hearty trasamund could offer nothing more he was worried or worse than worried hamnet thyssen let his horse fall back alongside ulric skakkis you came back through the gap in the wintertime he said making it sound almost like an accusation guilty ulric agreed so he caught the tone despite the howling wind how hamnet asked i waited for a spell of decent weather and one came along before i got too hungry ulric answered then i squirted through as fast as i could go the weather on the other side was a lot milder i will say well i believe that hamnet thyssen saw no way for the full fury of this storm to squeeze through that narrow opening what were things like where the two halves of the glacier came closest together ulric considered windy thank you so much i never would have guessed hamnet laid on the sarcasm with a shovel ulric skakki only chuckled he probably grinned too the way his eyes narrowed suggested as much but he too kept himself well covered up so hamnet couldnt be sure youll find out ulric said either that or the good weather wont come soon enoughin which case our meat will stay fresh till the animals find it next spring you always did know how to cheer me up hamnet thyssen said ulric laughed for a moment the wind howling down from the north let hamnet hear his mirth then the frozen blast seized the laughter and flayed it on knives of ice and swept it away hamnet wished he thought ulric were joking they could die up here if they did no one would know but the striped catsthe tigersand the wolves and the little foxes and possibly the rulers if they came this way when brief spring and summer set this land ablaze with flowers asking a wizard to work against such weather was asking too much count hamnet already understood thatunderstood it in his bones which grew colder by the moment he did wonder whether audun gilli or liv could work with it could craft some sort of preserving spell that would keep the travelers not quite frozen to death till the storm eased enough to let them travel some more steering his horse over to livs was a pleasure of sorts if he was going to die he preferred dying in good company when he asked her his question she said it would be a charm like keeping meat fresh wouldnt it yes it would he answered while his hope sank he hadnt wanted to hear would be that meant she had no spell ready to use he wasnt really surprised only disappointed if shed known of such a spell chances were she already would have been poised to use it maybe it will turn out all right anyhow liv said maybe it will hamnet thyssen started to bellow his answer as hed been bellowing all along halfway through he realized he didnt need to the wind was dying the snow was easing back in raumsdalia romance writers threw storms that conveniently stopped into about half their tales people laughed at them because most of the time storms werent nearly so considerate most of the timebut not always well well eyvind torfinn said as he had a habit of doing well well he said itand hamnet thyssen heard him one of the horses snorted and shook its head sending snow flying count hamnet heard that he looked around he felt as dazed and drained as if hed fought in a battle the aftermath of a battle though was horror with the cries of the wounded and the stenches of blood and ordure filling the air with maimed and slaughtered men and beasts sprawled on the ground with ravens and vultures and teratorns spiraling down out of the sky to glut themselves on flesh before it grew cold the aftermath of the storm was one of the most beautiful things hamnet thyssen had ever seen everything was white as far as the eye could seeand it could see farther with each passing momenteverything was covered in snow even the travelers were mostly shrouded hamnet almost dreaded having the sun come out shining off so much whiteness it would be bound to blind the bizogots sometimes wore bone goggles that let in only narrow slits of light to fight against snowblindness hamnet wished for a pair of his own to either side the glacier loomed up it was white too whiter than hed ever seen it the blizzard covered the dirt that clung to the sides of the ice covered the plants that sometimes grew in crevices when the weather warmed the way hamnets breath smoked reminded him it was anything but warm now trasamund shook himself like a bear emerging from hibernation the snow he dislodged made the comparison seem more apt well now i know where south is by god he said in a voice not far from a bears growl lets get to the gap as soon as we can and leave the worst of this behind us on they rode gudrids back was uncommonly stiff she wasnt used to getting mocked over and over again for making a mistake that was something she was more in the habit of doing to other people trasamund didnt care hed taken what she gave him and he gave back nothing no gudrid wasnt used to that at all what would she do about it what could she do about it nothing that hamnet could think of not now not unless she never wanted to see nidaros again but if they got down into safer country hamnet wondered whether to tell trasamund to watch his back in the end he decided not to the bizogot jarl was a grown man able to take care of himself that hed turned the tables on gudrid proved as much if he couldnt see that she might want revenge he was a fool to count hamnets way of thinking trasamund was a fool but not that kind of fool the sun came out and shone down brightly hamnet blinked and narrowed his eyes against the glare but for the snow everywhere the blizzard might never have happened the air grew warmer anyhow the travelers slogged on toward the gap xiv ham net thyssen spread his arms wide liv laughed at him you cant span the gap with your hands my love she said its narrow but not that narrow i suppose not hamnet said but the urge remained with those cliffs those mountains of ice going up and up and up the gap between them still seemed tinyand on the grand scale of things it was but a tiny gap was oh so different from no gap at all and then hamnet stopped and gaped really hearing in his mind everything liv had said what did you call me i called you my love she answered you are arent you by god the idea still startled him but he had to nod i am yes and that would make you mine well i should hope so the shaman sent him a sidelong look not much doubt about what weve been doing is there erno hamnet thyssen said and she laughed at him he didnt think it was so funny hed lavished all sorts of words of love on gudrid much good it did him since his love for gudrid founderedno since her love for him did if she ever knew anyhe hadnt wasted such words on any other woman he would have sickened himself if he had now with liv he could affirm he was her love and she his without wanting to bend down over the snow after the travelers got beyond the narrowest part of the gap after they returned to the regions bizogots and raumsdalians had known since time out of mind they left the worst of the winter weather behind them or almost behind them it was as if they were in the front room of a house where the door wouldnt close all the way the icy wind gusted and roared at their backs but ahead of them the sun shone down in nidaros its hardly even autumn yet eyvind torfinn said wistfully it will be cold enough on the plains by god trasamunds breath smoked as he answered coid enough yes but not so cold as this as the gap widens out your ferocity could we perhaps steer away from the very center of it eyvind asked that way the worst of the blast from the north will pass alongside of us instead of blowing through us maybe his shiver was exaggerated for effect on the other hand maybe it wasnt hamnet thyssen was cold too but trasamund shook his head by your leave your splendor ill take a cold breeze on my kidneys i dont care for that but i can live with it if chunks of ice decide to come down theyll squash me like a louse the two halves of the glacier are still too cursed close togethera really big avalanchell squash us no matter where we are still and all id sooner keep the risk as small as i can makes sense ulric skakki said reluctantly eyvind torfinn nodded yes i suppose it does i was hoping for the chance to be warm like his ferocity though i should much prefer not to be flat ulric looked back toward the narrowest part of the gap it was almost like looking back toward a dragons mouth except that what it belched was not fire but scudding clouds and snow in thoughtful tones ulric asked could a big avalanche in the right spot still block the gap do you think wouldnt be surprised trasamund answered but i dont think god will give us one god expects people to solve their own problems he doesnt go around doing it for them hamnet thyssen found it hard to quarrel with that but audun gilli inquired what good is such a god well i dont know that anyone would say he didnt make the world and all the things in it trasamund answered itd be a little hard to get along without this old world even if your kidneys do get cold do you suppose god made the rulers hamnet thyssen asked not altogether seriously but more so than he would have wanted if he did he was having a bad day ulric skakki said if he didnt some demon or other was having a good day which choice do you like better i dont like either one of them count hamnet said ulric skakki chuckled all right thenwhich choice do you like less both hamnet answered and ulric laughed out loud the gap slowly widened little by little hamnet thyssen lost the urge to push the halves into which the glacier had split farther apart by brute force when he looked ahead he saw the gap between the ice mountains stretched farther and farther apart it still wasnt hospitable country being flat and often marshy but hed known worse however flat and dull the countryside was it brought a broad smile to trasamunds face this is my homeland he boomed when the travelers camped one evening this is the land of my clan we have roamed here forever he thumped his fist against his chest to emphasize the words forever to him means longer ago than his grandfather could remember hamnet thyssen whispered to ulric skakki behind his hand no doubt ulric whispered back im surprised he doesnt drop his trousers and dump out a pile of dung to mark his territory the way mammoths will sometimes they both smiled but they were careful not to laugh trasamund was not a man you wanted to insult to his face unless you were ready to put your life on the line parsh had found that out gudrid had different thoughts about dung i want to get back to the empire she said if you knew how sick i was of eating food cooked over turds it may not be pleasant but when the other choice is not eating at all you do what you need to do eyvind torfinn said had no one else added anything it might have rested there but trasamund said me i like meat roasted over a dung fire better than what you get down in the south where you cook with wood the flavors better all what youre used to earl eyvind said with a smile but gudrid screwed up her face into a horrible grimace what you mean is meat roasted over a dung fire tastes like dung weve been eating dung ever since we left the empire she wasnt wrong the same thought had crossed hamnet thyssens mind once or twice he wished she wouldnt have said it though now he really had to think about it by the looks that crossed some of the other raumsdalians faces they felt the same way what does she say liv asked count hamnet didnt much want to translate that made him think about it too but liv only shrugged and said otherwise we would starveand fire is clean when hamnet heard that he nodded you have a good way of looking at things he said fire was clean even if it was fire from he shook his head he didnt want to go down that road fire is clean he told himself and left it there ulric skakki shook him awake in the middle of the night sorry to do this to you your grace he said but i need my time in the bedroll too who says hamnet demanded through a yawn ulric laughed count hamnet yawned again ulric stayed there by him till he got to his feet who hadnt seen a man fall back to sleep instead of going out to stand sentry mutteringand still yawninghamnet thyssen trudged away from the embers of the fire the dung fire he thought and wished he hadnt off in the distance he could see the glacier on either side of the gap it seemed almost magical under moonlight and made him wonder if it shone from within with a glow of its own the sensible part of him knew better but around midnight that part wasnt at its best like all the sentries he stationed himself north of his sleeping comrades if trouble came from where but the direction of the rulers would it come he breathed out fogthe visible warmth flowing from his body every time he exhaled the landscape was eerily quiet he could hear the other travelers snoring more than a bowshot away but for those small noises there was nothing so much nothing that before long he could hear the blood rushing in his ears and the beating of his heart after a while someone stirred and sat up there by the smoldering fire was that liv hamnet thyssens heart beat faster warmth flowed through him instead of flowing out she got to her feet and walked toward him a broad smile spread over his face it still felt peculiar his muscles just werent used to shaping that expression she kissed him when she got out to where he was standing but then she said somethings wrong which spoiled his hope for anything more what is it he asked instead of slipping under her tunic his hand fell to the hilt of his sword i dont know yet moonshadow made her look as troubled as she sounded but something should we wake the others hamnet asked should we wake audun something that roused foreboding in a shaman was bound to be sorcerous wasnt it but liv shook her head if he feels it too let him come she said if not not i would say something different if we could talk together she switched from her language to raumsdalian not know enough yet and audun gilli not know bizogot speech youre doing very well hamnet said in raumsdalian liv returned to her own tongue to answer i should have started sooner then i would know more and audun gilli should have started learning my language not all raumsdalians cared to learn the bizogot tongue several of the guardsmen whod come north with gudrid also remained ignorant of it hamnet thyssen had heard them muttering about braying barbarians but never when trasamund or liv was in earshot they might be arrogant but they werent foolhardy hamnet put his arm around herpartly from affection and partly for warmth however you like the company is good this way she nodded and smiled it is if i was wrong well we can see what happens then but lets wait a while first all right hamnet didnt want to wait he waited anyhow pushing an unwilling woman wasnt a good idea any time it made her think a man wanted her for only one thingwhich was too often true but pushing her when she said trouble was on the way had a special stupidity all its own if he were twenty years younger he might not have cared what man who was hardly more than a youth didnt think with his prong now though hamnet could wait liv would still be here after the trouble whatever it was went away motion in the sky made both of them swing their heads the same way at the same time silent and pale as a ghost an owl soared past on broad wings or was it only an owl to hamnets senses it was but he would never make a wizard if he lived to be a thousand that he whispered that liv said what can wewhat can youdo i dont know i dont know if i can do anything she answered which wasnt what he wanted to hear but then she went on id better try though yes id say so hamnet thyssen said if you dont the rulers will think were too weak to do anything about them and they may be right to think that liv said bleakly which was not at all what he wanted to hear but i dont care to be spied on night after night and so she reached into her pouch and drew from it something feathered something clawed and something that in the moonlight might have been a dark stone what have you got there hamnet asked the dried right wing of a screech owl and his right foot also dried and his heart likewise the bizogot shaman said you didnt kill an owl on our travels hamnet said and liv shook her head to show she hadnt he went on then youve had them with you since we set out and she nodded he asked why by god because these three things taken together will summon birds to them which can be useful liv answered also the heart and the foot together without the wing will compel a man to truth if set above his heart while he sleeps you did not use this magic against samoth when he first spied on us hamnet said nohe was in mans shape then liv said he took bird shape and flew away faster than i could have shaped the spellfaster than i thought anyone could do it if he flies away now the spell will fail but if he gives me time to use it if he does i may give him a surprise may it be so hamnet thyssen said what can i do to help for now just stand quiet she answered the time may come though when you will want to put out an arm if it does i promise you will know it he scratched his head wondering what she meant meanwhile she held up the wing and the foot in the right hand and the screechowl heart in her left this spell must have come from the south she remarked for the version we learn first says that these parts are to be hung in a tree even under the moon her smile was impish then we have to reshape it so that it works in our country but the original still survives hamnet thyssen wondered why maybe the shamans needed the link with the original to ensure that their altered version still worked he didnt know enough of magic to be sure of anything like that he didnt have long to wonder either for liv began to chant in a soft voice he had everything he could do to stay quiet as shed asked he wanted to burst out laughing for the tune she used was the same as a raumsdalian lullaby sure enough that charm had reached the bizogots from the south instead of laughing count hamnet watched the owl at first he thought its soaring circles were unchanged and feared the rulers had some counterspell to deflect or nullify the charm liv was using but then he saw that the circles were getting narrower and that they were centered on liv and himself not on the fire as they had been the owl called a strange questioning note in its voice liv answered hamnet could find no better way to put it she gave back fluting hoots still to the tune of that song that made babies in the empire close their eyes in the cradle down spiraled the owl it flew right in front of livs face she never flinched hamnet thyssen didnt think he could have been so calm with that hooked beak and those tearing claws bare inches from his eyes then he remembered what shed said before he quite knew hed done it he held out his right arm the owl perched on it it stared from him to liv and back again moonlight flashed from its great golden eyes despite that flash though it seemed confused it looked back and forth again as if wondering how it had got there hamnet didnt blame ithe was wondering the same thing do you understand me liv asked in the bizogot tongue the owl hesitated then it answered yes i understand an owls beak and throat were not made to speak any human language the bird managed even so samoth hamnet recalled was fluent in the bizogot speech you are from the rulers liv didnt make it a question or need to i am from the rulers the owl agreed and it nodded its round head one of the eeriest things count hamnet had ever seen are you samoth does his spirit dwell inside you the bizogot shaman was thinking along the same lines as hamnet himself i am samoth it is not a matter of the spirit i am samoth the owl said to hear its words hoot and hiss their way forth made the hair at the back of hamnet s neck want to stand up of its own accord as if he were a frightened animal puffing up in the face of danger by god what else am i he thought and you flew here to spy on us liv asked to spy on you yes and to spy out the way south said the bird that was also a wizard or a shaman or whatever the right word among the rulers was hear me samoth livs voice changed from questioning to commanding if anything the hair on hamnets nape stood higher and straighten hear me liv repeated when you flew forth you found no bizogot or raumsdalian travelers when i flew forth i found no bizogot or raumsdalian travelers agreed the owl that was samoth you did not pass through the gap at allthe snowstorm to the north was too strong i didnt pass through the gap at allthe snowstorm to the north was too strong the owl echoed were its eyes duller than they had been when it landed on count hamnets wrist he thought so but he couldnt be sure he steadied his right arm with his left hand to make sure no quiver upset the owl or disrupted livs magic her eyes by contrast shone as she thanked him with them you turned back and flew off to your camp because you could fly no farther she said to samoth i turned back and flew off to my camp because i could fly no farther the ensorceled owl agreed and of course you remember nothing of this talk for it never happened liv said when the owl echoed her once more she nodded to hamnet thyssen he thrust his arm up and forward as if launching a falcon against a quail like a hawk trained to the fist the owl flew away it arrowed off toward the north that wasbravely done hamnet whispered not wanting to disturb its flight in anyway bravely done my thanks liv whispered back she let out a long weary fogfilled breath he is very strong he almost slipped free of my magic four or five times even as an owl as a man i dont know if i could stand against him as a man this should have been easy and it was anything but you did it what else matters hamnet thyssen was determined to look on the bright side that felt strange for him but it was true nothing else mattersnow liv answered but if we see the rulers again when we see the rulers again how strong they are matters a lot he couldnt tell her she was wrong for she plainly wasnt the way you sent samoth off makes it less likely well see them anytime soon he said it may mean we wont see them at all i doubt that the bizogot shaman said what i wonder is whether hell stay fooled whether hell believe the weather was bad or hell realize he had a spell put on him if he does realize i used magic against him will he know how close his owlself came to breaking free she sighed again even more deeply than before nothing is ever simple however much we wish it would be count hamnet nodded he couldnt argue there either but he said you did everything you could it all worked every bit of it be proud of that he put his arm around her she leaned against him for a little while drawing strength or at least consolation from his touch then she straightened and took her weight on her own feet again i am she said but it should have worked better it should have worked easier hamnet thyssen almost did argue with her then at the very end he held his tongue he recognized that drive to have everything come out perfect and the gnawing sense of dissatisfaction when any tiny little detail didnt he had it himself if anyone had told him not to worry so much what would he have done ignored the advice and probably lost his temper why wouldnt liv do the same no reason at all not that he could see and so he kept quiet when the travelers rode south the next morning audun gilli had the oddest expression on his face he rode up alongside of count hamnet and asked did anything strange happen in the nighttime strange what do you mean hamnet couldnt have sounded more innocent if hed worked at it for a year i had the oddest dream audun said i was flying i was a bird of some kind not a flying man the way you can be in dreams i know i was a bird because i looked down and saw myself i dont know how i could though because it was night in the dream but i did and thenthen i didnt then everything was all confused as if i couldnt see at all and i was flying away as fast as i could but do you know what the oddest thing was no hamnet thyssen said gravely youre about to tell me though arent you the oddest thing wasaudun gilli ignored or more likely didnt notice his ironythat in the middle of all this your grace i somehow shook hands with you isnt that peculiar yes that is peculiar hamnet said the wizards occult senses whatever they were must have picked up some of what liv was doing but audun never fully woke and so had only a dreamers confused notions of what had happened audun sent him a quizzical lookor maybe a look a little more than quizzical you dont seem surprised by what i tell you nothing you tell me ever surprises me count hamnet saidlet audun make of that what he would the wizard scratched his head when we get back to nidaros i will buy myself scented soap and a tub of hot water he said and then he didnt go on not with words but his smile was blissful sounds good to me hamnet said nodding buy one more thing while youre at it whats that audun gilli asked a brush with at least mediumstrong bristles hamnet answered weve been up here a long time and the soap will need some help youre right now audun nodded as if making sure he would remember ill do that hardly noticing he went on scratching watching him made hamnet scratch too the way someone else yawning might make him do the same and once he started scratching he also went right on you wizards dont have a sorcerous cure for bugs eh he said not one that does much good audun gilli said mournfully if we did wed be richer than we are ill tell you that hamnet thyssen scratched some morethoughtfully at first and then just because scratching felt good speaking of rich meaning no offense but ulric skakki found you in the gutter how do you aim to buy your soap and your soak and your brush now audun gilli looked appalled wont the emperor pay us reward us for going beyond the glacier in his name well i dont know hamnet made his hand stop scratching lest he rub himself raw it wasnt easy he went on he may think we can live on fame he could himself eyvind torfinn could easily jesper fletti and the other guardsmen would go back to the duty theyd had before setting out ulric skakki count hamnet didnt know how much ulric had stashed away but ulric was enough like a cat to be able to land on his feet no matter what happened audun gilli wasnt i hope youre wrong he said in what had to be one of the most desperately tense understatements of all time times were hard for me before i started this journey i know hamnet said no matter what you have a story people will want to hear likely a story people will pay to hear that will help you carry on your trade too youll be a known man even a famous man do you think that will stop me from ending up in the gutter again audun asked it was a serious question he sounded as if he really wanted to know well i cant answer that only you can hamnet thyssen said if you cant keep yourself out of the gutter who else will i suppose youre right audun gilli sighed almost as wearily as liv had the night before i dont know whether its good news or bad though well i expect ill find out as the bizogot shamans had his breath filled the air with fog the travelers hadnt left winter behind the wind didnt howl so hard on this side of the glacier but the cold still reached into hamnet thyssens bones in spite of the furs that muffled him before long we should run into bands of my folk and their herds trasamund said it will good to see my clansmens faces again it will be good to see the faces of the women too he added in a different tone of voice gudrids back stiffened they started to run low on meat things might have got serious if they hadnt come upon a herd of musk oxen ulric skakki slew one bull with an arrow through the eye a perfect shot that dropped the big beast in its tracks you couldnt do that again in a hundred years jesper fletti said as they started the gory job of butchery ulric studied him with a mild and speculative gaze would you like me to try he asked in a voice so mild that no one could possibly take offense at it despite that mildness jesper was quick to shake his head maybe he didnt think ulric was talking about shooting musk oxen hamnet thyssen certainly didnt they gorged themselves on the meat once they cut it off the bones people needed much more food in this climate just to fight the cold hamnet thyssen was amazed at how much halfscorched halfraw flesh he put away it was as if he were doing hard physical labor even while only riding when he actually did have to work hard he needed even more the horses were in worse shape than their riders they had trouble finding enough fodder under the snow when one of them went down and would not rise trasamund knocked it over the head the travelers butchered it as theyd butchered the musk ox hamnet had eaten horse before after similar misfortunes it was chewy almost gluey but ever so much better than nothing chewingand chewing and chewingeyvind torfinn smiled wryly i dont believe my cook down in nidaros has any recipes for this particular meat i hope he doesnt gudrid said it may not be wonderful food ulric skakki said but any food is better than going hungry all bizogots know this for we know how hard life can be when winter clamps down trasamund said i was not sure a man from the south where you have bread and grain as a cushion against bad times would understand it ive been hungry a time or two your ferocity ulric answered believe me having food is better to food trasamund said a toast i will make in earnest when i can after they ate they rode hamnet thyssen had never spent so much time in the saddle before this journey he wondered if he was growing bowlegged the better to fit his shape to the horses he also wondered how long he would be able to go on riding if the horses kept getting weaker he and the other travelers might have to dismount and lead them they might have to slaughter them one by one the thought of more meals like the one hed just eaten did not appeal he patted the side of his mounts neck sizing up how tender the beast will be when the time comes to roast it ulric skakki asked god dont listen to this man hamnet thyssen exclaimed ulric laughed cant say as i blame you not the finest supper ive ever got down but swallowing anything is better than not some people will certainly swallow anything count hamnet said that drew another laugh from ulric skakki youre in a cheerful mood arent you your grace these days he used hamnet s title only for sardonic effect theyd all traveled too far with one another for the formalities to matter any more no hamnet wasnt laughing weve come an awfully long way id hate to see us fall just short of getting back to to trasamunds clan he almost said back to civilization no matter how far hed come no matter what hed seen he wasnt about to confuse the way the bizogots lived with civilization by ulric skakkis mischievous grin he had a pretty good notion of what count hamnet didnt say with his pointed nose and narrow foxy eyes he was good at sniffing his way past all kinds of deceptions and evasions better to have the bizogots with us than against us he said and count hamnet could hardly quarrel with that then looking even more sly than usual ulric added youve got one bizogot on your side all right hamnet refused to rise to the bait you already teased me about that if you do it over and over again people will say youre boring people what do people know ulric said or did you mean the rulers they know everythingand if you dont believe me you can bloody well ask them i dont want to ask them anything i hope i never see them again hamnet thyssen feared that was a forlorn hope now that you mention it so do i but ulric sounded no more hopeful than hamnet he looked to the east and to the west the glacier still loomed tall on both horizons but a broad expanse of land lay between the two walls of icethe gap was widening out then ulric skakki stared south i never want to see the rulers again no but i wouldnt mind meeting a bizogot besides our ferocious jarl and the admittedly charming liv neither would i hamnet allowed were far enough south that we could any day now there is some small difference between could and will ulric said you may perhaps have noticed why no hamnet tried to play the game of irony himself explain it to me if youd be so kind one of ulrics gingery eyebrows rose i could say youre being difficult i will say youre doing it on purpose very neat hamnet said with a mounted bow you should be a scholar thank you but no ulric skakki said no silver in it oh i dont know look at earl eyvind hamnet thyssen did look at him eyvind torfinn was talking earnestly with gudrid for the moment playing a subdued demure wife seemed to suit her ulric skakki shook his head earl eyvind had silver before he decided he wanted to be a scholar hes a scholar in spite of his money not because of it well not altogether hamnet said the silver hes got lets him do what he pleases he wouldnt be able to buy his books and learn his lore without it i suppose so ulric said but he isnt the kind of scholar i had in mind anyway i meant the holeandcorner kind the ones who have to stuff a rag into the toe of their felt boots in wintertime because they cant afford to patch them that sort is good enough to teach boys how to read and write and count but not for much more plenty of them around count hamnet agreed they call themselves scholars but im not sure how many other people do ulric skakki surely said something in reply whatever it was count hamnet didnt hear it his eyes went to an owl flying past the travelers from out of the north white and swift and strong samoth hamnets heart pounded no wizard himself he couldnt tell his gaze went to liv she noticed him no more than hed heard ulric all her attention pursued the bird till it streaked out of sight to the south only then did she turn in the saddle and look for him even before she spoke he saw the relief lighting her fine features sometimes a white owl is only a white owl she called a good thing too hamnet answered they smiled at each other sometimes i think i dont know everything thats going on ulric skakki said in tones full of mock selfpity count hamnet reached out and set a consoling hand on his arm dont worry about it sometimes i dont think you know whats going on either thank you thank you so much ulric said hamnet waved modestly on they went farther and farther south another horse died and another they cut up the animals and ate them the meat was strongflavored and there wasnt a great deal of it the horses had got very scrawny before finally failing do you think well make it jesper fletti asked hamnet the guards officer had never been up in the north before this journey all things considered hed acquitted himself well enough hamnet thyssen could almost forget that hed come along to protect gudrid i think so hamnet answered we cant be far from outriders from the three tusk clan i would have guessed wed run into them already truth to tell that they hadnt worried him though he didnt say so had some disaster befallen trasamunds clan while the jarl journeyed beyond the glacier that was the worst kind of bad news he could imagine the words were hardly out of his mouth the thought hardly through his head before trasamund let out a bellow that might have come from the throat of a bull musk ox that dot on the southern horizon was a mounted man and he was riding toward them xv seeing a new face hearing a new voice felt strange to count hamnet the rulers hardly counted most of them hadnt spoken the bizogot language and the ones who did showed themselves to be outright enemies hilderic wasnt he and trasamund kissed each other on both cheeks in the usual greeting of bizogots who hadnt seen each other for a longtime by god your ferocity hilderic said by god its good to see you youve been gone a long time some people were starting to wonder if youd ever come back oh they were were they the jarl said im not so easy to get rid of as all that and theyd best believe im not who are these fools who have no faith in trasamund hilderic suffered a sudden coughing fit uh that is well you see trasamund laughed all right never mind you dont need to tell me i can understand that you dont want a name as a snitch but ill find out sooner or laterhave no fear of that and when i do ill make those doubters pay he thumped his chest with a mittened fist yes will take care of them you dont need to worry about it may it be as you say your ferocity hilderic replied hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki exchanged covert smiles trasamund always saw himself as larger than life because he did he could make other people see him the same way most of the time hilderic though plainly a seasoned man certainly did liv worried less about how important other people thought she was and more about things that really mattered where is the camp you rode out of hilderic she asked weve traveled long and hard we arent at the end of our tether but we arent far from it either its not far lady hilderic said then he stopped and blinked the face of every traveler who understood the bizogot language must have lit up hamnet thyssen knew how happy he was hilderic went on the guesting will be good too the herds have done well through the summer and into fall lead on trasamund boomed hamnet soon found that something he already knew remained true what a bizogot meant by not far was different from what a raumsdalian would have meant but they did reach the encampment just before darkness fell hamnet wondered whether hed ever seen anything more beautiful than those black mammothhide tents bizogots swarmed out of the tents to greet the travelers welcome back they shouted welcome home it was home only to trasamund and liv but none of the raumsdalians complained or contradicted these tents might not be home but they came much closer than the endless expanse of wilderness the travelers had crossed the bizogots slaughtered and butchered a plump young musk ox spit flooded into hamnet thyssens mouth trasamund scooped out a handful of the raw brains and ate it blood running down into his beard hamnet did the same hed learned to tolerate the bizogot delicacy on his first trip up beyond the tree line years earlier on this trip hed learned to enjoy it and he was hungry enough now to find it delicious beyond compare ulric skakki took some of the brains too always glad when my stomach is smarter than my head he said mine is most of the time i think hamnet said licking his lips none of the other raumsdalians wanted anything to do with raw brains though liv came up to eat some trasamund clapped hamnet and ulric on the back in turngingerly for his hands were still sore by god the two of you make pretty fair bizogots he said thank you your ferocity hamnet knew the jarl meant it for praise and some of the highest praise he could give thank you so much your ferocity ulric skakki said if trasamund listened to the words he would find nothing wrong with them if he listened closely to the tone he would find hed given praise ulric didnt want for a mammothherder trasamund was a sophisticate beside ulric skakki he might have been a child the irony went over his head he was frank as a child too for he went on maybe not as good as the real thing but pretty fair even so this wasnt the three tusk clans main campthat lay farther south these bizogots had followed their herd of musk oxen into the gap most animals went south for the winter musk oxen shielded against cold and blizzards by their long shaggy hair and soft thick underwool could head the other way if they chose even though this was only a small band of bizogotsa couple dozen men fewer women a handful of childrenhamnet thyssen felt as if hed suddenly come into nidaros after a long sojourn in his castle unfamiliar faces talked about unfamiliar things in unfamiliar voices so much chatter almost made him want to flee the tents for the quiet and solitude of the frozen plain beyond them roasting muskox meat sent up a delicious aroma count hamnets stomach growled like a shortfaced bear even if he did feel slightly overwhelmed he decided to stay around he didnt mind halfraw meat at all he did mind waiting for it to cook all the way through so did the other travelers he overheard one bizogot say to another i thought these folk from the south couldnt put it away like real people do i guess i was wrong i thought the same thing the second bizogot answered only goes to show you shouldnt believe everything you hear doesnt it eyvind torfinn stared in mild astonishment at the pile of rib bones in front of him i never could have eaten like this before i set out from the empire he said never i tell you amazing what practice will do isnt it amazing what hunger will do isnt it ulric skakki said hamnet thyssen thought that came closer to hitting the mark though what earl eyvind said also held some truth without practice hamnet didnt think he could have gorged himself like this without being hungrier than he ever got down in the raumsdalian empire he wouldnt have wanted to the bizogots passed around skins of smetyn to celebrate the travelers return the fermented mammoths milk tasted good to hamnet which only showed how long hed been away from anything with a kick to it it also mounted straight to his head which showed the same thing audun gilli drank himself to sleep in short order the bizogots took such things in stride they draped a mammoth hide over the sodden wizard and shoved him near the edge of the tent where people were less likely to trip over him or step on him well your ferocity hilderic said tell us of the lands beyond the glacier are there people there did you find the golden shrine there are people there are indeed trasamund answered he spoke of the rulers and of how they not only herded but rode mammoths that made all the bizogots buzz as he must have known it would can we do that three of them asked the same question at the same time i dont see why not the jarl said but we wont do it today and we wont do it tomorrow either well have to figure out everything that goes into it and well have to get the mammoths used to carrying men on their backs the time will come though and i think it will come soon gudrid and the raumsdalian guardsmen whod never learned the bizogot tongue began to follow audun gillis example hamnet thyssen didnt suppose he could blame themnot in one sense anyway listening to a language you couldnt follow had to be boring but theyd traveled with bizogots for months theyand audunshould have learned more than they did he glanced over to liv shed waited longer than she might have to start learning raumsdalian too but she was doing well with it now in the flames that came from butterfilled lamps hilderics eyes glowed like a wild beast s if we learn this art well ride roughshod over the rest of the bizogots his fellow clansmen rumbled approval at the idea but trasamund regretfully shook his head once we learn this art i fear well have to show it to the rest of the bizogots what why hilderic demanded because the rulers god curse them are full of greed trasamund said we see the opening of the gap as a chance to go north to see what lies beyond the glacier they see it as a chance to fare south to lay hold of what lies below the glacier they cant do that hilderic wasnt the only bizogot to say thatfar from it several of the big blond men shook their fists at the north i hope they cant trasamund said but they have tricks we know nothing of yet this mammothriding is bound to be but the beginning the jarl speaks truly liv added one thing we saw while we were with themtheir magic is strong very strong perhaps stronger than any we know ourselves if the raumsdalian shaman were awake he would tell you the same still and all they can be beaten hamnet thyssen said his ferocity proved as much a reminiscent smile spread across trasamunds battered features well so i did he said and then waited till his people clamored for him to tell them more he was indeed a sophisticatefor a bizogot he spoke of his battle with parsh finishing and after i beat him the poor fool killed himself for shame killed himself for what hilderic said for shame you say what shame in losing a straightup fight as long as you gave your best did he he did by the way trasamund rubbed his chin he had no doubt of that he stopped smiling oh yes he did for shame of losing to a man not of the rulers hamnet said they are a serious folk then the rulers hilderic sounded impressed in spite of himself by the way several other bizogots both men and women nodded hed put into words what they were thinking they are a danger a great danger liv said we would do well to put warriors at the narrowest part of the gap to make sure they cannot break through and come down into the richer country we mostly roam the bizogots who hadnt traveled beyond the glacier stared at her so did trasamund meaning no offense wise woman he said but we of the three tusk clan have not the warriors to hold the gap even if we sent all our men i doubt we would have enough and if we did thathe chuckled as if humoring a madwomanwho would tend the beasts let everything be as you say your ferocity but the gap still needs to be held liv replied if we have not men enough to do it let other clans send warriors to our aid let even the raumsdalians send warriors to our aid so long as we hold the gap let other clans warriors cross the land of the three tusk clan in arms that wasnt the jarl it was hilderic horror in his voice let the emperors warriors cross our land by god it cannot be solemn nods from his clansmen said they agreed with him i am one of the emperors warriors hamnet thyssen said mildly you see others here beside you what harm have we done he is right liv said trasamunds big head bobbed up and down but hilderic said you are travelers you arent an army while youre here you obey the jarl you dont follow the emperors orders if an army came it would come to hold us and conquer us and take our wealth away count hamnet almost burst into hysterical laughter what wealth he wondered he had no idea how to say that without mortally offending not only hilderic but also trasamund and liv while he tried to find a way ulric skakki beat him to the punch saying no raumsdalians would want to hold a land where trees wont grow he put it more diplomatically than hamnet could have ulric is likely right about the southerners trasamund said but i wouldnt care to let our own folk onto our grazing lands in arms who knows what they might do if we yield the gap if we dont fight there well have to fight farther southhere or in our very heartland liv sounded desperate we could put a stopper in the skin a raumsdalian would have spoken of a cork in the bottle but it came to the same thing either way what of the golden shrine another bizogot said we asked about it before but got no answer do the rulers hold it they do not eyvind torfinn spoke with assurance as far as i could tell they know nothing of it we did not find it but it is safe believe me when i say this for it is true what does a foreigner know the bizogot muttered this foreigner knows more of the golden shrine than any bizogot trasamund said before earl eyvind could even begin to speak for himself dont argue with me wulfila for i know what im talking about wulfila bristled anyone who tried to tell a bizogot what to doeven the jarl of that bizogots clanwas taking his chances if not taking his life in his own hands but then liv said trasamund is right and wulfila subsided if a shaman said a raumsdalian knew a good deal about occult matters how could an ordinary bizogot quarrel with her oh a fool might but wulfila didnt seem a foolnot that kind of fool anyhow if i had to guess earl eyvind said the golden shrine has ways to make sure that those who would trouble its tranquility have no chance to do so i cannot prove this not with the little i know now but i believe it to be the case he sounded like a scholar even while speaking the bizogot language in an abstract way hamnet thyssen admired that hed never imagined such a thing was possible wulfila seemed impressed but he asked if thats so how do you know the golden shrine wasnt hiding from you that it might hide from a raumsdalian seemed natural to him where he never would have dreamt it might conceal itself from one of his own folk eyvind torfinn looked quite humanly surprised i do not know that not for a fact i do not believe it is true but neither do i know it is not count hamnet was surprised in turn for that seemed to satisfy wulfila voice gruff the bizogot said well you seem honest anyhow who would have thought it from a man of the south trasamund upended a skin full of smetyn he belched enormously which showed good manners among the bizogots then he yawned enormously let us speak of all this another time for now i do believe i will die if i dont crawl under a skin pretty soon none of the travelersthose whod stayed awake that longargued with him the bizogots had hides and blankets to spare the weather was cold but not as cold as it might have been plenty of covers could make the difference between life and death when the breath of god blew its hardest now the mammothherders shared them out to their guests hamnet thyssen was as glad to slide beneath one as any of the othersand even gladder when liv slid under the same one count hamnet woke in darkness liv was draped over him smooth and bare one arm flung across his chest one thigh over his leg one of his hands rested on the small of her back he moved it just a little she murmured something wordless it sounded happy he hoped it was how long since hed wakened with a woman in his arms before liv he knew that down to the very daysince the last time hed awakened so with gudrid after that hed bedded women yes but he hadnt slept with them not in the literal sense of the words he hadnt wanted so much intimacy now now he had to remind himself not to wake liv not to rouse her as he was roused himself he might want her but she wanted sleep and shed earned the right to it if she woke by herself but that was a different story so he told himself over and over again and made himself hold her quietly it wasnt easy then just when he was on the point of drifting off again she did wake in surprise more surprise than hed shown what she said and then a long beat later oh hamnet yes he said as if the two of them lying naked and entwined was the most natural thing in the world and why not he wondered why not by god she smiled against his shoulder thats good she murmured yes he said again he might have been announcing magic grander than any the most talented wizard could hope to work he might have beenand as far as he was concerned he was feeling her warmth against him made most of his warmth concentrate in one spot liv could scarcely help noticing she laughed softly youre ready so soon he said yes one more time and he might have been announcing another miracle again he thought he was he hadnt been so eager so avid for a very long time at his age he hadnt thought he could be getting happily surprised made a pleasant novelty had he ever been so avid he likely had back in the first days with gudrid his arms tightened around liv she laughed again and kissed him and then twisted limber as an eel and suddenly they werent just entwined but joined shhh she whispered as they began to move by the nature of things the bizogots often made love in a tent with others present that was all right waking others up while you did it thoughthat was rude hamnet thyssen tried to remember his manners afterwards he thought he did well enough right up till the moment when joy overwhelmed him he didnt think liv remembered very well then either neither one of them was inclined to be critical he sighed with regret when he slipped out of her a moment later his eyes slid shut and he was asleep again it was still dark when he next woke if anything he and liv were even more tangled up than they had been before he didnt pat her lam a virtuous man he told himself i can resist small temptations he hadnt triedor wantedto resist larger ones other people were stirring now morning had to be close by if so many were waking up liv came back to herself not long after hamnet did this time she knew where she was and with whom she kissed him on the end of the nose we should dress she said ah too bad hamnet answered which made her laugh they wriggled into their clothes under the hide anyone watching that from the outside might have guessed they were doing something else instead no one seemed to be though and they werent the only ones whod celebrated returning to the three tusk clan trasamund hadnt always been perfectly quiet under his hide either roast meat left over from the night before broke their fast the jarl left three or four of the weariest horses behind at the encampment exchanging them for beasts his clansfolk had been using sooner or later well replace them all he said but i dont want to leave a whole herd of screws up here they might need sound horses sensible ulric skakki whispered to hamnet who would have thought trasamund had it in him not fair hes a good enough jarlbetter than good enough hamnet said as if he hadnt spoken ulric went on of course by the noises last night he had it in everything but the cat ears heating some of those noises might have been his count hamnet said the bizogots dont keep cats that must be why he didnt then ulric said blandly erright hamnet didnt have one of the fresh horses but even the animal he was riding seemed glad of the longer than usual rest it had got the night before the travelers hadnt been riding for more than a couple of hours before they came upon a herd of mammoths with a couple of bizogots steering it toward the best foraging trasamund shouted back and forth with the herders he eyed the mammoths in a way he hadnt before how would you climb up on their backs without making them want to squash you flat he murmured personally i wouldnt hamnet thyssen said quietly laughing ulric skakki nodded but trasamund with the thought in his mind didnt want to turn loose of it how would you he repeated do you suppose it takes magic liv do the rulers spell their mammoths into quiet so they can mount them i dont know your ferocity she answered i saw no sign of that but i cant prove anything i want to try it trasamund seemed ready to jump off his horsehe rode one of the fresh onesand onto the back of the closest mammoth this is perhaps not the ideal time for experimentation eyvind torfinn said we have news to deliver important news and your untimely demise would assist only the raiders from beyond the glacier what untimely demise the jarl demanded indignantly nothing would happen to me one of the mammoths swung up its trunk and let out a sound that reminded hamnet thyssen of a blaring bugle filled with spit it also made him wonder if the enormous beast was giving trasamund the horse laugh a glance at ulric skakkis raised eyebrow made him suspect the adventurer was thinking the same thing theres a time and a place for everything your ferocity hamnet said this probably isnt the time to try riding mammoths trasamund glared at him to the bizogots the time to do something was the time when you thought of doing it but the jarl unlike most of his countrymen had gone down to the empire and at least understood the idea of waiting even if he didnt much care for it all right he said grudgingly all right it will keep i suppose he let out a martyred sigh that filled the air in front of him with fog if he was going to pass up the opportunity he wanted everyone around him to recognize what a fine fellow he was for doing it when the bizogot herdsmen learned that the rulers rode mammoths they too were wild to try it for themselves they werent going anywhere important they had nothing to do but guide the beasts in their charge if they wanted to clamber aboard one of those beasts they could as long as the mammoth let them i wonder if theyre going to do something theyll regret ulric said well if it goes wrong they wont regret it long hamnet answered a point a distinct point ulric said but look at them they think theyll be mammothlancers by the time the rulers come through the gap the rulers shouldnt come through the gaplivs dead right about that hamnet said we ought to be able to stop them right there if they try we ought to be able to do all kinds of things ulric skakki said what we will do count hamnet wished he hadnt put it like that plainly the bizogots and raumsdalians wouldnt be able to do some things no matter how obvious it seemed that they should trasamunds clansmen hated the idea of letting other bizogots let alone warriors from the empire cross their land even to fight the rulers every other bizogot clan would probably be just as unhappy to let its neighbors cross its grazing grounds as for the empire who could say whether the empire would take the idea of a threat from beyond the glacier seriously at all we may have made the greatest journey in the history of the world for nothing you know hamnet thyssen said yes that occurred to me ulric skakki sounded surprised it had taken so long to occur to hamnet then he glanced over toward liv and smiled a little but you wouldnt say it was for nothing any which way would you for myself no hamnet answered i was talking about things bigger than any one persons affairs he waited for ulric to make some lewd pun on that the adventurer didnt instead he asked how many people ever think past their daytoday affairs and he answered his own question not many by god some do hamnet said some have to in the empire if they didnt wed be as barbarous as the bizogots do you think were not before count hamnet could respond to that ulric skakki held up a hand never mind never mind i know what youre saying but people like that are thinner on the ground than you think your grace not everyone comes with your sense of duty nailed inside his chest you make it sound so wonderful hamnet thyssen said oh it is it is ulric smiled a crooked smile that showed a great many sharp teeth if you dont believe me ask gudrid for a red moment count hamnet wanted to kill him then grudgingly he nodded saying you have a nasty way of making your points why thank you ulric skakki said with another carnivorous smile hamnet had no answer for that at all when the travelers found the three tusk clans main encampment everyone celebratedeveryone but hamnet thyssen for him it seemed more an end than a beginning and an end he didnt want the smile on livs face flayed him this is my home she said and the words cut like flensing knives how ive missed these tents she went on carving another chunk from his happiness he wasnt used to being happy back before he was he would have borne up under anything now would you like to see raumsdalia he asked and worked with his tongue to free a chunk of muskox meat caught between two back teeth she looked surprised i hadnt even thought of that i hadnt thought of anything past coming back to the tents of my clan ulric skakki knew what he was talking about sure enough hamnet thought i dont want to leave you he said i hoped you didnt want to leave me i dont liv said and peered at the dung fire over which the meat cooked no i dont but i dont think i can turn into a raumsdalian either no more can i make myself into a bizogot hamnet thyssen said are you sure liv asked you would be an ornament to my folk an ornament to my clan you are strong and brave and wiseand a man as i should know she looked at him out of the corner of her eye what holds you to the empire loyalty he said at once i must go down to nidaros and let the emperor know what i have seen what i have done and what i think we need to do in times to come liv gave him a nod that was almost a bow your answer does you honor but once youve shown your loyalty why not come north again and lead the free life of the tents with me what would you be losing hamnet had never thought of himself as a man who set much store by material things but things were what sprang to mind when he asked himself why he didnt want to live the mammothherders life for the rest of his days books beds linen bread ale beer wine mead even the language hed known from his cradle was a thing ot sorts he could get along in the bizogot tonguehe could indeed do better than get alongbut it wasnt his and never would be he laughed a little when he thought of tobacco it was ulrics vice not his hed smoked only enough to convince himself he didnt want more but the herb came up to raumsdalia from the south and it hardly ever came any farther north the only bizogots who used it were men whod learned the habit in the empire but never having the chance to smoke again that seemed a bigger thing how much would he miss the society of his fellow raumsdalians not much not most of the time he was honest enough to own up to that but most of the time he stayed in his castle and his countrymen had the courtesy to leave him the demon alone escaping the bizogots if he came north to live would be much harder it might well prove impossible for all the vast plains they roamed the barbarians lived in clumps and knots of people especially in winter if they were going to survive they had to hamnet thyssen imagined himself cooped up with a tentful of nomads for months on end the picture didnt want to form the more he thought about it the less that surprised him he sighed you have your place i have mine maybe you wouldnt fit in mine i dont know if thats so but i can see how it might be but im sure i would never make a bizogot i need to be by myself too much he wondered if that would make any sense to her to his relief and a little to his surprise she nodded at once yes i saw as much when we traveled she said few bizogots have such a need is it common in your folk not very hamnet admitted liv nodded again all the other raumsdalians up here even hapless audun gilli and scholarly eyvind torfinn were more outgoing than he he continued but what others of my folk feel is not the problem what i feel is you seem to want my company liv didnt mean only that he wanted to sleep with her though that was in her voice too and now hamnet thyssen nodded i do he said aside from that he wasnt going to deny it was there he hardly could things being as they werei like talking with you and one of the reasons i like talking with you is that you dont feel as if you have to talk all the time you he groped for words you keep quiet in a pleasant tone of voice he waited that would have said what he wanted to say in raumsdalian he wasnt so sure it did in the bizogot language when liv smiled so did he in relief i thank you she said im not sure i ever got higher praise now hamnet wasnt sure whether she was sincere or sarcastic i meant it for such she smiled again i know you did bizogots do live in each others pockets dont we we cant help it you know if we didnt help each other all the time if we didnt stay close so we could help each other we couldnt live up here at all no i suppose not hamnet said now ive seen how you live dont you want to come down to the empire and find out what life is like there you wouldnt have to stay i dont think ill stay forever myself he drummed his fingers on the outside of his thigh i dont think the rulers will let me peacefully stay there liv bit her lip part of me would like to but i dont know its a far country far away and very strange you went through the gap you went beyond the glacier hamnet gestured toward the towering ice mountains that shaped the northern horizon after that what is the journey to the empire a stroll a nothing the way south gets easier not harder she shook her head the travel might not be hard the travel probably isnt hard but when i went beyond the glacier i was still myself what would i be when i came to the empire nothing but a barbarian she spoke the last word in the raumsdalian she was slowly learning if anyone calls you a barbarian turn him into a lemming hamnet thyssen said that will teach the next fool to mind his manners or if it doesnt hes a big enough fool to deserve being a lemming you dont understand liv sounded almost desperate chances are no one will call me a barbarian to my face you people dont come out and say the things you think the way we do but you think them whether you say them or notand what can i do about that count hamnet grunted she wasnt wrong raumsdalians did think bizogots were barbarians he thought so himself he had good reasons for thinking so he also had good reasons for making exceptions now and againas with this shaman with tears standing in her eyes would his countrymen make those kinds of exceptions he feared not and what he feared must have shown on his face for liv said you see it would be the way i told you she started to turn away then looked back at him in angry defiance give me one good reason why i should go down to the empire a good reason i tell you she was afraid he could see that but for a moment he could find no reasons anyhow not reasons of the kind she meant then he didand in finding one he discovered liv was not the only one who could be afraid on this cold autumn morning if he told her what the reason was but he would lose her if he didnt he could see that even so his heard pounded like a kettledrum in his chest as he answered because i love you her eyes widened maybe she had some small idea of how hard that was for him to say she couldnt possibly know all of it not unless she knew everything about him and gudrid even not knowing everything she said you look as if that was harder than going into battle maybe it was hamnet said how could it be in a battle all they can do is kill you if you love someone and it goes wrong you spend years wishing you were dead hamnet knew how true that was you mean it liv said wonder in her voice i usually mean what i say he answered i meant what i said when i told you i loved you too and i meant what i said when i told you i wanted you to come down to the empire with me will you i dont know she said which made him want to shout in frustration he made himself keep quiet if he pushed too hard he would push her away he could feel that instead of pushing he waited slowly she went on but i dont see how i can say no not with things the way they are not when i love you too ah he saida small sound one that didnt come close to showing how his heart exploded in rainbow delight livs nod was altogether serious yes she said i do and because i do it seems only right i should go south youve seen how bizogots live i should at least see your way too she made it sound only reasonable hamnet was much too glad to care how it sounded xvi setting out across the broad plains of the bizogot country with winters frozen fingers gripping tighter every day should have chilled hamnets heart it should have but it didnt snow and sleet and likely hunger and bizogots who couldnt stand raumsdalians or the three tusk clan or both at once hamnet thyssen didnt worry not worrying felt strange unnatural almost perverse all the same he didnt he was with someone who mattered to him more than all the possible worries put together i hardly know you with that smile on your face ulric skakki said ah well said hamnet who hardly knew himself with this smile on my face i hardly know you either whats that supposed to mean ulric asked just what it said and not a bit more count hamnet answered ulric skakki rode off shaking his head which suited hamnet fine gudrid left him alone at the start of the journey south from the three tusk clans encampment which suited him fine he waited for her to try to find some way to make him less happy as shed done whenever she caught him smiling after she left him hed always stolidly pretended not to care about her never with much success now though he truly didnt an armor hed never enjoyed before he was tempted to flaunt his happiness with liv to get gudrids goat he wouldnt have minded revenge gudrid had put him through too much to leave him immune to its charms but what he wanted even more was freedom from the hooks shed set in his soul shed been harder to break away from than poppy juice mostly because hed always wanted her back more than hed wanted her to go away and leave him alone she couldnt go away now not till they got back to nidaros she could keep on leaving him alone though he wanted no more from herand no less but not long after he found what he wanted gudrid suddenly decided she couldnt stay away from him it would have been funny if he didnt have so much trouble keeping his hand off the hilt of his sword she guided her horse alongside his as they rode south when he made as if to steer his mount away from her she stayed with him so slumming makes you happy does it she asked he looked at herlooked through her really no i didnt end up happy with you he replied gudrid laughed if you were half as funny as you think you are youd be twice as funny as you really are if you dont care for my conversation youre welcome to find someone else to annoy hamnet thyssen said here i try to give you good advice and this is the thanks i get gudrid sounded convincingly woundedbut not convincingly enough the only good advice youd give me is which poison to take and how to jump off a cliff count hamnet said oh i expect you can figure out that sort of thing for yourself gudrid pulled off a mitten for a moment so she could flutter her fingers at him youre clever about matters like that its people you have trouble with no doubt hamnet thyssen said look how long i put up with you just so gudrid said placidly as she returned the mitten to her hand what makes you think youll do any better this time around well i could scarcely do worse could i hamnet said you never know not till it happens ill take my chances hamnet said why dont you go back to telling eyvind torfinn what to do hes your sport these days isnt he youre more amusing though its harder to make him angry im sure you could manage if you set your mindor somethingto it meow she said jealousy doesnt become you im not jealous of eyvind torfinn hamnet listened to himself it was true he wasnt jealous it so surprised him he said it again im not jealous of eyvind torfinn by god if he wants you so much hes welcome to you gudrid stared she must have heard the conviction in his voice and it must have surprised her as much as it surprised him she yanked hard at her horses reins the luckless beast snorted as she jerked its head away and rode off hamnet thyssen went on alone for some little while after that for the time being he was free from the longing for what once had been he wasnt sure she entirely believed that even now but she would surely begin to suspect it might be so and when she decided it was what would she do then whenever the travelers met other bizogot clans trasamund would go onand on and onabout their wanderings beyond the glacier hed come with them precisely so he could speak with each clans jarl as an equal he talked about the rulers and about the way they rode mammoths that always made the bizogots chieftains and clansmen sit up and take notice everyone who heard about it seemed wild to try it why didnt we think of that was a refrain count hamnet heard over and over again then trasamund would talk about how the bizogot clans needed to band together against the invasion that was bound to come before long every other jarl who heard that would smile and nod politely and then would go on with whatever hed been doing before trasamund raised the point riding mammoths interested the bizogots taking steps against what hadnt happened yet didnt whats wrong with them trasamund growled when yet another jarl refused to get excited about the threat i can tell you your ferocity ulric skakki said and i can tell you something elseyou wont like it try me trasamund turned it into a challenge suppose a jarl from near the border with raumsdalia came up to the three tusks country and told you the empire was going to invade his grazing lands when spring came what would you do about it the jarl frowned me probably not much not by my lonesome its a long way off and his voice trailed away he sent ulric skakki a perfectly poisonous glare you have a nasty way of making your point ah god bless you your ferocity you say the sweetest things ulric crooned trasamund muttered into his beard not for the first time ulrics gratitude for things that werent meant as compliments succeeded in confusing the person whod aimed the unpleasantry his way hes right im afraid hamnet thyssen said gloomily when the rulers bump up against these clans theyll worry about them till then folk from the far side of the glacier dont seem real to them but they ought to trasamund said you raumsdalians can see the problem even though it isnt right on top of you well weve gone beyond the glacier too hamnet said we hope the emperor will see it but you need to remember he broke off not wanting to offend the jarl remember what trasamund asked what by god hamnet thyssen knew he needed to pick his words with care what he meant was that the bizogots were nothing but barbarians and so of course they didnt worry much about what would happen in a few months no matter what he meant he didnt want to say that for one thing it would anger trasamund for another he had no guarantee that the future meant anything more to sigvat ii than it did to a fleabitten mammothherder he scratched plenty of fleas had bitten him too flow he looked forward to a long soak and best of all to clean clothes he still had to answer trasamund who waited impatiently you need to remember the rulers will seem less real to the emperor than even to your own folk nidaros is much farther away from the gap than your camps are and so the raumsdalians will try to use the bizogots as a shield the way they bribe the southern clans now to help hold out the fiercer men from the north trasamund thumped his own chest with a big hard fist reminding count hamnet he was one of those fiercer men himself how can you imagine we would do such a thing hamnet said as innocently as he could the bizogot jarl laughed in his face by god your grace i would if i lived in sigvats palace we are mammothherdersyou think you can get away with being bizogotherders but there is a difference the mammoths dont know what were doing to them bizogots arent blind men or deaf men either sooner or later you raumsdalians will be sorry he was likely to be right no he was bound to be right once upon a time back in the days when history and legend blurred together the raumsdalians had roamed the frozen steppe in those days it ran much farther south than it did now hamnet thyssens distant ancestors had torn the meat from the bones of the empire that preceded raumsdalia one of these days maybe the bizogots would storm nidaros and set up their own kingdom on its ruins or maybe the rulers would swarm down through the gap and beat the bizogots to the punch hamnet thyssen didnt know that the barbarians from the far side of the glacier could do any such thing he didnt know they could no but he didnt know they couldnt either and that worried him i can see that the rulers are a danger trasamund said if sigvat ii cant maybe he doesnt deserve to be emperor anymore maybe something will happen so he isnt one thing god doeshe makes sure fools pay for their folly well youre right about that hamnet wasnt thinking about sigvat and the rulers liv likes you now trasamund spoke hesitantly even a jarl took care talking about a shaman yes hamnet said i like her too be careful with her i dont want her hurt she isnt just a good shaman shes a good bizogot and a good woman too if she werent a good woman i wouldnt like her the way i do hamnet thyssen hoped that was true if you were a bizogot trasamunds voice trailed off a moment later he tried again saying if you were a three tusk bizogot im not hamnet said im never going to be you know that as well as i do your ferocity i dont expect liv to turn into a raumsdalian that wont happen either i know it i should say not but she would lose something if she turned into one of your folk you would gain something if you turned into a bizogot my folk would say it the other way around you know count hamnet said trasamund laughed uproariously he thought that was the funniest thing in the world hamnet thyssen had known he would if barbarians recognized that they were barbarians they wouldnt be so barbarous any more he of course was right and full of reason when he declined to think about becoming a bizogot that was as plain as the nose on his face at the moment the nose on his face had a muffler over it to keep the blizzards from freezing it off him he rode on toward the south but winter rode ahead of him in spring sudertorp lake had been a marvelous place full of ducks and geese and swans and waders and shore scuttlersevery manner of bird that lived in or near the water seemed to want to breed in the bushes and marshes and reeds that lined the immense meltwater lake in winter though hamnet thyssen had never seen sudertorp lake in the wintertime before he was sorry to see it now under a gray sky the water and ice of sudertorp lake in winter were the color of phlegm the north windthe breath of godwhipped the water to waves and whitecaps that tossed sullenly where they could toward the shore the surface of the lake was frozen count hamnet supposed the ice would advance across the water till the turning of the sun made it retreat once more right now that turning looked a long way off a long long way indeed the bushes and reeds and rushes were yellow and brown and dead the turning of the sun would also bring them back to life but that seemed likelier to be legend than truth hamnet would have been sure of it if he hadnt come through here in the springtime in spring the leaping lynx clan camped by the eastern shore of sudertorp lake the bizogots of that clan lived off the fat of the land then so many birds bred and foraged here a clans worth of hunting mattered no more to them than a mosquito bite to a man in winter though the leaping lynxes lakeside houses stood empty the bizogots had to go forth and follow their herds and flocks like any other clan trasamund surveyed the empty stone buildings with a certain somber satisfaction serves them rightyou know what i mean he said in the springtime riccimir gets above himself he might as well be a raumsdalian a raumsdalian ulric skakki said thats right trasamund nodded he doesnt have to move around so much so he thinks hes better than the people who do if i thought not moving around made me better would i have gone beyond the glacier ulric asked twice he asked to himself but you are a man of sense the bizogot jarl said riccimir is an overstuffed mammoth turd what does he call you hamnet thyssen asked who cares trasamund answered which might have meant he truly didnt care or might have meant he couldnt see the boot might fit on the other foot as well hamnet would have bet on the latter trasamund was better at seeing other peoples weaknesses than at noting his own the travelers came upon the leaping lynxes winter encampment their wandering encampment a day after the pause by sudertorp lake it seemed like any other bizogot campbut then again it didnt the mammothherders were doing the same sort of things as all their fellows did and doing them about as well as the other bizogots did but every other clan hamnet thyssen had seen took those labors altogether for granted the leaping lynxes seemed faintly embarrassed at living in tents and following the herds they knew another way of life they not only knew it they preferred it when riccimir gave his guests roasted muskox meat he said its not fat goose my friends but its what we have nothing wrong with musk ox trasamund said his lips shiny with grease nothing wrong with it no the jarl of the leaping lynxes agreed but its not as fine a flesh as waterfowl im not just speaking of geese mind you though theyre common and theyre easy to take but when you eat snipe and woodcock through the fat season of the year you arent so happy with the leaner days he shrugged broad shoulders it cant be helped i know it cant be helpedits the way god made things work for us but i wish it were different and i dont know a leaping lynx who doesnt you like living soft trasamund said without rancor hamnet thyssen wouldnt have put it that way he would have said the leaping lynxes took advantage of their springtime abundance maybe those amounted to the same thing he wasnt sure and he would have bet trasamund wasnt either as for riccimir he replied what if we do youd live the way we do too if only you could will you call me a liar no trasamund said if hed said yes it would have meant a fight to the death but he went on be careful how soft you get or some other clan will drive you away from sudertorp lake then youll go back to wandering all through the year if youre lucky enough to hold together as a clan weve been attacked before riccimir said we still hold our lands anyone who ever tried to take them came to grief what does that tell you that youve done what you needed to doso far trasamund said but you have to win every single time if you lose even once youre ruined and for which bizogot clan isnt that so riccimir said trasamund had no answer for him neither did hamnet thyssen what riccimir said spoke of the differences between the bizogots and the raumsdalian empire the riches of sudertorp lake in springtime let the leaping lynx clan approach civilization but it was still as vulnerable as any other clan one defeat meant disaster the empire could draw upon more resources losing one fight wouldntor wouldnt have tomean collapse for it what about the rulers hamnet wondered how much in the way of failure can they stand before too long he worried that he would find out down toward the tree line where the frozen plains ended and forests began the bizogots yielded to the raumsdalian empire hamnet thyssen knew how tenuous raumsdalian rule over the northern part of the empire was in the north everything was tenuous there wasnt enough food and werent enough people to make life as relatively safe and secure and rich as it was down by nidaros trasamund kept looking back over his shoulder and shaking his head even when the weather was clear the glacier had fallen below the horizon doesnt seem natural he said the north looks naked the cold wind that blew down from the glacier left hamnet thyssen in no doubt that it hadnt gone away he said as much adding it wont either not for many many generations even to think that it might one day is as strange as thinking god might get old and die trasamund said eyvind torfinn rode close enough to hear him some men in the empire have been known to wonder about that your ferocity he said they argue that everything else grows old and dies that even the glacier is falling back and may leave us one day so why shouid the same not hold true for god really trasamund said what do you do with men who ask things like that yes what hamnet thyssen echoed i dont remember hearing about men with those ideas and id think it would kick up a scandal it did earl eyvind answered this was about a hundred and twentyyears ago you understand in the reign of palnir i if i remember rightly one of the philosophers got fifty lashes the other two got twentyfive apiece and they were all exiled to a town in the far southwest where they could watch ground sloths and glyptodonts and hope the manches didnt nip in and cut their throats im surprised they got away with their lives hamnet said palnir had a name for being merciful eyvind torfinn said he told them he wouldnt kill them himselfhe would leave that to god you raumsdalians are softer than the leaping lynxes trasamund said but whats a glyptodont do you know what an armadillo is hamnet thyssen said the bizogot shook his head hamnet wasnt surprised armadillos and their bigger cousins liked warm weather and didnt come up anywhere near nidaros he went on imagine a pot with a long handle turn it upside down make the handle its tailsort of a bony club give it a head and four short legs also armored in bone make it ten feet long from nose to tailtip and three or four feet high its not very bright and it only eats plants but a sabertooth will break his fangs before he can puncture it youre having me on trasamund said thats the craziest beast i ever heard of no hes telling the truth eyvind torfinn said i dont believe it trasamund said stubbornly you figure youve got a fool of a bizogot here and you think you can tell him funny stories and have a laugh afterward go ask ulric if you dont believe me hamnet said the bizogot jarl shook his head again not me you probably all cooked it up amongst yourselves beforehand he rode away his head still going back and forth not much later though hamnet watched him riding along next to jesper fletti trasamund might have thought hamnet wouldnt conspire with gudrid s chief bodyguardand if he did he was right by jespers gestures he knew what a glyptodont was trasamund threw his hands in the air hamnet thyssen began looking for border stations they were thinly scattered and wouldnt have been easy to spot if not for the smoke that rose from them all through the winter a lot of bizogots skirted the stations when they came down into the empire some succeeded in smuggling their goods or themselves into raumsdalia others ran into customs inspectors in the small northern towns and paid duty there a smoke plume led the travelers to a border post the guards wore furs that made them look like bizogots one of them stared at the newcomers and said if youre not the raggediestlooking bunch of buggers ive ever seen bugger me with a pine cone if i can think of who is if youre not a disgrace to the uniform you arent wearing gods more merciful than i thought hamnet thyssen retorted hearing unaccented educated angry raumsdalian burst from the mouth of the shaggy ragamuffin in front of him gave the border guard pause uh who are you anyway he asked his own voice suddenly much less scornful you might have wondered sooner i am count hamnet thyssen with my companions here ive traveled beyond the glacier and i have come back to tell the talebut to the emperor not to the likes of you the guards jaw dropped youre the people who went beyond the glacier you really did he turned to his comrades god let them come back vigfus somebody did anyhow vigfus allowed or so they say do you suppose we ought to believe em if you do not believe trasamund jarl of the three tusk clan of bizogots god may not punish you trasamund said god may not but i will he made as if to draw his great twohanded sword do you call me a liar who will mourn for you when you die anyone or will your flesh feed foxes and teratorns keep your hair on pal said vigfus whod surely heard bizogot bluster before if you really made it through the gap more power to you we were supposed to keep an eye out for you people but i never figured youd come through here the other guard said what are the odds whatever the odds may be here we are eyvind torfinn said we have done much we have traveled far and we have seen strange things his majesty sigvat ii needs to hear of them as soon as we get to nidaros vigfus and his friend looked at each other at the same time they asked did you find the golden shrine well no eyvind torfinn answered but that doesnt mean it isnt there well go back one day and maybe well find it then we did find white bears and deer that men ride like horses and beasts like lions only without manes and with stripes hamnet said and we found men who ride mammoths trasamund said by god i will ride a mammoth before too much time goes by i will he folded his right hand into a fist and brought it down hard on his thigh men who ride mammoths said the guard whose name they didnt know are they very brave or very stupid yes answered ulric skakki whod kept quiet till then whats that supposed to mean the guard asked what it says ulric told him im like count hamnet herei usually say what i mean people have a better chance of understanding me when i do the rulers are very brave and by god theyre very stupid too the rulers what kind of name is that vigfus said hamnet thyssen ulric skakki eyvind torfinn and trasamund all shrugged together its what they call themselves or how they say it when they use the bizogot language hamnet said i dont know what you want us to do about it gudrid rode up to the guards why are you wasting our time here she demanded why dont you let us go back to civilization vigfus looked at her it wasnt the way a man looked at a pretty woman with half a years grime on them none of the travelers was pretty any more who the demon does she think she is the border guard asked no one in particular she thinks shes my wife eyvind torfinn said shes right too did gudrid think that hamnet had his doubts when she felt like it maybe she did huh vigfus said shes a mouthy one she is you should belt her more often teach her to behave gudrids squeal was pure rage you are speaking to and of an earls wife she said shrilly show the proper respect oh shut up vigfus said gudrids jaw dropped that wasnt what shed had in mind she was used to getting her way with men with a wave of the hand and a wink of the eye not here not now vigfus went on im a guard at the most godforsaken post in the empire what can you do to me thats worse send me to prison somewhere farther south ill get down on my knees and kiss your hand or whatever else you want kissed if you do but the way things are ill talk however i cursed well please she stared at him some men in the empire were strong enough to take no notice when she said something shed never imagined a man who could be weak enough to do the same thing and neither had hamnet thyssen may we pass on he asked simple respect was the only thing the guards were looking for yes your grace replied the one who wasnt named vigfus pass on to the south tell the folk there what youve told us see if they believe you anymore than we do with that less than ringing endorsement hamnet did ride south with the rest of the travelers once they got out of earshot of the border post ulric skakki said by now i hardly care whether i tell the emperor what weve seen or not all i care about is finding a town with a bathhouse did you see those guards some time not too long ago they had baths both of them isnt that something he scratched as usual that made hamnet scratch too how many different kinds of bugs was he carrying around on his person and in his clothes too many he was sure of that liv stared at the firs and spruces through which they rode so big she murmured in an awestruck voice are they really alive they really are hamnet assured her his voice grave we make things from the wood and we use it for fires instead of dung yes i can see how you might so much of it in each tree there for the taking the bizogot shaman said truly this is a rich land hamnet thyssens jaw dropped these northern provinces were heartbreakingly poorbackbreakingly poor too if you had to try to claw a living from them woodsmen and trappers were almost the only people who could he eyed liv with something that went deeper than astonishment because what she said spoke volumes about how different they were in her eyes this miserable country seemed rich beyond compare and why wouldnt it summer here probably lasted six weeks longer than it did up where she lived hard by the glacier the ground wasnt permanently frozen liv had never seen a tree before in all her life a land warm enough to let them grow was a land richer than any the bizogots inhabited realizing that almost left hamnet embarrassed to be a raumsdalian how much his own folk took for granted they sneered at the bizogots for all the things the mammothherders lacked but that wasnt the bizogots fault it was the fault of the country in which they lived the rulers lived even farther north than the bizogots hamnet had seen that they used iron did they forge it themselves or did they get it in trade from some unknown land far to the west and south as the bizogots got it from the empire hamnet didnt knowby the nature of things how could he but he was sure of one thing if the rulers reached raumsdalian territory even these hardscrabble provinces along the northern border they would think the land was as rich as liv did that wasnt good news not as far as raumsdalia was concerned up in a tree a blue jay screeched at the travelers what makes that noise liv asked a jay hamnet thyssen pointed up to it the bird didnt like that maybe it thought his outstretched arm and hand were an arrow aimed its way screeching still it flapped off to another fir farther away liv laughed and clapped her mittened hands its a piece of the sky with wings she exclaimed ive never seen anything so pretty how many other birds do you have that we never see up by the glacier how many i dont know earl eyvind might be able to tell you or one of the savants down in nidaros hamnet answered but there are lots of them jays warblers orioles woodpeckers they were only names to liv woodpeckers she echoed uncertainly count hamnet translated the word into the bizogot tongue then he told how they pounded their bills into trees going after insects and grubs liv laughed when he finished youre making that up she said as trasamund had when he heard about glyptodonts youre telling me a story because i dont know any better the way we might talk about a musk ox with a trunk if we were making sport of a raumsdalian who thought he knew it all its not a storyits the truth hamnet said by god it is ask any other raumsdalian you please ask your jarlchances are hes seen them or maybe heard them drumming drumming liv repeated that too why dont their heads fall off from all that banging if they do what you say they do i dont know count hamnet had never worried about it and we have bats too though not this far north think of a vole or a lemming give it big ears and sharp teeth and wings that are all bare skinno feathers or anything thats what bats are they hunt at night and they eat bugs next youll probably tell me you have things that live in the rivers but arent fish liv said with a scornful sniff we do hamnet talked about frogs he talked about turtles he talked about alligators and crocodiles finishing those live only in the far south there are probably a few alligators in the southern part of the empire but not many liv eyed him you arent making these things up no im not by god im not hamnet thyssen said we have lots of creatures you dont because your winters would kill them he talked about toads and salamanders he talked about lizards he talked about snakes this time he finished some of them have poisonous fangs if they bite you it can kill if it doesnt it will make you very sick he wondered if she would think he was lying about those her face thoughtful she said a trader from the empire came up to the three tusk country a few years ago and talked about creatures like those we all thought he was the biggest liar in the world even if we didnt say so why didnt you hamnet asked you bizogots are quick enough to call raumsdalians liars most of the time liv wrinkled her nose at him well a lot of the time you are liars but no we didnt call him on his stories they were new to us and they helped make the time go by we didnt believe them so what we still enjoyed them fair enough i suppose hamnet said with a smile of his own your ferocity liv calledtrasamund was half a bowshot ahead of her on the trail through the forest he looked back over his shoulder and waved to show hed heard she booted her horse up into a trot to catch up to him hamnet thyssen sped up too when liv got close enough to the jarl to talk without shouting she said remember that raumsdalian trader who told us tales about the legless things with the poison teeth trasamund threw back his head and laughed im not likely to forget him he could spin them couldnt he he was telling the truth liv said he must have been hamnet here just told me about the same creatures oh he did did he the bizogot jarl eyed count hamnet whos to say hes not lying through his beard too i could tell you the chances of two men making up the same strange animal are slim hamnet said or i could just tell you im not lying and if you want to make something out of it and say i am go ahead trasamund eyed him you wouldnt fight over a noaccount thing like a story a bizogot might but a raumsdalian wouldnt so i suppose you are telling the truth who would have believed it these beasts are real they are count hamnet said have you ever heard the phrase a snake in the grass he shifted to his own tongue for the last few words yes it means something sneaky and dangerous thats right snakes crawl around in the grass and its easy to miss them with the poison in their fangs though they can make you sorry if you do well well trasamund plucked at his beard how many snakes in the grass do you suppose we have with us hamnet thyssen found no good answer for that in raumsdalian or the bizogot tongue xvii by the standards of nidaros the hostel in the northern town of naestved would have been thirdrate at best but even a thirdrate hostel boasted a bathhouse a big hot fire blazed in a hearth near the two copper tubs that sat side by side the travelers rolled dice for the order in which they would bathe hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki had to wait far into the night hamnet didnt care neither did ulric did you hear the landlord squawk about how much water hed have to heat he said and then ducked himself and scrubbed at his hair he came up blowing like one of the whales seacoast people talked about the poor dear youd think we werent paying for the wood hamnet thyssen said doing some scrubbing of his own the steaming bathwater had been clean when he stepped into his tub it wasnt clean any more it was grayish brown and scummed with soapsuds his own skin by contrast was getting toward the color he remembered its being once upon a time oh but were making his servants work for their living they dont like it any better than anybody else would as usual ulric skakki had enough cynicism for two or three ordinary people i want to wallow here for the next week hamnet said this is almost as wonderful as i thought it would be only two things separated him from perfect bliss for one thing the soap the landlord gave them was harsh and strongsmelling for another ulric leered at him you wish liv were in this tub instead of me or more likely you wish she were in that tub along with you hamnet s ears heated that was exactly what he wished he wondered if liv had ever had a real bath before he doubted it among the bizogots hot water except for cooking was hard to come by they washed their hands and faces sometimes they steamed themselves pouring water onto fireheated stones but he was sure theyd never heard of bathtubs she would have to bathe with gudrid that filled hamnet with misgivings gudrid might try to lead liv astray for the fun of it but if liv watched what gudrid did herself she wouldnt go far wrong these tubs are narrow to fit two ulric went on of course if you fit one on top of the other oh shut up hamnet told him this time ulric didnt leer he just grinnedhed wanted to get under hamnets skin and hed done it down in nidaros he said they make tubs a little wider because they know people will want to sport in them do they hamnet said and is this something youve heard or have you tried it for yourself oh ive tried it ulric skakki said cheerfully doing things is a lot more fun than talking about them some people will tell you the opposite but theyre liarsor if theyre not im sorry for them doing some things is more fun than talking about them hamnet said id sooner talk about lice and fleas and bedbugs than deal with them in person he looked at the specks floating in his bathwater how many of them were drowned bugs too manyhe was sure of that had he killed them all he was just as sorrowfully sure he hadnt have to take the bad with the good ulric s shrug made water slosh out of his tub not everyone sees that he paused sometimes i think hardly anyone sees that everyone sees why the other fellow needs to take the bad with the good hamnet thyssen said why he needs to do it himself thats a different story somebody banged on the bathhouse door havent you two turned into prunes yet jesper fletti called through the spruce planks almost all the wood up here was fir and spruce drawn from the enormous northern forests some of the rest of us want to see what color we really are too jesper added all right all right well get out ulric said regretfully under his breath he went on talk about taking the bad with the good or after the good anyhow hamnet sighed as he got out of the tub the water was starting to get cold but it hadnt got there yet in spite of the fire roaring in the hearth the air in the bathhouse was chilly he went and stood in front of the flames to dry off and warm up ulric skakki stood beside him hamnet was the bigger man but saying which of them was harder wouldnt have been easy hamnet eyed ulrics scars youve been in a scrape or three havent you oh you might say so ulric skakki surveyed hamnet s hairy arms and torso now that you mention it so have you the other fellows will fight back now and again hamnet said treacherous dogs but what can you do kill em fast before they have the chance to do anything to you ulric answered good advice anyone would know you were a fighting man hamnet ran a comb through his hair and beard then he stared at the bone tool i hope its not covered with nits if it is if it is youll know about it before long ulric who was also combing himself paused to mime scratching at least we can bathe now that will help and if we soak our hair in oil that will help more i suppose so count hamnet put on a robe the landlord swore was pestfree ulric skakki donned another one the bizogotstyle clothes theyd worn on their travels were being fumigated with burning sulfur the stinking smoke would kill most of the pests the garments carried as for the ones that survived well now that the travelers were back in civilization they could always fumigate the furs again they could even get new clothes the bizogots would have thought nothing of skinning and tanning hides up on the frozen steppe hamnet might have tried it himself in a pinch but he was glad he hadnt had to the mammothherders were bound to be better at it than he was when he and ulric opened the door jesper fletti and eyvind torfinn glowered at them took you long enough jesper said wait till the next pair start yelling at you hamnet said and they will they will i suspect he may be right eyvind torfinn said i dont care if he is jesper fletti said he turned and shouted in the direction of the kitchens wheres that clean hot water by god do you expect me to soak in somebody elses swill so charming ulric skakki murmured hamnet thyssen carefully didnt smile jesper fletti gave ulric a sharp look but the bathhouse attendants came up just then and jesper went back to yelling at them instead count hamnet thought that wise jesper fletti was a large strong tough man if he got into a fight with someone ordinary he would win and win easily if he got into a fight with ulric his size and strength and toughness might keep him alive an extra half minute or so or on the other hand they might not eyvind torfinn didnt quarrel with the attendants he eyed them as if they were the most wonderful people hed ever met to be clean he said i shall be clean hamnet thyssen walked down the hall before eyvind could finish the conjugation not that he didnt sympathize but he already knew how the verb worked next morning he found fresh bites in a way that infuriated him in another way it showed hed made progress for weeks for months hed been bitten so often that he hardly noticed new marksone itch blended into another now he had few enough that they stood out maybe one day before too long if he kept bathing and went on fumigating his clothes he wouldnt have any wouldnt that be something fat snowflakes frisked on the breeze as the travelers rode out of naestved liv looked back over her shoulder watching the palisade disappear behind them when she sighed the wind blew her breath too everyone talks about how rich the empire is she said and sighed again trasamund has come down here before and ive listened to him go on about it but i never imagined it could be as rich as this her wave encompassed both the town they were leaving and the dour forest around it naestved isnt anything much hamnet thyssen said truthfully liv stared at him sure he was joking when she saw he wasnt she sighed one more time i think you have so many things that you take them all for granted plainly she chose her words with care maybe we do hamnet said plenty of priests would be happy to tell you how right you areyou can bet on that what she said about priests would have horrified any of them who heard her it made eyvind torfinn and ulric skakki whip their heads around in astonishment i did not mean anything that has to do with my comrades here she went on in more moderate tones but you raumsdalians do have so many things that i wonder how you can stand to do without them when you come up to the bizogot country that thought had also crossed hamnet thyssens mind a lot of us wouldnt want to he admitted uncomfortably a lot of us wouldnt be able to but things are only things either you own themor they own you if you cant do without them they own you i dont want to be owned thank you very much you even talk like a bizogot she said how you say naestved is nothing much that means you must have seen better though i dont know what could be finer than that hot water to bathe in things to put the hot water in tubs count hamnet said helpfully tubs liv repeated soft things to sleep on beds beds she said and the food made from ground grain bread she found the word before he gave it to her and the tents with wooden walls houses so much wood everywhere even wood around the town to keep out enemies she shook her head in wonder to keep out the bizogots hamnet thyssen thought here in the north there were no other enemies he shook his head there hadnt been any other enemies not till the gap melted through now the rulers would come through come down onto the bizogots frozen plainswhich would seem familiar enough to themand then if they got this far into the empire so many things liv went on this is because you dont have to wander to follow the herds isnt it partly maybe even mostly hamnet answered it would be hard to carry bathtubs around in a mammothhide tent but also partly because the country is different it would be hard to herd mammoths and musk oxen through the forest i think so liv exclaimed i look at these trees and i think they all lean toward me i think they all want to fall on me we go through them and i feel they are all squeezing in on me she gestured with her hands some raumsdalians when they come up into the bizogot country they feel the land is too big they feel like flies walking across a plate hamnet thyssen gestured too they feel the land is so wide and they are so small that god has forgot them she laughed really after hamnet nodded she asked did you ever feel this way he thought she expected him to say no but he nodded again sure enough she looked surprised on the bizogot plains i feel small count hamnet said if a mammoth could think it would feel small out on the bizogot plains but some of my countrymen have it worse than i do some of them feel as if theyre about to disappear how funny how strange liv said but the forest doesnt bother them ive heard raumsdalians say they feel crowded here hamnet replied farther south we have forests and fields all mixed together we have towns that make naestved look like nothing beside them we have rivers that stay unfrozen all year longwell except in hard winters anyhow and we have boats that travel on them we have boats liv said proudly we make them from hides and use mammoth bones to give them their shape we use them for fishing and to cross streams too deep for fording so there hamnet thyssen thought im no savagemy people can do these things too liv was saying ours are bigger he said gently theyre mostly made of wood because it floats on water he felt odd saying thathow could anyone not know it on the other hand how could she know it living so far north of the tree line up where the three tusk clan roamed willows and birches were little shrubs hardly taller than the middle of a mans calf the forever frozen ground wouldnt let anything larger grow her eyes went wide so wide that he saw white all around the blue of her irises it floats you say then you can make boats as big as you please and they stay on top of the water hed already seen she was clever she understood right away what things meant even when they werent things shed had any reason to think about before we do make big boats he said they carry people and goods up and down the rivers most of the grain trade in the empire goes by boat because its so much cheaper to ship by water than by land up and down the rivers how do you go against the current our boats have sails hamnet thyssen answered they were mostly using the bizogot tongue but the new word had to come out in raumsdalian as best he could he explained what sails were and how they worked livs eyes widened again how marvelous she breathed this is one of the most wonderful sorceries i ever heard ofmore marvelous than anything i ever imagined myself believe me if you think this is magic then i didnt make myself plain count hamnet said its a craft a skill like tanning leather or carving bone is it are you sure liv asked suppose the wind doesnt blow the way you wish it would the way you need it to wont a shaman call up a wind to take the boat where it needs to go more likely the crew will use oars or will have horses to tow the boat upstream hamnet plucked at his beard he was no wizard he didnt know everything a spell might do if any of the travelers did audun gilli was the man hi audun hamnet called and waved to draw the sorcerers notice what is it your grace audun didnt seem as enthusiastic about going back to nidaros as the rest of the raumsdalians up in the bizogot country hed been able to set aside the cruel memories that haunted him now he was returning to them again he couldnt be looking forward to that if the breeze is against him can a wizard raise enough of his own wind to send a boat upstream hamnet asked well it depends on the boat and the wizard audun gilli answered if its a little sailboat and it doesnt have to go too far upstream a lot of wizards can manage i could do that myself i think if youre talking about a great wallowing barge with a couple of hundred head of cattle aboard thats another story maybe a team of strong sorcerers could bring it off but chances are theres some easier way to do it try that and fail and the wizards might not be worth much afterwards how much did you understand hamnet asked liv most i think she said in her own language then switched to raumsdalian to ask audun why not make better spells for such a useful thing because most of the time like i said you can go upstream without using much magic he replied dont you know spells you could use only most of the time you dont because theyre more trouble than theyre worth that got too complicated for her to follow easily count hamnet translated it into her language she thought it over then nodded yes there are some she said again in raumsdalian but for something this wonderful ah there we have it hamnet thyssen broke in you think boats and sails are marvelous and wonderful because theyre new to you down in the empire and the lands farther south yet weve been using boats for as long as anyone can remember and probably for longer than that we take them as much for granted as you take mammothhide tents how sad liv said in raumsdalian sad hamnet and audun both asked at the same time she nodded sad very sad wonders should be wonders to take them for granted is to waste them do you take making love for granted audun gilli shook his head by god i hope not hamnet said liv didnt claim he did which was a relief she just said well then as if shed proved her point to people who are used to them boats arent as importantor as wonderfulas making love hamnet said stubbornly audun gilli coughed hamnet sent him an annoyed look not least because he had a point of sorts men who skippered boats and men who made their living from them probably did think what happened aboard them was as important as what went on in bed you know what i mean hamnet said audun didnt deny it if he had hamnet would have looked around for something to clout him with well its not worth the argument liv said hamnet thyssen stared at her as surprised as if a shortfaced bear had spoken to him hed never heard those words from gudrid and what about you he asked himself hed never been known to back away from any argument hed kept this one going he wondered why who was right and who wrong counted for nothing not when you thought for a little while but he hadnt he wanted to be right whether he was right or not when you got down to it that was pretty stupid and hed only taken fortyodd years to realize it the really scary thing was he was doing better than most a lot of people went to their graves without ever figuring that out no its not he said and neither liv nor audun gilli had the slightest idea how much effort getting those three words past his lips took by raumsdalian standards the northern forests changed very slowly but liv noticed differences at once what are those trees with the white she asked and gestured because she couldnt remember the raumsdalian word she needed trunks count hamnet supplied and she nodded those are birches he said they look like skeletons liv took off her mittens and raised her hands with fingers widespread how do they live where are their leaves the last word came out in the bizogot language theyll grow them in spring and keep them into fall hamnet answered they do that every year the leaves fall off they turn brown and die most of them are buried under the snow now why do they do that she asked it seems like a waste the the firs and the spruces keep their leaves in this time why not the birches too i dont know maybe youd have to ask the trees hamnet thyssen said she made a face at him he called out to eyvind torfinn why do birches and oaks and willows lose their leaves in the fall eyvind stared on him what on earth makes you think id know something like that well i dont your splendor count hamnet said of all the people here i thought you had the best chance to tell me you know all sorts of strange things not that one i fear too bad hamnet thyssen turned back to liv if earl eyvind doesnt know you really do need to talk to the trees i wonder if i could magic out the answer the bizogot shaman sounded completely serious use the law of similarity to compare leaf to leaf branch to branch eyvind torfinn was no wizard but he knew a good deal about sorceryhe knew a good deal about anything that happened to catch his interest i dont see why you couldnt he said surprise and what sounded like wonder in his voice i dont believe anyone has ever used wizardry like that i dont believe anyone ever thought to use wizardry like that what are you going on about in that horrible language gudrid asked most of the time she paid as little attention to her husband as she could seeing him talking with liv though drew her noticeand her ire deciduous and evergreen trees eyvind replied in raumsdalian what about them gudrid still sounded suspicious why there are such things why theyre different and how one might go about finding out through sorcery his wife stared at him youre joking no why would i be eyvind torfinn sounded confused because if a man talks to a woman only a sap talks about trees gudrid rode down the path ahead of eyvind and liv and hamnet thyssen what was that all about liv asked she talked too fast for me to follow much youre lucky hamnet said my wife has a short temper sometimes eyvind torfinn said once in a while she lets it get away from her hamnet thyssen coughed a couple of times in lieu of snorting or breaking into wildinto madlaughter what earl eyvind said was true and the glacier was chilly and the sun warm and this forest rather wide sometimes understatement was the most effective way to lieeven to yourself did eyvind knowdid he even suspectshe was no more faithful to him than she had been to hamnet i cant very well ask hamnet thought this wasnt the first time hed wondered thoughfar from it usually the man was the one who wandered and also the one who bristled if the woman so much as looked at anybody else count hamnet did laugh then even if not in the gales hed almost loosed a moment before trust gudrid to do things backwards and then she screamed and he forgot about his musings he didnt need to hear the shortfaced bears growling roar to guess what was wrong the great bears haunted these northern woods and often didnt sleep through the winter a horseand a womanwould be just what a hungry bear was looking for gudrid screamed again no this time it was more of a shriek shed bragged about what an archer she was but that seemed forgot nowor maybe she never had a chance to string and draw her bow hamnet thyssen yelled too as he rode toward her he drew his sword no time for him to string his bow either maybe he could distract the bear keep it from attacking he shouted once more and laughed while he did the world turned upside down again more often than not he would have been happy to see gudrid dead and here he was riding to her rescue if that wasnt insane what was the shortfaced bear had gudrids horse down if the horse had tried to run it didnt have much luck shortfaced bears had longer legs than grizzlies and ordinary black bruins a horse with a running start might escape them but if the bear was already charging and the horse just ambling along the bear couldand this bear hadoutrun its intended prey before the horse got up to speed when the horse went over gudrid had jumped or been thrown clear but she wasnt running was she paralyzed with fear or had she hurt herself hamnet couldnt begin to guess it hardly mattered she was easier to kill than a kicking thrashing horse before long the bear would figure that out hamnet thyssen shouted at the top of his lungs the shortfaced bear ignored him it started eating the horse before the other animal was even dead if dinner kicked and squirmed and screamed so what the bears muzzle was crimson almost to the eyes how close to starving was it and if it did pay attention to hamnet and his onrushing horse what would it do run off he hoped so suppose it didnt suppose it went for his horseand himinstead what would he do then think of something fast he told himself hed be on the bear in another few heartbeats an arrow hissed past his headsomeone had managed to string his bow or perhaps was traveling with it strung the shaft thudded into the shortfaced bears hindquarters that got the beasts attention where hamnets shout hadnt the bear jumped and reared and roared again this time in pain and surprise rather than in fury as it reared he swung his sword the stroke wasnt perfect hed intended to strike its muzzle and badly wound it and all he managed to do was shear off the tip of one ear then his horse thundered past he tugged hard on the reins and guided the horse around with pressure from his knees and thighs if he had to make another pass at the bear he would he didnt two wounds at opposite ends were more than enough for the animal with a final snarl it limped off into the forest again it left a trail of blood behind had hamnet wanted to hunt it down he would have had an easy time tracking it he was content to let it go bravely done ulric skakki called he had an arrow nocked and ready to shoot so hamnet supposed hed let fly with the first one he didnt shoot again as the bear withdrew like hamnet he thought driving it off counted for more than killing it with a wry grin he added foolhardy maybe but bravely done looking back on things hamnet thought he was foolhardy too but hed got away with it are you all right he called to gudrid that horrible monster didnt eat me so im a lot better than i might be i hurt my ankle when i went off the horse though she looked up at him from the snow youre the last person i expected to come riding up and save me the same thing had gone through his mind while he was booting his horse forward shrugging he said i would have done it for anyone i would have done it for the horse come to that nice to know where i stander sprawl gudrid said whats worse is i believe you do you think the ankles broken or sprained or just twisted hamnet asked i dont know i think it would hurt more if it were broken but i never broke one before so how can i be sure gudrid eyed him again do you want to feel it and find out god knows youve wanted to get your hands on me again for long enough now around your neck maybe hamnet thyssen said grimly around your ankle no thanks somebody else can check the poor horse still writhed feebly he dismounted bent beside it and cut its throatthe last favor he could give it the horse let out a sigh that sounded amazingly human and died trasamund rode up he glanced at the horse well the bear didnt get a whole lot he said it can feed us now bizogots didnt waste much didnt waste anything if they could help it the jarl pointed to gudrid how bad is she hurt i dont know hamnet answered enough so she couldnt run anyhow do you want to see if that ankles broken well why not trasamund leered the way he prodded and tugged at gudrids ankle was all business though she gasped a couple of times but she didnt scream or burst into tears or even swear trasamund looked up from his work i think its sound but she should lie on her back for a while when shemmpf gudrid threw a snowball in his face serves you right you nasty man she said trasamund scrabbled at himself even after he got rid of some of the snow he still looked like a frozen ghost hamnet thyssen turned away so neither gudrid nor trasamund would see him laugh he still had little use for his former wife he didnt think he ever would but she had a pointthat snowball did serve trasamund right when they came out of the northern forests the sun was shining brightly the weather wasnt warm not by hamnet s standards but it was above freezing some of the snow on the ground had turned to slush some had even melted exposing patches of bare black earth they werent on the great north road but somewhere to the west of it liv laughed out loud she threw back her hood to let the sun shine on her head a thaw in wintertime she said who would believe that up in three tusk country why the breath of god hardly blows at all here when it blows it can blow hard hamnet said liv laughed again right in his face he held up a hand oh it can believe meit can not the way it will in your country at the worst but bad enough the difference is it doesnt blow all the time here this is about as far north as south winds can reach during the winter south winds in the winter a smile bright as the sun and much warmer still lit livs face it might have been the funniest thing shed ever heard in the winter in three tusk country there is no wind or more often there is the breath of god she gave a melodramatic shiver now you have met the breath of god in truth a lazy wind hamnet thyssen agreed gravely lazy liv started to scorch him but then very visibly checked herself wait you mean something by that tell me what what we call a lazy wind is one that blows straight through you because going around is too much bother ah she thought it over after a few heartbeats her smile came back she must have decided she liked it truth that is a truth has trasamund heard it i dont know hamnet answered if he has he hasnt heard it from me liv called to the jarl what is it trasamund rumbled do you know what a lazy wind is liv asked is that what happens when jesper fletti talks trasamund said with a sly grin jesper wasnt close enough to hear himself slandered if he had been if hed chosen to take offense count hamnet would have bet on trasamund in a fight liv made a face at her clan chief no she said when they got done scowling at each other she told him what a lazy wind was he weighed it then he nodded not bad no not bad at all the raumsdalians dont lack for witno one would ever say they did some other things maybe but never wit i wouldnt have come down to nidaros for help with the golden shrine if i thought different even on that relatively warm day steam surged from his lungs when he sighed turned out we didnt need help with the golden shrine after all not this trip hamnet thyssen said but chances are well go beyond the glacier again it may be there if it is eyvind torfinn knows more about it than any other man alive eyvind torfinn knows all sorts of things trasamund allowed then he spoiled it by asking so why doesnt he know his wife disgraces him whenever she pleases maybe he doesnt choose to look hamnet said that can happen especially when a man who isnt so young has a wife who isnt so old or maybe he doesnt care doesnt care do you say he has no ballocks at all then trasamund demanded count hamnet shook his head no i wondered about that myself before i got to know him on this journey but no he isnt a warriorhe doesnt pretend to be a warriorbut hes no craven either well then what do you say trasamunds frown was half anger half incomprehension that men and women and how they get alongor dont get alongare more complicated than youd guess hamnet answered i wont judge eyvind torfinn and i hope he wont judge me sometimes not judging someone is the biggest kindness you can do himor her it sounds very pretty the bizogot said tell me this thendo you not judge gudrid he was a boor a brute a barbarian he was a shrewd boor a clever brute a sly barbarian hamnet thyssens lips tightened his hands also tightened on the reins as if the leather straps were trasamunds neck or possibly gudrids he didnt want to answer the question and didnt see how he could help it i judge her he said after a pause he hoped wasnt too long yes i do but just because i do that doesnt mean someone else has to if eyvind torfinn wants to he may if he chooses not to who am i to tell him he should who are you trasamund opened his mouth someone who spread his wifes legs that was what he was about to say that or something like it but at the last moment instead of saying anything he jerked his horses head to one side and rode off he shouldnt have put you through that liv said quietly the only way i could make him stop was to kill him hamnet said with a shrug it isnt worth that ive killed one man over gudrid but i was married to her then now now its earl eyvinds worry if he feels like worrying about it how did it happen that you killed him about the way youd expect i found out he was bedding her no room for doubt no room to look awayid already done too much of that we fought a duel swords he would have killed me too youve seen that scar on my left arm up near the shoulder and the one that streaks my beard with white she nodded oh yes ingjald gave me those ingjald oddleif his name was but i killed him anyway i was proud of myself what a man i was gudrid acted like i had a cock the size of a bull mammoths for about a week she acted that way then she went out and found somebody else to sleep with she must have decided i wouldnt kill her you loved her liv said so i did hamnet thyssen shook his head like a musk ox the bizogots were slaughtering theyd herded it and tended it and warded it all its life why were they doing this to it now the beast couldnt understand even after all this time part of hamnet couldnt either so i did he repeated heavily and much good it did me eh maybe for a while she said he shook his head again i used to think so but i dont any more what good is love when the person you love is laughing behind your back youre only fooling yourself i was a fool im not the first i wont be the last god knows he rode on xviii as liv went deeper into the raumsdalian empire as the travelers made their way over to the great north road and went down it she saw plenty of towns larger and finer than naestved each seemed grander than the one just farther north had been each time she would ask and is nidaros like this and each time hamnet thyssen would smile and say no not really wait till you see the capital then youll understand but when at last they came to the city on the longvanished shore of longoutflooded hevring lake liv could see very little and neither could any of the rest of the weary travelers the blizzard roaring down from the north would not have been despised in the bizogot countrywould not have been despised in the land of the three tusk clan the breath of god could reach all the way down to nidaros and beyond it didnt always but it could hamnet got a glimpse of nidaros great gray frowning walls through swirling snow but only a glimpse of the towers and spires that showed above the walls in good weather he could see nothing at all as they neared the city liv said the wall is very tall isnt it a little later she added the gate seems very strong it is hamnet said she might as well have been examining a mammoth by closing her eyes and feeling first its trunk then a tusk then a leg and finally its tail she would know something about mammoths after she did that but probably not as much as she thought the guards had as much trouble spying the travelers as count hamnet and liv did seeing the citymaybe more for the guards had to peer straight into the storm the travelers were almost on them before they cried halt who comes i am earl eyvind torfinn eyvind said with me ride count hamnet thyssen jarl trasamund of the three tusk clan and the rest of our comrades we have come to report success to his majesty we have gone beyond the glacier and we are here to tell the tale well theyre here to tell a tale anyhow one of the guards said to another not bothering to keep his voice down you really think theres anything beyond the glacier how could there be the other guard returned you keep on going north its just glacier forever only stands to reason audun gilli muttered to himself his hands twisted in a few quick passes one of the soldiers spearheads grew a face that was a nasty caricature of the man holding it dyou suppose there are really such things as guards it asked in a shrill squeaky voice how could there be the other guards spearhead answered it too now looked like its owner its owner as seen by somebody with a wicked sense of humor we fly through the air all by ourselves birds do so we must only stands to reason it crossed its eyes and stuck out an iron tongue both guards goggled so did their sergeant hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki looked at each other told you so ulric mouthed hamnet nodded remembering when audun gilli worked that same spell on their winecups i think you had better pass on in the sergeant said they can deal with you at the palace by god his spearhead blew him a wet slobbery kiss he looked as if he wanted to wring its wooden neck the other guards spearheads made more sarcastic gibes maybe youd better let them quiet down hamnet thyssen murmured as the travelers rode into the city they will as soon as i get far enough away audun gilli answered that spell takes work to keep up and im not going to bother it is a good magic a funny magic liv said in her new and halting raumsdalian you teach me make people laugh when i go north again not if i go north again hamnet noted when she sounded very sure of what she wanted to do and he couldnt suppress a stab of jealousy when audun walked her through the spell step by step her face was bright and shiny full of excitement she and audun shared something she never could with him he scowled and muttered and clasped the reins tightly he hadnt left himself open to a womans wounding since gudrid left him liv wasnt hurting him on purpose which didnt mean she wasnt hurting him i thank you she told audun gilli when he finished it is clever i can do it i am sure i can do it not hard audun said not good for much but fun fun is good liv looked around seemed to come back to herself and nodded to count hamnet i begin to see what you mean this city is very large look at all the big buildings and at all the people in the streets and not just people all the beasts too a string of loaded mules was coming up toward the north gate the plump merchant leading it had some pungent things to say about the travelers who blocked his path then the lead mule screwed up his face and said oh sure you think theyre as bad as you are dont you fat chance it spoke clearly distinctly loudly the merchants jaw hit his chest with what should have been an audible clank the travelers squeezed past the column of loaded mules the animal in the lead went right on telling the merchant what it thought of him he didnt stand there gaping long when anyoneanythinginsulted him he shot back hard telling off a mule he didnt mind hed likely done it countless times when the beast couldnt say anything youve got more demon in you than i thought hamnet told audun gilli who me the wizard said modestly what makes you think that had anything to do with me ill tell you whatif liv tried it the mule would have had a bizogot accent i was going to do it liv said audun did it first well youve got more demon in you than i thought too hamnet said liv stuck out her tongue at him they both laughed his jealousy dissolving behind them the merchant called the mule something really unlikely the mule called the merchant something even worse chances were they were both right before long the mule would lose the power of speech as audun gilli moved too far away to sustain the spell the merchant was guaranteed the last word and all the words after that but count hamnet would have bet the man would never trust the mule not to tell him off again one day they moved deeper into nidaros streets zigzagging to blunt the breath of god the farther they went the wider livs eyes got there really is quite a lot of it isnt there she said how do you feed so many people me i dont hamnet answered youve seen the way i cook these folk would sooner starve than eat that she sent him a severe look and you said i had a demon in me all right then a lot of food comes up from the south we have markets we have storehouses meat mostly keeps fresh through the winter though thats shorter than it is up in the bizogot country grain will last a long time if you store it where mice and rats cant get at it and it cant go moldy how long is a long time i dont know exactly years anyhow years she echoed you are luckier than we are these are the riches that let you build the things we cant arent they i suppose so hamnet said we have more left over at the end of a year than you dounless the year is very bad i mean theres something else about having extra food ulric skakki put in we dont all have to hunt or gather all the time some of us can make the things bizogots dont have yes and some of us can try to think up new things things even we dont have things it would be nice if we did have new things liv frowned like what when you have all this what more could you want if i knew id think up new things myself ulric said old men say that when their grandfathers were boys no one made lamps with mirrors behind them to shed more light ive heard that more than once hamnet thyssen said its a small thing but its the kind of thing i mean every craft probably has secrets someone thought of not so long ago wizards make new spells all the time audun gilli would know more about that than i do therehed said it thank you your grace thats what i was talking about sure enough ulric skakki said we do come up with new spells now and then liv said the rest of the way we live that hasnt changed much not so far as anyone can remember ah but the three tusk clan lives hard by the glacier ulric said the bizogot clans farther south trade with the empire he turned to hamnet thyssen remember those ugly wool caps the musk ox bizogots wore im not likely to forget them hamnet said with a shudder to liv he went on youre lucky we came back farther west so you didnt have to see those but some of the bizogots take things we make and use them in ways wed never think of and the leaping lynxes up by sudertorp lakethe shorebirds they take there let them live in a town half the time theyre having to figure out how to do that when most of them have never seen a real town i see liv nodded every folk has clever people and fools in it but in the empire your clever people have more room to be clever than they do up on the plains yes i think thats likely so count hamnet said maybe or rather sometimes ulric skakki said just remember most people in the empire live on farms not in towns theyre born on a farm they grow up on a farm they get oldif they get oldon a farm and they die on a farm the clever ones might make better farmers than their stupid neighbors but thats about it farmers dont change the way they do things any faster than bizogots do sometimes they dont change any faster than their beasts you sound like you know what youre talking about hamnet remarked ulric was always chary of talking about his own past was he doing it now without naming names his foxy features were perfectly opaque as he smiled at hamnet well i try to do that harder to be taken for a fool when you do eh eryes hamnet had to drop it ulric left nothing on which to get a conversational grip the street zigzagged again jesper fletti who was riding ahead of hamnet and liv and ulric let out a war whoop no bizogot in the world would have been ashamed to claim the palace he shouted the palace he might have spotted water in the southwestern desert in an instant all the guardsmen whod gone north with gudrid were shouting the same thing the palace the palacetheyd come home at last and probably all of them had wondered if they ever would come to that hamnet thyssen had wondered if he would come back to nidaros too even if he was still a long way from his castle in the southeast at the forests edge a moment later very much to his surprise he found himself shouting too sigvat ii didnt stint he let the travelers use the imperial bathhouse that was luxury by anyones standards soft robes waited when the newcomers emerged the gown the emperors maidservants presented to liv told count hamnet what a fine figure she really had seeing her clean and dressed so was a far cry from the grubby woman in bizogotstyle furs and leathers those clothes the same for women as for men hardly showed which sex she belonged to the winecolored gown left no room for doubt it also flustered her how do your women stand outfits like this she asked hamnet its drafty the gown did reveal more of her than hed seen except when they were making love it shows the world how beautiful you are he said liv blushed now that she was clean he could watch the flush rise from her throat all the way to her crown its none of the worlds business she said which alone would have proved her no raumsdalian well i like the way you look hamnet said thats different you already know more than this but liv waved her bare arms i feel like im naked in front of everyone and it is drafty even though more fires burn in this palace than in all the tents of the three tusk clan put together which bothers you more the cold or everyone looking at you he asked everyone looking at me liv said at once what will people think the women will think i wish i looked that good hamnet thyssen answered and the men the men will think i wish she were on my arm not that graybearded counts liv flushed again your beard isnt gray she said only streaked a matter of time hamnet didnt worry about his own looks they were what they were and he couldnt do much about them if things really bother you he went on ask the servingwomen for a fur stole that will warm you up and cover you up i think it would be a shame but do what you like youre a man liv said more or less tolerantly of course you like to look at women pretty ones yes there is a whatdoyoucallit at sunset tonight liv said could i really come to it dressed like this a reception gudrid will or in something that shows even more of her hamnet answered so will plenty of other noblewomen and noblemens mistresses and theyll all say who is that fair stranger youre making that up but livs back stiffened hamnet smiled to himself she liked the idea of outdoing gudrid and she thought she could too he judged she was rightshe was a finelooking woman with about a twelve years head start if they were born on the same day count hamnet wasnt so sure but while the calendar might not be fair it was part of life liv did wear the gown to the reception she wore it with a stern jutjawed determination that warned people not to dare to look at her twice because of that some didnt look at her even once others of course couldnt get enough hamnet thyssen proved right about that and about gudrid her gown revealed and emphasized instead of concealing she had a lot to show and showed it to best advantage when she strode into the reception hall with eyvind torfinn the men already there gave her a couple of heartbeats of respectful admiration then most of them had to turn to the women they were with and pretend theyd done no such thing there at least count hamnet had no problem with liv she knew he was contentmore than contentwith her and not ogling the woman to whom hed once been married all she said was well you knew what you were talking about a bit later she added if she tried to wear that up in the bizogot country shed freeze no doubt hamnet hid a smile but youre not in the bizogot country anymore yes id noticed that liv said it has its advantages he told her come drink some wine shed put up with beer and ale on the way south from the frontier they were different from the smetyn she was used to but not necessarily better wine even in nidaros was an expensive imported luxury one thing being emperor meant though was not worrying about expense the tapman dipped her up a cup of wine red as blood and another for hamnet thyssen livs eyes widened as her nose caught the bouquet it even smells sweet she said and hamnet nodded she raised the silver cup to her lips oh she whispered hamnet took a pull at his own cup he nodded again nothing else was like wine not even mead some of the southern bizogots who lived in country where bees could survive the year around knew of mead livs clan though wouldnt be able to brew it hamnet wondered if they ever got any in trade he hadnt seen or heard of any while he was with the three tusk bizogots liv emptied the cup as fast as she could and held it out to the tapman face impassive he filled it again she made a good start on the refill then said with this wonderful stuff to drink why dont raumsdalians stay drunk all the time some of us do hamnet thought of audun gilli he looked around for the wizard as often happened his eye slid past audun and had to come back audun was drinking or holding a silver cup anyhow he didnt seem drunkbut then the night was still young he was talking with a woman who wasnt wearing a great deal more than gudrid maybe she would give him an incentive to stay somewhere within shouting distance of sober ulric skakki materialized at hamnets elbow so it seemed anyhow one heartbeat he was nowhere near the next there he stood a winecup in hand a slightly mocking smile on his face not a bad bash he said no not bad at all hamnet agreed im getting used to beef and mutton and pork again after so long eating musk ox and and worse ulric finished for him maybe he was thinking of the direwolf liver hed downed on the frozen plains hamnet thyssen had no trouble calling it back to mind ulric went on how much do you suppose the rulers would enjoy a spread like this oh maybe a little count hamnet answered yes maybe i think they might too as hamnet had before ulric skakki looked around but he wasnt seeking audun gillihe wanted sigvat ii i wish his majesty would come in he said when he didnt see him he hasnt wanted to hear about the rulers has he not as much as i hoped he would hamnet thyssen said as soon as he found out we didnt find the golden shrine and we werent bringing home any treasure he stopped being interested i think this reception is a consolation prize i was thinking the same thing ulric said pretty soon hell throw us out of the palaceeither that or hell start charging us rent hamnet shrugged if he does ill go back to my castle thats all i can give you a room and a bed if you like liv set a hand on his arm but what about the rulers you said it yourself if they come through the gap they arent just the bizogots fight theyre the empires fight too i know hamnet said but if they turn into the empires fight it wont matter if i stay here or go back to the castle ill have to fight them either way we may not be so ready if his majesty doesnt care to listen to ulric and earl eyvind and audun and me but well have to meet them ready or not youre more likely to lose liv said i cant make the emperor see that i cant make the empire do anything about it either hamnet shrugged again what i can do ive done and im doing liv bit her lip but nodded she knew that was true musicians struck up a sprightly air they distracted the bizogot shaman she knew about drums and flutes she even knew about horns though the bizogots made theirs from the natural horns of musk oxen not out of brass but shed never seen viols and basses and lutes before coming down to nidaros the look of them and the sounds they made fascinated her a courtier in a gaudy satin jacket spoke to the musicians leader he in turn gestured to his comrades the strings suddenly fell silent horns and drums blared out a fanfare his majesty sigvat ii by gods grace emperor of raumsdalia the courtier bawled into the silence that followed sigvat wore ermine liv and trasamund seemed much less impressed with his robe than his own subjects were up on the frozen plains weasels wore their white coats far longer than they did inside the empire those splendid furs were commonplace to the bizogots even if they werent to raumsdalians hamnet thyssen and ulric skakki bowed low when sigvat strode into the reception hall so did the rest of the men there the women dropped curtsies livs was smoother than hamnet expected who taught you he whispered as she straightened the maidservants she answered also in a whisper this is another strange notion you people have to use people to serve other people among my folk we can all do everything for ourselves she drew herself up very straight indeed in her own way she had as much bizogot arrogance as trasamund did as you were everyone sigvat ii called with a wave for the rest of the evening let the thought be taken for the deed he made for the tapman who handed him a cup of golden wine from the far southwest shall we beard him ulric skakki asked do you think itll do any good count hamnet asked in return how can it hurt ulric said since hamnet couldnt answer that he approached the emperor with ulric sigvat was talking and laughing with a tall blackhaired woman whose gown displayed at least as much of her as gudrids he was married but who was going to tell the emperor he couldnt amuse himself where and as he pleased not the empress certainly she wasnt even at the reception sigvat ii saw hamnet and ulric coming up to them he seemed more interested in the blackhaired woman in one sense hamnet didnt blame him in another your majesty the nobleman said politely but firmly no one who knew him ever thought he wouldnt take the bull by the horns sigvats mouth tightened with illconcealed annoyance he told the woman please excuse me of course your majesty she murmured in tones that said she would excuse him anything her curtsy almost made her fall out of that gown abstractly hamnet wondered why she didnt some sort of paste holding it to her he wouldnt have been surprised thyssen skakki sigvat acknowledged the two of them with their family namesthe least politeness he could give no he didnt like being interrupted he muttered to himself then went on well what can i do for you gentlemen that was bettera little anyhow your majesty we wish to thank you for this reception in our honor ulric skakki said he was smoother than hamnet and sly enough to remind the emperor that the reception was in the travelers honor my pleasure sigvat unbentagain a little when he spoke of pleasure though his eyes slid back to the woman waiting beside him he sipped from his winecup then went on you did something marvelous when you went beyond the glacier thank you again your majesty ulric said before he could go on hamnet interrupted him saying one of the things we did your majesty was find danger in the far north the rulers are not foes to be despised by the way sigvat ii said maybe so he didnt believe it for a minute he went on whatever else the socalled rulers are theyre very far away i dont think we need to worry about them for a long timeif we ever have to with respect your majesty that may be so but it may not count hamnet said both our raumsdalian wizard and the bizogot shaman who went north with us from the three tusk clan believe they have new magic magic the likes of which no one on this side of the glacier has ever seen magic we may not be able to match the emperors eye found liv even in this hall full of lovely women she stood out while i admire the shamans uh opinions sigvat said she is not necessarily expert on what raumsdalian sorcerers know and neither she nor uh audun gilli is expert on what the barbarians beyond the glacier can really do dont bother me about this now that was what he meant all right hamnet thyssen didnt care stubbornly he plowed ahead we would do better your majesty to meet this new threat as far from our own borders as we can i decide what we would do better to uh do sigvat ii made a face that didnt come out the way he wanted it to but even if it didnt what he meant was only too clear if youd found the golden shrine now he cared more about what wasnt there or wasnt found to be there than about the real danger your majesty ulric skakki began i have spoken sigvat ii sounded most imperial indeed if this peopleif these rulersshow themselves or itself or whatever the right word may be then raumsdalia will deal with it or them till that time the empire has enough real troubles without borrowing imaginary ones good evening skakki that was dismissal harsh as a slap in the face expressionless ulric skakki bowed your majesty he said and stepped away when hamnet thyssen didnt join him in withdrawing sigvat raised an eyebrow your majesty you are making a mistake count hamnet said then he bowed and turned away without giving the emperor a chance to reply if sigvat were a different kind of ruler that could easily have cost him his head he was too angry to care but sigvat if he didnt want to look north also wasnt vindictive for the sake of being vindictive he just went back to the statuesque brunette in the revealing gown sorry to keep you waiting there he said its all right your majesty she replied her voice like a crystal bell it wasnt all right or even close to all right but hamnet thyssen couldnt do anything about it savagely he stalked over toward the tapman ulric skakki was right behind him i aim to get as drunk as audun gilli ever did hamnet warned good ulric said we can end up in the same gutter because i aim to get that drunk too maybe well keep each other warm hamnet thyssen wasnt usually a man who drank to oblivion hed done it a couple of times after gudrid left him but he hadnt seen that it helped him much he was in the same mess when he sobered up but with a headache and a sour stomach besides once in a while though the world seemed too idiotic to stand this was one of those times eyvind torfinn and gudrid had been talking for all the world like any married couple eyvind left her and came over to hamnet and ulric both of whom were getting their cups refilled by the impassive server who took care of the wine no luck eyvind asked not a bit of it your splendor not one bloody bit hamnet growled havent you tried explaining things for him of course i have earl eyvind answered whatever happened beyond the glacier doesnt seem real to him god may know whygod must know whybut i dont he sighed maybe we should have lied maybe we should have said we did find the golden shrine that would have kept his interest anyhow ulric skakki shook his head jesper fletti and the rest of sigvats hounds would have given us the lie he wasnt drunk yet but he didnt care what he said he had to be disgusted with the world he didnt usually let himself go like that i suppose youre right eyvind torfinn said with another sigh its most unfortunate itll be worse than unfortunate if we have to deal with the rulers here toward the end of next summer count hamnet said maybe the bizogots will hold them in check eyvind didnt sound as if he believed they could either hamnet gulped his wine as he drank he watched gudrid out of the corner of his eye he wished he could stop doing that but getting what he wished for even after falling in love with the woman from the north wasnt easy his former wife said something to liv across the room count hamnet couldnt tell what it was the bizogot shaman answered again hamnet couldnt tell how gudrid said something else this time liv just shook her head gudrid stuck her nose in the air hamnet thyssen had seen that gesture more times than he could count whatever gudrid heard she didnt like it maybe liv was rash enough to have said something nice about him or maybe she said something rude about nidaros whatever it was it roused gudrid s ire or at least her contempt if shed walked away with her nose held high everything would have been fine but she decided she had to do more than that so as she turned to go she stepped on livs foot it might have been an accident it might have beenbut it wasnt his own anger inflamed by the strong wine hed poured down hamnet thyssen started over toward them he hadnt gone more than a couple of strides before he found not for the first time that his present beloved could take care of herself livs lips moved hamnet could see that gudrid didnt turn back so the bizogot womans words werent intended for her earwhich didnt mean they werent intended for her gudrid made a fundamental mistake she forgot the lesson shed had to learn far to the northgetting on the bad side of a wizard or shaman was a long way from smart one heartbeat gudrids minimal gown held together as well as overstrained fabric could reasonably be expected to do the next things fell apart literally and spectacularly they had no obvious reason for falling apart it might have been an accident it might have beenbut it wasnt gudrid looked down at herself first in surprise and then in horror the involuntary squawk she let out swung every eye in the reception hall toward her that was just what she didnt want there was more of her to cover up than she had hands to cover it she started to pick up what was left of the gown then seemed to realize she couldnt put it back together again she took a step toward a table full of trays of appetizers but must have decided the trays weighed down the tablecloth too much for her to grab it with another squawk she kicked out of the remnants of what shed worn and fled the reception hall oh dear eyvind torfinn hurried after her well well theres a dressmaker who wont live to grow old ulric skakki predicted but ill bet half the men here want to know who he is so they can get him to make gowns for their lady friends i wouldnt be surprised count hamnet answered but didnt think it was the dressmakers fault when he walked over to liv he carefully detoured around the bits of fabric still on the floor he wagged a finger at her that was naughty of you too bad she said did you see what happened i saw yes i couldnt hear what the two of you said but i know she stepped on you on purpose if she did that in the three tusk country i would have killed her liv said but i know you raumsdalians are soft when it comes to such things so i thought id embarrass her instead you did hamnet said gudrid might have arranged for her own wardrobe to fail but she would have gloried in her nakedness if she did to get surprised that was embarrassing shes spent a lot of time tormenting you so she thinks she can torment me too because i make you happy liv said she wont get away with that no matter what she thinks i can make her more unhappy than she makes me her eyes flamed chances are shes got the message now hamnet said shed better liv glanced over toward sigvat ii who was happily chatting with the wellmade brunette did the emperor get the message about the rulers no curse it hamnet shook his head he says hell worry about them when they bother the empire if they ever do till then he doesnt care well why should he he has more important things to worry about the bizogot womans voice was tart sigvat s companion laughed at something he said if the emperor made a joke of course it was funny i dont know what to do about it i dont think i can do anything about itexcept bang my head against a stone wall i mean hamnet thyssen said ive done that before by god ive made a career out of it but this time i can see it wont get me anywhere so what will you do then liv asked well i told you i was thinking about going back to my castle and waiting for the sky to fall hamnet answered sooner or later it will we both know that and i was hoping youd come with me he had to work to say that but he got it out now to see what happened next i like being with you you know that i like it better than i ever thought i could like being with anyone liv said and the empire has more more things in it than i thought there were there could be in the whole world but but hamnet broke in harshly as soon as liv started saying nice things he knew trouble lay ahead but liv said again the sky will fall here sooner or later yes for the three tusk clan the sky will fall sooner we roam nearest the gap the rulers will strike us first by the nature of things they have to the three tusk clan they are my folk i will do what i can to help them i have to do that hamnetdont you see he started to ask if anything he could do or say would make her change her mind he started to but he didnt he could see it was hopeless not without admiration he said youre as stubborn as i am do you know that she nodded again that was one of the things that drew me to you i wondered if we would bang heads the way muskox bulls do in rutting season but we never did did we not till now you will go north hamnet asked i will i have to liv said he thought about his castle about the estate surrounding it about the gamefilled woods to the east he thought about how many raumsdalians starting with his bailiff could care for the castle and estate as well as he could he thought about the gap and the building storm beyond it would you put up with a halfbaked bizogot if i came north with you he asked liv stared at him as if she didnt believe her ears then she threw herself into his arms naked gudrid might have made a bigger spectacle at the reception but not by much well hamnet thought dizzily as the embrace went on and on at least i know why im doing this xix hamnet thyssen did have a hangover from the drinking hed done at the reception the night before maybe his own headache and touchy stomach made him think ulric skakki seemed especially jaundicedlooking the morning after or maybe ulric was as astonished and dismayed as he seemed to be youre really going back to the barbarians he yelped in what certainly sounded like pained disbelief thats right count hamnet took a cautious sip from a mug of wine the hair of the dire wolf that bit him might ease his pangs he sent the adventurer a defiant stare what about it you mean besides your being out of your bloody mind ulric was also nursing a mug he was eating a sticky roll with candied fruit too hamnet wasnt ready for food yet ulric skakki went on youre the last man on earth i would have looked for to think with his cock by god im not hamnet said loud enough to make his own head throb more quietly he continued sigvat s not going to do anything about the rulers you know that as well as i do he rubbed our noses in it last night so what does that leave me either i go home and wait for the world to go to the demons or i try to do something about it i thought about sitting on my hands but i just cant an idealist ulric skakki asked sardonically hamnet thyssens nod was as defiant as his stare ulric laughed in his face and said sitting on your hands eh how idealistic would you be if the bizogot girl werent sitting on your watch your mouth skakki hamnet thyssen folded his right hand into a fist its early for a brawl but you can have one if you want he wondered if he was badtempered because of his headache or because ulrics gibe held more truth than he wanted to admit even to himself the adventurer shook his head no not me im a peaceable chap he said count hamnet snorted ulric skakki went on seriously though would you think of doing something like this if you werent in love with liv i hope so hamnet answered its the right thing to door will you tell me thats not so if ulric tried hamnet intended to walk away but ulric didnt not straight out he was practical instead practical and devious its only the right thing to do if you think the bizogots can beat the rulers otherwise seems to me youd do better waiting for trouble here besides do you want trasamund for your overlord i mean he rolled his eyes but count hamnet refused to back down better trasamund than sigvat he said trasamund doesnt pull his head into his shell and sleep through the winter at the bottom of a pond the way the emperor does ulric skakki looked alarmed not because he hadnt told the truth but because hed told it too loud keep your voice down or you wont have the chance to go north why not count hamnet said his majesty should be as glad to get rid of me as i am to go and thats saying a lot he got only a shrug from ulric as if to say on your head be it the foxyfaced man asked and how do you think trasamund will like having you for a subject i havent talked with him yet hamnet answered with a shrug he put up with me all the way through the gap and past it he ought to be able to stand me from here on out its not as if im likely to try to take the jarls job away from him if you could get the bizogots to listen to you youd do it better ulric skakki held up a hand i know i know nobody can get the bizogots to listen to him thats one more reason what youre doing is madness count hamnet looked at himlooked through him really i have two questions for you are the rulers the biggest trouble we have or is something else he folded his arms across his chest and waited ulric let out a snort of his own but he answered well the rulers are i dont think theres any way around that all right very good in fact hamnet thyssen clapped his hands in mocking applause ulric looked more exasperated than ever ignoring his sour expression hamnet went on if the rulers are the worst trouble we have would you rather do something about them or do nothing about them ulric skakki opened his mouth closed it then opened it again but still didnt speak for some little while at last he managed thats not fair fine have it your way but why shouldnt i have it my way too hamnet said because you wont do what you think you will ulric suggested fine count hamnet repeated but ill do something i want to do something i need to do something if you want to do nothing thats your business and youll be laying your pretty little bizogotexcept shes not so little is shein the meantime ulric jeered hamnet thyssen swung on him the next thing hamnet knew he was flying through the air upside down he hit the stone floor on his back hard ulric skakki wasnt even breathing hard you all right he asked you rushed me a little there count hamnet needed several heartbeats to take stock of himself his right wrist was sore so was the back of his head which had also thumped the floor i think so he said slowly as he climbed to his feet what did you do there can you teach it to me and spoil my air of mystery ulric said archly before either of them could say anything more a servant stuck his head into the room what happened the man asked it sounded like the castle was falling down oh i dropped my winecup ulrics voice was bland as butter without salt it was empty so i didnt even make a mess your winecup the servant thought he was lying or crazy or both the man was right too but ulric wouldnt let him prove it the adventurer just nodded and smiled the servant looked at hamnet thyssen then quickly looked away hamnets expression was probably terrifying thwarted the man withdrew ulric skakki winked where were we o winecup of mine oh shut up hamnet muttered he gathered himself standing on his dignity wasnt easy not when hed just been flipped and thrown will you teach me that trick come at me again and youll learn more about it than you ever wanted to know ulric skakki answered keep my woman out of your mouth then hamnet set a hand on his swordhilt and dont even start to make the joke thats in your filthy mind you cant prove it ulric said he didnt make the joke so hamnet didnt have to try eyvind torfinn was even more surprised and even more dismayed to learn count hamnet intended to go north with trasamund and liv than ulric skakki had been what gudrid thought hamnet didnt inquire no matter what she thought eyvind torfinn arranged a gathering of his own to see hamnet and liv and trasamund off to the bizogot country that he was able to arrange it left hamnet impressed earl eyvind was more his own man than gudrids former husband had imagined before setting off for the north with him are you sure we should come here liv asked as she and count hamnet rode up to eyvinds large rambling home will that woman poison the food or will hired murderers greet us when we go in i doubt it hamnet answered she hasnt tried to murder methat i know ofsince she left me and i expect shell put up with you she knows youre dangerous and she knows me well enough to fear my revenge ah liv nodded that she understood like all entrances in nidaros earl eyvinds faced south the bulk of the large home shielded hamnet thyssen and liv from the breath of god even so the knocker had frozen to the door hamnet had to tug on it to free it eyvind torfinn opened the door himselfno hired bravos your grace he said to hamnet and then to liv my lady he remained polite to her maybe gudrid hadnt told him everything that happened at the reception just as well if she hasnt hamnet thought your splendor he and liv said together they smiled at each other the way people will when they do that come in come in eyvind torfinn said you are both welcome here in spite of your foolishness your grace i thank you hamnet thyssen answered i dont look at it as foolishness you know yes i do the older man told him it makes you the only one in nidaros who doesnt liv squeezed count hamnets hand no your splendor it doesnt she said firmly in her new slow precise raumsdalian i stand corrected my lady earl eyvind bowed to her he bowed more readily than he would have before setting out for the gap and the lands beyond the glacier hed lost most of the comfortable paunch hed carried then hamnet guessed he would get it back soon enough but he hadnt yet as he straightened he went on i should have said the only raumsdalian in nidaros who doesnt oh there must be some sot in a gutter somewhere who hasnt heard the news hamnet said with a wry smile you make light of it but you shouldnt eyvinds smile was just as sour well come along come along we will celebrate what you have done and hope you may yet do more in days to come if you return to your senses im not dead yet i dont plan on dying any time soon either hamnet thyssen said in some annoyance by god im doing what i think is right trasamund was already in eyvind torfinns reception hall drinking wine and gnawing on a leg cut from a roast goose his belly was thicker than it had been before he got down to the empire he enjoyed the good things of life when he could get them he sent hamnet thyssen something more than a wave and less than a salute you are a brave man he boomed to count hamnet to put yourself in my hands you must be im going north anyway the raumsdalian nobleman answered liv smiled trasamund laughed audun gilli watched in wideeyed fascination ulric skakkis face was unreadable he was better at keeping it that way than anyone else hamnet had ever seen jesper fletti plainly thought hamnet had lost his mindbut with a cup of wine in one hand and a mutton rib in the other he didnt seem to care much if he hadnt gone north he never would have been able to get an invitation to eyvind torfinns home as for gudrid she had on almost as little as she did at sigvat us illfated fete was she reminding hamnet of what he would be missingnot just her but also a city such as nidaros where there were dressmakers who turned out gowns like the one she was almost wearing liv made a small noise deep down in her throat a lioness spotting prey might come out with a sound like that if gudrid had heard it she would have been wise to take herself elsewhere as fast as she could go but she didnt she swayed toward hamnet thyssen a smile on her reddened lips she leaned forward and stood on tiptoe to kiss him on the cheek liv made that noise again louder this time gudrid ignored it saying so youre going away are you well i hope you enjoy the bugs and the smells had some of her paint come off so he was branded to the eye as well as to the touch he would wipe his face soon for now he said i can put up with them and ill be where i need to be andhe put his arm around livthe company is better gudrid didnt lose her smile her face went ugly for a moment all the same who would have thought someone like you would run away for love she said someone boring like you but hung in the air hamnet shrugged im not running away im running toward you met the rulers you know what theyre like ah the brave hero sure he can charge off and save the day where nobody else has a chance you sound like someone out of the romances dear eyvind can quote for hours at a stretch gudrid jeered at her present husband too im not sure of anything of the kind hamnet answered steadily id rather not pretend theres no trouble thats all really gudrid tilted her head to one side since when you ought to knowyou taught me the lesson he kept his voice even will you excuse me please id like to get something to eat and something to drink so would i please liv said gudrid had to notice her then how could i say no to you who knows what would happen if i did liv shrugged how do i know there is no no poison in the food and drink she had to search for the word she wanted but she found it hamnet thyssen watched gudrid closely if livs sarcastic comment turned out to be not a sarcastic comment but the truth he thought his former wifes face would betray her if only for a heartbeat but gudrid just shook her head i wouldnt poison you youre going back to your tents and youre taking hamnet with you thats a better revenge than poison ever could be instead of answering liv walked away and got a cup of wine count hamnet lingered long enough to say were going off to fight the rulers and this is the thanks we get as if you care a fart about the rulers gudrid said youre going off to screw yourself sillysillierand to collect lice and drink sour smetyn and youre welcome to every bit of it too he growled down deep in his throat but then he turned away gudrid looked disappointed if hed hit her there in front of everybody he would have stirred up a terrific scandal was that worth getting slapped gudrid would probably think so he gulped the wine a polite servant gave him and then out of the blue liv said shes jealous of you she used her own language so most of the people who might overhear her wouldnt understand who gudrid hamnet thyssen didnt laugh in her face which was a small proof of how much he cared for her but he did say you must be joking no no indeed liv said seriously youre doing something important and youve foundi hope youve foundsomeone who matters to you whatever else she is she is no fool she has to know all thisher wave took in eyvind torfinns mansionis empty we dont have so much up in the bizogot country scorn edged her voice we dont have so much no but we know what we need to do count hamnet glanced over toward gudrid again she was laughing and flirting with jesper fletti hamnet wondered if liv was right he didnt want to argue with her but he couldnt believe it because the bizogot shaman had such a strong sense of purpose she thought everyone else did too she couldnt grasp that gudrid really was as shallow as she seemed well why should she hamnet thought i had to get my nose rubbed in it before i understood having fun ulric skakki had that gift for appearing at someones elbowand for disappearing just as readily me no but i knew i wouldnt count hamnet answered why did you come then ulric asked well i didnt want to disappoint eyvind torfinn hes doing something nice to see me off and hes a pretty good fellow even if two words too late hamnet broke off ulric skakki knew what he was about to say and said it for him even if hes married to gudrid thats right even then hamnet thyssens shoulders went up and down and if i can say that about him then chances are hes really better than a pretty good fellow if you know what i mean hes not as smart as he thinks he is ulric could always find something unkind to say about someoneand something that was true at the same time too well who is count hamnet said this time ulric was the one who shrugged hamnet pointed at him are you i like to think i am ulric skakki laughed he could laugh at himself which made him much easier to get along with than he would have been otherwise of course maybe im not so smart myself he bowed to hamnet yes i do see your point your grace im so glad hamnet said dryly and ulric laughed again hamnet asked are you smart enough to come north with me im smart enough not to ulric answered hamnet thyssen raised an eyebrow unabashed the adventurer went on im not a hero i never wanted to be a hero ive done my share of interesting things but i dont have to do this one and i dont intend to if you think you can save raumsdalia up by the glacier be my guest i wish you good fortune and thats the truth i aim to enjoy what youre saving though i like wine better than smetyn and spiced mutton better than roast musk ox i confess to a weakness for real buildings and real beds and women who take baths if that makes me a lazy goodfornothing weakling well ill live with it he was about as far from being a weakling as any man hamnet thyssen knew that was part of the reason hamnet so badly wanted him to go back to the bizogot country i dont suppose i can do or say anything to make you change your mind not likely my dear ulric skakki said when have you ever known anybody to change somebody elses mind the only person who can change my mind is me by god he jabbed a thumb at his own chest someone hamnet thyssen barely knew came up to him then the man wore expensive clothes and had a big belly he carried himself with the confidence of somebody whod done well for a long time though hamnet couldnt remember what he did well in no doubt he was a friend of eyvind torfinns which said something unflattering about earl eyvinds taste in friends so youre going off to the glacier again are you by his accent the nearstranger was born and raised in nidaros by the amused contempt in his voice he thought too much of himself thats right hamnet answered people like this made him wish hed declined eyvinds invitation after all by god you must be daft the fellow said cheerfully youll freeze your stones off and for what for nothing thats what he sounded altogether sure he was rightaltogether sure he had to be right oh i think going up to the bizogot country may be worthwhile after all count hamnet said ha how could it possibly be eh tell me that eyvind torfinns rich acquaintance was convinced hamnet thyssen couldnt but hamnet could well for starters it takes me away from jackasses like you the other mans face flushed ominously here now what the demon is that supposed to mean i usually mean what i say hamnet answered you should try it one of these days it works wonders you cant talk to me that way do you know who i am the bigbellied man said ive been trying to remember your name but im afraid i cant hamnet thyssen shrugged if you push me a little more though i suppose i can always find out from your next of kin from my the prosperous fellow must have drunk a good deal because even that message took longer to penetrate than it should have you wouldnt he broke off again because hamnet plainly would the bigbellied man gaped discovering some things gold couldnt dissolve you are a barbarian he burst out count hamnet bowed at your service and if you keep wasting my time and fraying my temper i will be more at your service than you ever wanted i promise you that he shifted his feet as if getting ready to draw his sword although the prosperous man also wore a blade he seemed to have forgot about it that was wise or at least lucky whatever else he was he was no trained warrior and wouldnt have lasted long against someone who was madman he blurted and took himself elsewhere you still know how to win friends dont you there was ulric skakki again winning him as a friend is a dead loss by god hamnet answered and you want to spend your time with people like him why oh hes no prize there are plenty here in nidaros who arent dont get me wrong hamneti dont say anything different ulric paused to snag a cup of wine from a pretty maidservant passing by with a tray after sipping he went on but you cant tell me the bizogots are any better not at that level people are people no matter where you find em and a lot of them anywhere will be boastful blustering saps did his eyes travel to trasamund or instead of following ulrics did hamnet thyssens go to the jarl on their own trasamund s no sap hamnet said whether the bizogot was boastful and blustering was a different question one he didnt try to answer mm not all the time i suppose ulric skakki said generously but often enough to make him a pain in the posterior he knows the rulers are dangerous you know the rulers are dangerous does his majesty know the rulers are dangerous hamnet said he will by the time he has to do something about them i hope he will anyhow ulric said hamnet turned away from him enjoy yourself then thats what im here for nothing fazed ulric skakkior if anything did he didnt let on after the unfortunate feast hamnet took leaving for the frozen plains much more seriously he bought everything he could think of that might be usefula second sword knives iron arrow points wooden arrow shafts lighter and straighter than the bone arrows the bizogots commonly used a spare helmet poppy juice horse trappings a pillow soap insect powder which probably wouldnt work but you never could tell and several sets of flint and steel for making sparks and starting fires a man could find flint up in the bizogot country but not much steel went up there you get no clothes you get no feathers for fletching or bowstrings liv said accompanying him as he spent his silver i dont see any need for those you bizogots make better coldweather gear than anything i could buy here count hamnet answered sinew will do for bowstrings and i can get feathers and fletching tools up on the plain what i want here are things i cant get there ah liv nodded this is wise well i hope so hamnet sometimes fancied his own cleverness usually it turned and bit him when he did on some of these things you could also turn a fine profit the bizogot woman said im not going up there to be a trader hamnet told her if the rulers dont come maybe ill trade what i dont need but thats not why im bringing it if the rulers dont come ill look like an idiot if they dont come ill feel like an idiot too you should have things to trade it will help you live among us liv said seriously you ride well and you fight well but you have no practice herding musk oxen or mammoths sooner or later you need to learn yes i suppose so hamnet said with no great enthusiasm she was right he couldnt lie around waiting for a war that might not come and eating what the rest of the clan gave him he wouldnt be a guest nowhe would be one of them and the bizogots didnt have enough to spare for idle hands children worked at whatever they were big enough to try men and women who got too old to worknot that many lived so long up there went out on the plains to die a cold but mostly merciful death it wasnt cruelty it was a harshness the land imposed not many raumsdalians would be able to do it liv said you thoughonce you learn i think youll do as well as if your hair werent dark thank you so much he said many raumsdalians sneered at the bizogots because they were so fairthough not many raumsdalian men from all hamnet thyssen had seen sneered at bizogot women amusing to find the mammothherders looking down their noses at their southern neighbors most of the time liv recognized his irony for what it was she took him seriously here i mean it she assured him you can do the work ulric skakki i think could do the workbut he would rather find ways to get out of it instead the rest of the raumsdalians who traveled with us the ones ive seen here she shook her head each cat his own rat hamnet said up in the north everyone has to be able to do everything near enough you said that yourself here we pick one thing and get good at it that leaves a lot of us not so good at other things its the price we pay if the rulers come this far liv said if the rulers come this far theyll see that some of us make good soldiers too count hamnet said i hope so liv didnt sound convinced from what i saw of jesper fletti and the other raumsdalian soldiers who came north though her voice trailed away again no no no no hamnet thyssen shook his head dont judge our soldiers by them theyre imperial guards part of their job is to look pretty while they take care of sigvat they can fight some or theyd be useless but they have to be impressive while theyre doing it most soldiers dont bother with that nonsense i hope so liv repeated still seeming dubious look at it like this hamnet said never mind the rulers if all our soldiers were like the ones you saw whod stop the bizogots from overrunning the empire liv grunted thoughtfully the way a man would she squeezed his hand fair enough you have a point i always thought it was because the southern bizogots were too weak and puny to be worth much themselves but your soldiers have to be able to fight too do you think theyll be able to fight warriors who ride mammoths it was hamnets turn to grunt i dont know he admitted the bizogots will have to worry about that too at least we know mammoths liv said hamnet thyssen started going on in raumsdalian about two bizogots and two mammoths gossiping about the clan that lived next door to theirs for a little while liv didnt understand what he was doing when she did get it she was affronted at first then in spite of herself she started to giggle i didnt mean we know them like that she said in the voice of one of the mammothsa snooty onehamnet said well we dont say we know bizogots like that either he made an indignant gesture with his arm as if it were a trunk giggling still liv hit him it was a most successful shopping trip it was snowing when count hamnet and liv and trasamund set out from the imperial palace that seemed fitting to hamnet it also seemed fitting to trasamund who said now we go back to a land with proper weather by god if you say so your ferocity hamnet didnt feel like arguing with him one of the stablemen said good fortune go with you your grace why thank you tyrkir hamnet thyssen was surprised and touched i thought everybody here was glad to get rid of me oh no tyrkir shook his head you know how to take care of a horse and you always treat us like people when you come to the stables we arent justthings that can talk not to you not like some i could name another attendant hissed at him he left it there hamnet found himself wondering as he rode off was tyrkir talking about the emperor like that he couldnt very well ask but it made for an interesting question all the same nidaros is a fine place to visit nidaros is a wonderful place to visit in fact trasamund said as they rode out with a smile like a cats that has fallen into a pitcher of cream i wouldnt want to have to stay here though neither would i hamnet thyssen said plainly not or you wouldnt come with me the jarl said count hamnet shook his head ive always thought so too many people crowded together too many ambitious people crowded together whenever i could stay away from the place i would sometimes you cant help it though its not just the people crowded together its all the things crowded together too liv said the houses and the shops and everything in the shops her shiver had nothing to do with the weather its marvelous i suppose but id go mad if i stayed here much longer as if to prove her point they got stuck behind a wagon that had overturned on the icy road spilling sacks of beans or barley or something of the sort the driver tried to keep people from darting in and stealing the sacks but some would distract him while others did the taking we bizogots dont steal inside the clan trasamund said loftily why do these people do it liv asked maybe to sell what they grab more likely because theyre hungry and they need something to eat hamnet answered here some have too much and many have not enough that is not good liv said among the bizogots if someone goes hungry its because everyone in the clan goes hungry that way is better i think maybe so hamnet said things are more equal among youyoure right but youve seen we can do things you cant oh yes the shaman nodded we talked about the price you pay for being able to do them this is another part of that price wouldnt you say although hamnet thyssen hadnt thought of it like that he found himself nodding too yes id have to say it is lets turn around and take another road trasamund said otherwise well be here till they steal the wheels off that poor fools wagon and the tail off his horse i can get us to the north gate on side streets i think hamnet said well have to do some zigzagging but we would anyway a boulevard that ran straight north would have given the breath of god a running start raumsdalian winters were milderor at least less regularly frigidthan the ones the three tusk clan knew but people still had to do all they could to fight the cold hamnet would have embarrassed himself if hed got lost in the maze of lanes and alleys that sprouted from the main road he knew more than a little relief when he got back onto it with luck neither of the bizogots with him noticed if it was snowing here what was it like up by the glacier do i really want to know he wondered he shrugged ulric skakki had gone that way and gone by himself without the bizogots knowing what he can do i can do by god hamnet thyssen muttered under his breath he still wished ulric were coming along the adventurer was a good man to have beside you when you ran into troubleor when it ran into you he pointed theres the gate so it is trasamund nodded in satisfaction on the way home at last even getting out of nidaros getting into the countryside here will feel like an escape its not the plains but i wont feel closed in all the time either the way i do now closed in yes by god liv said when you leave the tents theres a whole big world around you and you can see it when you leave a house what do you see more walls she shuddered its like being tied up like being caged all what youre used to hamnet thyssen said i told you beforeout on your plains sometimes i feel as if theres too much nothing around me he mimed curling up into a little ball the gate guards asked their names when the sergeant heard them he said oh youre that lot yes you can go through by all weve heard its good riddance to the lot of you we love you too hamnet said mildly he had offended sigvat then well too bad and as a matter of fact it was too bad trasamund said something even more unflattering in the bizogot language luckily none of the guards understood him liv really did sigh with relief when they put the gray stone walls of nidaros behind them free she said and threw her arms wide her horse twitched its ears doubtless wondering why its rider was acting so strange hamnet thyssen wondered why two horsementoughlooking rogues he thought peering at them through the swirling snowsat waiting by the side of the great north road was sigvat angry enough to set bravos on him to make sure he didnt get to the bizogot country he wouldnt have thought so but when he got a little closer his jaw dropped ulric he said audun what the demon are you doing here xx ulric skakki tilted back his head so he could look down his long straight nose at hamnet youre more persuasive than you have any business being thyssen he said severely if you set your mind to it you could probably sell snow to the bizogots i dont need to sell it hamnet held out a mittened hand till a few flakes fell on it its right here and im glad to see you even if i didnt think id put any horse traders out of business he sketched a salute to the wizard im glad to see you too audunyoud best believe i am what made you decide to come audun gillis nondescript features lit up when anyone paid attention to him i thank you your grace what made me decide to come ulric here kidnapped me for a moment count hamnet believed him then ulric skakki laughed well its nice to know im innocent of something anyway we got to talking after eyvind torfinns gruesome bash and we decided wed do better going north than staying here after all yes curse you you were right thereive said it now how much more snow are you going to sell me you will remember that i am the jarl of the three tusk clan trasamund thumped his chest with his right fist and glowered in turn at ulric and audun yes your ferocity audun said he wasnt likely to raise that kind of trouble any which way ulric pointed toward hamnet thyssen why arent you thundering at him he already understands trasamund answered do you i dont want to be jarl i have trouble enough telling myself what to do ulric skakki answered youre welcome to the job as far as im concerned i did not think you wanted to lead my clan you are no witling you know they would not follow you trasamund gave ulric his fiercest stare but when you are among my clansfolk will you follow me that is what i must know ulric thought hard before saying unless i think youre wrong enough about something to make a real mess of it thats not good enough the bizogot said youd better take it ulric skakki advised its as much as youll get and a lot more than id give most people trasamund went right on looking fierce hamnet thyssen could have told him that was the wrong way to go about intimidating ulric luckily hamnet didnt need to tell him he figured it out for himself i would kill any bizogot who was so insolent to me he snarled well youre welcome to try ulric skakki said politely trasamund muttered into his thick curly beard then he booted his horse up the great north road so did liv so did count hamnet and audun gilli and so did ulric skakki and if he had a smile on his face he often had a smile on his face he wasnt openly mocking trasamundnot so the jarl could prove it anyhow for the first hour or so trasamund rode as if trying to shake off pursuers then he seemed to decided ulric really was on his side or would be if he let him he slowed down that had to relieve his horse the bizogot was a big beefy man and couldnt have been easy to carry liv pointed to little sparrowlike birds hopping around on the snowcovered ground off to the side of the road larkspurs she said so this is where they go during the winter i suppose so hamnet thought for a few heartbeats we did see them up in the bizogot country in summertime didnt we he hadnt paid much attention to the birds they were too wary to be easily caught and too small to be worth eating unless a large batch of them were baked in a pie or something of the sort we saw them beyond the glacier too liv said do those birds fly through the gap to come here do they fly over the glacier or do they winter in the lands we dont know the lands to the far southwest there was an interesting question i dont know hamnet admitted how would you go about finding out you might be able to enchant a bird in the summer and then use the spell to see where it went in wintertime liv answered of course something might eat it between the time you cast the spell and the time you tried to check it and you might not be able to tell anything if the larkspurs beyond the glacier do go to that other land god only knows how far away it is that was liable to be literally true no man on this side of the glacier knew that was certain maybe the rulers did and come to that maybe the larkspurs did you might be able to enchant a bird in the summer hamnet saidi never could he paused then added you enchanted me liv blushed and shook her head that was no magic not the way you mean it was the two of us well good hamnet had always believed that was so but hed believed things about gudrid that didnt turn out to be true could he stand it if he and liv went sour slowly he nodded he could stand their going sour that was the chance you took the risk you had to accept life wasnt perfect neither were people if liv lied to him though he would be a long time getting over that if he ever did he didnt think she would he hoped she wouldnt and right now what else could he do on he rode after trasamund toward the bizogot country toward war with the rulers away from nidaros away from the empire away from everything he held dear sometimes you had to break the patterns that had run your lifeand run it into the ground was he doing that here again he thought so he hoped so whether he was right or not sooner or later hed find out stopping at the first serai north of nidaros made him nervous he breathed a silentor maybe a not so silentsigh of relief when there was no sign of gudrid in the common room the only women in the place were barmaids and slatterns the men in there fell into two groups merchants on their way down to nidaros and merchants on their way up from nidaros they ate and drank together gossiping and doing their best to find out what lay ahead they all eyed the party with two bizogots in it with curiosity they hardly bothered to hide hamnet thyssen supposed he accounted for some of that curiosity too he might have been a great many things but few men would ever have accused him of buying and selling things for a living everything about him from his face to the very way he walked said he had no compromise in him he and his comrades squeezed their way onto the benches at a long table near the hearth merchants sat closer together to make room for them half a dozen men asked one of two questionswhere are you from and where are you boundat more or less the same time before answering trasamund shouted an order for a fat roast goose a passing barmaid waved to show she heard and mead trasamund added plenty of mead by god the woman waved again were out of nidaros heading for the lands of the three tusk clan and the gap ulric skakki said that couldnt have been better calculated to make everyone else blink and gape at this season of the year asked a grizzled merchant who found his tongue sooner than the rest what will you do there besides freeze i mean ulric looked not at trasamund but at hamnet thyssen why not hamnet thought the more who know the better if sigvat doesnt like it too bad for him some of you will have heard the gap has melted through he said its true theres land beyond the glacier there are folk beyond the glacier toothe rulers they call themselves theyre warlike and dangerous chances are theyll try to come down into the country we know we aim to try to stop them you by yourselves the graybearded trader laughed raucously audun gilli murmured to himself count hamnet thought his chant sounded familiar he was right too a moment later the merchants plate grew a face that looked like a twisted version of his own you wouldnt have the ballocks to come along thats certain sure it jeered he stared at it so did several of the men around him their laughs were even coarser than his had been he picked up his pewter mug and slammed it down on the plate which shattered like the cheap earthenware it wasor had been youll pay for that by god a barmaid said you cant go breaking crockery for the fun of it it called me a coward the trader exclaimed the barmaid rolled her eyes i didnt figure you for one who saw snakes and demons when he put down too much ale she said only shows im not as smart as i thought i was doesnt it she strutted away swiveling her hips in magnificent scorn another merchant turned to hamnet and said next thing youll tell me is that you went and found the golden shrine off beyond the glacier no he shook his head we looked but we didnt see any sign of it it may be there or it may not i cant tell you one way or the other id like to go back and look again ulric skakki added i didnt believe there was any such thing till i went beyond the glacier i didnt believe you could go beyond the glacier till i went and did it neither did i hamnet thyssen said nor i trasamund rumbled i didnt know what would happen when i rode up into the narrowest part of the gap the first time but i kept going and i found there was another side after all what about thewhat did you call themthe rulers that was it yet another trader asked yes the rulers count hamnet said what about them theyre dangerous thats what for one thing they ride mammoths to war they carry lancers and archers aboard the beasts for another theyre stronger wizards than any we have on this side of the glacier thats so audun gilli said quietly it is liv agreed in her deliberate newly acquired raumsdalian the other reason the rulers are dangerous is that theyre sure god or whatever they worship wants them to go out and rule all the other folk around them ulric skakki said they dont want to talk to other folk they just want to tell them what to do and they may be tough enough to get away with it too huh the trader said they havent bumped into raumsdalians before or bizogots trasamunds tone and the warning gleam in his eye challenged the merchant to argue with him the man didnt rise to the challenge or bizogots he said quickly trasamund subsided why isnt the emperor doing anything about these rulers somebody said you would have to ask his majesty about that but hamnet couldnt leave it there i wish he would have seemed more interested he added you talked to him the merchant said slowly i talked to him hamnets voice was hard as stone cold as the snowdrifts outside he waited to see if the merchant called him a liar and how whether the man went on breathing after that depended on such things before the trader could speak ulric skakki said this is the famous count hamnet thyssen if he says a thing is so you may rely on it youd better rely on it some of the men at the long table had plainly never heard of hamnet thyssen famous or not to others he was famous for the wrong thing hes the one whose wife one of them whispered to his neighbor not quite quietly enough the trader whod asked if hamnet had spoken to the emperor didnt challenge him part of him was relieved part disappointed sometimes fighting was simpler than talking what can we do about the uh rulers a merchant asked that meant more talking count hamnet sighed maybe it would help maybe it wouldnt spread the word he said the more people who know troubles coming the more who know what kind of trouble it is the better off well be he could hope that was true anyhow he paid the seraikeeper extra for a private room with liv do you think they believed you she asked as they got ready for bed or was it all another travelers tale to them some of them believe some of it anyhow hamnet smiled at his convoluted answer maybe spreading the news will do some good maybe some more people will ask sigvat questions he doesnt want to hear that may help too who knows who knows if anything we do means anything at all liv lay down on the bed the frame creaked under her weight ive got used to sleeping soft she said it wont be so easy to lie on a mat or wrapped in a hide on the ground when we get back to the bizogot country hamnet lay down beside her well then he said you can always lie on me instead her eyes glinted i can do that now she blew out the lamp and she did twice up the great north road in the same year twice up into the bizogot country count hamnet had stayed in his castle most of the time after gudrid left him he traveled because he had to not because he enjoyed it for its own sake he would get where he was going and he would try to do what needed doing ulric skakki now savored each new day each new sight he couldnt stand doing the same thing all the time everything interested himthe fading of the fields the approach of the forest that stretched north to the tree line trasamund and liv were the same way they were nomads from a nomad folk where ulric came by his wanderlust was harder to fathom audun gilli the wizard was always hard to fathom at least for hamnet he rode along never saying much sometimes he got drunk when the travelers stopped at a serai if he did it all the time hamnet would have tried to make him stop or sent him back to nidaros but he didnt some nights he stayed sober if he drank for amusement and not because he had to count hamnet didnt see that he had any business complaining serais grew fewer too theyd done the same thing the last time hamnet came north but he didnt notice it so much then in spring mosquitoes were the only things wrong with camping outdoors they could come inside too as he had reason to know if you didnt have a good notion of what you were doing during the winter though you could easily freeze to deathand the more easily the farther north you went hamnet thyssen wasnt bad at tending to himself in winter weather he freely admitted the bizogots and ulric skakki were better when they ran up tents no cold air got inside they built snow barriers north of the tents to blunt the force of the breath of god they made the most of fur blankets and small braziers audun gilli seemed much more lackadaisical count hamnet wondered if he should scold the wizard or worry about him liv shook her head when he raised the question he uses spells to keep himself snug she said i wouldnt do that it would make me tired and i have enough things making me tired already easier just to do things right the first time but if you have the spells you can use them if you choose all right hamnet said i wont bother him about it then i didnt want to wake up one morning and find we had an icicle instead of a wizard thats all he wont freeze liv assured him not unless someone overpowers all his wards and who would want to do anything like that the rulers hamnet said livs breath caught she hadnt looked for an answer to her question how could they reach him here inside the empire she asked how could they even know hes coming north again im no wizardi cant tell you that hamnet thyssen said but we saw they know more of magic than we do just because we cant imagine how they would do something doesnt mean they cant do it or am i wrong plainly liv wanted to tell him he was as plainly she couldnt her voice troubled she said maybe you should speak of this with him tomorrow i dont know if youre right or wrong either way though audun should think about it ill do that hamnet blew out the candle that lit their tent as darkness descended he added tomorrow he almost forgot about it the next day audun gilli didnt draw attention to himself he seemed to do everything he could not to draw attention to himself eventually hamnet did remember the wizard heard him out audun was seldom rude well theres a cheery notion he said when hamnet finished what can you do about it can you do anything the raumsdalian noble asked i dont know i dont know how much i have to worry about it either audun said maybe ill tighten up my wards just in case maybe your lady friend ought to do the same thing too hamnet grunted he hadnt thought about that but if the rulers could know audun was on the move they could know the same thing about liv ill tell her hamnet promised me liv said when he did why not who here besides audun knows as much about their magic as you do count hamnet said if they can reach this far doesnt that give them a reason to go after you do you want to take the chance that they cant he admired the way she thought it over and then shook her head she really did think things through she didnt start with her mind closed the way so many people did no i dont want to take that chance she said if they marked audun they might have noticed me too if they didnt notice you they were blind hamnet thyssen said that flustered liv much more than the idea of sorcerous attack from the rulers did you she wagged her hand at him it would have been an angry finger if she werent wearing mittens why do you say such things because theyre true she ignored him he smiled which only seemed to annoy her more he wasnt a great one for fancy speeches and praise of womens beauty but any praise at all seemed more than liv was used to they came to a serai not long before the sun went down there would be a few more in the towns in the north woods after that the travelers would have to arrange their own shelter or pay the price for failure a roaring fire and greasy roast mutton suited hamnet fine after a long day on the road he ate more mutton for breakfast and washed it down with beer mulled with a hot poker not fancy but it sticks to the ribs ulric skakki said and hamnet nodded the travelers were about to go out to the horses when a newcomer walked into the serai hamnet and ulric looked at each other had the stranger traveled through the frigid night to get here by the way he yawned and rubbed at his redtracked eyes he probably had do i see count hamnet thyssen here he asked hamnet got to his feet his hand rested on the hilt of his sword you see me he said why do you care i am an imperial courier the newcomer handed him a rolled parchment held closed by a ribbon and by the imperial seal stamped into golden wax this is an order recalling you to nidaros at once give it to me hamnet broke the seal and read the order it was exactly what the courier said it was he recognized sigvats signature the document was genuine nodding to the man he said all righti have it thank you you will accompany me back down to the capital then no the couriers jaw dropped but but he tried again you are ordered to return ordered by the emperor sigvat ii he added the name as if count hamnet might have forgot who ruled raumsdalia no hamnet said again hes welcome to exile me why not im leaving the empire anyhow and i am leaving im not going back to nidaros if he wants to confiscate my castle down in the southeast he can do that too im in no position to stop him god knows i hope hell treat my retainers well i havent seen them since last spring and they have nothing to do with this but youre disobeying a direct imperial command the courier didnt seem to think such a thing was possible or even imaginable i am all right count hamnet nodded as if to encourage him you catch on fast you cant do that the young raumsdalian sounded absolutely certain watch me hamnet thyssen said calmly being clear in his own mind about what he aimed to do brought a wonderful sense of freedom he was his own man not sigvat s man or even the empires man he would do what he chose and hard luck to anyone who didnt like it what am i supposed to do the courier bleated tell the emperor you delivered his order tell him i told you no here wait he borrowed a quill and ink from the seraikeeper who watched the drama with wide eyes i have read this order i decline to obey it do not blame the messengerit is not his fault hamnet wrote and signed his name in a fine round hand he gave the parchment back to the courier there you go it shouldnt have anything to do with you this is between his majesty and me this wont help the courier predicted voice full of gloom would you like the wizard here and me to witness whatever count hamnet wrote ulric skakki asked even more gloomily the courier shook his head i could have god witness it and it wouldnt do me any good if sigvat was in one of those moods the man might be right tell me something hamnet said did earl eyvind torfinns wife have anything to do with getting this order sent the courier looked blank hamnet added her name is gudrid oh her i know who you mean the one whos like that with the emperor the courier twisted two fingers together but then he shrugged i dont know anything about it a clerk gave me the order and told me what was in it in case it got wet or something thats all the one whos like that with the emperor hamnet thyssen wasnt much surprised hed already had a good idea that that was so all right then youd better head south then and let sigvat know hamnet had a second thought unless youd sooner come north with me no thanks im not a crazy man im not a rebel shaking his head the courier walked out of the common room ulric skakki patted count hamnet on the back you crazy man you he said affectionately you rebel do not mock this man trasamund growled he has done what a free man should he has done what a bizogot would hes shown he is worthy to come north worthy to take his place in the three tusk clan however you please your ferocity now ulric seemed as indifferent as a dead man he could assume any tone or none in the blink of an eye see how much you like it when hamnet tells you where to head in instead of the emperor he would not do that but trasamund sounded doubtful dont be an idiot of course he would ulric turned back to hamnet thyssen wouldnt you your grace probably hamnet knew he would be lying if he said anything else i would if the jarl made the same sort of mistake sigvats made anyhow trasamund beamed then we have nothing to worry about he thumped his chest me i do not make mistakes like this i am too clever and too modest too ulric skakki remarked yes and that trasamund agreed liv raised an eyebrow audun gilli looked up at the ceiling count hamnet looked down at his hands ulric whistled a snatch of something or other trasamund wouldnt have recognized irony if he were a lodestone i think wed better leave hamnet thyssen said as he went out the door he wished he were wearing chainmail instead of furs and leather if that courier decided to exact punishment for disobeying an imperial order he could be waiting out there with a bow looking for a good shot he could be but he wasnt the travelers hadnt gone far from the serai before the great north road plunged into the forest belt liv sighed all these trees she said we could do so much with themand they even smell good her nostrils twitched then they twitched again the wistful smile left her face thats not just trees i smell hamnet thyssen sniffed too i know what that isits the musk of a shortfaced bear it is ulric skakki agreed no doubt about it maybe a sow that had a litter and now shes out of food he strung his bow much as i hate to mention it we qualify if a shortfaced bear would try to eat gudrid it only goes to show theyll eat anything that jerked a laugh out of count hamnet trasamund visibly started to say something then just as visibly he changed his mind hamnet strung his bow too shortfaced bears were hard to kill with arrows sometimes though they would run away if they got hurt and sometimes getting hurt would only infuriate them and make them attack all the more ferociously you never could tell audun livif you know any charms for fighting off animals this would be a good time to dust them off hamnet said these dont always work liv said animals are more deeply connected to nature than shamanry can ever hope to be well see if you can make this beast unbearable all the same ulric said audun gilli and hamnet thyssen winced liv was too new to raumsdalian to get the pun or realize how bad it was the horses snorted and sidestepped they smelled the bear too and didnt like it the wind is blowing from it to us hamnet said maybe it wont realize were here i hate to tell you this your grace but bears have eyes as well as noses they have ears too ulric said really tell me more about these things and ill taste what you have to say unlike trasamund hamnet thyssen didnt miss sarcasm aimed his way he didnt put up with it either there the bizogot jarl pointed i saw something move behind that tree hamnet peered in that direction he wasnt sure which tree trasamund meant but he didnt see anything moving was a shortfaced bear clever enough to hide behind a tree trunk and peek out at its intended prey he wouldnt have thought so but maybe he was wrong then the bear came out it wasnt very big not as far as shortfaced bears went but they went a long way in that direction when it rose on its hind legs to growl at the travelers hamnet saw it wasnt a sow as ulric skakki had guessedand as hamnet had thought himselfbut a boar ulric let fly his bowstring thrummed the bear dropped down in that same instant so the arrow hissed over its head and thumped into a tree trunk where it stood thrilling ulric swore he reached over his shoulder to grab another shaft from his quiver at the same time as the shortfaced bear ducked under the arrow liv gasped and audun gilli let out a wordless exclamation then he said magic and her hands twisted in a sign bizogots used against evil all that hamnet noted only out of the corner of his ear so to speak his attention centered on the bear if he gave it an arrow in the face that might hurt it enough to make it run away he drew his bowand the bowstring snapped his curses made ulric skakkis seem a beginners beside them the bear let out a deep growl and sprang forward straight toward him ulric shot again in that same moment but only grazed the bears right hind leg count hamnet just had time to draw his sword before the bear was on him it reared again perhaps to smash him off his horse he swung first his blade bit into its right paw severing three claws blood spurted and splashed the snow with red the bear roared opening its fangfilled mouth enormously wide as it did ulric shot an arrow straight into that inviting target this time the shortfaced bears roar was more like a scream it came down on all fours raking hamnets horse with the claws on its left paw as its forelegs lowered the horse screamed too more shrilly than the bear had it sprang away hamnet thyssen tried with all his strength to keep it under some kind of control and also tried to stay on its back the bear lumbered after him the wound on its front paw must have slowed it shortfaced bears could usually outsprint horses ulric skakki had a perfect shot this timeright at the bears heart but his bowstring also broke this time he outcursed count hamnet trasamund rode up and slammed his sword down just behind the bears ears the animal had hardly seemed to notice his approachall its attention was on hamnet thyssen it let out a startled grunt and slumped to the snow dead no wonderhamnet heard its skull break and then all the travelers swore at once the dead bear writhed in the snow its shape changed after a couple of minutes it was a dead bear no more but rather a dead man that fellow comes from the rulers audun gilli said no one tried to contradict him that strongfeatured heavily bearded face plainly belonged to one of the men from beyond the glacier what in blazes is he doing here ulric said fitting a new string to the bow that had let him down hamnet thyssen was doing the same thing the way it looks he said i think he was trying to kill me you dont think well of yourself do you ulric skakki mocked as automatically as he breathed i think thyssen is right trasamund said when it was a bear it let you shoot it it let me strike it it wanted only the count no one else nothing else mattered to it why would that be ulric asked i see only one answerthey think he is dangerous to them that wasnt trasamund whod raised the point it wasnt liv who might have been expected to take hamnets side it was audun gilli his objectivity helped make him convincing arent we all dangerous to them by god wed better be ulric skakki said should i write them an angry letter complaining that they dont think enough of me to try murdering me im tempted if only i could find somebody to deliver it he sounded affronted that the rulers might not find him worth killing believe me i could do without the honor hamnet thyssen said as he dismounted to look at the wounds the bear had scored in his horses flank they were long but not deepplenty to pain and frighten the animal but not crippling he thought they would heal well the horse trembled when he put his hands anywhere near the gashes he bent down scooped up some snow and pressed it against the animals wounds the horse snorted and started to shy then it seemed to decide the cold felt good and let out what sounded like a sigh of relief bear grease might help ulric said how about shaman grease trasamund said you can slit that bastards belly and use what hes got he wasnt joking not in the least bizogots wasted nothing they couldnt afford to this would be the same sort of spell that wizard used when he turned into an owl wouldnt it hamnet asked liv i would say so yes she answered her voice troubled it is a more thorough spell than we use it is a more thorough spell than we know though some of ours do the same thing how did he get down here trasamund said a long way from the far side of the gap to this forest maybe he was an owl till not long ago maybe he flew audun gilli said i doubt it liv said with us at least a shaman has a spirit animal if the animal is a dire wolf say the shaman may howl when the moon is full but he will not hop like a snowshoe hare and he will not take wing like a ptarmigan is it the same for the rulers would it have to be audun asked if it is not the same they are even stranger and darker than i thought liv sounded more troubled than ever this one was a bear and now hes dead trasamund said we still live no matter how strange and dark he was the son of a scut and wed better get up to the north and put a stop to the trouble the rulers are causing hamnet thyssen wondered what sigvat ii would have done if he knew the rulers were already inside the empire he laughed bitterly as he remounted seeing that the wizard or shaman or whatever he was had tried to kill him sigvat might have congratulated the fellow or even ennobled him will the horse be all right ulric asked we still might be able to buy you another one i think he will hamnet said i think trasamund s right too we need to get up to the gap as fast as we can why ulric skakki said the rulers are already here on that cheery note the travelers rode north again xxi in the middle of winter hamnet thyssen saw only a little difference between the bizogot country and the glacier farther north snow blanketed everything on days when the sun shone the reflections from all that white could dazzle and overwhelm the eye trasamund and liv had no goggles but rubbed streaks of ash from a campfire under their eyes to cut the glare before long the raumsdalians with them started doing the same thing it was ugly but it helped im wearing muskox dung ulric skakki sounded more cheerful than he had any business being well weve been eating it whenever we cook up here hamnet said why not wear it too i wish you hadnt reminded me audun gilli said i wish for all kinds of things that wont come truegood sense from the emperor for instance ulric said whats one more wasted wish hamnet thyssen looked around as if to see who might have overheard ulric down in raumsdalia someone could have betrayed him to the emperors servants in which case he would not have a happy time of it up here he was among friends and had the sense to realize it before hamnet did trasamund saw the raumsdalians glance and knew what it meant no spies up here your grace he said no informers youre in bizogot country again youre in the free lands breathe deep breathe free what if someone back in the three tusk clan has been talking about you behind your back your ferocity ulric skakki asked in his most innocent tones beneath the dirt and ashes on his face trasamund turned red if i hear about it ill knock the son of a mammoth turds teeth out he growled welcome to the free lands welcome to bizogot country ulric said and whats that supposed to mean the jarl demanded what do you think it means ulric asked i think it means youre making fun of me on the sly you raumsdalian hound trasamund said and he wasnt wrong didnt i ask you when you chose to come north if you would obey me how am i disobeying you did you ever tell me not to make fun of you did you ever tell me not to make fun of silly ideas ulric sounded mild which didnt mean he wasnt serious if you obey you have to respect you are not respecting trasamund said ulric skakki went to his knees before the jarl then he went to his belly knocking his forehead in the snow your ferocity your wonderfulness he cried your highness your majesty your exalted magnificence may i please be allowed to kiss some of the muskox dung from the sole of your boot liv giggled helplessly that meant trasamunds venomous glaze divided itself between ulric and her and lost some of its effect he stirred ulric with the toe of hiswith luckclean boot get up you fool give me the respect i deserve not this stupid show of more i was trying to do that the adventurer brushed snow off his front you didnt seem to like it very well either no one likes to be made fun of trasamund said accurately well your ferocity if you say something silly cant i let you know i think its silly ulric skakki asked if i cant whats your famous bizogot freedom worth i might as well have stayed in the empire after all trasamund started to answer then stopped this time ulric got the full force of his glare he seemed to have no trouble enduring it you twist things up trasamund complained i am the jarl i know what i can do and i know what i am not supposed to do and i know what my clansfolk can do too you go past that he is a foreigner your ferocity liv said he did not suck in our ways with his mothers milk do you follow all our raumsdalian customs when you come down into the empire hamnet thyssen added i dont think so maybe not trasamund said but i dont dance on them for the sport of it either ulric was trying to pull my prong for the sport of it i wont put up with that a raumsdalian would have talked about getting his leg pulled as usual the bizogot idiom was gamier and the jarl was probably right ulric skakki did make trouble for no better reason than that he liked making trouble hed certainly annoyed count hamnet more than once now he said ill be mild as milk you can rely on it youll be as mild as smetyn and like smetyn youll make everyone around you wild trasamund predicted the only reason i tell you to come along is the hope you will madden the rulers more than the three tusk clan thats good enough ulric skakki said cheerfully and on they went the breath of god reached down to raumsdalia in the winter hamnet thyssen thought he knew what blizzards could do after the first couple he went through on the plains he owned himself an amateur he was as warmly dressed as any man could be in furs with mittens on his hands and baggy felt boots with more loose felt in them on his feet only his eyes showed his hood came down low on his forehead a thick muskox wool scarf covered his nose and mouth when snow came roaring down from the north riding a wind almost strong enough to knock a man off his feet it hardly seemed to matter trasamund and liv took being out and about in such weather for granted were still a long way from the glacier liv screamed in hamnets ear that being the only way to make herself heard through the winds howls this is nothing it seems like something to me he shouted back her eyes showed amusement or he thought they did when they were the only part of her he could see he had trouble being sure it was blowing too hard for them to hope to set up their tents when they stopped for the evening trasamund and liv started making snow huts lumping snow into blocks and building inward to form a dome they left a tiny opening in the roof to let smoke out the entrance faced south and had a dogleg to break the force of the wind what about the horses audun gilli asked but the bizogots were already piling up more snow blocks into a windbreak liv used a little magic to melt some snow on the ground and let it refreeze as ice around the poles she used to tether the horses they wont be able to go anywhere she said confidently suppose bears come or wolves what do we do then audun asked we walk trasamund answered with withering scorn the idea didnt seem to worry him it worried hamnet thyssen but he didnt say anything about it what could he say the wizard also kept quiet no one said anything about how the travelers would occupy the snow huts either but hamnet and liv ended up in one with the other two raumsdalians and trasamund in the other just getting out of the ravening wind made hamnet feel warmer he fumbled for flint and steel in the darkness inside he had a little leather pouch with tinder in it on his belt the sooner he got a fire going the happier he would be liv did it before him a few murmured words were enough to set a lamp alight he gave her a seated bow handy traveling with a shaman he said up here any bizogot will know that spell she said we need it too often and not knowing it can kill can bizogots who arent shamans work it hamnet asked is the power in the spell or in the spellcaster this spell works most of the time for most people liv answered whether that means most people have some power or the spell itself is strong i dont know i never thought about it most of the time hamnet wouldnt have thought about it either it was the kind of question more likely to interest eyvind torfinn but here in the snow hut fire was naturally on his mind he and liv didnt need much of a blaze the heat from their bodies warmed the cramped space surprisingly well the lamp gave more light than heat liv even had a chunk of muskox meat with her as she sliced off frozen strips she sent hamnet a sly look can you eat raw meat if im hungry enough i can he broke off he almost said he could eat anything if he got hungry enough but since the bizogots ate stomachs and guts with their contents still in them when they got hungry enough that might prove more bragging than he cared to back up to his relief liv took what he did say for a complete sentence she started passing him strips of meat he had no trouble eating them they might even have been a delicacy down in nidaros and the company here was better than any he would have known in the imperial capital whats it like making love when the wind is screaming outside he asked liv smiled you want to find out i suppose well why not its warm enough and the work will make us warmer as long as they lay on their clothes and blankets it was fine when hamnet stuck his foot in the snow for a couple of heartbeats it put him off his stroke but he quickly recovered afterwards he dressed in a hurry and so did liv they wrapped themselves in their blankets and fell asleep it was dark inside the hut when count hamnet wokethe lamp had gone out the wind still howled and screeched outside within the hut though it was snug and more than warm enough the bizogots knew what they were doing all right he yawned twisted and went back to sleep the next time he woke up a little light was coming in through the smoke hole he needed a moment to realize the storm had died it was almost eerily quiet beside him liv said its blown itself out i hoped it would i wondered if it would bury the hut before it did hamnet said notoo windy for that the snow wouldnt stick enough she said we may have to dig out of the entrance though they did as they shoveled snow with mittened hands hamnet thyssen said i hope the horses came through all right so do i theyre your southern beasts not the ones we breed ourselves liv went on digging as she spoke she broke out into fresh air well know soon standing up came as a relief to hamnet hed felt as crowded in the snow as he felt small and insignificant traveling across the frozen plains everything was frozen now the ground as far as the eye could see robed in white even his furs and livs had snow all over them he trudged through snow that crunched under his boots to the windbreak trasamund and liv had built the horses were still there still alive and eager for food he had a little sugar made from maple sap down in the empire the animals snuffled up the treat and snorted for more liv started digging out the snow in front of the other huts entrance somebody inside said something hamnet couldnt make out what it was but liv s tart answer told him no im not a bear she said it would serve you right if i were audun gilli ulric skakki and trasamund emerged a moment later good thing the suns in the sky ulric said otherwise we wouldnt have any idea which way north was i could use the spell with the needle audun said it wouldnt be perfect not up herehe was ready to admit that nowbut it would give us the right idea if the water didnt freeze before you could finish chanting trasamund sounded altogether serious hamnet decided he had a right to be with the air this cold water would turn to ice in a hurry weve got the sun the raumsdalian noble said lets use it they mounted and rode north the southern horses did know enough to paw forage up from under the snow hamnet hadnt been sure they would one less thing to worry about anyhow only last summers frozen marsh plants sticking up from the snow here and there told the travelers theyd come to the edge of sudertorp lake no screeching waterfowl nownothing but the silent grip of winter count hamnet looked west then east the frozen lake stretched as far as he could see in either direction which is the shorter way around he asked they both look pretty long ulric said that both will cost us time hamnet said fretfully the sense that it was slipping away gnawed at him see the southerners trasamund said to liv in the bizogot language she grinned and nodded whatever amused the jarl she found it funny too whats the answer then hamnet thyssen asked with as little sarcasm as he could we dont go around trasamund answered we go straight across by god this season of the year musk oxen and mammoths cross lakes and rivers if the ice holds them it will hold us too hamnet and ulric and audun exchanged glances hamnet had skated on frozen ponds in winterwhat raumsdalian hadnt but sending horses across that was a different story what happens if we fall in audun gilli asked the question on hamnets mind and surely on ulrics too if were close to shore we drag you out get on dry land build a big fire fast as we can and maybe you live the bizogot jarl answered if not so close you freeze before we can do it like a lot of mammothherders he was callous when it came to things nobody could do anything about he went on it wont happen though the ice now is as thick as jesper flettis head and even harder that made both ulric and hamnet thyssen smile audun gilli just nodded seriously and said i hope youre right im betting my neck too trasamund said the wizard nodded again the horses went out onto the ice without much fuss they placed their feet carefully even with horseshoesone more thing the bizogots who didnt smelt iron went withoutthe going was slippery but trasamund proved right about one thingthe frozen surface of the lake was more than solid enough to bear the heavy animals weight except for the smoothness hamnet couldnt tell he wasnt riding across solid ground there was no shaking under him to suggest water yet unfrozen lay beneath the ice sudertorp lake was a long way across going around would have been three or four times as longhamnet understood as much but he still felt peculiar with nothing but ice all around he felt as if he were riding across the top of the glacier when he spoke that conceit aloud ulric skakki clapped his mittened hands now theres a sport no ones likely to try soon he said men might get to the top i suppose but not horses your ferocity what do you want trasamund often suspected ulric of laughing up his sleeve at himand often was right but the adventurer sounded serious as he asked have any bizogots ever tried climbing to the top of the glacier not in my clan the jarl answered not so anyone remembers ive heard that men have tried farther west i dont think anyone ever made it though there are mountains that stick up through the glacier some of them are topped with green in the summertimebut what grows on them no one knows how would you get to them to find out count hamnet whistled softly that wasnt a small thought those mountain peaks above the glacierwhat might grow up there anything at all how long had they been there each by itself eons could there be people up there people who did roam the top of the glacier and had no more hope of coming down than the bizogots and raumsdalians did of going up what would they eat the top of the glacier made the bizogot plains seem paradise by comparison probably rabbits and lemmings and voles up there ulric said when hamnet put that into words bound to be birds too at least in summer but i wouldnt want to try to live up there and thats the truth he shivered so did hamnet thyssen and then unmistakably so did the ice beneath them hamnet thought he heard a crackling noise far below he pointed at trasamund not that pointing with a forefinger in a mitten did much good you said this couldnt happen he shouted at the bizogot it cant trasamund shouted back even though it was the crackling grew louder i dont know about you people but im making for shore as fast as i can ulric skakki said and booted his horse up to a trot and then to a gallop that seemed like such a good idea count hamnet did the same thing so did trasamund and liv and audun gilli but the crackling followed them and got louder still even through the drumming thunder of their horses hooves this is sorcery audun shouted someone is making the ice breakup well for gods sake make it stop hamnet shouted back he thought about what the jarl said about going into the icy water having thought about it he wished he hadnt to die like that it would end fast but not fast enough and someone could only mean someone from the rulers how did the folk who lived beyond the glacier track the travelers here hamnet had no idea he wished audun gilli or liv did liv began to chant in the bizogot tongue she took her left hand from the reins so she could use it for passes i know that spell trasamund said do you hamnet thyssen looked back over his shoulder what he saw made him wish he hadnt cracks in the frozen surface of the lake stretched toward him like skeletal arms wanting to hold him in an embrace that would last forever i do by god the jarl answered when snow is very dry it wont hold together for things like huts that spell clumps it you might say will it do the same for ice hamnet asked i dont know trasamund said were going to find out dont you think audun gilli rode up alongside liv he reached out and set a hand on her leg most of the time hamnet would have killed him for that now though he understood the wizard wasnt feeling her up audun was lending her strength he didnt know the spell it wasnt one raumsdalians were likely to use but he was doing what he could to help would what he was doing what liv was doing be enough count hamnet looked over his shoulder again those grasping cracks were still coming forward as fast as a horse could runbut no faster or so he thought so he hoped he looked ahead that rise had to be the beginning of solid ground real ground it also had to be most of a mile away could liv hold back the sorcery from the north long enough slow it down enough to let them all win to safety if the horse stumbles under me im a dead man hamnet thought even so he booted it on as fiercely as he could if the cracks in the ice caught up with him he was also dead when he looked back one more time he gasped in dismay he could see black water there where the cracks had widened no he didnt want to go into that come on horse he called run curse you and the horse did run and its hooves thudded up the slope of sudertorp lakes northern bank just as the cracks and black water reached the edge of the lake ulric and trasamund were ahead of him liv and audun just behind for a bad moment he wondered if the spell could tear land asunder as it tore ice but it did stop at the lakes edge he reined in breathing almost as hard as his horse was then he pulled back his hood in lieu of doffing a cap to salute the shaman and wizard i think you saved us he said liv was panting as if shed run a long way i think i did too she said and i knowi knowi had help from audun you knew the spell audun gilli told her it worked just well enough he looked back toward the cracks in the frozen surface of the lake so did liv her shiver had nothing to do with winter on the bizogot plains just well enough is right she said i couldnt stop the spell i didnt have a chance in the world of stopping it all i could do was slow it down a little how did the rulers reach so far hamnet thyssen asked i dont know she blazed sounding angry at him and herself and the rulers all at once i dont know i tell you if i knew id be able to do something like that myself and i cant nobody can nobody except them audun gilli pointed north what does that say count hamnet had a pretty good notion what it said but hoped he was wrong does it say wed better not quarrel with them or else well lose does it say we should bend the knee to them because thats the best we can hope to do if it does why are we fighting were fighting because were free and were going to stay free trasamund answered before liv could speak if thats not why youre fighting go back to the empire because i want nothing to do with you im not going anywhere hamnet said except north that is next frozen lake we come across we ought to go around it and not over it ulric skakki said i wonder if it matters hamnet said if the rulers know where we are if they can strike as they please theyll find some other way some other place to try to kill us foolish to give them the same chance twice ulric insisted why theyve seen it didnt work so wouldnt they think its not worth trying again count hamnet said we havent seen any more wizards pretending to be shortfaced bears after we killed the first one that man was not pretending liv and audun gilli said the same thing at the same time in two different languages whether he was or not they only tried it once count hamnet said stubbornly are we as safe as we can be now trasamund asked the only answers the others could give were shrugs how could they hope to know but even shrugs satisfied the jarl either we let them scare us or we dont he said and if we dont we keep moving spoken like a nomad ulric said i am a nomad trasamund answered proudly i am on the way back to my clans grazing grounds and you had better be too he urged his horse north the others came with him having ridden so far what else could they do hamnet thyssen didnt like his dreams theyd mostly been happy after he and liv became lovers the dreams hed had since returning to the frozen steppe though were muddled and grim and they got worse the farther north he traveled when he finally complained about it liv looked surprised yours too she said mine have been the same way i dont care for the omen they soon found they werent the only ones with ugly dreams ulric skakki made light of his saying what do you expect after you eat muskox chitterlings two days running whats wrong with muskox chitterlings theyre good trasamund declared and besides theyre a lot better than going empty i wont argue with the second part of that ulric said the first is a matter of opinion and it isnt mine even though trasamund liked what he was eating he also had bad dreams he put it down to worry i keep wondering how things are with the clan he said i imagine everything that could go wrong do that long enough and youll start doing it whether youre awake or asleep audun gilli said if my dreams are bad its because someone is trying to make them bad and someone is doing it too the rulers hamnet said i cant think of anyone else its likely to be audun said can you i cant livs voice was worried too none of the other bizogots hate the three tusk clan enough to bring a sending down on us what about his imperial majesty ulric skakki as usual was full of pleasant ideas however much count hamnet wished he could he couldnt dismiss that one out of hand the most he would say was i dont like to think that of sigvat well neither do i but i dont like nightmares either i dont like waking tireder than i went to sleep ulric said how do we know for sure our own wizards werent cracking the ice on sudertorp lake how do we know because they cursed well werent thats how audun gilli said i know what our sorcery feels like i ought to by god this had nothing to do with that it felt strange strange and strong whoever worked that magic has been making spells in a tradition in a style separate from ours for for forever as best i can tell hes right liv said i know bizogot shamanry i know some of what raumsdalian shamanry feels like this was different as different as blackberries and musk oxen ulric spread his hands all right i was wrong about that but are you sure im wrong about the sending liv and audun looked at each other i thought it was coming from the north she said slowly audun gilli nodded but liv went on im not sure of that not the way i was with the spell on the lake i still think its likely but im not sure my dreams have been cold all of them have been cold audun said thinking back on it hamnet realized his had too audun continued that doesnt prove its the rulers and not the emperor but id bet on them when we get back among the good folk of the three tusk clan we will be troubled no more trasamund said by being what they are they will shield us from this nuisance what were not good folk ourselves ulric asked if thats all it takes we dont have some of the people who came along with us last time here now you know he named no names which was just as well hamnet thyssens mind immediately turned to gudrid but he hadnt had nightmares about her up here not even once that struck him as odd hed had plenty of them before trasamunds thoughts ran in a different direction nothing wrong with eyvind torfinn he said jesper fletti and the other soldiersi dont miss them so much he thought earl eyvind was a good fellow because the aging noble either didnt see his sport with gudrid or pretended not to notice it hamnet didnt think eyvind torfinn a bad fellow either but he esteemed the other raumsdalian despite his ties to gudrid not because of them trasamund sent ulric skakki a sly glance he didnt say anything about ulric he didnt say the adventurer wasnt a good man whatever he thought he thought and if ulric growled and muttered he didnthe couldntdo any more than that trasamund smiled who would have thought a bizogot could show such subtlety the red dire wolvesnot to be confused with the black dire wolves who dwelt far to the westfed the travelers to the bursting point theyd just killed a bull mammoth and for the time being had more meat than they knew what to do with baked mammoth stewed mammoth mammoth fritters roasted mammoth marrowa delicacy that even without toasted bread on which to spread itmammoth blood sausage mammoth head cheese anything you could do to and with a mammoths carcass the red dire wolves did im surprised we didnt see mammoth eyeballs and mammoth ballocks audun gilli said during a pause in the orgy of eating oh the jarl gets the eyeballs trasamund said seriously they help make him farseeing or so the hope is as for the ballocks the clansmen slice them up and roast them first thing same with the pizzle you can figure out why eryes audun raised a leather jack of smetyn to his lips he was on his way to getting drunk but so were the rest of them he didnt get drunk when he needed to stay sober which was all that really mattered hamnet thyssen gnawed more meat off a chunk of mammoth rib some enterprising raumsdalian trader had sold the red dire wolf clan several bone saws of the sort surgeons used down in the empire for the bizogots they made firstrate butchers tools hamnet wondered who his clever countryman was the fellow had found an odd way but a good one to meet his customers desires a big burly graybeard named totila ruled the red dire wolves he eyed hamnet and ulric and said some of you foreigners can fill yourselves almost like real people he didnt include audun in that the wizard was small to begin with and didnt seem to have an infinitely extensible paunch practice your ferocity ulric skakki answered the mammoth brain is very tasty but now i keep wanting to wave my trunk and wiggle my ears he did wiggle them something hamnet hadnt known he could do totila stared then laughed and laughed as long as thinking like a mammoth doesnt make you want to shit in the middle of my tent eat all the brains you please ulric did eat some more then mimed pulling down his trousers totila laughed harder than ever in raumsdalian hamnet thyssen said i see youve found your true level ill cut your heart out and eat it for that ulric answered and what kind of fool will i act like then a jealous fool id say hamnet answered and i ought to know about those he remembered the feel of his point grating off the ribs of gudrids first loverthe first one he found out about anyhowand then sliding deep to pierce the mans heart he remembered the anguished surprise on ingjald oddleifs face this cant be happening to me he must have thought there at the end but it was totila found girls for trasamund and ulric skakki he would have found one for audun gilli too but the wizard was using the bits of the bizogot tongue hed painfully acquired to try to talk shop with the deaf old man who was the red dire wolves shaman audun would have liked to find someone to translate for him but the rest of the travelers were otherwise occupiedhamnet and liv had crawled under a mammoth hide together too audun had to do the best he could on his own when the travelers rode out of the red dire wolves encampment the next morning the wizard said i think odovacar told me there were changes in the north their shaman has he had bad dreams too ulric skakki asked by his selfsatisfied smirk whatever dreams hed had after enjoying the bizogot woman werent bad at all but he sobered when audun gilli nodded he has im almost sure of it audun said that makes it more likely the rulers are sending the dreams not the emperor why would imperial wizards trouble a shamans dreams why would the rulers hamnet thyssen asked in turn if theyre plotting something wouldnt they want to keep shamans in the dark as long as they could in the dark was the right phrase the sun rose late and set early scuttling across the sky from southeast to southwest and never rising high above the southern horizon beyond the glacier it wouldnt come up even this far hamnet remembered ulrics account of winter up there sometimes spells wash out farther than you wish they would liv said in raumsdalian and audun gilli nodded she went on odovacar may have felt bits and pieces of what was aimed somewhere else aimed at us hamnet asked it could be liv said or maybe she broke off maybe what audun gilli asked she didnt answer she stopped speaking raumsdalian in her own language she called out to trasamund saying i fear the rulers may have struck at our clan god grant it not be so but i fear it would they dare the jarl said never doubt what the rulers would dare ulric skakki said in the bizogot tongue they may not always get everything they want but they want a lot god be praised we come in time to stop them here then trasamund said if we do hamnet thyssen said trasamund sent him a horrible stare he looked back steadily the bizogot was assuming that what he wanted was true but was it really well find out soon the raumsdalian thought on they rode the weather was clear but very cold totila had given them some mammoth meat to take with them on their journey they also killed hares even so far north though those had next to no fat on them relying on their thick white fur for warmth they would feed a man but wouldnt keep him going indefinitely by themselves in such weather people needed fat for fuel to keep from freezing now we ride into the lands of the three tusk clan trasamund said a couple of days after they left the red dire wolves encampment now we join the grandest clan among the bizogots he looked around i see no herds not yet they will be wandering elsewhere no doubt our grazing range is vast and needs to be hamnet thyssen thought if the land up here by the glacier were better the musk oxen and mammoths could have lived on less of it by the ironic glint in ulric skakkis eye he saw the same thing neither of them pointed it out to trasamund that would have enraged him without being able to change anything late in the afternoon liv pointed north across the snowcovered plain those are people i think heading our way they were no more than wiggling dots at the edge of visibility to count hamnet if you say so he told her my own folk coming to greet me smug pride rang in trasamunds voice before long he got a closer look at his clansfolk and pride changed to horror they werent welcoming himthey were fleeing disaster some were wounded others terribly burned invaders gelimer gasped when he saw his chieftain invaders from the north xxii nor all the survivors from the three tusk clan even wanted to linger long enough to talk with trasamund and his comrades the bizogots wanted to flee lest worse befall them they had been struck and they had been broken theyd never imagined such a blow could fall on them not from that direction even though trasamund spoke of the rulers on the far side ot the glacier the danger must have seemed no more real to his folk than to sigvat why didnt you patrol the gap the anguished jarl asked gelimer we didfor a while but the hunting is bad up there so the men came back gelimer answered he had a new cut across his forehead and a bandage on his left arm we didnt look for invaders not at this season of the year he grimaced i wish we would have the rulers can do all kinds of unpleasant things hamnet said gelimer nodded and then bit his lip moving his head had to hurt how far behind you are they ulric skakki askeda good relevant question not far enough by god the bizogot exclaimed but they arent chasing as hard as they might be why should they bother whats left of us cant do them any harm and they have to know it my clan trasamund howled you threw away my clan because you wouldnt listen to me what i ought to do to you whats the point your ferocity hamnet thyssen said wearily whatever you want to do the rulers have already done worse if id stayed it might not have mattered ulric said they still would have surprised you eh i would have beaten them anyhow even in disaster trasamund clung to his arrogance they hadriding mammoths riding mammoths with lancers on them gelimer said for all the world as if the travelers hadnt told him about that when they came south from the gap as if he hadnt wanted to ride mammoths himself how could we hope to stand against them and the ones who werent on mammoths rode deer they might as well have been horses and their shamanstheir shamans blasted our camp with lightning liv put her face in her hands i might have stopped that if i were there she said in a broken voice ive met the rulers i have some notion of what they can do anyone who didnt would have been easy meat for them she swiped at her eyes i cant even cry not now my eyelids will freeze shut what do we do audun gilli asked in a very small voice we cant keep riding norththat seems plain enough if we do we run into the rulers and then ulric skakki didnt go on but he didnt have to the rest of the travelers could draw their own pictures how many other clansfolk got away trasamund asked gelimer are there parties in back of you or did they flee in different directions i dont know your ferocity gelimer said miserably i think the only ones behind us are those horrible godcursed demons from beyond the glacier i wish i could know for sure the jarl said i dont like to leave anyone behind who might somehow get away if i go forward you throw yourself away hamnet thyssen broke in will you charge a squadron of war mammoths singlehanded some people would call that brave but isnt it stupid what would you do afterwards nothing because youd be dead with my clan murdered i deserve to be trasamund said no count hamnet shook his head this war is all the bizogots all the folk below the glacier against these invaders the three tusk clan has lost a fight but the bizogots are still your folk they need you they need what you can do they need what you know ulrics right if we charge now we lose we have to regroup and figure out what to do next how to fight the rulers talk talk talk this is what raumsdalians do trasamund said not bizogots bizogots go out and fight and then wish later that theyd done some talking instead ulric skakki said trasamund scowled at himand at the world the raumsdalians are right your ferocity liv said not you too the jarl howled she nodded im sorry but yes going forward charging ahead is useless now we need to save ourselves for a fight we can hope to win our grazing grounds the mammoths the musk oxen trasamund beat his fists against his legs in misery theyre lost now your ferocity ulric said if we win you can reclaim them if you lose now will you ever see them again how likely is it tell me the truth not what your heart wants to hear trasamund growled like a wild beast down deep in his throat better to die than to live the exiles life he cried if you really want to die it wont be hard ulric said if youre just making noise because things hurt so much right now thats a different story but be careful what you say because you may decide to do something your mouth means but your heart doesnt he is right liv said again what we really need is vengeance dont throw yourself away before we can take it trasamund turned his ravaged gaze on hamnet thyssen well raumsdalian are you going to preach me a sermon too he spoke in the empires language his own had no word for sermon no count hamnet answered the only thing ill tell you is i know what watching your world crash down on you feels like its happened to me too you have a hole where your heart used to be and you go on anyway what else can you do kill trasamund roared if you kill a little now your ferocity you will die right afterwards audun gilli was almost maddeningly precise if you wait for your moment you can work a great killing on the foe and still live to hear him mourn which would you rather i want to kill now and i want to kill later the jarl answered i want to kill and kill and kill if i drowned the world in blood it wouldnt glut me do you understand you and your talk of killing what do you know of death audun gilli bit his lip i came home one night to watch my family burn is that enough your ferocity or do you want something more did you ever smell your wifes charred flesh when you lay down to try to sleep he almost quivered with fury little weedy man that he was he was on the point of hurling himself at the burly bizogot magic forgot simply man against man and hamnet thyssen might not have been astonished if he prevailed trasamund stared in his own moment of agony he seemed to have forgot that others could know had known torment too where ulrics sarcasm and hamnet s stolidity failed to remind him of it the wizards rage did trasamund seemed to slump in on himself like a pingo melting in an uncommonly hot summer i will live he mumbled i will avenge and i will hate myself every heartbeat till i do hamnet thyssen and audun gilli both nodded oh yes your ferocity hamnet said oh yes that comes with the territory for now though we see about living dully trasamund nodded as well audun gilli knew a weatherworking spell that seemed stronger than any liv had he used it to call snow down on the travelers tracks maybe that would let them and the survivors from the three tusk clan give the rulers the slip or then again maybe it wouldnt if you like ill ride off by myself hamnet said the wizards from the rulers seem to want to kill me in particular fools that they are i dont want to bring my troubles down on anyone else youll do no such thing livs voice went high and shrill she does care for me hamnet thought that seemed a stranger stronger magic than the one audun used to fill their trail with snowflakes stay with us thyssen trasamund said stay with us if the rulers want you so much it follows that you can hurt them if you live and so wed better keep you alive if we can he cared for hamnet too cared for him the same way he cared for his own weapons anything he could aim at the rulers he would count hamnet didnt want to leave liv and he didnt want to leave trasamund either the bizogot jarl wanted to hit back at the invaders that was more than sigvat ii did hamnet thyssen was in the right place and in the right company if you dont think my coming along will endanger you ill gladly stay good thats good we need all the enemies of those lion turds to ride together trasamund could see that even if sigvat couldnt and we need to hit back at them as soon as we can without throwing ourselves away how once more ulric skakki asked a bluntly practical question he asked it and the bizogot waved it aside i dont know yet but we need to do it when we see the chance we need to show the rest of my folk that we can hit back if we dont whats to stop them from rolling on their backs like a dire wolf thats lost a fight and giving the cursed rulers whatever they want a point ulric didnt sound happy about admitting it but he did he was no more honest than he had to be but was in his own way scrupulous gelimer trasamund boomed the other bizogot nodded miserably trasamund went on you will know where the herds are not so i know where they were your ferocity where they were before the thunderbolt from the north hit us i should say gelimer answered we warned you by god you should have listened but trasamund let that gofor a bizogot a rare show of magnanimity the rulers will be feeding off the beasts closest to your camp guide us to a herd farther away it will feed us for a while and sooner or later the invaders will come to steal when they dohe smacked his hands togetherwe strike he made it sound simple whether it would be gelimer seemed to gain a little life at the thought of hitting back off to the west is where most of the musk oxen were the mammoths roamed closer to our camp i dont know if those rulers are breaking them to ride even after you said they could do that who would have thought it was true you should have hamnet thyssen answered before trasamund could speak did you think we were making up stories to pass the time with raumsdalians who knows gelimer said all you people lie all the time so how can we tell what to believe hamnet looked at liv she was looking back at him they both remembered eyvind torfinns paradox hamnet wished the bizogots here hadnt taken it so literally it might have cost them dear or then again it might not have mattered who could say whether the rulers would have beaten them anyhow am i a raumsdalian is the jarl a raumsdalian liv asked gelimer when we say something is true you can rely on it you can but you didnt and now you see what happened you dont need to make me feel any worse lady gelimer said im already lower than a maggots belly killing the enemy will make a man of you again trasamund declared west you said the muskox herds were then west we shall ride west and north back into our own lands again enough fatty roast meat made the cold all around much easier to bear the furnace inside hamnet thyssen stoked with such fuel burned harder and hotter he seemed warmer and supposed he really was the bizogots had no trouble cutting an old bull musk ox half lame and slow out of the herd and leading it downwind so the smell of blood wouldnt panic the other animals killing it took a lot of arrows but they had them when it went down at last bawling in pain and incomprehension trasamund finished it with a headsmans stroke from his great twohanded blade gore crimsoned the snow some of the hungry bizogots snatched up that bloody snow and stuffed it into their mouths they couldnt wait for butchery let alone a fire bodies needed food of any sort in this weather the nomads grinned with blood on their lips and running down their chins hamnet thyssen having eaten better lately left the blood alone after the dung fire began to burn he roasted his meat and gulped it down burnt on the outside raw in the middle he didnt care you couldnt be very fussy in the bizogot country not if you wanted to go on living he supposed he would eat bloody snow if he got hungry enough he didnt think he would grin afterwards though trasamund seemed to gain strength with food too where are the rulers he roared let them come now yes let them come by god we will kill them by the hundreds by the thousands the remnant of his clan had no more than twenty warriors counting the newcomers up from the south let them come yesbut not too many of them wherever you put him ulric skakki had good sense let them leave their wizards behind too that wasnt trasamund scorning liv and audun gilli that was audun himself they are stronger than we are however much i hate to admit it maybe we can take them by surprise liv said theyll think were weak and theyll be right too hamnet thyssen thought the shaman went on and theyll think were afraid and we will show them theyre wrong were not afraid of them we were never afraid of them gelimers voice was blurry because he talked with his mouth full he was too busy eating to pause very much but they beat us they were too many and too strong they wont come against us with everything they have thats bound to be true they wont think theyll need to and theyll be gathering strength for a raid farther south thats what i would do if i were one of them anyhow theyll push through the bizogot country so they can attack the empire what makes you so special demanded one of the bizogots whod lived through the rulers onslaught what are you doing here if you think youre better than we are i didnt say anything about better i dont say anything about that ulric answered but were richer than you are our lands are richer than yours our weather is warmer than yours the rulers will strike south he defied the bizogot to disagree with him the man wanted to hamnet thyssen could see as much but the fellow only muttered into his gingery beard and went back to stuffing himself with meat down in raumsdalia the musk oxs stones would have been called prairie oysters trasamund toasted them over the fire and ate them as the bull battered down his rivals and won his mates so will i beat down the rulers he vowed so may it be liv said softly ulric skakki had to remind trasamund to put scouts out to the east the jarl still wasnt at his best or anything close to it if we had another leader here to follow i would ulric told hamnet thyssen the way the adventurer looked at count hamnet alarmed him i dont want to lead anybody hamnet said i didnt want to do it down in raumsdalia with my own folk i really dont want to do it here the bizogots wouldnt follow me anyhow you might be surprised ulric said youre large and youre tough and you dont spend all your time going on about how wonderful you are im a foreigner hamnet said with a patience not far from desperation all raumsdalians are liars remember and bizogots arent ulric skakki threw back his head and laughed thats the funniest thing ive heard since i dont know when its their country they can do whatever they want in it count hamnet said and one of the things theyd want to do is knock any raumsdalian who tries to tell them what to do over the head with a lump of frozen mammoth dung liv came up to the two of them the snow crunching under her felt boots what are you arguing about she asked they spelled it out for her she didnt need long to make up her mind count hamnet is right she said we bizogots must have our own to lead us do you plot against the jarl no but i want someone who isnt sunk in grief in charge ulric answered if trasamund cant do it who can who says trasamund cant liv returned when the rulers come his spirit will rouse you wait and see what if the rulers came and we didnt even know they were on the way ulric asked but liv didnt want to listen to him and neither did hamnet thyssen ulric sighed out a small cloud of fog threw his hands in the air and gave up whoever persuaded trasamund to set scouts out it was as well that he did because two days later one of them rode back to the muskox herd so hard that his horse steamed in the frigid air theyre coming he shouted those murderous thieves are coming liv proved to know her jarl he might have been sunk in gloom before he got the news but he revived with a roar oh they are are they he boomed by god well teach them this isnt their country when he gave orders he seemed to know which ones to give he sent a few bizogots out as herd watchers to give the rulers something to focus on the rest along with the raumsdalians he stationed at the edge of the herd ready to ride out and strike as the chance offered he put liv and audun gilli with that group if you find a spell to confound the rulers use it he said if you find theyre using spells against us block them is that plain if we fail audun asked you wont you cant trasamund said too much riding on it no place to run away any more no place to hide we beat them here or we die here is that plain biting his lip the raumsdalian wizard nodded theyre coming the shout came from several throats at once count hamnet looked east those moving dots at first he took them for horses or for the large deer the rulers rode instead then he realized they were bigger and farther away than that mammoths he thought the chill that ran through him had nothing to do with the icy weather he was honest enough to call it by its right namefear can we really fight them the same noxious beast filled gelimers voice by god we can we will trasamund sounded confident or at least unafraid if we die what do we lose nothing for the clan is shattered and we are nothing without it but if we win we have the start of our vengeance and so we shall win we have nothing else left to do i dont think eyvind torfinn would like the logic ulric skakki murmured to hamnet bugger eyvind torfinn hes down where its warmer hamnet answered were doing his work for him up here so lets do it behind him audun gilli began a soft chant a masking spelljust a small one he said into a pause so they dont look at the musk oxen too closely and dont notice whatever they happen to see along with them good good trasamund rumbled let us surprise them if we can the rulers had stronger magic than folk on this side of the glacier but auduns spell didnt have to be strong it didnt aim to draw attention to itself the opposite in fact hamnet thyssen hoped that meant the invaders wouldnt notice itand wouldnt notice him and the rest of the warriors he strung his bow and nocked an arrow here came the mammoths now he could see the deerriders flanking them so you want some more do you a lancer atop one tusker shouted in the bizogot tongue well give you more all rightsee if we dont the bizogots who seemed to be ordinary herders did what hamnet thyssen would have done in their placethey wheeled their horses and fled laughing and jeering the rulers came after them hamnet discovered something he didnt knowmammoths could move at least as fast as horses with snow on the ground some of the bizogots turned and shot over their shoulders at their pursuers most of those arrows went wild the manches and other tribes in the far southwest practiced that shot and made it deadly they would have laughed themselves sick at how little use the bizogots got from it when a mammoth caught up with a horse by contrast the rulers knew just what to do they speared one bizogot out of the saddle then another and they went on laughing while they did it now trasamund bellowed the bizogots and raumsdalians concealed by the muskox herd and by audun gillis magic thundered forward bowstrings thrummed these archers werent making an unaccustomed shot but one they used all the time they aimed for the mammoths eyes and ears and trunksthe sensitive spots where wounds would pain even those gigantic beasts and they aimed for the warriors atop them one thing mammoths couldnt do was turn as quickly as horses the rulers cried out in surprise and dismay at the unexpected flank assault their enormous mounts went wild when wounded just as horses would have one plucked a rider off its back with its trunk dashed him to the ground and stepped on him his scream cut off abruptly red stained the snow with shouts of rage men of the rulers on deer tried to close with the horsemen the deer lowered their heads and charged ready to use their antlers as secondary weapons but ferocious archery kept most of them at a distance and the horses overbore those that did manage to close hamnet and ulric and the bizogots chopped down at the enemy riders with their swords revenge trasamund shouted over and over again the three tusk clan revenge ulric skakki made a lucky shot he hit a mammoth not just near the eye but in it no hamnet decidedit was a great shot not lucky ulric had done that before the arrow must have pierced the thin fragile bone behind the eyeball and reached the brain for the mammoth crashed to the ground stone dead one of the men atop it survived the tumble but not for long a bizogot ran up and dashed out his brains with a hatchet revenge trasamund yelled once more and all the bizogots took up the cry revenge seeing the mammoth topple seemed to suck the spirit from the rulers they still outnumbered their foes but they lost stomach for a fight that wasnt a walkover the ones who could rode back toward the east as fast as they could go they dont look like such heroes when you see their arses do they ulric skakki remarked not a bit of it hamnet thyssen answered thrusting his blade into the snow to get blood off it we ought to round up the ones who are still breathing but couldnt get away yes the bizogots will have fun with them wont they ulric said count hamnets mouth twisted the adventurer was bound to be right about that and what happened then wouldnt be pretty revenge yes hamnet thought they shouldnt just be sport he said we ought to squeeze answers out of them too some of them speak the bizogot tongue who knows what kind of noises theyll make by the time the bizogots get through with them ulric said do you want to be the one to tell trasamund he cant have all the revenge he craves ill do it after a moment count hamnet amended that ill see if he wants to listen anyhow trasamund wasnt paying much attention to captives when hamnet came up to him he was directing the butchery of the mammoth ulric had slain and of the deer and horses that had fallen in the fight when we go off to join up with another clan by god we wont come emptyhanded he shouted well have meat for their larders so much meat that theyll want us worse than we want them that was bravado he had to know as much too but it was a bravado the surviving three tusk clansfolk needed along with the fallen men of the rulers bizogots lay in the snow cold and dead and rapidly getting stiff the ones who yet lived had to be convinced the others didnt die for nothing the bizogots were already starting to abuse the prisoners theyd taken we should question them not torment them hamnet said trasamund looked as if he hated him easy for you to talk like that the jarl growled they didnt wreck your clan not yet hamnet thyssen answered which brought the bizogot up short he went on if we learn all we can well save other bizogot clans too or we can hope we will would you rather waste them think of them as foodfor the sword that got home to trasamund considering how the bizogots ate every bit of every animal they killed from snout to tail count hamnet had hoped it would the jarl went on scowling at him but then turned aside and started bellowing orders and he needed to bellow having started in on some of their captives the bizogots had the rest trussed and waiting and watching they didnt want to be deprived of the pleasures of vengeance trasamund said if they tell us the truth maybe we let them live or at least give them a quick end that will give them a reason to talk to us if we catch them lying then we do as we please some of them dont know any of our tongue gelimer said we might as well slay themwe cant talk to them keep them breathing for now trasamund said maybe we can ransom them or make the rulers do something to keep us from hurting them youve spent too much time in the south gelimer said youre getting soft trasamund hit him in the face the jarls mitten cushioned the blow but it knocked gelimer down even so he got up smilingtrasamund had proved himself still ferocious hamnet thyssen would have thought that a perfect bizogot attitude if he hadnt known raumsdalians who worked the same way he went over and squatted down by one of the captives tell me your name he said in the bizogot tongue i am a dead man the warrior of the rulers answered in the same language count hamnet drew back a fist tell me your name i said he wouldnt take nonsense from the prisoner no matter what wearily the shaggy hatchetfaced warrior replied you can call me karassops that wasnt quite the same as telling hamnet thyssen his name but hamnet accepted it karassops likely feared his real name if he gave it would be used in magic against him why did you invade this land karassops hamnet asked wounded battered and captive though he was karassops eyed the raumsdalian as he would have eyed any other fool because we could of course it doesnt belong to you some of it does now all of it will the warrior spoke with frightening confidence much good coming here did you you will die here hamnet said i told youi am already dead all of us you captured are dead you surprised us you caught us you disgraced us we are dead we cannot show our faces around the fires of our folk ever again give me a weapon and i will end myself now karassops sounded eager for the chance if you are dead you wont mind answering my questions count hamnet said what harm can answering do the dead karassops made an argumentative corpse eyeing hamnet he said who are you you are no bizogot you must be one from that other herd never mind who i am you dont ask questions you answer them hamnet said one from that other herd karassops followed his own line of thought which one we knew some of you were stupid enough to come back and stir up more trouble he laughed i know you must be the one who kept mooning over the woman he couldnt have any more hamnet thyssen hit him two or three times before even realizing what he was doing blood ran from karassopss nose and started freezing in his mustache and beard hamnet looked at his hands in some surprise they seemed to have minds of their own my women are none of your business he growled i got the idea karassops turned his head and spat red into the snow and you were the one who didnt want to torture us i didnt want you mouthing off either hamnet said youd better remember who won this fight and who lost i am not likely to forget i am disgraced forever karassops couldnt have looked any more forlorn i am outcast i am outlawed i can never take my place among the rulers again i am dead now hamnet wished he hadnt lost his temper and hit the man if karassops was dead to the rulers he might decide he could be alive and have a place among the bizogots but as things were hamnet didnt try to turn him even if karassops said he would join the folk whod defeated and captured him how far could he be trusted not far enough not now the raumsdalian thought regretfully maybe he or the bizogots would have better luck with some of the other men from the rulers meanwhile though hamnet could still learn from karassops even if he didnt try to get him to turn his coat how many of your folk came through the gap he asked despite the blood on his face karassops bared his teeth in a saucy grin enough when count hamnet made as if to hit him again he didnt flinch he had courage the rulers seemed to they were enemies but far from cowards how many of your folk still dwell off to the north karassopss grin got wider more than enough we are tigers you are prey it could be hamnet thyssen said that startled the warrior from beyond the glacier hamnet went on we can build tiger traps though would you be here if we couldnt you would be trying to squeeze answers out of me instead you got lucky this time karassops said hamnet thyssen feared he was right but didnt say so karassops added how long do you think you can go on being lucky how long do you think it will be before the bizogots join together and hurl you out through the gap hamnet returned the warrior from the rulers laughed in his face shrugging count hamnet got to his feet startled again karassops asked arent you going to kill me hamnet thought of parsh after he lost the standdown with trasamund he had killed himself to efface the shame of losing to a foreigner to someone who didnt belong to the rulers the raumsdalian noble grinned too as unpleasantly as he could live he said live with knowing how you failed what worse thing could we do to you live long and brood on what you should have done that struck home where nothing else had the rulers might disdain physical torment but hamnet knew hed found a vulnerable spot even so karassops yammered at him in his own harsh guttural language hamnet didnt understand him but knew rage and fear when he heard them you dont deserve to use that tongue any more do you hamnet said sweetly he thought he was only mocking the warrior but karassops took him literally the captive bit down hard he groaned in agony then spat something pink and red into the snow blood poured out of his mouth he gulped frantically swallowing more so he wouldnt drown you idiot hamnet thyssen cried you could bandage and close off a gash on an arm or a leg maybe in the neck maybe even if you were very lucky in the chest or belly but on the tongue how count hamnet stared helplessly as karassopss face went gray the warrior slumped over his eyes sagged shut in a few minutes hed bled to death ulric skakki eyed the corpse and the chunk of meat next to it i dont think i could make myself do that he said shaking his head why did he after hamnet explained ulric shook his head if youd just told him to watch his tongue hed still be here who knows hamnet pointed to the severed organ he died watching it heh ulric skakki said either i laugh or i heave and you were the one who said to go easy on the rulers wed caught i thought i was hamnet thyssen answered i didnt mean for him to do that his stomach wanted to turn over too hed never been seasick but this helpless nausea had to come close to that feeling well were rid of him now ulric said was that callousness practicality or most likely both at once the adventurer went on if he was the kind who would do something like that he was the kind who would have caused us all sorts of trouble meanwhile we can take the prisoners we do have and head on down to the red dire wolves theyll prove the invasion is real and theyll make totila get off his backside and fight the rulers that was pure practicality count hamnet found himself nodding good enough and wed better use auduns magic to cover our tracks again or well have lancers on mammoths right behind us they wont be so easy to surprise twice i wasnt sure we could surprise them once ulric skakki said but it turns out they can be overconfident fools just like anybody else thats good news of a sort huzzah hamnet said and ulric laughed but it was worth remembering the rulers were powerful and dangerous but they were also human they made mistakes they could be made to make mistakes so could trasamund he was wild to storm to the attack after his small victory he didnt want to wait and gather strength before hitting back he didnt want to listen to count hamnet either then liv said your ferocity this is bigger than the three tusk clan nothing is bigger than the clan nothing the jarl shouted the bizogot folk is the empire is all the lands on this side of the glacier are liv said hamnet does not tell you not to fight back he tells you to pick your time trasamund snorted he worries more about gudrid and eyvind torfinn and sigvat more than he does about us for better or worsefor better and worsethey are my folk so are the rest of the raumsdalians hamnet thyssen said steadily no matter what sigvat thinks theyll join this fight before too long theyll have to so you say the bizogot rumbled after a moment though he gave a grudging nod to the red dire wolves then we will pick our moment he made it sound like picking his nose but when he said the fight goes on liv and hamnet thyssen both nodded with him
