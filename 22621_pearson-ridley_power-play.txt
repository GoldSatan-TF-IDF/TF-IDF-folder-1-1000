ridley pearson power play the fourth book in the kingdom keepers series for my daughters storey and paige and my wonderful readersyou make it magical lets get lost finn said to the two girls disneyquest was a maze a place where it was difficult to know where you were an electronic funhouse filled with virtual rides video games and interactive attractions the enormous building in walt disney worlds downtown disney consisted of five floors subdivided into virtual worlds and activities all interconnected in a way that seemed designed to disorient finn whitman actually was currently losthe couldnt quite figure out where he was or how to get out of therebut his suggestion to get lost stemmed from his spotting greg lousy luowski at the other end of the gaming room over near the guitar hero consoles luowski was the ninthgrade bully roughly the size of a kitchen appliance the zitfaced fingernailchewing luowski had it out for finn and finn knew enough to stay clear of trouble at least avoidable trouble over the past few years trouble had defined him had followed him as he and his four friendsnow known as the kingdom keepershad gained notoriety for their efforts to save disney world from the overtakers a group of fanatical disney villain characters within the parks bent on taking over and stealing the magic guys like luowski didnt appreciate sharing the spotlight with anyone and at the moment finn was roughly a million times more popular than luowski how about the simulators in cyberspace mountain charlene said charlene was to beautiful what mount everest was to high a cheerleader and phenomenal athlete she was the poster child for the kingdom keepers her facebook page had more friends than ashton kutcherswell not really but close enough boys liked her girls liked her teachers liked her parents liked her it was enough to make you hate her but no one could she was too ridiculously charlene to ever have an ill thought aimed at her finn considered the suggestion and glanced over to amanda to get her read amanda was a different kind of pretty mysterious her looks often changing from slightly asian to polynesian or caribbean amanda was not officially one of the five kingdom keepers but she and her sister jess had unique qualities and unusual abilities that made them important to the team amanda and jess had once been part of a group of foster kids called the fairliesas in fairly human kids who could bend spoons just by staring at them or hear clearly at absurd distances hold their breath underwater for ten minutes at a time light fires by concentrating dream the future see the past kids labeled freaks and weirdos kids once studied by the military but dismissed to a special home in baltimore when scientists failed to duplicate or explain what was termed their controlled phenomena currently amanda and jess lived in an orlando foster home for wayward girls run by the ironhanded mrs nash despite sharing not only the same address but also the same bunk room they now attended different high schools jess had qualified for an ap program and went to edgewater high along with two of the kingdom keepers willa and philby amanda had come to disneyquest this evening because the event was a schoolsanctioned function shed brought jess as her one allowed guest to finn it seemed like the entire ninth grade of winter park high was there finn liked amanda which roughly translated to he couldnt stop thinking about her was often tonguetied when trying to talk to her and made a fool out of himself when trying to come off as cool there was a friction that existed between amanda and charlene that he knew had something to do with him but which he didnt like to think about in general he didnt like to think about girls all that much but he couldnt seem to help himself okay he said i guess finn didnt like roller coastersactually was terrified of thembut wasnt about to admit it the other three keepers were also in disneyquest somewhere as was jess even though only finn and amanda attended winter park it had been months since the whole group had done anything fun together their last outing to disneys hollywood studios fantasmic had led to an encounter with the overtakers that nearly got finn killed the idea tonight had been to meet here and stick together but theyd separated by ride and interestphilby and willa had gone to the ground floor to battle pirate ships while maybeck and jess had gone to the bumper cars charlene had taken off to the bathroom a few minutes earlier and finn had considered ditching her in favor of being alone with amanda but it had only been a passing thought and one he didnt fully understand he liked charlene a lot but not in the same incomprehensible way he liked amanda luowski spotted finn and made a face like a football player whod taken a knee in the wrong place finn didnt want to get drawn into that come on lets go he said as charlene returned the three took the stairs to the second floor and charlene led them to cyberspace mountain the ride was a virtual roller coaster that allowed visitors to pick preexisting twists and turns or to design their own there were five levels of challenge from easy to terrifying ill take mine lite finn said me too said amanda i get sick on roller coasters we should go together finn said confessing because im basically a chicken oh right said charlene you a chicken i dont think so seriously the barnstormer is about as tough as i can take both girls laughed then they exchanged looks that had they been taser shots would have dropped each other to the ground bill nye the science guy tutored charlene as she scrolled through selections to create a wildly scary roller coaster for herself maybe she was trying to make a point to amanda maybe she just loved roller coasters but it had enough loops and jumps to make an astronaut puke she used her entrance ticket to store it then she quickly worked with bill nye to make another very basic ride she saved it onto finns ticket i love it as scary as it gets she said looking directly at amanda its awesome they headed for the short line of people that waited for the next simulator charlene was bumped into by someone so hard that had she not possessed the grace of a dancer she would have fallen to the floor greg luowski she dropped the two tickets in the process in a surprisingly polite gesture luowski asked if she was okay and collected the tickets and returned them to her finn caught this look in luowskis eyesthe jerk liked charlene his bumping into her had been no accident lay off luowski finn said amanda took finn by the arm lay off what whitless my bad for the knockdown cant i help her up he faced charlene i really am sorry no problem she said but finn was still seething as in we dont want any problems she said this slowly making sure finn heard every word ill be around whitless if you want me you can find me try some deodorant luowski charlene cupped her mouth hiding her smile luowski didnt just smell like a jock he smelled like an entire team that had been working out in the summer heat for five hours he smelled like a guy who hadnt showered since sixth grade or maybe ill find you he growled at finn im not worried finn said ill smell you coming the line moved finn and the girls were shown up the stairs the simulators were designed for a maximum of two people charlene lined up in front of door finn and amanda door no holding hands you two if you get scared charlene called down to them finn faked a grin he was scared already a cast member wearing a name tag that said megan accepted finns card from him and chose the only predesigned ride it contained the door opened and finn and amanda were escorted into the simulator chamber they climbed down into the padded seats of the red metal capsule the seats faced a large flatpanel screen megan directed them to stow anything loose in their pockets that was when finn started to worry she then pointed out the two red stop emergency buttons one for each rider finns stomach turned he didnt like the idea of taking a ride that needed panic buttons he pulled down the black padded chest brace as directed amanda did the same megan doublechecked everything youre good to go she said she hit a button and the simulators lid closed slowly locking in place the only light came from the flatpanel display where the rides parallel tracks stretched out in front of them this was a stupid idea he mumbled youre telling me amanda said but did you see the course charlene created for herself no way i would go on that thing in a million years she wanted to impress you thats ridiculous trust me she picked the scariest stuff possible it would terrify the guy who designed it but shes going to come out of there and tell us she loved it he wanted to disagree but thought she was probably right the lights dimmed the ride began if i scream finn said its just to make it feel all the more real she laughed but not for long her amusement was cut short as the roller coaster car began to move forward on the tracks in front of them a light flashed in their eyes sound effects roared from unseen speakers and the car banked sharply left finn clutched the safety harness and shut his eyes i hate this already he said the capsule banked left did a complete flip in that direction and then lifted into a double loop dumping them upside down twice in a row amandas hair fell like a curtain finn squinted open his eyes the track dropped straight down about a thousand feet they plummeted down like on the tower of terror finn screamed a word that would have gotten him grounded for a week if his mother had heard it it just flew out of him thisisnotright amanda cried they reached bottom leaving finns stomach somewhere at his feet he reswallowed his dinner the car shot up like a nasa rocket launch he screamed the same word again shetrickedus amanda hollered then she screamed at a pitch so high it should have shattered the flatpanel display puke alert finn gagged out as they entered a triple loop please no amanda said try shutting your eyes only makes it worse he choked out tell me this thing cant actually crash she released another shriek at a volume that might have been heard in miami it cant actually crash he said though he wasnt so sure what if the simulator was put through stuff it wasnt designed to handle he wondered what if its bearings froze or its motor overheated the thing was even charlenes ride as crazy as shed made it hadnt seemed this bad had she tricked them in order to sabotage amanda that was the first time he realized that maybe charlene wasnt the only one involved a ride this violent carried the fingerprints of the overtakers finn remembered megan telling them about the panic buttons he reached down to punch the red emergency stop button just as he did the car lurched left and he leaned so sharply in that direction that his hand missed the button did you see that he hollered i think it knew i was trying to stop it youre losing more than your cookies amanda said so this thing can think the car dropped again rose and fell leaned ninety degrees left and stayed there jerked totally upside down and did three more upsidedown loops amanda struggled to reach her stop button but as she did the track dropped away she and finn were thrown forward against their restraints she punched down and hit the red plastic button got it she yelled the ride continued she hit it again they were flipped over seven times to their right like rolling down a steep hill in an oil barrel i swear i pushed it she announced but nothing happened impressive he managed to mutter to himself despite all the craziness no longer thinking it was the work of the overtakers but knowing it wondering how they might have accomplished such a thing and what if anything charlenes role had been in it she had designed the ride after all if it was the ots how had they organized any kind of attack given that their two leaders maleficent and chernabog were currently locked up somewhere in a disney holding facility the kingdom keepers mentor and designer wayne kresky had believed that with the head cut off the snake the body cannot survive but someone had clearly taken over leadership of the overtakers the ride going out of control could not be considered coincidence the keepers were under attack finn reached down able to press his stop button nothing itsthemisnt it amanda was no dummy shed figured it out on her own yeah he said its them by now megan knows he gritted his teeth as the track lifted and fell so hard and so many times in a row that his neck hurtsomething is wrong shes working to fix it youre dreaming probably but at this point shes our only hope outside the simulator bay megan was in fact hitting every switch and button possible the systems mechanicals included a warninglight display used to alert cast members to potential simulator hardware failure a single light that ran a solid green amber or red it was currently flashing reda warning level never seen before and one that attracted the concern and attention of three other cast members including the ride manager its going to come off the gyros the manager shouted like a wheel coming off a bike the thing is going to basically explode if we dont stop it he too hit every known control trying to stop the ride what the heck he asked megan as if it were her fault the power she said call down and tell them to cut off the power its coming apart finn yelled on the screen the parallel tracks rushed toward them at impossible speeds reflecting the velocity of their virtual roller coaster car finn could barely look at itanother five loops coming up then a series of left corkscrews and what appeared to be the edge of a cliffanother of the thousandfoot drops it was no longer the pattern of the animated tracks that frightened him but the sounds of grinding metal and the way the seats in the simulator were no longer level but leaning heavily left it was being made to do things it was not designed to do its parts were failingthe bushings the bearings servos and gyros it was like a car going down the side of a mountain with no steering and two of its wheels loose it was going to crash how could they know where we are amanda cried out how is that possible finn didnt answer he knew that when it came to the overtakers anything was possible we have to stop it he said looking for options he shoved his back against the seat and tried to slip out of the chest restraint it was the same kind of restraint used on real roller coastersa padded pipe that pulled down over your head there was some slack in the way it fit he got about halfway out before getting stuck youre going to crush yourself she said the simulator spun sideways and rotated forward in full circles seven times finn felt his dinner coming up again each time he took his eyes off the screen he felt sick he tried to focus on the screen the way his father had told him to focus on the horizon when seasick the nausea passed he was okay they fell hundreds of feet facedown finn squeezed back into his seat unable to free himself wehavetodosomething he said im up for suggestions she answered oddly amanda sounded suddenly collected and unaffected by the flips and twirls and drops she could actually string a sentence together then it struck him amanda had a unique power pushitopen finn shouted over the roar of the simulators disintegrating parts amanda flashed him a look her dark hair hanging fully upside down her cheeks vibrating like jello her eyes strained to find the hatch door that megan had closed electronically neither of them knew exactly what was up or down any longer its too strong i heard it lock she said so had he but what choice did they have youhavetotry if the seal broke maybe it would initiate an automatic shutdown could be dangerous she said for me amanda was thinking how would they explain the damage to the simulator damage that would come from the inside so far in her life her giftas some called ithad only gotten her in trouble or made her the object of teasing subjugated at the age of eight to a foster home for freaks in baltimorethe fairliesshed been studied by scientists doctors and soldiers until shed had no choice but to run away with jess she had no urgent desire to make a scene with her gift and bring all that down on herself again they jerked violently left right front back and left again finns head felt as if it was going to come off his neck dangerous he wanted to say really amanda couldnt risk finns getting hurt she released her bloodless grip on the chest restraint reaching toward the screen with outstretched arms finn watched her close her eyes bend her elbows and flatten her hands palms facing out like a traffic cops she pushed up over her headall at once and with every ounce of strength she possessed the metal bulged like it had been hit with a battering ram red paint flakes rained down sparks flew again he hollered too strong she complained youre all weve got the vibrations climbed toward a climax the push had made the simulator lean even farther to the left the grinding of metal was now louder than the sound effects he smelled electrical smoke they were going to suffocate everything youve got he shouted the act of pushing drained amanda at low levels she could briefly levitate a person or objectcause them to float for a few seconds using up more of herself she could shove a car a few feet in a parking space or knock a group of peopleor overtakersoff their feet or bend a simulator hatch door finn needed her to give it her all omg she screamed on the screen the track ahead of them rose fell and tilted to the right beforedisappearing it looked as if someone had simply erased the trackit broke off in space below the break was a rock canyon so deep that finn couldnt see the bottom the simulator shuddered the smell of an electrical shortlike the air before a stormcontinued to flood the cabin their screams were lost amid the groan and complaint of the failing mechanics the car reached the end of the track and flew off into space amanda thrust her arms toward the overhead door but this time like she was lifting an incredibly heavy set of gym weights going for an olympic record steady finn shouted as the car tilted down now plummeting into the depths of the rock canyon the hatch door rumbled and bent bulged and shuddered the seal cracking open first a fraction of an inch then wider more finn said as the grounda rock bottom like a dry riverbedrushed toward them at over three hundred miles per hour the cry of the metal hatch now overpowered any other sound amandas face was scarlet and sweaty her arm muscles bulging as her bones seemed to bend to breaking the sheet metal tore at the location of both pneumatic hook locks that secured the hatch two inchesthree the lid blew open the ride shut down smoke coiled from motors and servos a group of cast members rushed inside aiming fire extinguishers that belched a yellow foam finn and amanda hung against the chest restraints as the simulator rotated forward ninety degrees facing the ground it made it hard to see what was going on some guy was shouting a bunch of orders finn heard megan say are you okay were getting you out hang on youre almost out the chest restraints released without notice finn and amanda fell crashing into the flatpanel display and cracking its safety glass finn helped amanda up and megan offered them her hand they climbed out wow finn said thats incredibly lifelike amanda played along must be expensive if they do that every time they exited from the smoke and chaos charlene stood there her full attention on their joined hands finn hadnt even realized that he and amanda were holding hands he let go a little abruptly charlene leaned in to examine the twisted wreckage smoke and steam and the gas from the fire extinguishers commingled she fanned it away from her face what happened in there she asked amanda said i think next time ill design my own ride you dont think i had something to do with thatthat charlene stammered with whatever happened in there do you you mean just because you talked us into coming here in the first place and you designed our roller coaster now why would i think that amanda said finn charlene pleaded you gave us the card charlie he said using a nickname for her only he used you designed the ride and maleficents locked in a jail cell he felt like adding use of her nickname was an attempt at intimacy to remind her that he still considered her a close friend despite what had happened but it backfired amanda heard him and clearly resented it really amanda said to him youre going to sweettalk her after she almost killed us she stormed off down the exit stairs amanda wait finn called after her i promise you charlene said i didnt do anything i had nothing to do with this it wasnt me theyd been close friends for more than two years finn said listen do i want to think you sabotaged the simulator come on but shed designed the ride he reminded himself finn couldnt let amanda get away he hurried out after her charlene followed at a run the building seemed more crowded he recognized nearly everyoneeven though there were four hundred kids in his grade kk rules he called back to charlene his team had long since agreed that when in the parks no one flew solo the overtakers took advantage of keepers off on their own in pairs or teams their chances for survival increased finn shoved his way through the crowd catching only fleeting glimpses of the back of amandas head she was wasting no time trying to get out of there she disappeared down the staircasemuch too far ahead to hear him calling after her charlene closed in from behind him he glanced over the rail looking down hoping to catch a glimpse of amanda as she reached the bottom of the stairs his breath caught not possible snow whites evil queen stood amid a torrent of admirers all begging for autographs but the evil queen wasnt looking at her fans she was locked onto finn like a laserguided missile he jumped back from the rail out of the way of her gaze a shudder of terror flooded him if it was a legitimate cast member fine but if it was an overtakerif it was the real evil queenthen she could throw spells conjure curses mix potions to transfigure herself into an ugly old peddler offering a poisoned apple in short she was nothing to mess with amanda he yanked his phone out of his pocket and sent a group text possible ots in dq head bus asap hopefully that would get the others moving presently his job was to get amanda and charlene out of there the four other keepers had smart phones just like hisgifts from wayne and the imagineers amanda and jess didnt have phones even if theyd had the money to buy themand they didntmrs nash didnt allow her girls to have phones charlene caught up to him and he launched himself down the crowded stairwell fighting through the throng as he neared the bottom of the stairs amanda came into view again the queen turned to look at finn he averted his eyes fearing a spell she walked toward him the bubble of her admirers moving with her he stole one more glance in her direction only to realize she wasnt looking at him but over his head he looked behind him at charlene from the step above charlene lowered her eyes to finn and said whats she doing here you know who that is finn asked surprised of course i know who that is ive never seen her before not the real one the real one is that the real one what do you think you feel like giving her the pinch test amanda charlene cried out loudly she waved furiously trying to get amanda to turn around and join them but amanda was too caught up in the reason for her running off in the first place even more furious seeing finn and charlene on the steps together she heaved through the crowd ever closer to the evil queen i texted the others he tried telling charlene but then he saw what she was up to she was taking a photo of the queen charlene mumbled whats she doing outside of the parks technically he said were on disney property he led her down the stairs fighting his way toward amanda charlene followed technically she said calling over his shoulder she belongs in the magic kingdom the afternoon parade some autographing not inside disneyquest maybe its part of our school event finn suggested he wanted an easy explanation he wanted to be told this was a cast member maybe a college student in costume the queen was slowed by her fans amanda had disappeared hopefully into an elevator or down another stairwell to the ground floor where a variety of rides gave way to a long hallway and an exit that passed through the gift shop the evil queen seemed caught up in her popularitya woman pulled in two directions but favoring admiration over purpose finn and the keepers had long since learned that the byproducts of famethe adoring crowds wanting autographs and souvenirs the people invading your space away from the parkswas a different but very real challenge charlene grabbed finns hand he led her through the crowd coming incredibly close to the queen but her fans formed a wall and they passed by as quickly as theyd arrived he let go of charlenes hand and bounded down the lesscrowded stairway he ran and caught up to amanda turning her by the shoulder wait up he said she spun around her face streaked with the snail lines of fallen tears let go she said i knew it was the ots theyre here his eyes refocused toward the entrance of the hallway that led outside there he said cruella de vil was looking right at them gaunt pale and wearing fur in florida with her trademark cigarette holder in her right hand she too was surrounded by a knot of fans wanting autographs she raised her cigarette holder and pointed with her long gloved finger look kids she said in her creamy voice its the kingdom keepers the mass of fans turned toward finn and amanda just as charlene caught up to them shes rightits themlets go voices echoed off the ceiling and walls a mass of kids abandoned cruella and rushed toward them finn pulled amanda to him protectively amanda said ohno pointing back toward the stairway the evil queen the three of them were sandwiched charlenes attention was on the low ceiling decorated with fishing nets and metal sculpture i can handle this she said stay with me i have an idea she broke away from them just before the fans enveloped finn and amanda finn had learned that the only thing worse than a hyper fan was an angry fan no matter what he didnt want to make any of the kids mad or they would harass and glue themselves to him complaining and shouting and taking an attitude hey how ya doing he said amanda looked curiously at finn wondering what he was starting but he knew what he was doing hed done it plenty of times before offered a pen he started signing forearms hands the back of shirts the crowd pressed in more tightly everyone eager to get an autograph this was what charlene had immediately understood their fans would protect them given the distraction charlene had scrambled up the wall like a tree frog and was currently hanging upside down from the lights attached to the ceiling as she moved so did the human wall surrounding finn and amandathe fans were leaping up and trying to touch her applauding her screaming her name as long as finn and amanda stayed below her the protective wall of fans that encircled them moved with her keeping the evil queen and cruella at a distance the two overtakersthey had to be overtakerswere also trying to push through to finn and amanda but it was no use they werent going to beat out fifty wild fans charlene continued on the ceiling toward the hallway finn and amanda and their fans moved with her as the group reached the hallway the room narrowed charlene dropped finn pushed rudely through that side of kids dragging amanda with him a gloved hand caught his shoulder taller than the young fans the evil queen had reached above their heads and caught him she said you cannot stop us we will do this with or without your help if you run youd better keep running he ran down the hall at a sprint twenty of the screaming kids close behind through the turnstile the gift shop and into fresh air finn had rarely ever run so hard and yet both girls were several paces ahead of him and increasing their leads when a good distance away he dared to look back cruella and the evil queen had made no attempt to run after them if you run youd better keep running instead cruella was heading to apay phone she reached it and brought the receiver to her ear it was the last finn saw of her but it struck him as so out of place so odd despite the fact that cruella used telephones in her movies not pay phones not in downtown disney he arrived at the bus stop out of breath just as a bus was about to pull away the driver braked for him and opened the door and as he climbed on he saw all six of his friends clustered in the back by the door maybeck a head taller than anyone his age caught finns eye and nodded clearly relieved to see hed made it a telephone finn was thinking philby contained his surprise when a popup window appeared on his lab computer a brighteyed sixteenyearold with reddish hair and freckles philby was a geek in disguise he looked perfectly normal but his british upbringing and slight accent along with having a brain like einstein set him apart from other kids edgewater highs computer lab security software blocked popups prevented cookies and limited web access while simultaneously recording keystrokes it was like working in the offices of the cia or the nsa the lab had five long countertops with chairs and eight laptop stations each currently thirtyone students all faced forward where their instructor mr chambers was stationed to the left of a large interactive whiteboard mounted to the wall behind him the whiteboard could carry anything from a mirror of one of the computers to a powerpoint presentation or video the instructor monitored software that showed a realtime thumbnail of each computer screen active in the lab mr chambers could click on any one of these at any time seeing exactly what a particular student was doing chats were forbidden as were aimlessly browsing the web downloads or entertainment the popup on philbys screen displayed an invitation to a video chat technically because of the security software and firewall a popup was impossible which only made it all the more intriguing to him despite his computer expertise philby had never been able to hack the schools firewallbut not for want of trying making matters worse philby and his fellow students had all signed ethics contracts making it their responsibility to report any breaches or misuse of the system by not raising his hand the moment the popup appeared on his screen philby had already violated that contract it didnt escape him that mr chambers could easily be watching his screen could already know about the popup himself if caught in violation of the contract philby would be suspended from lab for a week possibly expelled from the class for the semester it called for diversionary tactics nothing new to philby and his friends who had long since established a system to distract mr chambers away from his monitoring software philby caught the eye of hugo montcliff a neighborhood friend with droopy eyes greasy hair and shirts that carried unidentifiable food stains hugos father was a harddrinking former policeman who couldnt hold a job hugo occasionally sneaked out at night because he couldnt take the screaming between his parents some nights hed show up at philbys house and sleep on the couch philbys mom had come to think of him as a kind of adopted son and philby considered him the closest thing hed ever have to a brother philby signaled hugo by tapping the desk twice and then pointing to his screen hugo nodded philby then turned his attention to mr chambers knowing hugo would open a drawing program when he was supposed to be creating a powerpoint as mr chambers reached for his computer mouse suggesting hed spotted hugos divergence from the assignment and would therefore briefly only be monitoring hugos activities philby made his move already wearing a headset for the sake of his own powerpoint assignment philby accepted the invitation to the online video chat the popup window grew in size and a fuzzy video image appeared philby brought his fist to his mouth to muffle his own gasp although difficult to see clearly the white hair and cool blue eyes revealed the identity of the caller wayne the keepers had neither seen nor heard from wayne in several monthsnot since his hospitalization following the fantasmic adventure he was believed to be in hiding keeping himself out of the hands of the overtakers who would use any means necessaryincluding tortureto obtain the topsecret location of their captured leaders maleficent and chernabog or possibly to obtain other secret information that the creator of the kingdom keepers possessed are you secure the old mans voice was steady but troubled even as heard over the staticridden poor connection not exactly but im okay for a couple minutes philby whispered wayne knew more about the behindthescenes operations at the parks than any other disney imagineer he had helped to create a new hologram technology had recruited finn philby and the others to model for what would become hologram guides in the parksdaylight hologram imaging or dhi the new holograms were an instant success families could be toured through the parks by a talking teenage guide who was nothing but light yet looked and sounded absolutely real park attendance jumped tourists traveled from around the world to see the new disney phenomenon but wayne and his imagineering colleagues had advanced the dhi technology so the five students whod modeled for them could also cross over into the parks as holograms when they went to sleep at night once in the parks the dhis could spy for the imagineers or battle the overtakers for control of the parks a call from wayne could not be taken lightly philby had so many questions he wanted to ask how had wayne managed to breach the schools computer security why would he risk contacting philby in this manner when had wayne gotten out of the hospital where was he now did his call have anything to do with maleficent or chernabog but time was precious he kept his mouth shut and listened as you know these are dangerous times wayne said dangerous times require risk taking my daughter wanda whom youve met has been my eyes and ears of late she has been extremely busy carrying on my workour work but something has happened she has been jailed by the police philby wanted to cry out but he held his tongue wanda arrested i need finn to offer bail for her release this will require an adult and we know mrs whitman to besupportiveof our cause wanda knows things that you five must know must act upon quickly the evil queen philby was thinking cruella de vil its happening again tonight the five of you must be in norways stave church at eight pm not your dhis but your real selves a picture is worth a thousand words i have so many questions prepare for remote access to the server you may need it wayne said philby knew this was a call to battle since maleficent and chernabog were imprisoned by disney waynes concern suggested that the overtakers had reorganized but if wayne was risking breaching the schools computer security it implied something else as well you believe theyre monitoring our home computers philby said guessing you see why i contacted you you understand the bigger picture finn is the natural leader but you philby are the navigator steer finn in the right direction and he will lead you well the overtakers were spying on them it gave him the chills hed been iming with willa on a regular basis writing stuff he didnt necessarily want anyone else seeing never underestimate their capabilities wayne said we all have learned that lesson too many times where are you philby blurted out are you all right wayne looked old and tired he must be worried sick about wanda philby thought unimportant do as i say do what i ask good luck were all counting on you the window went black the connection lost mr philby it was mr chambers from the front of the class he was not in a charitable mood philby slipped off the headset expecting suspension and possible detention no videos you know the assignment voice is okay no video philby realized that mr chambers so trusted the schools firewall that he couldnt for a moment believe that anyone had managed to breach it he must have assumed that the video on philbys screen was something philby had created sorry mr chambers philby and hugo met eyes and philby thanked him with a quick nod of his head hugo smiled and went back to work he could see the curiosity on hugos facehe wanted to know what had required the diversion philby would have to invent a pretty convincing story hugo was not easily fooled philbys heart raced wayne wanda the stave church the overtakers were reorganized still out there for the past several months he and his friends had not worried about such things theyd actually had lives again but now in a few short minutes all of that had changed again philby compartmentalized his ideas his mind worked like a filing cabinet he held ideas in drawers opening one or two while closing others he didnt think about it it just happened once he had hung up from the chat with wayne he put all those ideas into a drawer and slid it shut marking it as urgent hed been able to go about his classwork but now while other kids occupied the time between classes with hallway chitchat philby concentrated on the contents of that mental filing drawer he made a list of what had to be done and in what order with an emphasis on efficiency first he would text finn about wanda next he would send a group text to all the keepers about meeting at the stave church at eight pm then once home he would take his laptop over to hugos house to get off his home network where the overtakers might be monitoring him he would access the dhi server remotely and lock it down making sure there was no chance that the keepers might cross over unexpectedly after going to sleep crossing over was not the danger it was getting stuck as a dhi failing to come back what the keepers called the return philby spotted willa up the hallway in that instant he became just another ninth grader with a crush she was standing at her locker one hand on its metal door the other at her side while staring into space he suddenly tensed his legs felt like lead he recalled the exact day this change in his attitude toward her had occurred theyd been sitting at a table at the marble slab with the other keepers when hed been overcome with a feeling of curiosity it was something he still didnt understand but what it amounted to was he wanted to be around her to know more about her to spend time with her she was smart funny and thoughtful maybe not dropdead pretty like charlene or the brooding kind of beauty like amanda but interestinglooking intriguing more important to him was that they thought the same way often came to the same conclusions without any kind of communication like they were connected hi there he said reaching her locker you ever know youre looking right at something but cant see it at the moment willa was looking right at him yeah i suppose my sheet music is in here somewhere one thing on which they differed she kept her locker a mess his was neatly ordered he studied her locker carefully reached in and withdrew the sheet music her eyes filled with appreciation youre awesome she said he wanted to hear her say it again wayne just videochatted me in the lab he told her yeah right im not kidding the locker door slammed into place and she locked it philby could sense both willas apprehension as well as her misgivings he could see her think she had an intensity that he totally got but thats not possible she said i know isnt it cool it had to be some kind of trick the schools firewall was breached wayne breached it spencer randolph was staring at them from across the hall a gifted athlete and popular tenth grader spencer always seemed to be hanging around willa dont look now philby said trying to make it sound like he didnt care but spence cant take his eyes off you he always does that willa blushed philby didnt like seeing her blush over spencer randolph she looked back at philby why would he do that philby felt confused because youre smart because youre a willa kind of pretty he probably wants to go out with you he said wayne stupid she said not spence i know all about spence you do how had he let that slip why would wayne go to all that trouble just to get a message to you thats the thing he whispered he said it had to be here at the school that it couldnt be at my home or finns or any of ours because he thinks the ots are monitoring our home computers what but wei mean you and me willa stammered yeah i know we have to stay off our computers and no crossing over who knows what theyre planning just when i was starting to feel normal again yeah i was thinking the exact same thing he added normal if you overlook that when we go to sleep we wake up in the parks as our holograms weve all been overlooking that for a couple of years now i dont even think about it you know its justa part of me willa added we need to tell amanda and jess as well the keepers had applied the hologram technology to amanda and jess months earlier philby could remotely cross them over as dhis as well but this meant they were now at risk along with the other keepers it didnt seem exactly fair yeah theyll need to know philby told her about the stave church at eight pm he left out the part about wanda for now he wanted finn to deal with that as wayne had asked im going to text the others not im we have to assume that whatever we do online from home could be monitored thats way creepy willa said yeah but what about texting probably safer than anything on the internet i dont see the ots hacking verizon no thats true the hallway bell rang signaling another class for both of them spencer had not gone away the longer he stared the more philby felt like kissing willa right there in the hall for everyone to see not that he would ever do it he shook his head and coughed out disgust at himself what she asked you wouldnt understand philby wounded her by saying that hadnt meant to he longed for a rewind button another chance to say something different but willa was already on her way down the hall her back to him spencer peeled himself off the wall and came up alongside of her and willas step seemed a little lighter philby stood there watching sick to his stomach what are you doing here finn blurted out as he climbed atop his bmx bike it wasnt just any bike but a trick bike capable of doing stunts and jumps being on the bike gave him a height advantage over charlene which he appreciated you dont have to sound so pleased she said sarcastically i didnt meanits just that evans high happens to be playing your school in soccer today said charlene i didnt think soccer had cheerleaders am i dressed like a cheerleader in fact she wore tight jean shorts and an equally tight tshirt where are you headed charlene asked im going to see wanda i kind of figured that mind if i hitch a ride the bike was small finn had ridden with amanda beforeon the seat behind him while he stayed up on the pedalsbut it felt a little weird to offer the same thing to charlene i dont bite she said when he hesitated no problem finn said glancing around in the mass of kids hoping amanda wasnt among them finn climbed off helped charlene on and then straddled the bar he rode away quickly the message from philby had injected a sense of panic in him wayne wanda the police he pedaled hard were meeting my mom only adults can bail someone out of jail finn said and your mom agreed well see you havent asked her not exactly he changed subjects you got philbys text about tonight yes charlene said do you know what its about only that wayne told us we had to be there at eight why no idea what do you think he wants its got to be important finn answered do you know what he told philby exactly why all the questions finn asked charlene never asked so many questions she was more of a tell me what to do and ill do it person i dont know curious i guess am i asking a lot of questions yes maybe im nervous she said i talk a lot when im nervous she put her hands on finns hips to steady herself on the seat now he was nervous too he kept glancing back worried that amanda would see them despite the fact he was now several blocks from school were not supposed to use our computers at home he said yeah i got that she said hey how come wayne contacted philby instead of you another question i dont know i dont have computer lab the way he does i suppose that could be it but it bothered him much more than he let on wayne referred to him as the leader wayne usually contacted him not philby was his leadership role of the keepers in jeopardy had he done something wrong what do you think it all means she asked wayne contacting philby wanda getting arrested i thought with maleficent and chernabog locked up this stuff wasnt supposed to happen it wasnt he said so so i guess things never go as planned finns mother was an actual rocket scientist shed eventually left nasa to raise finn and his sister the dual commitment proving to be too much but she remained the smartest woman hed ever met and the fairest whereas his father got angry and upset about finns escapades as a kingdom keeper his mother a huge fan of everything disney supported waynes effort to keep the magic alive in the parks what was to finns father a silly ambition fraught with physical danger and risk was to his mother on the level of national importance because of this he had recently opened up to her more sharing the challenges the keepers faced sometimes even asking for her help this was one of those times mrs whitman currently a brunette was thin happyfaced and athletic she hardly wore any makeup her shoes were what she called practical and her earrings artistic bailing someone out requires money she said from the other side of the kitchen counter finn and charlene were both eating bowls of breakfast cereal i know that im sure wayne will pay you back and a bail bondsman you put up a small amount and the bail bondsman promises the rest its complicated if the person misses her appearance in court then the bail bondsman loses his money and in this case we would have to repay him she wont miss anything finn said please mom it would mean taking money out of our savings your father would never approve of such a thing but if wayne repays you its only gone for a day or two right if he repays me yes but youve no way to reach him correct finn hung his head shamefully yeah in two weeks the bank statements will arrive by that time we have to have the money back in the account does that mean youre going to do it finn didnt even try to contain his excitement not a word to your father she said the sign out front read city of orlando police headquarters it was a normallooking office highrise finn charlene and mrs whitman checked in at a lobby reception desk and rode the elevator it was not the dismal smelly dimly lit space that finn anticipated from television but instead more a combination of post office and doctors office there were some decent chairs to sit in copies of newspapers and magazines the overhead lighting was bright the smell not nearly as bad as hed expected a man in uniform sat behind a window of thick glass he looked pleasant enough finns mother spoke to him for several minutes she handed him stuff from the bail bondsman filled out something on a clipboard showed her drivers license it reminded finn of her returning shoes at nordstrom or paying for an oil change we cant get her out tonight mrs whitman reported to charlene and her son some problem with the courts i can return tomorrow morning tuesday at the latest she has to stay here finn said thats terrible shes going to make bail his mother said its just delayed a little but were allowed to see her finn felt a huge weight lift yes he said fistpumping you are totally awesome if mrs whitman could have floated off the floor she might have come on what are you waiting for the three had gone through security to enter the building but they were put through it again before entering the jail the room they were shown to was plain it looked like a very small version of their school lunchroom with six green plastic picnic tables bolted to the floor overhead tube lighting and lots of acoustic tile wanda looked older than finn remembered she wore an orange jumpsuit with orlando city jail written across the front her hair was stringy shed been crying finn his mother and charlene sat on the bench facing her a guard stood just outside the door so how are you finn asked wanda smirked her twisted smile telling him more than he wanted to know been better she said weve posted bail mrs whitman said tomorrow sometime im told thank you so much but i wouldnt count on it ive been told by the attorney they appointed that they may try for homeland security charges thats probably why the delay what did you do charlene asked wanda lowered her voice my father has me monitor bandwidth usage on the dhi server the same way philby sometimes does finn nodded if bandwidth usage surged it meant extremely large data packs were moving in and out of the dhi servers that in turn meant someone was crossing over or returning wayne watched for unusual or unexpected bandwidth usage as a warning sign of possible overtaker interference wanda said there has been some unusual activity data surges late late at night a spike at one point from the animal kingdom server others as well we knew something was going on we just didnt know what so i hacked one of disneys multi protocol routers if the internet is the information superhighway i hacked a major intersection a truck stop thats probably why the homeland security charges its kind of like hacking google or microsoft but you work for disney finn said that just makes matters worse i look like a disgruntled employee oh my said mrs whitman i came away with more questions than answers what seemed to be happening couldnt possibly be happening i needed more data more time to drill deeper that was when i was arrested in the middle of all that it was only then i realized that id probably been set up that id walked into a trap she looked each of them in the eye making sure they understood the earnestness of what she was about to tell them our friends she said meaning the overtakers who werent their friends at all knew that if they made enough noise on the dhi servers it would attract our interest mine philbys someones they could then alert the authorities who would follow the data mining back to its source and arrest whoever was messing aroundin this case me that would then mean that id need to be bailed out and who would bail me out wayne finn answered wait a second are you saying it was all a way to make wayne show himself to draw him out wanda said nodding thats my guess a fathers first instinct is to save his children my dad nearly came here if he had hed never have made it through the doors theyd have had him out front im sure of it so he contacted philby in order to not come here in person finn said i made him promise not to come wanda said was the internet stuff you turned up for real charlene asked we wont know without more tests she answered more investigation do you know where your father is charlene asked more questions finn thought he said thats none of our business it is if the police are going to torture her or something charlene said dont be ridiculous charlene mrs whitman said that kind of thing only happens in movies wanda and finn exchanged a questioning look weve got to get you out of here mrs whitman said as the bus from the transportation center rolled into epcot finn spotted a pair of crashtest dummiesctdson segways patrolling the parking lot and pointed them out to jess moving her dark hair off her face to get a better view jesss features reflected off the bus window she had a teardrop chin with full lips and wideset eyes she changed her hair colorwhich had turned horsetail white after an encounter with maleficentseveral times a year she pointed out the segways to amanda the overhead monorail line divided the enormous parking lots the lane beneath it was used for the parking lot shuttles and as a pedestrian walkway leading to the parks front gates a fun distraction for park visitors the ctdsonsegways were known to the keepers as possible soldiers for the overtakers some were nothing more than cast members in ctd suits acting out a part but others were robotic drones armed with hightech detection and surveillance equipment outfitted with bluetooth and wifi originally these had been introduced to epcot by securityan effective and inexpensive way to patrol the parks during regular hours and after closing their popularity had led to the cast member varietyctds that would talk and interact with the visitors but somewhere along the line the overtakers had managed to electronically hijack control of at least a half dozen of the robotic variety seeing them now so close put finn on guard well if theyre looking for you theyll never spot you amanda said not with you looking like that they wont said jess finn wore an orlando magic jersey with a heavy chain around his neck a yankee cap sideways on his head and mirrored sunglasses his shorts went below his knees and he wore basketball shoes with nike socks there were probably a few hundred boys just like him in the park at this very minute you look sooooo stupid amanda said prompting a laugh from her and jess good finn said it was true he looked like an idiot but that was the point if he happened to be recognized in the park as a kingdom keeper hed be hounded for autographs if he was hounded for autographs hed win the attention of security if security caught him or any of the keepers in the park without approval his family could lose their golden mickey passor worseoperations management could bring the hammer down it was one thing to attend a school function in downtown disney but something else entirely to be in epcot without asking permission operations management did not want park visitors seeing both the dhi hologram guides and the reallife models for the dhis in the same park at the same time finn and the four others were under contract not to visit any of the parks without prior approvalapproval they currently lacked plus youre hanging out with two gorgeous girls said jess striking a pose so we know who everyone will be looking at jess was typically more modest than this the comment from her drew a shrill laugh from amanda they seemed to be having more fun than he was we need to keep our eyes on them finn warned seriously okay we get it amanda said hed ruined the moment he wanted to kick himself entering epcot they passed beneath spaceship earthwhich looked like an elevated giant golf ballreaching the fountain plaza where a computercontrolled water show ran it could mesmerize visitors for hours at a time pavilions rose on both sides the land the seas with nemo friends test track beyond the plaza was the fifteenacre lake surrounded by the world showcase pavilions each representing a different country and duplicating its most famous architecture the eiffel tower in france a mayan temple in mexico the autumn food and wine festival was under way special booths offered food and drink the mood was even more festive than usual the place was packed at a few minutes before eight pm the sun set the illuminations reflections of earth show would take over the lakeand the entire parkbefore long there was a buzz in the air for finn the buzz felt more like fear seeing wanda locked up had upset him the idea that the overtakers had tried to trick wayne out into the open worried him they were planning again they were up to something with wayne in hiding and wanda in jail it fell onto him and the keepers to figure out what was going on and to stop whatever was planned the only timetable was right now finn amanda and jess arrived at norways stave church just behind philby and willa the steeple on the dark brown wooden church rose forty feet in the air while the interior space was quite small a closeted museumlike space the walls were dark wood the ceiling vaulted the five displays depicted various scenes or famous people from norways colorful history there were descriptive plaques alongside each the three girls drew together in the far corner and immediately began talking the way girls do finn and philby were left alone philby reviewed everything he could recall about the video from wayne finn detailed the visit with wanda a trick philby asked thats what she thinks makes sense yes it does finn agreed i wish shed told you more about the data bursts i knew you were going to say that finn said you are so predictable its what i do philby said unapologetically what could it mean philby shrugged all sorts of things but its kind of random that shed hack a bank of disney routers thats like hacking the streetlights at an intersection no wonder shes in trouble he mulled it over whats interesting i suppose is why shed bother in the first place those big routersi suppose if you wanted to determine where the packets were headedthe firewall logs might be all youd need finn lost him for a minute while philby was doing the math in his head listen theres one other thing before she gets here finn said charlene philby said naming the only girl not there yet yeah i know this doesnt make any sense but she designed our ride she gave us the card do you know what youre saying yes of course i do and look was it her alone no but thats even more disturbing and today she just materialized at school said shed ridden over with the evans soccer team shes been asking all these crazy questions this is charlene were talking about i know finn said thats what got me since when does she ask a dozen questions in a row since never but she did today she was like sherlock holmes or something you cant accuse her not without evidence it isnt fair we just dont do that i know finn said i get that but i wanted you to know only you so i should keep an eye on charlene thats all im saying yeah finn added reluctantly not that i like it no its ugly speaking of ugly he told philby about his seeing cruella de vil on the phone outside disney quest and how out of place it seemed this is beginning to feel like a parallel universe philby said right finn said philby reached out and touched finns shoulder just making sure were not holograms he said both boys laughed a father and son entered the son was carrying a kim possible cell phone the kim possible quest was an interactive mystery hunt where the participant joined a popular cartoon characters pursuit of bad guys the phones gave clues and could lead you all over the park the boy searched the church and apparently found the answer in a display description that his father helped him to read the boy squealed and pushed a button on the device the phone gave him his next location the two left without having paid any attention to the five kids maybeck arrived out of breath he looked around the small area making sure they were alone he said hello and then did any of you see the ctds out there there was a pair trying to follow me i lost them but they were zoned in on me appraising maybeck finn said not the best disguise ive seen maybeck liked the fan attentionloved it was more accurateand rarely changed his appearance he wanted to be recognized he wanted to be mobbed im kind of hard to miss he said you reap what you sow willa told him wheres charlene amanda asked looking past him philby and finn exchanged a curious look maybeck said she stopped to get us some food im starving its eight oclock philby said so what i cant be hungry at eight oclock im hungry all the time i have a big appetite i wouldnt mind something jess said that dinner tonight she said to amanda mrs nashs tamale pie is basically microwaved dog food with boxed gravy and doritos on top agreed amanda gross willa said you should be in the same room with it said amanda maybeck said i dont think we should hang here too long not only are there cameras all over this parkright philbybut i wouldnt be surprised if those ctds circle back and come looking for me wed actually be safer out there with the mob lining up for the fireworks i love the fireworks amanda said willa said so why are we here anyway whats going on do we even know why wayne wanted us here not yet we dont finn answered what we know is that the ots are active again he told them about the jail visit with wanda philby tried to explain what wanda might have been doing hacking the servers disney has an elaborate set of firewalls in place think of it as one of those european fort walls around all of disney worlds data lines one you cant climb one with gates too strong to bust through on cue the door banged open charlene entered struggling to balance a stack of small plastic plates all holding food everyone hurried over to help her shortly thereafter lips were smacking loudly so finn said to philby you were saying the point is the firewalls log any eventsthat is attempts to breach them there are subnet masks isp numbers all sorts of data that can be traced and used to track down where the attack came from and who was behind it if im wanda thats what im looking for the person behind the data bursts and if youre the ots charlene asked if im the ots and im attacking firewalls philby said then im either looking for a way in or a way out a way in would give me access to other disney data like the location of where disney might lock up certain other overtakers maybeck proposed like that yes or you remember how we used the changes in temperature inside pavilions to try to track maleficent that kind of record would tell them everything they want to know energy use willa said philby smiled he loved the way her mind worked absolutely disney has to keep maleficent cold theyre not going to mistreat her and she needs cold to survive that would require more energy thats a number something easy enough to uncover those kind of records could be hacked theyre going to bust maleficent and chernabog out maybeck said speculating its a jailbreak silence philby began nodding nicely done terry could it be charlene asked it makes total sense willa said theyre trying to gather enough data to locate where maleficent and chernabog are being held at the same time they know thats going to attract our attentionwayne philby wandasomeone when that happens they have a backup plan to lure wayne out into the open and kidnap him maybe they want information from him maybe they want to trade him for maleficent and chernabog but its all directed at the same goal freeing the boss maybeck said and with wayne in hiding and wanda out of the way willa said its up to us said finn prompting another heavy silence the church door pushed open a girl and her parents entered they were also on the kim possible quest the keepers scattered pretending to be interested in the various displays the mother and father looked on as the girl read a plaque looking for the same clue the boy had earlier her father complimented her as she identified the king in question check the a box he said i know dad the girl complained a little snotty are you going to let me do it or not he stepped back and the girl worked the phone then she stopped and looked across the room her curious eyes finally settling on finn she tentatively crossed toward him her father keeping an eye on her ive played this game like six times she said addressing finn shyly her parents now nearby but this is the coolest yet she handed finn the kim possible phone he accepted it reluctantly she hung her head slightly embarrassed i recognized all but those two she said pointing to amanda and jess when we came in her parents looked around not having a clue who the kids were i didnt want to bug you iweall of us appreciate that finn said is this a friend of yours dear the mother asked skeptically oh momcome on these are the kingdom keepers you know this is like the most awesome kim possible ever philby said were not actually part ofoww finn had elbowed him the girl pointed to the phone in finns hand read it finn read the message on the phones small screen hand your phone to the nearest kingdom keeper press ok to continue finn reread the message twice waynes reach inside the parks never failed to amaze him maybeck came over and read the screen what if when you push ok it sends our location to our other friends i kinda need my phone back the girl said finn pushed ok the screen changed go to the kp cart in norway tell them youre my friendw press ok to continue finn pressed ok hand the phone back to the guest press ok to continue finn pushed ok and returned the girls phone to her before leaving she asked everyone to sign her epcot map bounding with excitement she left with her parents when they were alone again finn said we have to trust it this is why were here it could just as easily be a trap maybeck warned wayne gave us all phones he reminded if he wanted to contact us wouldnt he just call us or text us am i missing something why bother with the kim possible thing charlene said we wont know until we try willa said he is always paranoid about the ots eavesdropping when he puts us on a quest its to tell us something that no one else could figure out i volunteer charlene said raising her hand ill do it amanda and i could do it jess said we arent kingdom keepers we wouldnt raise any suspicions shes right philby said and if its a trap finn said then they catch the wrong people and who knows what that means charlene said i thought you were the one trusting it busted i said i volunteer charlene reminded ill go with you finn said but if they catch youwe cant let them catch you amanda said some suppressed smirks it was the amandaandfinn show for all to see including charlene who looked away finns the only one of us that can allclear with any consistency said charlene i know amanda said ive seen him do it with greg luowski finn recalled hed suckered luowski into taking a swing at him while finn was briefly transformed into his hologram no one had explained the science behind how finn was able to briefly transform himself into pure lightwhat he and the others called all clear he supposed it made him part fairlie like jess and amanda he supposed that all clear was a state where mystical metaphysical elements met the physical sciences it worked two ways finn as a mortal boy could on occasion concentrate to where he suddenly turned into a hologram it only lasted a short amount of timehis record was eighteen secondsbut in that state he could walk through walls or take a punch because technically he didnt exist as anything but light the second way was more difficult for parents and even wayne to understand a hologram was nothing but light when projected or crossed over into the parks as dhis the kids were technically nothing but light but fear removed their state of purity if as a dhi one of them became afraid that hologram lost a percentage of data depending on the level of fear that resulted in a dhi that was part mortal part teenager part hologram and therefore vulnerable to being wounded or captured finn had perfected a kind of visualizationa train coming at him from down a dark tunnelthat helped him achieve all clear pushed him into that state of invulnerable light it was a useful even necessary tool and one hed been coaching the others to learn how to do and while you two are out playing games what are we supposed to do maybeck asked clearly complaining im not hanging here im not big on churches youll divide into groupssplit up between norway and mexico on either side of us said finn you watch for crashtest dummies text me if you see any charlene and i will do the kim possible quest and let you know what we find out amanda and jess stay with us to make us a bigger group that way its less likely we get spotted as keepers maybeck said you look so stupid whitman so ive heard at least he tried for some kind of disguise willa said philby said its a good plan lets get going philby and willa headed for china after more discussion maybeck went by himself into mexico an announcement filled the loud speakers the fireworks were set to begin a wooden cart sat tucked into a dark corner of the terraced path between norway and mexico pushed against an island of trees and bushes the cast member attending the unmarked cart wore a kim possible adventure tshirt finn charlene and the sisters approached the overweight man waiting for a small boy and his father to return their kim possible phone w sent us finn told the cast member okay the man had a gruff voice unexpected of a cast member were here to do the adventure charlene said i was told you would have two initials for me he said to finn this had waynes dna all over it kk cant be too careful the guy said he rifled through some phones in the carts drawer and handed one to finn he launched into a memorized explanation of the game finn and the other three listened intently didnt miss a thing any questions i think weve got it finn said checking with his friends off you go return it here please id tell you to enjoy yourselves but im not sure thats appropriate the phones screen told finn to step away from the cart and to press ok the crowds for the fireworks clogged the pathway encircling the lake forty people deep the park music charged the air with excitement finn pressed ok the cartoon image on the screen of kim possible changed to a photograph of a tree a written message read go to this tree by the bakery café and press ok where is it finn said spinning around there amanda and charlene said at the exact same moment both pointing okay but lets not advertise finn said the girls lowered their arms once at the tree behind the café finn pushed ok the tree began speaking or at least it seemed so real that charlene jumped back finn felt shivers run up his arms as an old mans voicea voice he knew to be waynesspoke to them from a speaker in the shrubs designed to look like a rock we all need a waiter now and then said the voice some can get a waiters attention faster than others this can have disappointing results as finn slapped his pockets hoping to find a pen he noticed jess already scribbling on a piece of paper jess carried a pencil and paper whenever she was inside the parks she had previously had daytime dreams or visions of the future here while awake she came prepared her uncanny ability to dream about future events had earned her a place as a fairlie alongside sister amanda that power was corrupted and nearly harnessed by maleficent whod put jess under the effects of a horrible spell which brought her together with finn and the keepers when amanda had sought their help to free jess of the spell now the keepers benefited from her unique ability on more than one occasion the keepers had used a jess diary page to see an event before it happened theyd learned to pay strict attention to anything she sketched the phones screen said to press back to hear the message a second time finn pressed the button jess continued writing got it she said whats that supposed to mean charlene asked we keep going you know what hes like finn said the screen on the phone changed an animated kim possible said find a friend around front push ok and watch what he does again a photo appeared it showed two garden gnomes and some shrubs they located the identical setting just inside the norway plaza past the stave church finn pressed ok the gnome spun around his backside facing them finn pressed ok and the garden sculpture pivoted to face them again he triggered the phone to repeat the effect whoa charlene exclaimed way cool please write it down finn said to jess charlene leaned against him from one side amanda the other a finn sandwich a cartoon of a dorky kid appeared onscreen he said that kim possible had identified a signal post and that she needed their help in locating it if the enemy saw that signal they were told bad things might happen is that supposed to be some kind of code charlene asked dont know finn said but he was thinking so many questions from her the camera offered another photograph the four of them returned to behind the bakery jess with her keen artistic eye found the scenery that matched she positioned them all with their backs to the bakery patio and pointed to their right where the building ended at a knot of rocks and foliage go ahead charlene said try it finn pressed ok nothing happened try again she said up high amanda said she knew better than to point and attract attention one by one the other kids saw it a red triangular flag popping up from behind a wrought iron lamppost each time finn pushed back the flag reappeared and sank better write it down he said but jess was already on it the kim possible character reappeared on the phone and told them how well they were doing and that they had one last clue to find another picture charlene spotted the location immediately it was a rock face on the way back to the kim possible cart where theyd started the screen read push ok to have your picture taken i dont know about having your picture taken amanda said its telling us to do it charlene pointed out weve done everything so far finn said softly maybe its a way for wayne to see that its really us that were the ones on the adventure that makes sense jess said it should probably be just you and charlene in the picture agreed finn said you and amanda keep an eye out while charlene and i do this his personal phone vibrated in his pocket he read the text it was from maybeck ctds on segways headed this way crashtest dummies finn said we need to hurry finn texted back diversion needed his phone buzzed back no prob he and charlene hurried out in front of the rocks and finn pressed ok the cartoon characters thin voice told him to face the lake and press ok again when he was ready to have his picture taken he had no idea what might happen a trap door a net falling from the trees with everyones attention now focused on the lake anything could happen to them and it would go unnoticed if it was a trap it had been cleverly planned he and the others had walked right into it eyes open his thumb hovered over the phones ok button he pushed ok a bright light flashed quickly from within the bushes finn believed this to be part of the trickto blind them while someone attempted to capture them he bumped his shoulder against charlene and reached down and grabbed her hand but no one came charging toward them finn spotted amanda looking back at them and immediately released charlenes hand return the phone to get your photos press ok finn pressed ok and was told what a great job hed done for the kim possible team how they couldnt have done it without him jess and amanda joined them amanda said did you see maybeck he was running through the crowd a pair of crashtest dummies after him did they catch him finn asked anxiously she pointed the ctds stood well above the crowd on their segways but they were barely moving because of all the people maybeck had led them past norway and had to be way ahead of them by nowa good job of creating a diversion finn and the girls reached the kim possible cart the cast member greeted them have a good quest i guess said finn returning the phone heres your picture the man said pointing out the snapshot pinned to a corkboard as all three girls stepped up to see it the cast member blocked finn from joining them and slipped something into finns right hand slippery paper photosfinn could tell by the texture he stole a glance at the first of the photos but slid them into the only pocket in his absurd gym pants as the cast member shook his head suggesting finn wasnt to share these the image on the photo hit him hard the evil queen somewhere in disneyquest she was standing in front of four students two girls greg luowski and a boy wearing a striped tshirt whose face couldnt be seen because of the queen hed only seen it for an instant but there was no question in his mind of what hed seen the queen was talking to the four kids and more importantly they were listening it hit him like a slap in the face he had to show it to the others he simply had to but the cast member had warned him not to worse he still didnt know what was on the second photo he needed a minute by himself i gotta go to the bathroom he told the girls as they turned from the posted photo i dont get it charlene said so what if our picture was taken whats it mean this is yours the cast member said i hope you enjoyed your mission and will join us another time charlene accepted the photo though unhappily cant you wait she asked finn i dont think we should split up just now sticking together was his rule yeah okay ill text the others well meet at the ice cream place by the fountain there are rest rooms near there why meet why not just go home charlene asked the mission is over so weve been given all the pieces finn said we need to figure out what it means while its still fresh in our heads but those guys are out there buzzing around looking for us she said finn already had his phone out and was sending a group text ice cream he said maybeck was the last to reach the ice cream parlor the other kids stood at the counter the fireworks show continued so they owned the place even so they kept their voices low between greedy bites of mint chip cookie dough and royal fudge if there was one thing the keepers could agree on it was eating vast amounts of ice cream finn wasnt sure the others noticed jess sketching on a napkin as the discussion began with maybecks heroic description of eluding the crashtest dummies we need to figure out the kim possible mission charlene said still edgy finn looked at her differently now hed been to the bathroom and hed dragged philby with him there hed taken out the two photos and for the first time taken a good look at both thats sally ringwald finn said naming a girl who went to winter park and thats luowski said philby who knew about the bully talking to the evil queen i dont recognize the second girlmaybe maybeck or charlene knows her whats the other photo philby asked for finn had kept it tucked below the first who knows if we can trust these pictures finn said are you going to show it to me or not i just think we have to keep open minds come on you know me finn peeled away the first photo revealing the second the photo was actually two images divided by a black line both blackandwhite they appeared to be freezeframe photographs taken from a security video on the left it showed charlene entering a rest roomtime and date stamped as the night before while theyd been in disneyquest to the right was the evil queen entering the same doorway twenty seconds later philby said charlene was still in there we dont know that finn said of course she was who can pee and wash her hands in less than twenty seconds she obviously met with the evil queen just like these other kids philby looked back and forth between the various shots the question is not whether she saw the queen the question is why havent we been told about it we cant jump to conclusions whos jumping philby said number one shes been acting weird do you deny that no finn said unhappily number two shes been asking a ton of questions just like a spy would i know number three she volunteered to do the kim possible thing with you now im not saying she doesnt volunteer to do stuff with us but when she does its alwaysi mean alwayssomething physical something gymnastic or athletic thats her talent its not to solve a mystery thats willas turf yeah finn said she was in the bathroom with the evil queen yeah finn agreed reluctantly why philby said it was after that that she got weird yes it was philby said youre right so another way to look at this is that the queen met with her not the other way around meaning she cast a spell on charlene to spy on us maybe on the other four too luowski and everyone maybe finn wasnt easily convinced that greg luowski could be a victim so charlene starts asking all these questions and acting weird it makes sense finn said so weve got to break the spell philby said ten times out of ten when it comes to breaking a spell put onto a girl you break it by kissing her not me finn said if i kiss charlenei am not doing that amanda yes yeah well i dont exactly want willa to see me do it you and willa this is news to you said philby finn shrugged that just confirms what willa says that boys dont get any of this stuff what stuff you see philby said his eyes shifted left and right maybeck they both said at once back in the ice cream parlor finn saw philby pull maybeck aside and whisper to him maybecks face crunched like a crushed paper bag first finn said to the girls in part to keep them from noticing philbys whispering was the waiter jess read from her notes we all need a waiter now and then some can get a waiters attention faster than others this can have disappointing results then the garden gnome finn said the gnome turned around jess said then turned around again to face us at this point maybeck and philby joined the group again maybeck flashed finn a look impossible to interpret was he going to kiss charlene or not finn couldnt tell then the flag amanda said a red triangular flag jess added and then the photograph charlene said but whats any of it mean the girls all looked to philby as to the first philby said there arent any waiters at the norway bakery its a cafeteria with outside seating we didnt look inside charlene admitted maybe we should have waiters deliver menus food and drinks professor philby said breaking the clue into smaller pieces philby was more like a college student than a freshman in high school what else they take stuff away after were through the bakery sells all sorts of stuff maybeck said meals desserts drinks just deserts willa said a brainiac like philby willa understood language the way he understood anything technical what if its a play on words wayne does that kind of thing just deserts is with one s it means giving people what they deserve maybe the clue has something to do with giving the overtakers what they deserve thats way too random even for wayne said maybeck heads nodded in agreement but a play on words isnt philby said sticking up for willa when i was washing my hands just nowyou know those signs telling employees to wash their handswell some wise guy had crossed out cast members and had written servers its not waiter but server philby said we all need a server now and then its server not waiter we all need a server now and then some can get a servers attention faster than others its a computer server that works said willa wayne knows ive messed with the dhi server before philby said amanda said so the full translation would be we all need a dhi server now and then yes said philby you guys and who else amanda asked the ots maybeck said he looked cruelly at charlene finn thought he was the only one to pick up on it willa said and the gnome turning around like that jess read from her notes the exact mission was to find a friend around front a friend spinning around charlene asked not spinning philby said a friendturning his back on you or hers willa said innocently a friend betraying you us said maybeck still fixated on charlene a red flag amanda said the flag was red a red flag means something you need to notice willa said something you shouldnt miss that everyone needs a server philby said and that a friend has turned his or her back on us weve been betrayed willa gasped charlene said to maybeck quit staring at me why are you doing that finn caught himself holding his breath maybeck and his big mouth could ruin it all now finn caught a look from philbyhe was thinking the same thing its now or never maybeck said ive just never seen you prettier willa giggled amanda and jess watched intently as charlene blushed and said seriously terry whats with you maybeck took another step toward her while maintaining constant eye contact this was maybeckthemouth in action the selfproclaimed chick magnet trying to prove himself i dont know if its the lighting he said but you look like anangel like a movie star like one of those girls on the front of a magazinethe it girl the girl everyone wants to be the prettiest smartest girl in the room terry charlene said again her voice quavering he was a single step away from her now as he stopped one memory he said is all i ask he reached up and cupped her head in his hand his thumb stroking her ear she tilted her head slightly toward his hand her eyes looked sad and happy at the same time charlene her voice strong once again said i mean come on she pushed maybeck back with both hands you really think that stuff will work on me the other girls erupted in nervous laughter for a moment theyd seemed so close to a kiss amanda was blushing jess returned to her sketching her head down giggling finn could see it was a face she was drawingan upside down faceof a boy or a man she hadnt put on the finishing touches yet he couldnt be sure but in the back of his mind a small voice asked who it was the keepers policy to leave their phones on at night parents rarely approved of that policy and so each of the kids had come up with his or her way to get around the objections finn put his into vibrate mode and left it on his side table on a piece of aluminum foil so that if it vibrated the aluminum foil would rattle enough to wake him he was a heavy sleeper he didnt know what tricks the other keepers had come up with only that if called at night they answered he answered his on the fourth metallic buzz as the vibrations lifted the phone and carried it close to the end tables edge and a possible tumble to the floor what he whispered into the phone having already seen philbys photo and name on its screen problems only philby could sound like a male librarian at one am finn rubbed his eyes with his free hand scrunched his pillow behind him and sat up in bed this had better be good i know you hate technical explanations so im not sure where to start maybe start with the problems i monitor bandwidth usage as you know the same thing wanda did but i dont go hacking internet hubs the dhi server our dhi server all it takes is the isp and youre right forget as much of the technical stuff as possible philby cleared his throat lets put it this way because i have the port address to the dhi server now im able to direct what park we land in when we go to sleep you and i can go to the magic kingdom while willa and maybeck go to animal kingdom the only catch is the return we have to be together for the return you woke me for a history lesson i know all this finn i woke you because we had a spike in traffic volume about ten minutes ago my laptop wakes on network usage i have it alarmed i got woken up by that traffic surge it was a major hit a dhi for sure i thought you controlled that finn said i thought we only crossed over when you wanted us to i dont get it exactly i do but if wayne or another imagineer wanted us over there then thats what would happen wayne you think its wayne i didnt know what to think so i called you its charlene finn the graphic tagthe holograms idis charlenes for finn it was almost as if her name was echoing over the telephone line in fact it was nothing but a little bit of static it would have to be her right he said sarcastically the evil queen waynes kim possible thing warned us about the server what if the ots have control of our server finn didnt answer his heart racing only philby would understand if that was possible i wanted to follow her in there shes in epcot but i didnt want to pull a maybeck and go alone and wander into a trap maybecks dhi had once followed a girl around inside the magic kingdom only to go missing he had never showed up for the return and the others had crossed back without him this had left his hologram stuck in the park and a sleeping terry maybeck in a kind of coma in his bedroom until his hologram was returned the boy had not awakened the kids now referred to this comatose state in several ways the sleeping beauty syndrome sbs or the syndrome following maybecks mishap they had instituted the buddy rule philby was simply playing by the rules can you help us get there of course ill need to send the others a text in case something goes wrong you and i cross over find her and return and if we dont return theyll need wandas or waynes help to come looking for us put that in the text okay finn said so i hang up and get back to sleep and ill see you in epcot true story finn ended the call sent the group text and slipped quietly out of bed he had secretly oiled the hinges on both his closet and bathroom doors so they could be worked in the middle of the night without screeching the dresser drawers were a little more tricky so he took his time with them fresh socks fresh underwear he dressed quietly and quicklyblack jeans black tshirt with a pirate skull on the back a brown hoodie an old pair of running shoes hed painted black he pocketed his phone and wallet which held a few dollars sometimes the phone worked when he crossed over sometimes not he crawled back into bed and did his best to settle down knowing that philby would have already programmed the dhi server to cross them over into epcot he blamed charlenes crossing over on the evil queen it seemed more and more likely that she had put a spell on charlene maybecks failing to kiss her loomed large the more he thought about everything the harder it was to get to sleep he cleared his mind picturing a dark tunnel with a faint pinprick of light far far at the endthe same technique he used to go all clear he watched the pinprick widen ever so slowly focused on that tiny speck of light in the sea of black as it grew larger the train approaching and then there was nothing finn awoke near the fountain in epcots central plaza the fountains were shut off in fact the entire park was lit by maybe half the available streetlamps the landing or arrival zone for their dhis was one of the biggest problems with the program philby could now control which park each of the kids landed in who among them would cross over and in a pinch he could manually return them from his home computer but the program transmitted the dhi into a parks central feature in the magic kingdom it was the central hub in front of cinderella castle in animal kingdom the island and the tree of life in disneys hollywood studios it was the elevated area beneath mickeys sorcerers hat here in epcot it was the fountain plaza just beyond spaceship earth in all cases in all places it meant their holograms landed in open space finns limbs tingled as he scrambled across the plaza reminding him that he was in his dhi state epcot after closing was not the remarkable and enchanting park it was during its opening hours it was known to the keepers as a haven for overtakers crashtest dummies on segways gigabyte a ginormous snake that was part of honey i shrunk the audience slithered in search of unwanted visitors there were court jesters in france capable of every kind of martial art there had been a time when finn had been certain the magic kingdom was the overtakers headquarters but he was no longer so convinced over here came a harsh whisper philby fifteen feet toward the lake from finn sitting on the walkway with his back against the information booth that housed a pin exchange a pair of ctds passed by here maybe five minutes ago finn lay down flat and kept very still the robotic crashtest dummies were nothing to mess with how do you want to do this he asked philby its too big to just start searching around it would take us days not hours to look everywhere then you know me technology meaning the illuminations control booth on the roof of mexico i know for a fact that setup includes feeds for all of the parks security cameras we climb to the top of the temple as dhis we should be able to walk through the door if i get freaked out and lose all clear then you go through and unlock it for me we use the security monitors to find charlene fifteen minutes later philby was sitting in a chair working switches the television monitor displayed four camera views at a time heck of a view finn said outside the window finn had a clear view of the lake and the surrounding pavilions he grabbed a pair of binoculars and began sweeping the area true story philby allowed enough time to study the view from each security camera then he pushed a button and another four appeared there were thirtytwo camera views available twice philby spotted ctds on the move but no charlene finn confirmed the ctds through the binoculars they began working out a system with the binoculars held to his eyes finn said what do you suppose they want with her a download philby answered lets say she was put under a spell to spy on us as we talked about she asks questions she looks over our shoulders then the evil queen and cruella need a chance to download whatever shes found out but shes not a zombie exactly so who knows what state she was in when she crossed over the ctds could be looking for her the queen may need a stronger spell to get charlene to talk im just guessing at all this it makes sense thank you movement finn said loudly in front of morocco a pair of ctds running through the binoculars he watched the dummies in full sprint they were tall powerful and surprisingly light on their feet a trash can rolled toward them the first vaulted it the second bent and knocked it out of the way like it was made of cardboard each dummy had the strength and speed of three men someone threw a trash can in their way finn announced philby worked the camera views its her its charlene finn had trouble finding her in the binoculars he turned and watched onscreen as charlene ran past norway philby pointed out another camera view charlene wearing a white nightgown ducked behind norway then cut back through the bakery patio toanother camera viewthe norway courtyard she hid as the ctds ran past like something out of the terminator then she turned to her left scrambled up some rock and disappeared into a dark cave maelstrom philby said finn had failed to recognize the cave because there was no water coming from the rides waterfall smart thats a great place to hide lets go philby said ill go finn said volunteering you stay and watch for the ctds no philby said we stick together finn wasnt going to waste time arguing a few minutes later the boys were climbing maelstroms dry waterfall toward the ominous black cave entrance the lip of the cave was mosscovered and slimy there was water in the trough just beyond so they kept to the left where a narrow ledge followed the water course the deeper they penetrated into the ride the darker it became the boys used hand signals to communicate philby indicated for finn to keep his eyes open finn had no problem with that his heart was about to burst in his chest as their eyes adjusted to the limited light the maelstrom world enveloped them lush green bushes and trees rocks and stones strange things happened inside the rides and attractions in the parks at night the only rule was that there were no rules trust nothing finn reminded himself on philbys signal both boys stopped and crouched they saw a pair of yellow glowing eyes tightly set trolls finn pushed past philby and continued along the ledge philby followed him as they pressed deeper into the darkness the only light coming from the faint glow of their dhis not trolls he realized but polar bears two giant white bears one standing one down on all fours if those things come alive finn said his voice shaking were hamburger philby said finishing the thought for him thanks for that image finn said no charge morbid humor had a way of sneaking into their conversations at the strangest times they moved past the polar bears there was something large and squarish up ahead to their left finn knew where they were the cottage he said the start of the ride finns eyes had adjusted to where he could now see a lifesize norwegian standing in front of a cottage finn hurried over to a rock that was familiar to him from his last visit here as a dhi he reached down and felt for the three handles he knew to be there theres an ax missing finn whispered philby stepped forward leaning against the rock was an oldfashioned ax and a sword there should have been two axes its her philby said thats why she came in here finn took up the sword knowing it well from a previous visit he handed the remaining ax to philby what would you have done said charlenes voice they both looked up as she stepped out of the cottage the ax gripped in her hand they hurried over to her it is you finn said they hugged youre okay crowed philby also hugging her not really terrifieds more like it she addressed philby why did you send me here without telling me it wasnt me philby said it wasnt like that we can explain we think said finn but first weve got to return weve got to get you out of here there are ctds out there she warned we saw finn said well have to be careful philby said and if that fails he raised his ax a whizzing sound sizzled past finns ear a chopstick lodged in the painted styrofoam scenery behind them the next one flew through his shoulder his pure dhi state preventing it from wounding him incoming he said he felt his own terror beginning to take holdhis fingers tinglingand understood the mortal danger it presented no fear he reminded easier said than done charlene cried out yellow eyes glowed from across the stream more arrows whizzed past i can feel my hands philby said me too charlene said and my feet they werent in a state of pure dhi which made them vulnerable to attack philby and charlene ducked behind the small rocks eight trollskneehigh old men with beards whiskers and huge eyesappeared across the water they carried kitchen pot lids as shields steak knives as swords carpentry hammers and the homemade bows and arrows they jumped across the water and charged the kids stayed behind the rocks the trolls split up philby took an arrow in the arm and screamed as he pulled it out that thing hurts he cried a troll came at finn his steak knife glinting finn swung the sword and knocked the knife out of the trolls hand philby stood and pressed his back to finns so they could defend in two directions charlene on her knees battled ax against hammer one of the old men surprised finn from the right stabbing him but his sword passed right through finns hologram the guy fell offbalance philby kicked him across the water into the scenery soccer philby shouted to charlene she stood and kicked out at the trolls sending them flying goal philby cried as one of the trolls flew though the door of the cottage thats it finn said we get them all into the cottage and trap them philby kicked one of the trolls passing him to charlene like a soccer ball she expertly sent him through the cottage door finn battled with his sword he heard philby counting them down fourfive finns blade clanked against the steak knife of a competent swordsman philby came to his aid toekicking the troll toward the cottage where charlene finished him off by sending him inside six i sent one across the water finn said so thats seven the final troll dropped his hammer and threw up his arms in surrender philby grabbed his hands threw him into the cottage and charlene shut the door she used her ax handle to prop it shut the kids out of breath looked around for more trouble but saw none that wasweird philby said you okay charlene asked philby approached her and kissed her on the lips before she knew what he was doing the kiss went on longer than finn would have expected charlene and philby pulled themselves apart breathlessly whatwasthat charlene asked not a twinge of complaint in her voice how do you feel finn asked thats a stupid question she said besides thats for philby to ask not you philby looked tranquilized ithat wasit was he had to do it finn said excuse me charlene said how would they know if shed been put under a spell worse how would they know if shed come out of it do you remember going into the girls room at disneyquest finn asked what kind of a question is that one that needs answering he wished philby would say something but he remained stunned and unable to speak he was staring at charlene like hed gotten religion its none of your business eww philby finally managed to speak it is our business do you remember who followed you inside the girls room she looked frightened her holograms blue outline faded what are you two talking about she blinked furiously as if about to cry do you remember going into the bathroom at disneyquest philby asked repeating finns question yeah i suppose do you remember anyone else in there with you like who amanda willa who do you mean we were all there that night anyone else philby asked the trolls were pounding on the door to the cottage to get out finn could barely hear himself think how could you possibly know about this charlene asked know about what finn said aboutwhen i was in there i kind of lost track of time what do you mean philby asked i mean i lost track of time i spaced out or something this girl was standing behind me asking if i was all right because because according to her i was just standing there staring into the mirror not moving or anything she said it wasawkward was her exact word but how could you possibly know that and the girl philby said the one in the bathroom had you thought about her before just now before we started asking questions charlene shook her head whats going on we can explain later finn said youll explain now she demanded later finn repeated im not going anywhere until you tell me whats going on she crossed her arms tightly philby was not pleased he said we think the evil queen may have enchanted you to spy on usthe keepers finn said that she crossed you over tonightbecause i definitely did not philby added that the ctds are out there looking for you finn said that weve got to get to the return and get you out of here stunned charlene took a moment to process everything youll explain it all later yes finn said i kissed you to break the spell philby explained it apparently worked you remember stuff you didnt remember before why charlene gasped why me what does she want if were right about them trying to break maleficent out of jail then who knows what they want who knows what they think we have but we cant get caught were not going to let her get you again i want to go home charlene said makes three of us said finn we cant take the axes with us philby said they wont return with us and to leave them lying around the plaza would just tell somebody that wed been here we dont need to leave clues like that how about leaving seven trolls locked up in the cottage thats their problem philby said they leaned philbys ax and finns sword against the rock as theyd found them then they hurried to the cave entrance and climbed down the dry waterfall they stayed in shadow using trash cans kiosks trees and anything else available to hide behind they passed mexico and followed a perimeter route that took them near test track a hundred yards from the plaza fountain philby stopped slower now philby said taking a moment to catch his breath extra careful they circled around the fountain finally reaching the pintrading station a small circular onestory building it held a large display screen that when operating informed guests of wait times for the various attractions there was only one return one black fob capable of wirelessly connecting to the server and canceling the dhi projection finn had once asked wayne for more of the devicesone for each parkbut wayne had steadfastly refused explaining that the act of returning was the most dangerous part of the program if two returns were engaged within a few seconds of each other they would theoretically cancel each other out and the imagineers had no idea where that would leave the dhisnor the kids who lay asleep in bed if trapped between the two worlds the results could be devastating the system would tolerate only one fob one return the keepers were currently hiding the allimportant fob in epcot in an intersection of purple pipes that supported the roof of the pintrading post on the plaza the pipes came together about head height connecting with a single support column that rose up from the plaza where the pipes joined was a hidden space just big enough for the return finn reached up his fingers searching blindly and came down with ita black rubber remote like a car door opener ready he asked charlene nodded and reached for finns hand philby took her other hand connecting them all for the return to work effectively they had to stand near each other physical contactlike holding handsworked even better well text in the morning philby said and figure all this stuff out like what to do next like if theres some way to stop them from crossing us over like why they chose me charlene said finn stretched on his tiptoes holding the return over the junction of pipes as they crossed back the return would fall from his fingers lodging in its hiding place they would need to know where to find it the next time they crossed over with the three of them all holding hands finn counted down threetwo he pushed the button being back at school was a major letdown a regular part of almost every day it was still the forgettable part his time as a keeper dominated finns thoughts the one bright spot in the school day was of all things lunch not that the food was edible it was not but lunchtime was finns chance to hang with amanda he stopped in the boys room to make sure he didnt have something stuck in his teeth or a booger lodged up his nose when his eyes shifted focus in the mirror he saw greg luowski standing behind him hey greg finn was mindful of the security photograph showing the evil queen talking to luowski and three other kids he was a bundle of nerves especially because luowski didnt say anything there was something different about luowskis sneer maybe it was seeing his ugly mug reversed by the mirror maybe it was his piggish eyes or greasy skin or maybe it was just luowski trying so hard to look menacing it was working if theyd given grades for imparting terror luowski would have gotten an a finn cupped his hands beneath the faucet filled his mouth with water and swished it around in his teeth to get rid of any cereal that might be lingering from breakfast he did this in part to pretend that luowskis presence didnt concern him in part because his hands were shaking and he didnt want luowski to see the effect he could have over him when finn stood up and looked in the mirror luowski was gone the door to the boys room hissed shut and finn let out a sigh of relief but he also wondered why luowski had passed up the opportunity to bully him the silent treatment was not lousy luowskis style finn looked around to see if a teacher had entered looked for some explanation as far as he could tell he was alone he tried to let it go to forget about it but luowski had gotten under his skin he felt slightly sick edgy jumpy his skin was crawling amanda was sitting off by herself in the lunch room a hopeful look in her eyes which brightened as she spotted him her tray held salad a bowl of fruit and a glass of water the lettuce was mostly white not green the fruit canned even the water looked gray through the scratched plastic cup he arrived with a yellowish mass on his plate that had been labeled creamed chicken and rice with enough salt it could be swallowed have you seen gregthegross he asked yes you may join me she said ignoring his question completely lousy luowski he said id be happy to have you finn sat across from her he stabbed at the yellow mound it lives he said putting his fork beneath the mass and causing it to wiggle she laughed in the hall earlier she said finally answering him his usual oafish self she looked pretty today like every other day did he lookdifferent a few more zits she asked a few less brain cells some creamed chicken and rice caught in finns throat he washed it down with warm milk she stabbed her fruit the consistency of rubber it resisted her fork like she was trying to stab an eraser im not exactly a fan she said i dont usually pay attention to him she had trouble chewing her fruit she said but did you happen to notice sally ringwalds new contacts might have missed that he sat up taller and listened carefully sally ringwald had been one of the kids with the queen in disneyquest pigmented you know green you cant believe the difference shes much prettier now kind of irishlooking one of my moms friends wears the blue ones its really disturbing its like im not supposed to notice or something im supposed to pretend her eyes always looked like that as if he paused dont ever do anything like that okay dont go changing yourself like that she blushed and returned to stabbing her fruit or trying to where did that come from he said i dont mind in a desperate effort to change subjects he blurted out philby and i crossed over into epcot last night to rescue charlene rescue to help her return did she ask you to no its just that philbyhe hadnt arranged for her to cross over in the first place so youre the dhi police now is that it ouch she cant cross over without philbys permission what about wayne or maybe the imagineers what if they crossed her over it he didnt have a great answer for that as it turned out it was a good thing we went in after her we ended up battling some trolls the ctds were out everywhereprobably looking for her probably she said stinging him should he tell her you can tell me she said how come girls could read his thoughts like that he never had a clue what a girl was thinking we think she was under a spell he lowered his voice the evil queen seriously he reached into his back pockethe only changed his pants about every four daysand passed her the timestamped photograph of charlene and the evil queen entering the disneyquest washroom he said there were two photographs last night the one of the queen with luowski and sally ringwald and this one notice the times you kept this one from us she sounded upset we kept it from charlene yeah finn ate some more of the yellowish mush but bit down on gristle and pushed his tray aside he said she has no memory of the queen being in the girls room with her amandas concern carved lines across her face maybe the plan finn said is to cross one of us over each night until were all stuck in the syndrome that would get us out of the way if that ever happened she said jess and i would cross over and come find you the ots cant possibly know that you made it so we can be dhis he spotted sally ringwald across the cafeteria she was too far away for him to see her green contacts but it prompted him to reconsider his encounter with luowski what if they were green he said what if what were green luowski what about him his eyes contact lenses he said what if luowski looked different to me because eyes were green thats ridiculous greg luowski has boring eyes she said hazel red hair hazel eyes finn said but what if his boring hazel eyes are now green like sally ringwalds greg luowski wearing pigmented contacts not possible a guy like him never thinks about how he looks but we should think about it finn said persisting the evil queen corners sally luowski and a couple of others at disneyquest then a day later they both show up at school wearing green contacts its like those goth groups right green as in maleficent get it youre sick its not me its them its your idea weve got to look for others and you have to get close enough to luowski to see if im right why me she said because if he sees me he goes all neanderthal he didnt when you were in the bathroom just do it please hes right over there by the drinks okay ill walk by him on my way out what are you doing after school he asked jess and i were grounded by mrs nash she found out about our little trip to epcot were in serious trouble its her threestrike rule she threatened to send us back to the fairlies she said thats not going to happen no offense but i dont think youre going to have a lot of say in it the school buzzer sounded lunch was over see you she stood along with half the kids in the room she walked toward luowski and the exit finn watched her every step as she passed luowskis table she said something to him then at the door she turned around and found finn she pointed to her eyes and nodded her lips mouthed green for a second he thought he might puke it had nothing to do with the creamed chicken and rice philby felt the prickle of hairs raising on the back of his neck and knew he was being watched worse he only associated that same level of dread of impending disaster with the overtakers but in school normally it wouldnt have made any sense but the photo of students with the evil queen had changed all that for philby no one was to be trusted the hallways of edgewater high were jammed with students some were hurrying to class some were flirting some facing their lockers but someone was watching him he crossed past mrs mcveys classroom and stood with his back against a bulletin board filled with thumbtacked essays on the promise of electric cars he hoped the new angle would make whoever was watching him reveal himself but the only person he saw was hugo montcliff his neighborhood friend checking out the girls or what or what philby answered he looked hard for someone focused on him no one weve got algebra yeah so you okay hugo asked you ever get that feeling someones watching you like a girl me not so much do you think of anything but girls hugo xbox the new guerrilla warfare twopointthree the sensation had passed i was trying to have a little private time here he said wounding hugo for the first time he took his eyes off the kids in the hallway and looked over at hugo he must have hurt him bad because hugo didnt look like hugo at all hey philby said im sorry enjoy your private time hugo said he charged off hugo he was about to run after him when he caught a pair of eyes staring at him from across the hall a girl with dark hair she looked vaguely familiar though he couldnt remember her name the girl from the photo she broke off the stare and moved on philby joined the river of students trying to catch up with her the more he pushed the less progress he made he pulled to the side and tried working along the lockers he made some headway there he reached out and grabbed her shoulder turning her around the wrong girl sorry he said loser the girl said brushing his hand from her shoulder he dragged himself out of the way of the crush against school rules he pulled out his phone and sent a group text we hav talk crzy glaze after skool philby believed in science empirical proof he believed in forming a theory developing evidence reaching a conclusion he lacked all of that he had only a few hairs tickling the back of his neck and some girl who might have been staring at a hallway clock for all he knew and yet he had no doubtnone whatsoever there were overtakers in his school they were watching him it turned his world upside down theres no place safe he thought finn left school with dillard cole his closest nonkeeper friend and fulltime neighborhood pal dillard was neither athletic nor particularly fit but he had a good imagination a huge appetite and was probably the best gamer finn knew at one timewhat seemed like many years ago to finn but wasnt actually so very long agothe two had spent endless weekends and evenings working the thumbs as dillard called video gaming following finns modeling as a dhi and his recruitment into the kingdom keepers by wayne their friendship had fallen off the reason for the fallout had been in large part the secrecy under which the keepers operated but now with newspaper stories alleging that finn was one of the five kingdom keepers dillard understood the complications of the past and was letting the friendship come around again finn found himself preoccupied with the idea of luowskis green contact lenses he and amanda had blamed charlene for their wild neardeath simulator ride in disneyquest but a film had been playing in finns memory luowski bumping into charlene and helping her to pick up the virtual roller coaster tickets off the floor when shed dropped them what if luowski had substituted the killer ride for the one charlene had designed for him and amanda but its over right dillard said bringing finn back dillard sweated as he labored to keep up with the fastwalking finn you guys vanquished them vanquished that is so gate crashers finn said referring to a popular video game the disney villainsthey took care of the witch and the thing villains rumors all rumors so you are hurrying because ive got to catch a city bus i got a text from philby said finn philby yeah you two are tight i suppose hes a good gamer youd like philby whod win do you think at sudden disaster me or philby wed have to find out finn said what kind of dumb answer is that my kind of dumb answer i guess hey could we slow down some im soaked said dillard you gotta keep up dillard stopped short beads of sweat flying off him and spraying finn who also stopped i could keep up if i wanted dillard said i know that im sorry i can slow down if you want why dont you go do whatever it is youve got to do ill catch you later dont be like that like what oh no finn said get down he pulled dillard to a crouch behind a parked car luowski dillard said looking that direction you and luowski i got nothing to do with that luowski jaywalked crossing the street to the other side finn couldnt believe what he saw since when did luowski give him a free pass hes following me finn said like spying yeah like that why finn thought back to the confrontation in the boys room before lunch he thought back to the photograph with the evil queen itsinvolved he answered the question is do i dare test it test as in im going to go over there finn said if he beats up on me i may need you to rescue me me and greg luowski right finn handed him his phone threaten to call nineoneone seriously im not saying to do it just threaten it luowskis stupid but hes not dumb he wont want to mess with the police he might want to mess with me dillard said its your call finn said yeah okay ill do it finn patted him on the shoulder thanks finn stood and hurried across the street greg he called out luowski appeared to panic he spun around then reconsidered and turned back to face finn he seemed uncharacteristically perplexed whitless luowski had been born mean he was the kind of kid destined to be a serial killer the kind of kid who burned down garages who dropped rocks off highway overpasses the kind of kid who deserved a go directly to jail card in monopoly are you following me finn said as if he was a bad liar luowski turned his head slightly and finn saw the green contact lenses instead of looking silly they gave him a chill was it possible luowski and other students how many he had no way of knowing had been put under a spell by the evil queen that the green contacts were a way for them to identify each other and to intimidate the keepers how many had the queen recruited did the spread of the overtakers extend beyond their own school if so how many did the ots now control and why it was enough to make finn wonder why hed so eagerly crossed the street to confront luowski in the first place you dont get it do you luowski asked apparently not but something tells me im about to finn thought the trouble with you whitless is you think youre so special you and your friends there were times that luowski tried to act tough then there were times when he looked like a lightbulb screwed into the socket wronga sparking problemridden butchcut exmarine in a sixteenyearolds body finn warned himself to settle down if he could manage a few seconds of all clear luowski wouldnt be able to hurt him but at the moment the space between him and all clear was about as wide as the grand canyon luowski was like a force field and finn a metal particle nearby worse luowski was relaxed he didnt have a care in the world why would you want to follow me thats what im asking myself finn said youre confused you are so naïve finn studied the greeneyed kid a word like naïve had no place coming out of his mouth you must have had language arts today finn said take off luowski said before you fall down and get hurt what did she promise you dont know who youre talking about luowski replied finn decided it was worth the risk he pulled the photo out of his back pocket her he said showing the picture of luowski and the evil queen you photoshop that or something i dont even know who that is he sounded so convincing that finn nearly believed him i didnt photoshop those contact lenses the trouble with you whitless is your mouth runs like a faucet language arts must have been a block class today see what i mean dont believe her shell eat you up and spit you out finn said is that right yes thats right luowski grabbed finn by the shoulders his hands felt like metal clamps listen to me carefully whitless his breath was sour his voice dry and raspy the contact lenses made his eyes look like doll eyes when close up like dead eyes some of us dont believe in magic he pushed finn back lifting him off his feet and sending him to the sidewalk luowski was strongmaybe the strongest kid in the entire high school not just ninth gradebut it had been more than strength that had lifted finn off his feet im going to call nineoneone came a girlishsounding threat from across the street dillard waved the phone he shouted the warning again luowski glanced in that direction unfazed youre pathetic he said turning his back on finn and youre strong finn was thinking supernaturally strong crazy glaze was a paintyourown pottery shop owned and operated by maybecks aunt and legal guardian bess or jelly as everyone called her they lived in the apartment above the store he worked afternoons and saturdays helping out sometimes she paid him sometimes not depending on how well business was doing finn liked the smell of the glaze and wet clay by the time he got there the other keepers had already arrived though not amanda and jess jelly had given them the back room all to themselves the door closed to the outside noise and chaos of kids doing afterschool art projects the collective mood felt highly charged with anticipation finn sat down and caught them up on his encounter with luowski philby related his story about feeling watched willa and maybeck had similar stories to tell but neither had connected the events at their school with the overtakers until they heard finn and philby voice their suspicions what does it all mean charlene asked philby spoke up it means the evil queen has found a way to recruit kids in our schools to watch us it means were outnumbered maybeck said and outflanked that we cant trust anyone but the contact lenses charlene said they give themselves away as ots in training or whatever right i mean why do that intimidation maybeck said is there some other explanation agreed its the fear factor finn answered maybe they think we can all go all clear and want us nervous and on guard to keep us from doing that and it makes them feel special willa said it makes them important and part of a bigger group it is unusual to make your spies known to the enemy professor philby said lets assume theyre planning some kind of jailbreak remember the ots are characters that means theyre confined to the parksand its entirely possible maleficent and chernabog arent being kept locked up in any of the parks they could be in jail anywhere that might make it necessary for the ots to have field agentspeople on the ground to do stuff for them the queen puts spells on a few kidsthat would explain luowskis bizarre strengthand tests them out with some assignments and then moves them like pawns to do her dirty work finn spoke first i hate to say it but it makes sense no one is going to stop luowski with that kind of strength if there are five or six of them like that they could easily overpower a bunch of guards or us maybeck said ominously maybe when the time comes their job is to keep us from interfering with the evil queens plans weve messed things up a lot for them in the past good point willa said oh my gosh charlene said i just got it she was fixed on maybeck you were trying to kiss me to bring me out of the spell in epcot at ice cream can we stay on topic please philby said maybeck said you missed your big chance how long had you guys known about the spell i mean charlene said ignoring philbys request we can do this later philby said the point is youre back jess showed me a sketch today willa said changing subjects at school finn recalled jess drawing on a napkin at the ice cream parlor and he asked she said it had just come to her when we were in the parks and finn repeated anxiously it was this military guy like a general or maybe a police officer or something what kind of officer philby asked how would i know they all look the same to me just a guy a grownup in a uniform id like to see it philby said wondering if it had something to do with wanda being locked up according to finns mother she was supposed to have been released earlier that day finn nodded so you can ask jess willa said what are we supposed to do maybeck asked spy on their spies that could be awkward so what can we do about it the everpractical willa asked can you stop what happened to me from happening again charlene asked it shouldnt have happened to you in the first place philby said that doesnt exactly answer my question she said philby said i can monitor the traffic set a data alarm if theres another surge of data high bandwidth usage i should be able to detect it that doesnt exactly sound promising maybeck said im open to suggestions said philby knowing he was the only one who understood any of what hed just said id like to gang up on one of these imitationflavor overtakers and have a little talk with them about what theyre up to maybeck said i wonder how strong they are when its three against one i hate to say it said willa but it might be bettersaferto try a girl first sally ringwald finn said she was in the photo with lady evil and amanda said shes now wearing green contacts can you or amanda get her alone with us someplace maybeck asked listen to you charlene said chastising them youre going to hurt some girl without even being sure shes part of this of course youd defend her you were working for the evil queen yourself besides who said were going to hurt her maybeck said scare her a little maybe sure its not like the ots dont scare us am i right you bet i am its time we return the favor is all if those guys are spies we need to know it before its too late heads nodded in agreement i was apparently a spy for them and i didnt even know it charlene reminded in a somber voice well keep that in mind maybeck said but it didnt sound as if he meant a word of it philbys cat elvis was a plump lazy cat the kind of plump that might get him mistaken for a pet raccoon the kind that scared off small dogs elvis like all cats enjoyed warm places to sleep on the couch nestled between pillows curled up in a shirt that had been tossed on the floor philbys laptop computer ran hot its internal fan emitted a pleasant catlike purr elvis jumped first to the empty office chair then up to the desk and lay across the purring keyboard luxuriating in its warmth at desk height he was nearly level with philby who slept soundly in his bed across the room elvis got up and circled once unable to find the perfect position his back paws hit several keys at once on the screen a window closed then another elvis took no notice hed found the perfect spot to sleep he had no idea that hed just closed the data traffic monitoring program philby used to police the dhi server no idea hed turned off philbys data alarm instead he settled his formidable self over the keys wiggling until gravity claimed various parts of him he placed his considerable cat chin down gently onto his crossed paws and closed his eyes behind him the laptop timed out and went into sleep mode along with him the boy in the bed knew no different willa slept with a bear not a real bear a stuffed bear but no normal stuffed bear either a sizable bear a gargantuan bear of proportions nearing those of a small child she slept with it alongside of her its head on a pillow or sometimes rocked up on its side with its black button eyes looking right at her as she drifted off to sleep and sometimes at the same magical moment of finding sleep she would sling an arm around it and pull it in close subconsciously enjoying its fuzzy fur as well as the comfort of having something so wonderfully close she dozed off dreaming of school that day of meeting the keepers at crazy glaze and of a particularly disturbing exchange of texts with philby theyd been texting a lot recently which she didnt mind at all but when she found out that philby not maybeck had kissed charlene to break the spell shed felt the tug of jealousy charlene with her athletic ability her incredible looks and her classa flirtingif she turned on the charm a fire hydrant would agree to go to the mall with her why had philby been the one to kiss her and not finn why had his recent texts felt more normal and less crushy mr totems brought her comfort but her mind wouldnt stop churning willas dream became intensely realistic suddenly she was laying beside a lake while clutching tightly to mr totems her bear across the lakerising out of the waterwas a green dinosaur a brontosaurus she thought though she was no expert it was not daylight but it was not exactly night either there was an eerie quality to the color of the light everything around her was glowing she let go of mr totems noticing the familiar shimmer to the outline of her forearm and hand she held her hand out in front of her admiring the translucent quality of her skin then a breeze blew across her and she shivered and she gasped it wasnt a dream at all she was a hologram a dhi she had crossed over in her sleep it wasnt supposed to have been able to happen they had talked about avoiding crossing over until they knew more until they knew it was safe philby would have told her if hed planned this otherwise it must be an extreme emergency she thought something that couldnt wait and here she was in her pajamas with mr totems somewhere in disney world at least her justice pajamas werent too embarrassingred pants and a longsleeve top with a panda bear and fireworks that glittered not exactly what she wanted to be seen in but better than a nightgown which was what charlene typically ended up in but which park was it willa wondered as she took her bearings she faced a streetnot much of a clue some buildings surrounding an open plazaagain not enough to tell her which park it was she sat on a raised platform it was nearly pitchblack above her except that she could just make out a patch of nighttime clouds swirling directly overhead in a doughnut of black her lack of familiarity with the place told her two things one she wasnt anywhere in the magic kingdom or the animal kingdomshe knew both parks too well two by process of elimination that left only epcot and disneys hollywood studios epcot had streets in the various world showcase attractions but none as wide as reallooking as what she faced a moment later she had it she was sitting beneath mickeys sorcerers hat now it made so much sense she felt stupid disneys hollywood studios of course she heard a rhythmic clomp clomp clomp reminding her at first of the sound of the football team crossing the running track as they ran out onto a field before a game the sounds rang of men and equipment she sat up only to realize she was clutching tightly to mr totems she held mr totems to the side so she could see and there coming up sunset boulevard was a groupno she thought a troopof soldiers they were so hard to see that she thought they must be wearing camouflage but as they drew closerclomp clomp clompshe saw it wasnt camouflage they were a solid dark green they were the army men from toy story but they werent toys at all they were lifesize and they were coming right at her willa grabbed mr totems and scrambled to her feet heading away from the army men keeping in shadow until she fled down a set of steps she sprinted once she reached the plaza running down commissary lane and putting some distance between herself and the troop arriving at the end of the street she heard more of the organized marching up ahead she turned left past some landscaping and kept running the sounds of marching soldiers all around her forced by the sounds to move to her left she now faced echo lake willa squeezed mr totems all the tighter this wasnt going well to either side of the lake were more army men enough to block her way behind her the two squads arrived now merged as one large unit mr totems its time to get out of here any suggestions mr totems didnt answer his expression didnt change willa wondered if something like this had happened to charlene the night before was she under some spell she didnt know about what did they want with her she recalled maybeck wanting to scare the truth out of one of the greencontactlens kids she hoped that wasnt what was intended for her if so it was already working she needed to get to epcot she needed the return close zee ranks came a heavily accented frenchmans voice willa didnt see him at first she was far more concerned with the circle of green army men tightening around her then she spotted him a man in a red velvet dinner jacket beneath which was a frilly white shirt and a bizarrely large black bow tie the tails of which disappeared into the velvet his pants were threequarter length tight around the calf and puffy on his upper legs with hookandeye laced brown leather boots spitpolished to gleaming he had long curly haira wig perhapsbeneath an exaggerated hat like those worn by the three musketeers judge claude frollo from the hunchback of notre dame it took her another few seconds to figure out what he was doing here in the studiosthat he was part of the fantasmic show the soldiers continued to close around her you have to understand my dear judge frollo said i have no patience for young children as a judge that is my verdict is a simple one guilty of having too much fun guilty misuse of time guilty irresponsible unacceptable behavior guilty so its nothing personal you understand it comes down to this it has fallen upon me to determine what your friend showed you at school im told it is a drawing and that it was drawn upon a small square tissue he stroked his chin a nervous habit what is the subject matter of this drawing if you please but i dont she said excusezmoi if you please she said i dont wish to tell you perplexed he cocked his head considering her i would be careful my dear my politeness is but a formality an inescapable part of my egalitarian french upbringing so civilized the french dont you think but make no mistakei would just as soon direct my minions here he said gesturing toward the hundred soldiers to test the water as it were to send you bottomfishing to drown you my dear did i caution you that im not a patient man when it comes to children i cant tell you what i dont know she said lying though lying well she thought but you were seen witnessed it was reported her head swooned which was it witnessed or reported one way would put the event in her school hallway another inside the private meeting with the other keepers the source of the leak was of vital importance to her she thought of philby and what hed do in her position gather intelligence she thought gain enough data enough information to form an exit strategy an escape plan finn would have schooled her to rely upon her dhi statusto maintain all clear but she was so scared her teeth would have been chattering had she not been biting down on her tongue if she were fifty percent dhi at the moment shed be lucky the thin blue outline that should have been surrounding her arms had dimmed to nearly nothing all clear was not an optionnot at the moment anyway judge frollo smiled a snarl of gnarly teeth and a twist of lip that turned her stomach if it please the court he said then guffawing since he was the court i will ask the defendant again what did you see drawn upon the tissue it was a napkin your honor she said trying to appeal to his sense of importance a tissue meant to catch crumbs in your lap it is not something one writes upon that task is better served by a pad of drawing paper or notepaper there may have been a logo or business name i was meant to take note of im sorry to say i dont happen to remember you do however recall what it is i intended to do to the infant boy in the animated motion picture that bears in part the name of a certain famous parisian cathedral notre dame the same you were going to kill him she said quasimodo your memory is not so bad after all i see excellent now try againone last timewhat was drawn upon thenapkinthe crumbcatching tissue and again as much as id like i cant describe something that wasnt there she said trying to speak somewhat like him trying to befriend him mores the pity my lack of patience is something i must improve upon very well seize her into the lake with her a wet nap a swim with the fishes drown her he roared waving his hand like a ballet dancers toward the lake strangely she thought only of mr totems if they drowned her what would it mean for mr totems would they tear him to pieces as much as she loathed the idea of leaving mr totems behind a plan began to form in her mind the soldiers were about to pick her up and throw her into the lake if at the exact moment she could substitute mr totems for herself she couldnt feel sorry for mr totems she had to think of it as mr totems sacrificing himself for her maybe she could come back and get him later who knew theyd come through a lot together bubble gum stuck in his fur the replacement of one of his button eyes a torn seam that left him spewing stuffing tiny plastic balls that smelled something like fish if she charged the line of army men they would simply catch hold of her no the answer was the water itself give them mr totems and then dive in and swim for the opposite side hoping to beat the cloddy soldiers with a second dismissive flick of his wrist judge frollo signaled the green soldiers to close around her willa felt lightheaded she held mr totems tightly threetwo a soldier reached for her she stuffed mr totems into the soldiers open arms pushed judge frollo into the others turned and ran five steps to the lakes edge shoot her she heard she dove white lines raced around her bullets zooming through the water she couldnt surface without being shot down down she swam pulling against the water and traveling deeper and deeper she had thought echo lake was only a few feet deep but suddenly it was much deeper the bullets werent reaching her now butas she looked upthey were zooming overhead like shooting stars and there in silhouette was mr totems floating on the lakes surface snow was falling all around him as bullets riddled his body not snow she realized but his stuffing mr totems had given his life for her willa screamed underwater bubbles rising above her like silver christmas balls she was smart enough not to breathe in to avoid inhaling a fatal lungful of lake water but she was sinking now her lungs aching she felt lightheaded something up aheada dark flowing shape interrupting the light on the surface a fish the size of a porpoise or a shark yet even more graceful it grew larger with its approach her lungs about to burst willa saw a flash of green a glimpse of rustcolored seaweed no she realized not seaweed but hair it was a mermaid it was ariel a girls long fingers reached out for her willa took hold ariel pressed her face close to hers and blew bubbles in a steady stream into her lips and willa drank them in the pain in her lungs subsided the two swam side by side ariel stopping every few yards and blowing another stream of bubbles for willa to inhale ariel led her across the lake and they surfaced together on the far side of a large white ship tied up to shore willa sucked in the fresh air and ariel held a finger to her lips silencing her there was much shouting and yelling from judge frollo and the sound of the soldiers feet pounding the pavement as they surrounded the lake ariel pointed down signaling for them to go underwater again willa was reluctant but nodded her consent where had ariel come from were there more characters like her willing to help the keepers they dove ariel led her along the tank wallthe lake was nothing more than a giant swimming pooluntil they reached a large hole the end of a pipe ariel filled willas lungs with air and smiled beautifully and willa knew it was going to be okay ariel swam into the opening first and willa followed the pipe grew increasingly darker unable to see willa felt outward and caught ariels hand suddenly the powerful tail propelled them willa had never moved so fast in the water twice ariel stopped to charge willas lungs in the dark twice willa drank in the air only to feel herself whisked away into the darkness again ariel pulled her upward willas head broke the surface again she gasped for air marveling that she was still alive they were in a large tank with a ladder and a metal platform she spotted a sign on the wall that read voyage of the little mermaidbackstage entrance an arrow pointed to a door ariel focused on the door then eased willa toward the stairs in the water willa shook her head i cant thank you enough for saving me but if the soldiers saw us they will come looking they will start here she said pointing to the sign i need to get to epcotmy friends and i the keepers ariel said in a beautiful lilting voice willa coughed you know about us ariel blinked and smiled at her my dear girl everyone knows about you you are our saviors our saviors what did she mean by that willa wondered are there more of you no no no were just kids were nobodies believe me im afraid no one would believe such nonsense said ariel we know who you are we are most grateful for what you are doing we allany of uswill do whatever we can to keep the magic the magic is what feeds us us there it was again it isnt safe here willa said i dont want to leave you please dont think me rude but i dont want to get you in any more trouble than youre already in you are shaking ariel said im cold one last swim ariel said i know a place the perfect place warm and i can be with you without concern i couldnt ask that youve done enough its okay dear girl willa ah you are the willow willa she corrected yes i know of course and shirley charlene of course i know you ask nothing it is after hours i can go back and forth tail or legs as i choose i am happy to help you come please swim with me a short distance i promise willa didnt want to use that backstage door she nodded ariel dove willa followed and grabbed her hand again the water was dark ariels powerful tail drove them left right and upstraight up harder and harder the tail pushed higher they swam willa didnt understand how it was possible when theyd started they couldnt have been more than ten or fifteen feet underground yet now it felt as if theyd climbed fifty feet or more ariel had not fed her any air her lungs were bursting as they broke through the surface she coughed and gasped for air they found themselves in a much bigger tank again a metal ladder ran down below the waters surface stretching high above them to a circular catwalk surrounding the tank as ariel pulled herself up the rungs willa watched as her mermaids tail changed into a girls long bare legs and bare bottom i keep these handy just for this transition ariel said once theyd reached a steel catwalk at the top she had her back to willa as she slipped on a pair of bikini bottoms that shed had cleverly wrapped around the back strap of her halter top hidden by her long hair she led willa out a heavy metal door and onto another catwalk willa nearly screamed as she reached to steady herself they were a hundred feet above ground high up on a catwalk balcony surrounding the park water tower but willa like philby was a climber and had no trouble with the height once she realized where she was ms cheerleader charlene could do some climbing too but more of the gymnastic variety willa and philby were the keepers who did the rope courses and climbing wall as afterschool activities it was where shed first started liking him itsbeautiful willa said yes i love it up here theres a lot to be said for being human you saved my life mermaids ariel said interrupting have a longstanding tradition of rescuing sailors at sea it would seem that is about all were good for that and exciting homesick sailors in the first place in my house youre known for your singing yes wellthat came later what do we do now asked willa i am not sure i only know that no one will find us here no one will see us i often spend time hereoverlooking the park watching the guests playing the occasional prank did you know that mermaids like to make practical jokes first ive heard of it yes well how would you feel if shipbuilders were constantly carving sculptures of you on the front of their ships from the waist up its undignified such things deserve practical joking can i ask you something willa said you just did willa giggled you said you knew of the keepers of course are thereothers who would consider helping us i told you you have many friends here you might be surprised to discover how many stand with you here in the world and in the land as well we lack only a leader we assume that is why you and the others have come to lead us willas head spun finn had often talked about wayne making reference to leadership shed always thought of it in terms of the keepersnever the disney characters themselves willa had never considered that she and the others were there to lead a movement she doubted finn or anyone else had either my father king triton says a kingdom has room for only one ruler ariel said our group is more of a democracy willa said but maybe were here to help you find a leader what about mickey isnt mickey your leader ariel locked into a distant stare shed gone somewhere far away we can discuss this another time i think her entire demeanor had changed willa filed the information away for later why had mention of mickey closed off ariel willa said let me ask you this if youre here she reached over and touched the beautiful girl does that mean ursulas here too of course everyones here arent they there are so few you can trust here believe me we need a plan willa mumbled or a script theres always a script to follow not always im afraid willa said this is one of those times we need to write our own script willa looked out on the empty park occasionally she caught movement from a particular direction but by the time she turned to look in that direction the street would be empty the park a ghost town willa recalled with some dread judge frollos eagerness to drown her how the soldiers had appeared so well organized they had been waiting for her to cross over they had wanted her to describe the sketch jess had shown her at school it meant only one thing someone had told them about jess showing it to her the spies were real somethings going on here she allowed to slip out oh theres a great deal going on dear girl we just so seldom see it were in danger yes it was as if this was old news to ariel i need to get to epcot to the return she was thinking but you just got here ariel complained my friends and i want to help willa reminded but we can only help if were together like a team friends a team my friends are a crab and some fish im all alone here ariel said wistfully not anymore youre not said willa youre part of the team now while willa was sitting with her feet draped over the catwalk surrounding the disneys hollywood studios water tank finn was awake contemplating a text message hed received from an unidentified sender it wasnt that he didnt receive text messages of course he didhundreds a week maybe morebut this particular message held more interest than most wwwthekingdomkeeperscomkey beneath the url was the title of the book and a page numbera book finn knew all too well a book written about him and his friends underneath the title of the book a single letter w it was that w that had held his attention for the past hour or so that letter and all it represented philby had been contacted by wayne at school hed sent them on the kim possible adventure now this wayne was becoming involved again finns first instinct had been to find the book and go to the web site that was why the book was sitting open to the right of the keyboard and why finn was sitting in the chair in front of his computer but for the longest time he couldnt bring himself to do it he just didnt completely believe wayne had sent the texteven though wayne had given him and the others their phones and therefore would know how to text him even though he was eager to connect with wayne the problem was this wayne never made it simple finn couldnt think of a time that wayne had given them something easy to solve or easy to do the method hed used to contact philby supported that notion why hadnt he just texted philby if he thought texting was safe wayne had a tendency to surprise arriving uninvited in a chat room or interrupting a skype session a straight text seemed so unlike him but that w was like a finger drawing finn closer to his keyboard the longer he stared at it the more tempted he was finally he webbed the fingers of both hands cracked his knuckles by bending them backward and placed them upon the keyboard he typed the address into his browser the page loaded and he was instructed to hold the particular page of the book up to the computers internal video camera he pushed the laptop back a few inches and hoisted the book he hit enter the computer bonged and the screen changed color success the screen declared for a moment there was no change it was late and he was tired all that anticipation had been coursing through his veins for the past hour like caffeine from a soda with nothing happening a wave of fatigue overcame him he felt like a pool toy losing its air a condition that left him wholly unprepared for what happened next wayne appeared on top of his desk just in front of the keyboard a small hologram of wayne no more than four inches tall impossibly reallooking finn waved his hand through the image just to confirm it was what it was whoa finn said aloud can you hear me hello finn it was waynes voicethere was no mistaking the scratchy quality but maybe because of the projection or the transmission the words sounded somewhat artificial almost glued together the intonation wrong what exactly where is that really you where are you come downlowerfinn look atmy face i should seeyoubetter finn had heard philby talk about augmented reality appsarbaseball cards that came to life as holograms on your desk maps that did the same thing the keepers had heard rumors that disney was considering making kingdom keepers playing cards with an ar component allowing them to appear as d images just as wayne was now appearing some augmented reality could even be animateda baseball player swinging a bat a dancer spinning on her toesbut he had never heard of an ar element projecting in real time the way this one was it was like a d video chat and finn found it captivating he backed up his chair and lowered his head as instructed in order to look directly at waynes small face somewhere in the far reaches of finns mind a warning light went off the choppiness of waynes voice could be a transmission problem as he suspectedbut why would the hologram be so clear and the audio be so choppy that didnt make sense the audio sounded editedwords cut and pasted into sentences as he lowered himself toward waynes small face finn simultaneously cleared his thoughts and pictured a dark tunnel with a pinprick of light showing far far in the distance he allowed that light to grow closer allowed himself to sink not only toward the desk but into a peaceful blissful state all clear that isbetter said the hologram then as finn looked at wayne the face transformed no longer a man with white hair but suddenly the stern face of a beautiful woman the evil queens mouth was already moving her voice both haunting and musical as soft as a whisper no one will tell the curse reversed seen by the sister when kissing jezebel finns fingers and toes tingled with the mention of kissing jezebelthe name jess had gone by a few years earlierhe panicked and he slipped out of all clear the evil queen repeated her message as soft as a whisper no one will tell finn was caught in a state of partial all clear a dangerous placementally alert but with tingling toes and fingers part mortal he was real enough to be wounded yet enough all clear to believe he was safe in this interim state he managed to reach forward move the mouse and click the back button on his browser the computer screen showed an algebra web page hed been using for homework the evil queen hologram sparkled and vanished finn sat back into his chair feelingdifferent the pageforward button on the browser flashed as if hed clicked it with the mouse which he had not thekingdomkeeperscom page reloaded the evil queen hologram reappeared someone was controlling his computer the queen began reciting the verse again finn pulled the power plug on his computer but the laptop being batterypowered continued to run he shut the lid and the computer went to sleep he focused at that space in front of his keyboard where the evil queen had stood no matter how he fought against it he could hear her as soft as a whisper no one will tell the curse reversed seen by the sister when kissing jezebel kissing jess he spat on the floor before he knew what he was doing it wasnt that he didnt like jess of course he did but not in that way why jess why would the evil queen want him to do that was it simply a matter of making amanda jealousdividing the sisters what would that accomplish he would have to reboot his computer in safe mode and run a virus check there was work to do before he could attempt a chat session or email he put the machine to work searching for the backdoor or bug that had allowed it to be controlled remotely he knew he should have probably allowed philby to look at the machine first should have given philby a chance to trace the infection back to whoever had caused it but he had no desire to share the stupid verse with anyone just the mention of it could have the desired effect anger jealousy confusion he had to think this through he relived the incident convincing himself hed been all clear at the time the verse had been recited nothing to worry about if it was a spell it had not reached him it didnt occur to him for even a split second that such denial might be part of the spell that by not doing anything he was already doing something stone stairsteps at least they looked like stone stairsteps leading up to a box or possibly a door jess moved slowly like she was trying to walk through jello finn was there practical finn organized finn amandas finn jess preferred boys like kaden keller more on the unpredictable side more wild but amanda was crushingno doubt about it and jess liked finn a lot so she was happy for amanda so why she wondered was she just standing there as finn walked up to her with that look in his eyea look any girl knew a look that said he was going to kiss her and why she wondered was she going to allow it to happen when she knew how it would hurt amanda he took her by the shoulders closed his eyes and pressed his lips to hers and he stayed there like that a real kiss that flooded through her like a sugar rush lips to toes by the time she awoke and began to sketch in her diary she knew full well it had been only a dream but with her dreams came a connection between now and then between here and there the present and the future only later could she ever make full sense of such a dreama day a week a month adults had labeled it a power amanda called it a blessing jess often thought of it as a curse she knew some piece of the dream would happen but not when or why or how it might change things upon seeing her sketches the keepers often looked for answers she didnt have she could see the future she couldnt interpret it but the kiss lingered on her lips it had felt realincredibly real she adjusted her pillow and continued to draw she started with the background firstthe five uneven steps seen in profile rising to a landing she loved the sound of the pencil lead scratching the paper she felt no fatigue she enjoyed these visions they no longer came as often as they once had as a child shed had several a week shed seen a flood a car crash a fire shed made the newspaper with the prediction of the fire that was when the doctors had started hooking up wires to her when the military men had begun asking questions when shed been taken from her original foster parents and moved in with the fairlies before she and amanda ran away the visions came much less frequently now a secret only amanda knew sometimes in groupsthree or four in a week and then none for months sometimes a piece of a dream but not enough to stick with her not enough to draw being in the parks hanging with the keepers seemed to increase their frequency and intensity she drew the scene of the kiss as best she could her artistic abilities having improved over time she not only caught the angle of their heads correctly but the profile of the boy really looked like finn and though the girl was less obvious she knew it was her it was one dream she would never allow to happen would never do this to amanda had no interest herself if finn wanted it too bad not ever she heard amanda stir in the overhead bunk so she switched off the small light and covered the drawing with her hand in case amanda leaned over curious but amanda only rolled over jess switched the light on and finished drawing the kiss she studied the girls face more carefully she couldnt be absolutely sure it was her but she knew what shed felt she knew what was going to happen please charlene said appealing to her mother over the breakfast table its no big secret that i like him her mothers one soft spot was her daughters love life there were times that charlene felt as if her mother was trying to be her same age again which was so random it pained her to even consider it but the fact was her mother had been a high school cheerleader had been pretty and according to her chased by all the boys and she seemed to want all that for charlene as well you dont want to be the one doing the pursuing her mother cautioned she advised charlene about her interest in certain boys as if she were coaching a chess match id just be visiting winter park for a day thats his school ahyeah which will be seen as you pursuing him i have friends there too mom do i want to hang with him at lunch yes of course but its not like im going to follow him down the halls or something its one day she and amanda had plans but she couldnt go there her mother understood boys charlene knew which buttons to push i can spend time with my friends after school i never get a chance to see them anymore with graduation from middle school some kids had gone to different high schools because of redistricting her mother knew the situation theyd talked about it often enough i know i know her mother said charlene heard the change in tone shed won all we have to do is have you sign me in at the office itll take two seconds and youll call or text me when schools out promise her mother smiled you must like him a lot you have no idea charlene said as the buzzer sounded leading into the lunch period charlene wearing her visitor tag waited by the water fountains in the west hall as arranged in a hasty meeting with amanda earlier she peeled off the tag and stuck it inside her shirt so it would remain sticky but not be seen she pulled out the section of panty hose from the pocket of her jean shorts and kept it scrunched in her hand her heart was beating the way it did before a gymnastics competition amanda appeared among the mass of students crowding the hallway wearing a look of fierce determination charlene knew what they were about to do went against everything amanda held dear knew that for amanda this was about friendship and loyalty and her dedication to finn and the keepers knew that she was like charlene dying inside with anticipation follow me amanda said all business charlene stepped into line behind her amanda made her way to the stairway they held close to the banister and hurried down passing other students they reached the ground floor and continued down to the basement level its all about timing amanda said over her shoulder you remember your assignment yes of course you have the stockings charlene held up her balled fist the basement level was far less crowded they walked together down a hallway and turned to the right shell be coming by here any minute amanda said pulling open a door band room empty this period okay said charlene well be expelled if we do this wrong i know so lets not do it wrong im in the hall youre inside but out of sight instructed amanda i remember ill cough i know charlene turned into the darkened room and tucked around the corner her chest ready to explode there was a bass drum on a metal stand risers with chairs and music stands an upright piano she left the lights off bracing herself for what was to come she pulled the piece of panty hose down over her hair and head obscuring her face amanda wore the section of rolled panty hose on her head like a winter cap kneeling with her face to the wall her hands in her computer bag digging around as if looking for something sally ringwald came down the hall with two girlfriends now came the tricky part without turning without showing her face amanda said hey sally got a minute ill catch up sally told her friends as predicted the two girls turned up the stairs amanda had chosen this spot for a reason whats up sally said to amandas back amanda coughed and pulled the stocking down over her face and turned around looking like something from a slasher movie what the but sally didnt have time to complete her exclamation amanda lifted her hands and pushed sally lifted off her feet and flew backward through the doorway skidding on her bottom across the floor amanda stepped through and charlene pulled the door shut when sally jumped off the floor she wasnt even human she sprang like a mountain lion crashing into amanda her green eyes flashing in the dim light she and amanda smacked into the wall by the piano charlene came at her from the side grabbing an arm sally tossed her off like she was a stuffed animal charlene landed hard amanda pushed for a second time sally lifted off her feet and crashed into a music stand taking it down as she knocked some folding metal chairs out of the way landing in a heap amanda pushed again sally slid on her bottom and was pinned to the riser amanda held her there still pushing arms extended charlene crossed the room and was slammed to the floor as if a ninetymileperhour wind had struck her groaning she rose and with amanda still pushing charlene wrestled sallys arms behind her back and tangled their legs together keeping sally down amanda released her push the three girls were panting out of breath charlene said coarsely what do they want sally wrestled but couldnt get free of charlenes hold power sally said through clenched teeth whats anybody want from us amanda said youre insignificant dont flatter yourselves so insignificant that youre spying on us charlene said pulling the girls arms back harder to make her point whats that make you busy she said snickering whoareyou amanda asked for the girls eyes were wide and evillooking sally ringwald laughed but it wasnt a girls laugh it was a womans the future she said not my future charlene said gasping it was taking all her considerable strength to restrain sallys arms both she and amanda feared what sally might be capable of if she could get free there is no yours or mine where the futures concerned its ours you can either be on the right side or the wrong side sally said there is no side to the future only to the things we do with it the choices we make amanda said what do you know the future always arrives before you can stop it said sally talk to me saturday morning to amanda it sounded like a recruiting line she felt slightly lightheaded the pushing had drained her charlene looked as bad as she felt they were out of time how many of you are there this had been the question philby most wanted asked more each day sally answered more than you can possibly imagine we have big imaginations charlene said increasing her hold and winning a wince of pain on sallys face your kind think dreams really do come true then dream on charlene flashed amanda a lookher signal she couldnt hold on much longer amanda had been expecting it she nodded now amanda called out charlene let go and rolled amanda pushed sending sally into a back somersault and into another music stand and more chairs she and charlene ran for the door they got into the hall and both girls grabbed the door handle together and held on the door was struck from the other side by what sounded like a truck the entire jamb dislocated in the masonry wall on three amanda said onetwothree they let go of the door handle stripped off the panty hose masks and ran as fast as theyd ever run for the stairway they heard an enormous crash behind them as they climbed the stairs out of breath reaching the mob scene of students they slowed hooked elbows and walked calmly into the surge of bodies they heard footsteps flying up the stairs behind them but never looked back they were deep enough into the mob that their clothes could not be seen to be identified they turned into the lunchroom packed with other students amanda looked around for finn he wasnt there finn saw greg luowski down the school hallway standing at a locker and recalled their strange encounter on the street an agent for the overtakers was it possible did waynes kim possible message about friends turning their backs on you have something to do with luowski or only charlenes erratic behavior luowski could never be considered a friend to finn but did wayne know that next he spotted a woman wearing a visitors sticker down the hall she was staring at him her face vaguely familiar yet unknown to him the way her gaze locked onto him he had no doubt she was there to see him worse she was upset any kid knew that look on the face of a grownup that was when he realized how a stranger could look so familiar behind the crinkly eyes and puckered lips willa looked back at him the woman started toward him at the same time luowski caught finn staring luowskis menacing expression seemed to say you want something finn looked away rather than provoke the bulldog he didnt need luowski in his face finn whitman the woman said now upon him im willas mom finn said yes weve met before but it was some time ago i need a word with you perfect what had he done now you have a class in five minutes so it needs to be now right now that or we can do this with your parents after school his father no way next periods my lunch period finn said im okay anything but his father is there someplace we can talk gulp finn checked out a classroom then another he held the door for her hoping it might score some points they entered she studied the classroom as if making sure they were alone double gulp she ran her tongue into her upper teeth when his mom did that it was to bite back her words to keep herself from saying the first thing that came to mind i dont know where to begin she said whatevers going on young man whatever youre up to you had better stop it you had better fix it right now finns heart beat so powerfully that it occupied his entire torso he was having trouble breathing he could tell she was just getting warmed up he held back the wisecracks wondering why they always came to mind when he found himself in trouble dont pretend you dont know what im talking about im in no mood to play games shed been crying he understood that now red eyes fatigue say something she insisted he shrugged she hadnt left him many options he had no idea what she was talking about but had warned him not to say so willa is not in school today in case you havent heard her eyes had narrowed to little lasers i didnt know he said no of course you didnt she said sarcastically making him feel like a liar his parents did this all the timeanswered their own question before giving finn a chance to speak she doesnt go here he reminded her how was he supposed to know that willa had skipped school why was he suddenly responsible shes in bed asleep willas mother puckered her lips as if about to cry asleep as in unable to wake up like terrence maybeck that time you all have a name for it i believe sleeping beauty something like that he felt like hed been punched the syndrome finn croaked out sleeping beauty syndrome it had to be something elseanything else the flu food poisoning the panic started in his legs as a painful chill and ruptured through the rest of him the syndrome did willas mom have any idea of what she was suggesting for willa to be in sbs philby would have had to cross her over for philby to cross her over he would have at least told finn if not all the keepers philby had not told finn so either philby had turned traitorhe recalled waynes kim possible warningor someone else had crossed her over exactly as had happened to charlene both considerations wereterrifying which only drove the cold all the deeper into his bones now you listen to me young man finn felt himself go rigid the imagineers supposedly repaired the dhi program they met with usthe parentsand told us that this kind of thingthis crossing over or whatever you all call itcouldnt happen again wouldnt happen again but now it hasto my daughterand i want some answers she sniffled back some tears i want willa back shes always said you were the leader i have several options the police the imagineers the hospital willa made me promise that if anything like this ever happened i would come to you first so i have she told me that the imagineers couldnt help terrence and doctors only made things worse for dell philby so before i take the next stephere i am awaiting your explanation finn could barely believe what he was hearing what if other keepers were in the syndrome and he didnt know about it what if he was the only one not in the syndrome he hadnt even seen amanda this morning at school the cold panic owned him well young man iahthe thing is what was he supposed to say he had more questions than she had all he wanted to do was start textingbut he had willas mom to contend with and texting was illegal in school he looked around considering leaving her standing there and skipping out of school he muttered yes its true theythe imagineersfixed the dhi server at least he thought they had but thereve been some glitches in the past couple days a week maybe his mouth uttered the explanations but his mind was elsewherewaynes warning the photo of the evil queen with luowski and others did she have the kids working for her a spell would explain luowskis supernatural strength he continued the imagineerswaynewarned philby that stuff was happening if you contact themthe imagineerstheyll back that up as for stopping it if shes really crossed over if are you calling me a liar young man oh come on finn said suddenly annoyed he was halfcrazed with a mind that couldnt stop thinking about a million things at once why wouldnt she just go away listen the same thing happened to charlene two nights ago we have no idea whats going on that came out wrong we got charlene back we can get willa back but this is not us okay she crossed her arms defiantly if you think i am going to stand idly by while my daughter is in a coma you are gravely mistaken hed seen his own mother this way unpredictable terrorridden poor willa he thought stuck in some park not knowing how shed gotten there did the overtakers have her why what did they want just go away would you he felt like shouting i will cross over tonight and find her ill bring her back promise he was promising something he couldnt necessarily deliver and he thought they both knew it the police that had been mentioned as her first option he thought about wanda being arrested and now it made so much sense if the overtakers wanted to eliminate the competition where would they start with wayne with waynes daughter and then one by one the keepers he thought about the photothe greeneyed students with the evil queen he felt a shiver down to his toes they were under attack hed said that to her but only now did he fully grasp his own words it was allout war and the keepers were late to the party he needed to settle down to project confidence instead he felt paranoid terrified spooked but he had to keep her from complaining to the police or even to the imagineers the syndrome was nothing to mess withnot even the imagineers understood it the way the keepers did he tried to explain if you go to the imagineers the first thing theyll do is shut down the dhi servers in each park thats why she told you to come to me first if the servers are shut down shes done was that what the ots wanted he wondered to take the keepers out of the picture by getting the entire dhi system shut down shes in the syndrome she wanted you to come to me so that wed go get her let me do that please its what she wants to happen do not tell me what my daughter wants she said though he could see her processing everything hed told her she appraised him with a searching skeptical eye she said you have one night understand after that its the police the imagineers and the doctors okay he said thank you one night and ill tell you something this is going to be the longest night of my life tears ran down her cheeks her lips trembled she looked so afraid for what its worth shes gonna be okay the woman sobbed go to lunch she said in her motherly way lunch finn thought right he said knowing he would head straight to his locker and start sending texts wllasbs return her asap phones werent allowed in class but you could use them outside once school was dismissed the workaround for the students was to keep their phones on vibrate in their lockers where they would check them between classes without being seen for the ten minutes between classes the hallways were now less crowded instead of mass confusion a hundred kids had their faces planted inside their lockers as they sent and received texts bullies and jocks would take plastic rulers and run down the hallway slapping bottoms an unpleasant but tolerated punishment for the right to communicate if a teacher approached the phone was replaced by a textbook and the locker was closed it was almost impossible for them to bust a kid when philby read finns text he believed it a mistake or worse a prank sent by one of the greeneyes hed double checked the number it was finn willa couldnt be stuck in the syndrome because like charlene hed never crossed her over more to the point hed been monitoring the servers bandwidth he had an alarm set there had been no alarm last nighttherefore willa had not crossed into the parks as her hologram but then he remembered finding elvis asleep on his laptop late for the bus hed pushed elvis off and had shut the laptops lid scooped it off his desk and stuffed it into his backpack without a second thought he felt sick to his stomach when hed reopened the laptop at school had the dhi monitoring program been open he couldnt remember he was the last line of defense against the overtakers had he messed up had he failed willa of all people he raced down the hall to hugos locker his head ready to explode willa ive gotta borrow your laptop he said he wasnt asking no you dont hugo said i need it for science hugo didnt even look like hugo something was different about him but everything looked different the school hallway seemed about two feet wide philbys world was all backward ill trade you you can use mine he offered you have a data card i dont i need internet access i cant be on the school server please whats up keepers stuff such as later i gotta do this now ive got a class please hugo exchanged laptops philby hurried into the boys room locked himself in a stall and set up hugos computer on his lap while sitting on a toilet seat he used hugos wireless data card to connect to the internet entered the url for the back door into the dhi server and typed his login password he navigated to the page where he could manually cause a returnthe same set of instructions that were used for the fob when inside the parksand typed from memory willas twentysixcharacter id string the window flashed hed lost the handshake he doublechecked the data card connectionall was goodand reentered the url ready to start over he reached the logon page and reentered his password incorrect password access denied believing he must have typed too fast he tried again incorrect password access denied now he had real problems a third failure in a row would mean hed be blocked from trying to enter a password for twentyfour hours willa didnt have twentyfour hours wondering if it might be a problem with hugos data card philby decided that the only thing to do was to get to the dhi server in person and make an attempt at the password from there he texted finn major problems password not workin call emergency meeting the rest of the school day dragged on impossibly slowly several times philby debated skipping but hed never done that in his life and he had no desire to be caught and grounded for eternity that would make matters even worse for everyone especially him he traded back computers with hugo before seventh period thanking him he and finn maybeck and charlene met at the marble slab ice cream shop charlene told them about the confrontation with sally ringwald shed been too hyper to catch every last word but she gave them all she could remember amanda will have the full fouroneone she said but whats important is that sally is definitely under some kind of spell theres lots more where she came from and something big is going down on saturday for what its worth weve got to move on an anxious philby said willa it came out as a moan the point is the server passwords not taking he explained basically im going to be locked out of the server if i try it remotely again so ive got to make it count why wouldnt your password take maybeck asked he was met with three blank facesone of them with strawberry ice cream on both corners of her lips if its the imagineers security kicking in philby said its not so badmaybe someone would help us but somehow i doubt it with everything thats been happening ive been thinking about it all day i lost the connection after i first logged on i thought it was the data cardyou know like a cell phone dropping out happens all the time but its possiblemaybe not probable but possiblethat my keystrokes were captured its possible that the system was reset right after id logged on in order to break my connection by the time i was back on my password had been removed my back door closed the ots charlene said yeah they could have been waiting for me finn quoted the kim possible mission everyone needs a server now and then you think wayne was trying to tell us the ots had hacked the server they didnt like that you came and got me charlene said they arent about to allow that to happen again so they ambushed us maybeck said without access without control of the server we cant cross over philby said the only way we can help willa is to return her weve got two choices we can either hack back into the server or we can go into the parks try to find her and then use the fob to return her good luck maybeck said we dont know which park we dont know where she is in whatever park shes in that could take years maybecks dhi had been locked up in a maintenance cage inside space mountain he might never have been found there if i hack the server well know which park shes in philby reminded the activity log will tell us but finn said in order to see the activity log weyouhave to hack the server so we have to get to the server as us not dhis right i mean we cant cross over because weve lost access to the server which is the whole point right philby confirmed we go in as us hopefully i get us back online after that we can cross over if thats what we have to do maybeck cursed and pushed away from the table disgusted this rots he said weve got to get her back what are we waiting for we can use our employee passes we get philbo into the server room and let him do his thing if the return doesnt work from there we go into whatever park and we get her back ive been therein the syndrome so have you philbo it sucks weve got to do this wayne had supplied them with employee cards that allowed them to enter the parks as cast members they rarely used them keeping them for this kind of emergency my mother expects me home charlene said i have an orthodontist appointment this afternoon i could sneak out later but if i miss that appointment she might start calling your parents jelly will cover for us maybeck said she knows what its like to have a kid stuck in the syndrome trust me she wouldnt wish that on anyone you can all tell your rents youre coming to my place to study for an exam we arent in exams philby pointed out yeah okay i got you but you think your parents know that maybeck said ariel had come and gone but basically stayed through the night with willa on the water tower with the sunrise she moved willa through water pipes to what she called the grotto as a dhi willa was stuck in her pajamas which was going to make it a problem to blend in she spent the day in hiding hatching a plan if she were going to return she needed the allimportant fob but the fob was currently hidden in epcot and shed been sent into the studios between the two parks was a sea of dhi shadowan area that lacked dhi projectors this would be to her advantage dhi shadow meant shed be invisible for most of the path that connected epcot to the studios as long as she could get out of the studios without being spotted this was doable shed get over to epcot find the fob and return the nightmare would be over i can do this willa told herself shed leave the studios at sunset when the light was soft and her dhi qualities more difficult to spot the occasional sparkle the blue outline home her bed her mom almost too good to be true she couldnt wait the parks experienced a big turnover around dinnertime kids got tired adults got hungry epcot was an evening favoriteterrific food and a spectacular fireworks display entering epcot would not be easy she had no pass or ticket no money and worse she was a hologram wearing pajamas im leaving she told ariel im going to try to get out of the gates without being seen i can help you youve done so much for me already ill be fine i can pose for photographs and autographs provide a distraction a diversion i think eric calls it it was the first time shed mentioned eric so hesreal i mean as far as characters go eric ariel blushed oh hes very real as real as real can be but they keep him in the magic kingdom hes part of the stage show there in front of the castle we rarely see each other willa wondered if there was another ariel in the magic kingdom or if that one was only a cast member wondered if eric had all the mermaid company he wanted while she sat here pining for him a diversion might help consider it done dont you need a handler to make an appearance someone who takes care of you willa asked the handlers come and go dear girl whos the one whos been doing this all these years i think i can manage but wont you get in trouble thats the idea isnt it the more trouble the better the diversion i cant let you do that for me actually you cant stop me said ariel she was beaming i havent had this kind of fun inwellprobably longer than youve been alive willa looked at herariel was maybe sixteen or seventeen you never get any older she hadnt thought of what it was like to be a character not a cast member the characters didnt change while the imagineers handlers and staff came and went year after year it was the same shows the same posing for photos and signing autographs it had to drive the characters halfcrazy no wonder the overtakers were rebelling ariel hung her head clearly saddened by the reminder no ariel said as she looked up a coy grin played across her face not older but i do get wiser ariels appearance at the front gate did the trick excited guests encircled her winning the attention of security guards willa joined the mass of departing park visitors and left the park unnoticed soon she was walking in the direction of epcot most everyone else rode the monorail or the buses only she and a few others walked when willa noticed her hand and arm sparkling she stopped to let others pass she had reached the edge of the dhi projection coverage a few more yards and pieces of her image would decay leaving holes in her or missing limbs she would be human swiss cheese and would likely have guests either lining up for autographs or calling so she moved up into the flowers and shrubs that hid a cyclone fence remaining amid the plants she continued on paralleling the sidewalk her elbow and part of her shoulder disappeared her left leg from the knee down vanished for a moment she was a set of headless pajamas finally she vanished completely dhi shadow was a weird state she could hear though not touch she could see though narrowly as if though a camera lens whatever this state was technically it wasnt perfect once while in dhi shadow she and the others had been able to pick up sand from the floor of a tepee there seemed to be exceptions to the physical laws of nature philby explained these as having to do with the survival instinct comparing them to a mother picking up and moving a car that pinned her child or a father heaving a slab of concrete aside as if it were styrofoam back on the sidewalk now in full dhi shadow willa picked up the pace walking faster she approached a family coming at her and moved into the grass to avoid them one of the two young kids a girl no older than eight let out a yip ghosts mommy ghosts i heard a ghost oh shush ginny the woman said to her husband she complained i told you that ride would scare them he mumbled something as they continued on a chill passed through her how many times as a child had she felt a ghost in the room how many times when taking the trash out at night had she felt someone watching through the dark for how long had dhis been around she wondered her hologram began reappearing as she neared the boardwalk her image sparkled and sputtered some kids pointed at her making fun of her pajamas a couple of girls recognized her as a disney host interactive from the magic kingdom they approached her for her autograph willa explained dhis couldnt sign autographs and allowed the girls to wave their arms through her free of fear and still in her dhi state she strayed off course a few minutes later and walked through a fence joining a roadway behind the eiffel tower it was only a matter of reaching the fob now dusk had settled it would soon be dark she was perhaps a quarter mile from the fountain plaza from the return from home she set off in that direction in determined strides with only an hour to go before the magic kingdom closed for the night finn philby and maybeck used the employee passes to enter which didnt register on the computer system and allowed them to avoid the front gates operations management prohibited them from entering any of the parks as themselves without prior approval and now they risked being spotted for camouflage all three wore as close to the same clothes as their projected dhis wore this way theyd be mistaken as their own disney hosts but they werent perfectly identical costumes maybeck had for some reason chosen a pair of dark socks finn no longer owned the running shoes hed worn when modeling for his dhi so he was wearing the black ones hed colored with a sharpie they walked slowly side by side behind the buildings on main street in the direction of cinderella castle they appeared relaxed and selfconfident never a problem for maybeck as they happened past other cast members they heard comments trailing behind them like can you believe how real those things look the three fought to keep smiles off their faces the magic kingdom had been built atop a series of interconnecting tunnels called the utilidor through these tunnels passed cast members and electric golf carts that served as small trucks control of the parks technology was handled from offices in the utilidor which included a massive computer server room the brains of the park this was the keepers destination multiple backstage castmemberonly entrances to the utilidor existed throughout the park as the three approached the entrance just behind the main street ice cream parlor maybeck blocked finn and philby pushing them back against the wall pirates finn and philby spotted them a pair of pirates casually talking in front of a double doorway up ahead thats the door to the utilidor professor philby said overtakers finn said must be maybeck agreed theyre guarding the entrance just in case we come along to spoil all their fun we could try the entrance by splash mountain finn suggested wed have to cross the entire park to get there philby said and if these guys are guarding this one others are probably guarding that one too we need another way in maybeck said how do you guys feel about getting filthy dirty finn asked he led them through the crowded parking lot staying as far away from the pirates as possible as they neared a fulllength mirror at the cast member entrance into the park a foul smell overpowered them a message on the mirror read make it a magical day for our guests what the maybeck said stinkeee shh keep your voice down said finn but the constant roar to their right covered their voices he led them toward that noise an area just before cast members entered the park tucked behind a plywood screen with empty cardboard boxes piled in a corner and a large pipe three feet in diameter sticking out of the concrete brilliant said philby as he realized where they were maybeck focused on the pipe it had a weighted lid and was surrounded by warning signs no way he said you are not getting me down there thatll work said finn we need you to stand guard we all have our phones i wouldnt count on ours working down there philby cautioned macbeth finn said trying to get back at maybeck for all the nicknames he called him will stay up here to keep an eye on the pirates youll text us if you see any change in them because it may mean trouble for us philby and i will try to get to the server room maybeck said so i text if i see something awkward up here is that all no said philby you see this red stop button kind of hard to miss maybeck said the plastic emergency button was huge if you hear the system restart then you hit that button finn added wed rather not get sucked through the system and spit out into the compactor its up to you to see that doesnt happen could be bad for our health said philby as in fatal the wind generated to suck the trash out of the park reaches sixty miles an hour in the pipe thats almost hurricane speed got it said maybeck hit the red button kill the wind seriously philby said red button easy enough okay then finn said to philby ready as ill ever be said philby finn punched the red button the roar ground to a stop philby lifted the heavy lid and the smell intensified glad its you guys going down there and not me maybeck said pinching his nose we wont have long philby warned engineering base over in the studios will see a warning that the systems down theyll try a restart before anything else soill go first finns only other time in the trash system had been a long time ago maleficent had been chasing him hed been terrified he climbed over the sticky edge into the steel pipe while philby and maybeck held open the lid maybecks face was puckered in disgust as the putrid odors of rotting trash wafted up finn let go and dropped he fell a few feet landing in some wet slop at the bottom of a similarsize steel pipe that ran parallel with the surface a tunnel within the tunnel out of the way philby said the pipe was too small to crouch and stay on two feet finn was forced to drop to hands and knees amid the sticky disgusting goo of old garbage he called back coarsely you might want to get your flashlight out before you put your hands in this stuff philby dropped in behind him flashlight on finns shadow spread before him amid the garbage and debris that adhered to every inch of the pipewrappers crushed cups and cans chewing gum rubber bands grotesque rotting remnants of former meals banana peels turkey leg bones and every kind of plastic container ever made most of them unrecognizable the smell only grew worse the farther they crawled finn held his breath for as long as possible but an inhale was inevitable and when it came it tasted like he was eating trash i think im going to puke philby said from behind him go ahead it might improve the smell by now base has tried to reset thatll take a couple of minutes to be in effect when maybeck pulls a second emergency stop theyll send a team to investigate we need to be out of here by then this thing is basically a wind tunnel philby could recite the statistics but finn had experienced the trash pipe what philby didnt seem to grasp was the power of that suction if the trash bags were moving at sixty miles an hour the two of them would be also some things were better left unsaid he picked up the pace though it wasnt exactly fast going the slime coating the tube was the consistency of tar his knees and the palms of his hands stuck to it like a fly to flypaper each movement made a sucking and slurping noise hurry it up philby said im trying it smells like my fathers beefjerky farts tmi finn paused at the first intersectiona pipe ran off to the left professor philby had to take a closer look himself he shined the flashlight at the walls of the connecting pipe hair he said pointing out clumps of what looked like steel wool stuck to the surface the beauty parlor is close by the server room is up ahead at the next intersection it should be a recycling station finn was going to ask why a recycling station would be connected to a trash system but he knew better than to challenge philby for one thing philbys explanations could run on the long side finn slogged ahead so disgusted with the ooze that he began walking on his elbows rather than sinking his hands into it were too slow were taking too long philby warned and just like that a clunk was heard like a grumbling in the belly of a beast the system was restarting okay thats what we expected philby tried to sound calm his hair stuck to the goo on the walls now all that needs to happen is for maybeck to trip the emergency stop again finn considered trying to send a text but looked at the layer of tarlike goo on his handssomething they hadnt considered nonetheless he reached into his pocket for his phone as the wind lifted the hair off his head zero bars no service oh perfect he said maybeck understood his assignment keep an eye on the two pirates stop the system if it restarted piece of cake what philby had only vaguely mentioned was that onsite engineers might seek immediate answers to their trash system shutting down despite the casual playful magical impression the parks had on visitors in truth they were run more like a nasa mission there were teams of experts to tackle and instantly solve any kind of problemfrom the lettuce in a restaurant going brown to the intricacies of staging the three oclock parade each day the evening fireworks the street bands the stage shows there were enough maintenance employees to form a small army two of these men were radiodispatched by engineering base to investigate an emergency stop at ursutilidor refuse station luckily maybeck heard them coming before they saw him they were complaining to each other about what kind of knucklehead would pull an emergency stop on the trash system they were just on the other side of the trash areas plywood barrier as he heard them he turned dropped to his hands and knees and burrowed deeply into the pile of cardboard recycling he stared out from his hiding place as the two maintenance guys inspected the door that sealed the trash drop as well as the electronic box that housed the red emergency stop override i dont see nothing wrong said the shorter of the two he was thickboned and heavyset and had a voice like a dog growling philby had said the system would be restarted the first time remotely from engineering base hed been wronga rarity nah said the other a taller leaner man some wise guys idea of a practical joke the short guy grabbed his radio good to go ursthree repeat green light for ursthree restart roger that came a womans voice over the radio a moment later maybeck felt a thunk underfoot the system had restarted willa her dhi riddled with static moved carefully through the backstage area behind france taking care to screen herself behind trailers vehicles and pieces of staging hypersensitive about how she stood out wearing pajamas she wanted to avoid being seen as much as possible if kids recognized her shed be mobbed and shed have to roleplay as a disney host another willa guidedressed in lederhosenwas currently somewhere in epcot which could explain her own current projection problems willas own hologram would likely improve once epcot was closed and the regular dhis were turned off for the night but she didnt want to wait she had a few hundred yards to cover in order to reach the pintrading station by the fountain the return the most direct route was to join the sea of park visitors but the idea terrified her she knew that if she looked scared and out of place she would appear vulnerable if she looked confident and comfortable despite the pajamas she would fit right in after all newlyweds went around the parks in mouse ears and bridal veils on a scale of to pajamas barely registered she briefly hid behind a food and wine festival station gathering her courage then she stepped out and confidently joined the hordes she was in a courtyard in france the lake straight ahead there were shops to her right and a french bakery benches to her left trees and raised islands of flowers in the center of the oblong cobblestoned plaza music filled the airpieces of the sound track to the hunchback of notre dame it had an inviting and calming effect the music surrounded her and made her feel at peace she loved the parks when they were open and filled with families and brimming with happiness her toes and fingers tingled her blue line grew solidshe was pure dhi in her euphoria she failed to look where she was going and walked right through a raised flower bed coming out the other side some kids recognized her immediately and approached crowding her asking for photographs and autographs she had to agree or risk making an even bigger scene as visitors complained she posed for some photographs explained politely that as a hologram she couldnt sign autographs and hoped to get away camera flashes blinded her kids bubbled with enthusiasm over here a mother called out willa looked in that directiontoward the bakery above the womans shoulder she saw a court jester in a green felt costume and clown makeup the jester stared at her but not in admiration more like a policeman watching a suspect as she heard the organized sounds of synchronized marching approach she knew she was in trouble epcot was not a place for goosestepping soldiers twelve costumed cathedral guards appeared from around the corner judge frollos guards she thought overtakers they marched straight for her excuse me she said to a group of kids but i have to go i hear those guards will give you candy if you hold onto them and dont let go the kids squealed and took off shouting at the guards willa walked quickly toward the bridge leading to the united kingdom the rhythmic footfalls stopped as the kids assaulted the guards again she heard her name ripple through the crowd as more people identified her things were going badly what had seemed like such a short distance now felt like miles spaceship earth looked so tiny and distant all of a sudden behind her a frenchaccented guard called out clear the way clear the path apparently not all of the guards had been sidelined by the kids disney visitors were too polite they cleared a path behind her willa glanced back the guards were gaining ground the crowd ahead now grew thicker as the walkway narrowed she dodged her way through pedestrians but wasnt increasing her lead behind her frollos guards continued their relentless pursuit only as she lost her balance and bumped into a baby carriage did she realize the value of her being a dhi a moment earlier shed walked through the flower island she needed to get to all clear she allowed the music to own her let it carry her away to where shed been only moments before music was the elixir for her music was her cure the tingling of her fingers signaled her transformation and she broke into a sprint running through anything in front of herpeople strollers it didnt matter with her approach startled guests jumped back only to have her run right through them kids cheered adults shouted startled complaints but she left the guards behind no matter how they tried they werent going to catch her twice more she settled and focused on the music twice more she went all clear willa passed the canadian pavilion still a long way from the return but gaining with each step her confidence increased she was going to make it the fountain and plaza came into view almost there but then appearing from around the fountain a halfdozen segwaysnot ctds but park security her holograms blue outline had faded slightly she couldnt allow them to scare her couldnt allow her dhi to weakento become even fractionally mortal the path split just ahead directly in front of her the fountain to the left a pathway leading behind innoventions west with access to the land and the seas she took this alternate route hidden from the security team from behind her came the steady tromp tromp tromp of the cathedral guards she reminded herself that she only needed to reach the return willa cleared her thoughts and watched her blue outline grow more solid if she could trust her dhi she could charge the pintrading station grab the return and send herself back so close now she followed the path to the right the pintrading station straight ahead you there a man shouted arriving to the fobs hiding place she jumped to reach into the intersection of support pipes empty she tried the next steel support realizing she must have the wrong post empty you another mans deep voice shouted stop she tried a third column nothing the next the segways rolled toward her the cathedral guards closed in from behind her mind reeled where was the return where had philby and finn put it how was she supposed to get back without it she couldnt stay there bumming over it she needed to hide she needed spaceship earth its geodesic construction rose feet into the night sky maybe inside the dome shed find a place to hide or maybe shed turn out to be in dhi shadow she turned and ran the men behind her calling after her to stop not likely philby looked back into the strong wind a park map landed on his face and wrapped around him like a veil litter splattered him as the wind tunnel restarted the lightest items were lifted first followed by increasingly heavier ones ducking the larger pieces of airborne trash was like something from a video game finn and philby didnt dare turn their backs on the onslaught for fear of missing something really big and dangerous so they faced into it crawling backward as quickly as their knees and hands would carry them incoming philby announced he flattened himself as a constellation of aluminum cans came down the pipe one struck finn on the shoulder oww dont let one bean you philby warned it could probably knock you out neither boy was amused now came plastic knives forks and spoons paper plates more cans the halfeaten turkey bones came at them like spears and arrows fruit and vegetable waste and all matter of wet stuff finally they couldnt take it they had no choice but to turn their backs to the steady stream for fear of having their eyes poked out the force of air grew stronger ruffling their clothing and hair the amount of loose garbage was overwhelming it smashed into them sticking to their clothing and bare skin finn slapped away a plastic fork that adhered to his ear a sticky rain pelted themketchup soda cold coffee and soup hurry philby shouted as a tumbling sound arose from down the pipe the first of the garbage bags it sounded like it was rolling at the moment but soon it would be lifted and carried by wind soon it would be a missile headed for them thats it philby announced shining his flashlight ahead of them highlighting an intersection of pipe a bag crashed into philby careened off the pipe wall and knocked finn sideways flattening both boys they clambered to their hands and knees only to be bowled over by the next and another after that any chance of finn going all clear was out the situation was terrifying the bags felt like rocks when they hit each time finn managed to get his legs and arms under him another bag knocked him over the pipe intersection just ahead seemed no closer wheres maybeck finn called out we need maybeck maybeck couldnt believe that the two engineering guys would just stand there hanging out by the trash dump he could feel the rumble under his feet knew the system was engaged he could picture finn and philby like soda bubbles in a straw getting sucked toward the trash compactor he watched as the shorter guy grabbed his radio awaiting instructions he said roger that came back a voice thinly were waiting on base copy the two guys were obviously in no hurrywere used to waiting maybeck eyed the red emergency stop button wondering what to do willa ran up the long ramp leading into spaceship earth out of breath the segways ridden by security guards were only yards behind her she slid like a baseball player under the chains blocking the entrance scrambled to her feet and took off running again behind her the security guards had to dismount the segways costing them precious seconds behind them the phalanx of frollos cathedral guards followed up the ramp the security men turned to face the marching unit stop one of them hollered raising his outstretched palm hed never been in this situation before marching guards he had no idea what to do this attraction is closed the park is closing for the night report back to operations management the guards stood there in formation their eyes straight ahead like true soldiers not one of them said a thing did you hear me the security guy said funs over the lead guard signaled his group forward they marched toward the security man what the heck the security man complained willa hurried through the dark crestfallen to look down and see her own feet spaceship earth was not in dhi shadow the ride was running though its seats were empty the park was closing down for the night she climbed aboard the first car that passed first things first she would hide until she came up with a plan at their meeting theyd discussed why charlene had been crossed over into the park philby had thought it was to debrief her as a spy but now a second more insidious motive presented itself by putting charlene into epcot and knowing she would try to escape the ots could follow her to the return and steal it without the return and without philbys back door on the server any keeper who crossed over would have no way back crossing them over one at a time made so much sense when working as a team the keepers had never failed but as individuals they were far more vulnerable they would be stuck in the syndrome locked in a coma in their beds at home not just overnight but forever the flashlight fell out of philbys hand as the next bag of trash struck him down in the swirling light finn watched a bulging trash bag approach at the speed of cannon fire he ducked and it flew overhead the flashlight rolled at his feet finn lunged for it but missed affronted by a windstorm of sloppy trash and deadly bags he inched toward the intersection of pipes philby he cried the wind in the tunnel was at full speedhurricane force finn was sliding backward clawing at the goop trying not to lose track of philby suddenly a hand appeared finn grabbed it he felt himself braked as he and philby joined handsphilby had caught on to the edge of the intersection together they strained to hold on finn repeatedly struck by flying trash bags then the wind all but stopped he and philby were in the adjoining pipe light shone through a circular crack a few yards ahead philby saw it too thats the way out the system has supplementary pressurization stations professor philby explained there are dozens of extra fans along the route all connecting pipes must be airtight maybe another time finn said philby led finn to the end of the short section of pipe together they managed to unlock and push open a maintenance door against the drag of the wind philby used a plastic bottle to jam the bottom of the door open finn climbed out first down a metal ladder philby followed they were behind heavy equipment a cardboard compactor in an alcove off the utilidor the boys were disgustingcovered in a layer of stinking brown sludge from head to toe we cannot just walk out there like this finn said how are we ever going to pull this off philbys eyes ticked back and forththe professor at work he poked his head through a network of smaller pipes got something he said crawling through he returned a moment later with a small greasy hand towel they took turns cleaning each others face were still a mess finn said indicating his clothes im like a human booger this is a cardboard recycling station yeah so its closing time everyone wants to get home you think anyones going to look twice at a couple of kids coming down the hall wearing cardboard boxes i like it the boys snuck around to the side where dozens of collapsed cardboard boxes leaned against the wall philby sized up two of them and the boys reassembled them overlapping the flaps to make them square and sturdy again philby then tore sections out of the flaps one for finns neck and one for each of his legs on the opposite end of the big box it was marked doritos philbys was sun chips they got past the machinery and philby quickly helped finn into his box so that it hung on his shoulders and ended just above his knees making walking awkward philby climbed into his box but had trouble getting the bottom flaps closed finn tried squatting but it did no goodhe was just a big cardboard box finally philby gave up his box hung from his shoulders with his head sticking out but the bottom flaps hung down moving with his every step with finn walking awkwardly in the lead the two boys moved out into the thirtyfootwide utilidor tunnel joining dozens of cast members philby had been right no one gave a pair of moving boxes a second thought twenty yards later they reached a set of windows on their left venetian blinds drawn from the inside they walked past the server room philby hissed from behind finn didnt need to be reminded hed been here more than once the last time a certain greenskinned fairy had been here as well philby tried to get his eye to the window at the edge of the blind so he could see through but the box was too big and it blocked him from leaning in close he turned to the side but again the box blocked him from seeing in suddenly the door swung open finn spun around and said to philby here ill fix it for you he spun philby and his box around mainly to hide their faces three cast members came out of the server room saying goodnight to each other two of them wished the other a good vacation and the man thanked them finn turned back as the door was shutting he got a look into the room seeing no one but then reflected off the doors safety glass he caught sight of a man at a desk theres still at least one guy in there at a desk over on the far side of the room well we cant just stand around here weve got to do something finn said the smells coming out of this box are going to make me puke wed better keep moving the boys continued on toward an exit where people dressed in street clothes were leaving golf carts laden with everything from bottled water to pirates of the caribbean muskets streamed past the magic kingdom was shifting into maintenance mode stores and restaurants would be restocked there would be painting and carpentry cleaning and polishing carried out within the park for the next several hours the boys had to reach the server gain access determine which park willa was in and launch a rescue attempt every second counted behind them the server room door opened and two men came out the second one checked to make sure the door was locked and the two said goodnight can you manage all clear philby asked maybe for a few seconds unlock the door and let me in finn nodded they stood in front of the door willa needed him finn reminded himself he closed his eyes and pictured the train coming when he opened them again the blue line shimmered around his filthy sleeve he stepped through the box and the closed door into the server room the lights were off no one was there good ten seconds later he watched the blue line fade until it was gone he reached out and unlocked the door for philby a few minutes later two cardboard boxes were discovered by a cleaning crew outside the server room the cleaners picked up the boxes and carried them to recycling while on the other side of the wall two nervous boys waited for them to pass were in philby said jess sat upright in bed while dozing over homework shed had the kissing dream again the same steps in the background she shuddered feeling guilty and somewhat creepy finn was a good enough guy but she didnt think about him like that she felt a little sick to her stomach no matter how this went down it couldnt be good for anyone her reaction was automatic and immediate once again she reached under her pillow and came out with her diary she switched on her book light and flipped through the pages to the earlier sketch there were details about the stairs to add they stepped down left to right andhere was the weird partwerent equal in size bad perspective she thought or out of scale she sketched in some planting that looked familiar to her though she couldnt place it she added some texture to finns face he looked incredibly lifelike filled in his shirt with stripes modified the tailored shirt she was wearing in the sketch only to realize it was a shirt she didnt like very much she lent it to amanda more often than she wore it herself well theres a solution she thought if she avoided wearing that particular shirt then she wouldnt be wearing it in the future if she didnt wear it in the future then she wouldnt kiss finn relief flooded through her so simple it all came down to avoiding that shirt heres something to think about philby said standing alongside finn facing row after row of librarylike shelving that held stacked computer servers ethernet routers modems power supplies and wireless boxes all blinking a constellation of colorful lights if the ots are messing with this stuff this is the time they mess with it after the park closes we may not be alone here for long way to cheer me up thanks said finn philby reached the dhi server the electronic brains responsible for both generating their images and communicating those images to an array of park projectors within the magic kingdom it also tied to other dhi servers through fiber optic lines in the animal kingdom epcot and disneys hollywood studios philby pulled out the tray holding the servers keyboard and entered his backdoor password the system rejected the password i thought it was a data transmission problem he said half talking to himself theres no attempt limit from the hardwired keyboard only with remote access i thought if tried my password from here id get in but thats not working what i know for sure is that if i tried remotely and failed three times in a row remote access would be denied for twentyfour hours an alarm would be sent upline engineering base over in the studios would see the hack attempt and probably notify security ive got one more remote try but i know its not going to work its the ots they were waiting for me you dont actually know that you think it was the imagineers wayne sends me a warning then locks me out of the server i dont think so so what about willa philby just stared at the screen fuming the fob should still work for a returnits sent wirelessly over the cellphone frequency a whole different subsystem than a manual return but its not going to be easy finding her you gotta get us into this machine tell me about it okay give me a minute he laced his fingers over his head and closed his eyes i can help out finn offered philby sat very still for several minutes finn grew increasingly impatient but said nothing okay philby said standing and moving down the aisle lets assume the ots phished for my password stole it and then erased it that would explain resetting the server and my losing the data connection that would mean they can now access the server remotely same way as i did but he said pulling out his phone if i try to access it one more time remotely and i fail any remote access will be blocked for twentyfour hours including theirs thatll leave the only access from herethis keyboard but the ots are not the only ones who can access this server the imagineers finn said engineering yes sop he said meaning standard operating procedure for an attempted raid on a server would be to send security first and someone from base second the security guy makes sure the rooms clear the guy from base checks the server runs virusscanning software studies and prints the log so finn said philby was already unplugging and collecting wires from the backs of other computer servers finn followed along like a lost dog so we need the guy from base to access the server philby continued i think we established that he has to enter a password philby said the systems master password is the only thing that can override a lockout look for a camera what a webcam usually little round balls about the size of a golf ball i know what a webcam looks like said finn so find one where this is a giant room devoted to computers and only computers somewhere in here are security webcams as well as personal webcams just find one youre telling me security can see us probably could be but there are hundreds probably thousands of cameras around the parks theyre not going to focus on here unless we give them reason to until we give them reason to thats why i havent tried the password for the third time first we need a camera the boys split up to search is that one in the ceiling finn called out yeah probably but its too hard to deal with finn kept looking ducking down another long aisle of stacks of electronic gear somewhere here philby said there has to beaha ive got it hed found a freestanding webcam alongside a keyboard at one of the desks he traced the usb cord and unplugged it when philby got on a roll there was no stopping him his actions became frantic as he hurried with the webcam back to the dhi server he dragged a chair into place climbed up onto it and placed the webcam on the top shelf wedging it between a pair of speakers run the wire down the back there philby directed finn finn did as he was told together they worked furiously running wires changing the position of the camera finn still didnt know what philby was up to philby double checked his phone and said no cell service but its a good wifi signal down here philby handed his to phone finn can you see my hands he said placing them on the keyboard finn viewed the phones screen it was the video image from the webcam philby had installed it showed the keyboard and philbys hands unreal finn said yeah your hands and the keyboard he took his phone back check the cold room for hiding places he said referring to a second server room with which the boys were familiar room for both of us it has to be good we cant be found finn entered a small room crowded with big lumbering machines the bigger and more sensitive electronics ran more efficiently when kept extremely cool he found space behind a computer the size of vending machine ive got something he called out stand by philby called back he used his phone to make a remote connection he then tried his password for the third time the computer bumped the access page and warned that access would now be denied for twentyfour hours he glanced at his watch given the past history of the dhis and this server he gave base five minutes to respond it took only three minutes a security woman named joyce brighton whod worked security for eleven years the past three in the utilidor entered the server room with a cup of coffee in hand she glanced around well aware that false alarms outnumbered real ones to she surveyed the empty room and reached for her radio then she stopped what on earth was that foul odor it smelled like a dumpster philby and finn remained hidden behind the towering rack of servers when the door to the supercooled room opened over the steady sound of the air conditioning and the computer fans could be heard a nose sniffing philby looked down at the brown muck and pieces of food and litter adhered to his clothing unfortunately hed already grown accustomed to the foul odor clearly the guard had picked up on it the nose worked the air in short little sniffs the sound moved toward the two boys what in heavens name is that smell said a woman softly to herself the guard reached the towering enclosure they hid behind ahha the guard said she tried to squeeze herself between the two enclosures finn and philby had slipped through judging by the sounds she was making she was not a perfect fit joyce whats your twenty a male voice said over her radio fresh coffee when youre ready the woman guard stood there basically stuck between the two metal enclosures she was maybe two feet from philby her hand shot out from the gap and nearly touched him as she tried to get to her radio after a second try she backed out into the main part of the room pour me a cup im on my way tell base that data operations is clear they can send their guy over the guy was not a guy at all but a woman from maintenance who arrived from the studios in less than fifteen minutes philby had finn hold the phone while he watched the image from the webcam a pair of delicate hands appeared in frame and typed in a sixteendigit string alphanumeric password philby knew what to watch for he had finn study the first eight finger motions while he took the second set philby had sketched out a keyboard on a piece of notepaper he marked the finger movements with xs and numbered them the technician spent another twenty minutes putting the server through its pacesa full virus scan and a reboot apparently satisfied that thered been no breach she slid the keyboard back in its tray and left the server room what now finn asked now philby answered waving the piece of notepaper i do my magic and you and maybeck get to sleep were back in business maybeck sneaked out from under the cardboard boxes the two guys had been told base was good they finally left his hand hovered over the stop button then he thought to send philby a text want me to stop it tucked in behind the plywood wall he waited and waited when no text came back he decided the reception was bad he had to make a decision too much time had passed since the system had been restarted by now finn and philby had either been blown out of the system or were safe but his job was to keep the trash system down he could stop it again hide amid the boxes and see what happened he hit stop as philby and finn left data operations philby noticed that the overhead rumble stopped maybeck he said about time finn said the two boys hurried back and reentered the trash system they moved incredibly quickly this time knowing exactly where they were going reaching the vertical pipe through which theyd entered philby knocked three times the lid opened and maybeck reached down a hand hurry he said into the dark he helped philby up then finn oh man maybeck said you guys reek like diaper poo nice to see you too finn said minutes later they were attracting unwanted attention on their way out but thankfully the state of their smell kept the curious at bay they cut a wide swath as they walked out of the employee gate at the front of the park finn caught sight of the time and called his mother the arrangement had been for them to be picked up in downtown disney but they were already late he was going to have to risk the truth or something close to it good grief she said as they piled into the car maybeck riding shotgun finn and philby relegated to the back you two look disgusting we went dumpster diving finn said you what i threw my wallet away by accident philby said it was on this food tray and i just dumped it in there by mistake and by the time i realized it theyd already emptied the trash so they went dumpster diving maybeck said and we found it finn said in the magic kingdom she said what happened to downtown disney our plans changed you arent allowed in the magic kingdom without permission his mom didnt miss much something came up finn said an ominous silence overcame the cars interior his mother was clearly considering how far to push her son with the other boys in the car well at least it has a happy ending she said letting finn off the hook for now she rolled down the window can i just say you stink she burst out laughing as did the boys though their laughter was faked then she went through the typical mom stuff did you have a good time did you see any friends how much money did you spend it was like she was reading from the same script anytime finn did anything with his friends willas mother called she dropped it like a bomb and checked the rearview mirror for impact the thing about his mother she could lay little traps that he would fall into before he knew it she said you knew what it was about his mother continued yeah okay thanks finn said so she said addressing maybeck now you can tell me the real reason you were in the magic kingdom and if you lie ill know it and i wont be happy she met eyesmother eyeswith finn in the rearview mirror its probably nothing you want to hear about maybeck said try me maybeck hesitated mom finn said we had an understanding correct his mother said philby knew that of all the parents mrs whitman had a love of all things disney and was maybe the only parent to support their efforts he said the overtakers crossed over willa and shes stuck in the syndrome thats why her mom called finn said joining in on the explanation it wouldnt look good if philby was the only one telling the truth they tricked us and phished for my passworda back door to the dhi serverand they got it they blocked us out and i couldnt return willa oh myand tonight she asked there she was staring down finn in the rearview mirror again the utilidor finn said the server room philby said we had to gain access to the server we set up a trap and the maintenance people fell into it i trapped the master password which allowed me to create a new back door i can control the server remotely again now how do you know it wasnt the imagineers or maintenance who locked you out in the first place she said attenuating circumstances finn said extenuating his mother corrected then added which were finn answered if someone from disney had locked us out it would have meant we were in big trouble theyd have called you and dad right the parents but that didnt happen mrs whitman nodded she pulled off the highway and into a gas station she parked the car and faced the three boys i realize i dont get all of this but if youre back in the server why not just bring willa back now i tried when we were down there philby said a manual return is different than using the fob when we use the fob our dhis and the signal are in the same locationthe same projection coordinates a manual return only works for sure at the landingthe hub in mk the fountain in epcot if her dhi is not on the plaza theres no guarantee it will link up so weve got to get her to the plaza finn said were doing everything we can for willa what we need now is to get home and get to sleep to cross over she said she didnt sound pleased willas mom maybeck said knows she cant take her to the hospital because of what happened to philby when his parents took him its up to us to get her back philby said tonight mrs whitman put her hands to her temples like she had a headache but to get her back you have to use that button right its in one of the parks somewhere isnt it she was basically talking to herself which park epcot both finn and maybeck answered at once you have to find her first yes finn said and then use the button to bring her back the fob yes philby said its the best way but as a backup i can bring them back remotely why would you need a backup she asked philby responded though tentatively becausefor some reason she hasnt used the fob to return we dont exactly understand that the first thing is to find her so shouldnt i be taking you to epcot she asked finn looked dumbstruck wed never get in philby said and even if we could it would be too dangerous finn said risky maybeck said dangerous or risky she asked both all three boys answered simultaneously finn said we need to be dhis its way safer these are just disney villains she said as if trying to convince herself they are fictional characters the boys said nothing unless youd met maleficent facetoface there was no explaining it i thought they locked them up she said philby said theres no real way to know but yeah were pretty sure theyre locked up then whos doing this she asked you wouldnt believe us if we told you finn said try me the two weve seen so far are cruella and the evil queen there are probably more oh i hate the evil queen she said then she started laughing and the boys joined in she cleared tears from her eyes as they stopped what are you going to do how can i help seriously finn said wondering if the overtakers had gotten control of his mom this was his mom right for one thing you could call jelly and philbys parents and tell them theyre spending the night i can do that what else she asked philby explained we have to get finn and maybeck to cross over and find her as long as they can get her to the fob were good if somethings wrong with the fobwhich seems possiblethey need to get her to what we call the landingthe center of the park the fountain then i can bring them back manually without the fob we could use a parent on our side finn said if the parents gang up on usit will not be good meaning you could use a parent in case something goes wrong she asked philby uhh what could go wrong she asked youre saying finn and maybeck might not return like willa i suppose finn held his breath think of willa he was chanting to himself her mothers really freaked out he reminded we know we can get her back mrs whitman put the car in gear and peeled out throwing the boys back in their seats i hope you know what youre doing she said philbys mother wouldnt let him spend the night having lost her son once to the syndrome she didnt approve of his spending time with his keeper friends despite the newspaper stories spreading rumors that the keepers had defended disney world from its villains she had a limited view of their purpose she didnt give two cents about disney world keeping its magic not if it put her son at risk it wasnt like he was saving the world or something it was an entertainment company some theme parks she wasnt about to sacrifice her son for the sake of larger profits her resistance to anything kingdom keepers was tempered by an appreciation for the money disney continued to contribute for philbys future college expenses she wasnt going to look a gift horse in the mouth but she had limits so mrs whitman had dropped philby home taking maybeck and finn with her philby had placed a towel at the bottom of his door to block the light from reaching the hallway so when his mom checked it would look like the lights in his room were out he sat at his computer ready he texted finn over skype yes finn texted back its working im in good go finn texted k philby returned cm finn leaned back in his chair his mother sitting on one side maybeck on the other finns father snoring from the other room this worries me his mother said its good news not that she said but that i dont understand half of what youre texting its like a code i know that finn dont get smart with me his mother got irritable if she stayed up late this was going to be a long night once maybeck and me get to sleep philbyll cross us over maybeck and i she corrected he ignored her way too tired what about you getting back well find the fob no sweat if its not working weve already set up a time and philby can manually return us the manual override he talked about she said yeah exactly he said what time one she sat back you all have thought it through havent you its what we do mom yes butyoure fifteen almost sixteen he said its a lot to deal with not really he said he could hear her rethinking her decision to allow him and maybeck to cross over its dangerous risky she said you both said so exaggerating maybeck said you know philby remember mrs w when we cross over were holograms stuff passes through us what kind of stuff terry are you saying they try to hurt you its disney world nothing bad happens maybeck said finn wondered if theyd used this excuse one too many times to finns relief she nodded she was definitely tired weve got to get to sleep he said maybeck climbed onto an inflatable mattress on the floor with your shoes on mrs whitman said to maybeck mom finn said we know what were doing go to sleep well see you in the morning as if she said she was even beginning to talk like him the finn had texted had let philby know his mother was in the room the cm that came back from him meant call me now with her gone finn climbed out of bed and let maybeck know what was going on he doublechecked that his door was fully closed and returned to his computer he called philby and spoke at a whisper whats up finn said theres something weird going on philby said willas projection coordinates are for epcot but the current default for the return is in mk how could that be the fobs in epcot it was when we last saw it why would the imagineers reset the default it doesnt make sense not for the imagineers the point is weve lost the return somehow ill definitely have to cross you back manually from here he made it sound so simple one of philbys greatest qualities was his confidence he wasnt arrogant or a bragger he just happened to be right most of the timea knowitall who didnt get all up in your face with it to hear him even slightly uncertain was alarming finn didnt say anything about it philby lived with more pressure than most of them stuck with the professor role so were good to go finn said one oclock yeah sure i just wanted you to know where were at i can return you manually all ill need is a signal ill bring my phone yeah philby said but they dont always work so we go with one oclock or a signal if you find her earlier philby had a plan for everything he provided finn with a way to signal him that philby couldnt miss okay but no matter what if you cant send a signal you and maybeck should be at the plaza by onean hour and a half from now it isnt much time its a big place i realize that philby finn said if this doesnt go right its not your fault okay forget about that just whatever you do dont let anyone else cross over three of us in the syndrome is enough do not go there im serious so am i said philby dont even go there if that happens get to jess maybe shell have dreamed something that will help us but dont freak out come into the park as your real selves well find you well figure it out together okay now youre definitely freaking me out philby said just promise yeah okay i wont panic someones got to keep it together i thought thats your job philby said maybeck placed a hand on finns shoulder overhearing the conversation it was not what he expected from maybeck finn hung up and a few minutes later the boys went back to bed it was not easy for either of them to fall asleep finn didnt know how much time passed but he woke up lying on the concrete at the edge of the epcot fountain plaza hed crossed over took you long enough came the familiar voice of maybeck finn got up off the concrete checked his hands for the shimmering blue outline and grinned it felt good to be back he sat with his back pressed against the concrete retaining wall that formed the fountain so how do we find her maybeck said finn looked around epcot began at the golf ball shaped spaceship earth two huge areas ran off to both sides with a half dozen attraction pavilions in both directions the plaza fountain gave way to the lake surrounded by replica world showcase countries with big ben the eiffel tower and other world landmarks mexico finn said we start with philbys plan for close to an hour willa had huddled behind a rock in the primitive man display inside spaceship earth earlier shed heard two men speaking frenchcathedral guardsas theyd passed on the ride shed made herself as small as possible and held her breath to make no noise one of the guards had apparently jumped out of the car he was riding but by doing so he tripped a sensor and shut down the ride at which point there had been a flurry of discussion realizing his mistake he and the other guards had left quickly one of the advantages of being a hologramwilla had not tripped the system assuming disney maintenance men and possibly security personnel would follow up on the rides emergency shutdown willa had relocated to a display that included a roman guard things had been quiet for some time now and so she ventured out determined to search for the return determined to get home she would start with lost and found if a cast member discovered what looked like a garage door opener he or she would turn it in because the keepers had lost the fob once before willa knew exactly where to look she took her time careful to advance and pause advance and pause after determining an area was clear she would move a little bit farther thankfully the lost and found wasnt far in the back office of a small building tucked away near the entrance gate turnstiles she reached the building concentrating on her thin blue outline to make sure her hologram was all clear and then walked through the back door she arrived into a tiny office with event posters covering the walls there were two desks one cluttered one neat two computer terminals two phones the phones presented her with an opportunity she had not until now considered she could call finn or philby andexcept she didnt know their numbers they were on her phone as speed dials but her phone was back home she knew charlenes number by heart charlene could relay a message she would need to lose her dhi state at least slightly in order to be material enough to pick up and handle a telephone but at this point being afraid wouldnt take any effort first she checked the metal cabinet marked lost and found unlike when finn had to go into the cabinet months earlier it wasnt locked now inside she found over a dozen cell phones clothing wallets jewelry drivers licenses credit cards and four sets of car keysall with black fobs but not the return her conclusion was that the ots had stolen it as shed suspected she eyed the phones and the computers did she dare start down the road of fear in order to become material enough to work the devices once begun it was hard to turn back fear fed on fear but what choice was there she thought of her mother trying to wake her while in the syndrome her fingers knees and toes tingled she picked up the phone and dialed charlene answered its me willa im in the syndrome we know that but how im in epcot im pretty sure the ots have the return you have to tell the boys not to come after me its obviously a trap iahi think its too late the plans for finn and maybeck to cross tonight but they cant theywecant return philby got back into the server its going to be all right no its not not anywhere close finn and maybeck should be there by now i need philbys number willa said i keep it on speed dial but yeah okay hang on as willa waited she looked down at the phone to see a line light lit by using the phone shed given herself away she hung up immediately she had to get out of there she tried walking through the door but bounced against it her fear had gotten the better of her it was a sickening downward spiral she tentatively opened the door and slipped outside pulling it shut quietly behind her when she turned around a shape appeared around the corner of a building and quickly ducked back finn she spoke his name aloud though only in a whisper she glanced around haltingly ensuring she was alone pssst he reappeared she waved so happy to see him finn stepped out into the open and she realized hed come in disguisehe was wearing the same stupid costume shorts and a tshirt that his dhi wore in the magic kingdom she hurried toward him a combination of relief and anxiety overcoming her relief theyd found each other anxiety over the thought of telling him there was no way to return oh my gosh finn it is so good to he evaporated into a wisp of smoke that reformed into something darker and largeruntil she found herself facing the evil queen she screamed her hologram outline dimmed youwitch she uttered angrily you are correct this small girl impossible to lose she now finds no way to move the evil queen waved her index finger in a tight circle willa tried to run she could hardly lift her legs she was quickly surrounded by cathedral guards behind them on the points of the compass four crashtest dummies on segways cruella de vil stepped out from behind the queen well well i have to compliment you dearest she said to the evil queen youre quite the little venus flytrap the queen ignored her the judge asked you a question little girl the queen said to willa her eyes squinting i fear you were rude to him let me explain that being rude to me will have far moredevastating results hmmm do i make myself clear the evil queen stepped forward willa found her beauty bewitching and powerful she nodded against her will the sensation in her limbs slowly returned her legs no longer felt like they weighed a ton then out with it the queen ordered or suffer another flick of her hand and willa bent over in a convulsion like she had been punched in the stomach this despite her being in her state of partial dhi she hated to think how that would hurt when flesh and blood the queen waved her hands again and her lips trembled as she chanted some kind of incantation spiders appeared out of cracks in the pavement hundreds thousands of them small ones red ones black ones huge ones they swarmed at willas feet leaving her in the center of an oozing circle of hairy spiders if she moved even slightly she was terrified which dampened her dhi making her more vulnerable she was outmatched the queen got what the queen wanted what did jezebel draw a face a man willa volunteered still bent over her stomach in a knot the spiders encroached the witch cackled with laughter that sounded like breaking ice who what man and be careful you dont lie little thing she began to sing the itsy bitsy spider the ring of spiders tightened at willas feet a manin uniform finns dhi climbed the stone steps running up the center of the mexico pavilion a mayan temple with balconies of flowers on either side of the center staircase hed taken this same route with philby he knew what he was doing maybecks dhi had already reached the top climbing as effortlessly as a cat wait up hissed a humiliated finn move it maybeck said he watched finn climb its only a set of stairs tiny stairs steep stairs finn felt like saying but he kept his mouth shut memo to whitman i dont think youre going to be able to see willa from up here so what in the name of cream cheese are we doing here doing what philby told us to do finn whispered back into the booth the illuminations booth hows that supposed to help willa remember in the wizard of oz the man behind the curtain sure the old guy what about him thats you youre the man behind the curtain youre the one controlling things im liking this plan more and more whitman i knew you would finn nearly said okay so pay attention the longer he sat there staring at his computer monitor the more concerned philby grew the webcam view was of the park as a whole he could see a few black specks move from time to time but they looked about the size of ants he couldnt tell who or what they were or what they were up to if finn is going to send me a signal he thought it had better be something good otherwise i might miss it so he focused intently on the most recent development a thick group of ants had congregated between spaceship earth and the office building near the entrance that couldnt be good it might be a meeting of security or a cleaning or maintenance team getting ready to deploy around the park or it could easily be overtakers when philby heard rustling in the bushes outside his window he looked away from his computer the window was unlocked not good what if there was a serial killer creeping around their house when he heard more brushing of sticks against the side of the house goose bumps raced up his armssomething was out there and it was too big to be a dog more like a person willa was not scared of spiders she was terrified of them they moved as a mass around her bare feet within inches of touching her her dhi was anything but pure making her physically vulnerable what kind of uniform the queen asked shed said too much already she hated herself for having said anything a security officer she lied like at the airport there were two huge vultures following behind her cruella steered clear of the birds as she walked around willa studying her willas eyes followed cruella i dont think so the evil queen said she waved her hand the spiders swarmed over willas feet and started up her ankles she cried out and kicked with both legs like running in place but the spiders kept coming screaming she brushed them away but there were thousands of them and each time her bare feet landed she felt them squish beneath her while a hundred more climbed onto her get them off willa jumped out of the oozing black circle but a vulture came at her flapping its large wings and stuck its grotesque bald head and curved beak into her face driving her back she leaped to her left and the second vulture blocked her there as well she fled back into the swarm of spiders some had reached her knees as fast as she could brush them off they gained on her stop it what kind of uniform dear the queen said in a perfectly calm voice military i think those things on his shoulders she jumped and hopped and swatted at the spiders the queen waved the spiders down and off her they formed the doughnut again with willa at the center thats better my little ugly duckling the queen said more details and ill keep them off you willa collected herself and looked up intent to meet eyes with the queen but what she saw just beyond the queen nearly stopped her heart finn her friend finn not the queens copy of him he wore all black and was carrying the shimmering blue line that said hed crossed over finn whod come to rescue her the evil queen caught willas eye movement and without looking behind her made a sweeping surprisingly graceful motion toward finn her lips moving but making no sound whatever she had expected to happen to him did not the blue line around finns dhi shimmered though only slightlyhe was only part hologram he rushed willa lowered his shoulder and hit her like a football tackle throwing her onto his shoulder he took off at a run spiders raced up his back willa brushing them off furiously she looked down the stream of spiders had stretched into long black line like a snake gigabyte the twentyfoot python was a matter of yards behind finn the vultures flew on either side of him back at gigabytes tail the remaining spiders turned into rattlesnakes finn willa gasped laying atop his shoulder snakes the rattlesnakes moved faster than the giant python finn she said he could feel himself slowing downthe more frightened she became the heavier she was to carry dontlook he said he followed the path past innoventions west and aimed for the fountain plaza now in sight maybecks timing was going to have to be perfect or between the snakes and vultures they would lose their chance to return the fountain was now only a matter of twenty yards away a figure appeared on the far side toward the lake maybeck running at a full sprint two ctds on foot chasing him maybeck counted down in his head thirtyninethirtyeightthirtyseven he had a pair of robots on his tail pursuing his dhi at lightning speed one of them had gotten close enough to fire some kind of taser but because of his dhi state its electrodes and wires had passed right through him up ahead he saw whitman carrying willa on his shoulder and some kind of broken shadow slithering behind him behind the shadow came the evil queen and cruella if this had been philbys plan he was out of his skull theyd walked right into a nest of overtakers uncool he shouted as he skidded to a stop seeing the snakesnot shadows but snakesbraiding themselves around the feet of finns dhi do not look down maybeck added finn looked down his blue hologram line faded and the tangle of snakes locked around his partially mortal ankles and finn fell dumping willa whom maybeck caught in his arms maybeck had lost count eighteen twelve whitman had told him he had to keep count oops finn rose to his elbows but surrounded by hissing rattlesnakes he froze welcome boys said the evil queen finally catching up maybeck helped willa keep her balance as he put her down it was a clever moveit put her within an arms length of finn if she dared to reach across the snakes they could hold hands philby stared out his window it was not a serial killer it was hugo montcliff and more important he had elvis in his arms elvis an inside cat had disappeared earlier that afternoon and philbys mom had been distraught hugo would be a family hero for years to come philby threw open the window you found him my mothers going to saint you he was wandering around the evans house need the couch tonight philby knew hugo couldnt suffer his parents screaming fights all night you mind climb on in philby said making a gesture like a hotel doorman hugo passed him elvis and followed through the window philby felt a shiver but blamed it on the night air sorry ive got to be rude philby said shutting and locking the window but im jamming he pointed to his desk its late so be as quiet as you can wouldnt want to wake up my mom towels in the closet ill catch you in the morning maybe i shouldnt stay hugos voice had dropped an octave he spoke softly sounding hurt philby who was now a step closer to his desk looked back at his friend feeling sorry for him no i didnt mean that ill be done in a couple minutes is that epcot hugo said stepping closer thats amazing you could recognize it philby said his screen was nothing but some lights the shimmering water of the lake andthe little ants had moved to the fountain plaza that has to be finn and maybeck but there were way too many ants on the screenif it was finn he and maybeck werent alone can i play hugo asked ahits not exactly a game and ahyou know if you dont mind im a little busy right now oh but i do mind hugo said dont touch that keyboard philby spun around with hugo having been outside in the dark he hadnt gotten a good look at him especially given that hed been holding elvis the cat had won philbys attentionby design philby thought because hugos eyes were a vivid green hugo had brown eyes philby couldnt believe it hugo of all people after all philbys family had given to the boy he felt overcome with anger and disbelief he saw his terry cloth bathrobe and belt lying on his bed the belt would work to tie hugo up philby charged hugo knocked him out of the way and onto the bed where had that kind of strength come from philby did a somersault and sprang from his haunches launching himself at the boy to his right a burst of color erupted across his computer screen the signal the lake burst into flames flooding the night sky and illuminating every pavilion in a wash of golden light it reflected off the face of the evil queen it danced in cruellas eyes finn hopped to his knees and stood leaning to reach across the tangle of rattlesnakes and touch willas outstretched hand it was not only the water burning a dozen towering torches surrounding the lake had also burst into flames but the water effect part of the illuminations show was a spectacular sight giant balls of orange flames boiling off the waters surface and rising into the dark looking like the surface of the sun the timing of the effect had been maybecks job to schedule the pyrotechnics that professor philby had discovered on the control booths computer when he and finn had visited two nights earlier more than a thousand different pieces of ordnance on water barges and a halfdozen laser projectors mounted on top of pavilions were all synchronized by the illuminations computer following their spotting willa and the queen on the security video maybeck had scheduled the fire events giving himself five minutes to leave the control room climb down the mayan temple and catch up to finn with it nearing one am and the scheduled manual return maybe the pyrotechnics would offer a needed distraction given that it looked like all of epcot was on fire there was no way philby could miss the signal now all he had to do was remotely tell the dhi server to return them philby witnessed the wash of flames engulfing epcots lake and stretched for the computers returnenter key but hugo held him by the shoulders struggling to get his arms around philbys chest and squeeze the wind out of him philby stumbled back his fingers hitting the spacebar instead of the return key he threw an elbow into hugos stomach and groaning hugo let go philby regained his balancetook a step toward his deskand was tackled to the floor he went down hard facefirst philby rolled over and kicked out catching hugo in the face but hugo scrambled on top of philby pinning his shoulders and winding up with a balled fist as hugo drove the fist toward his face philby jerked his head hugo punched the floor philbys hand found the wicker trash can he raked it across hugos face and the boy went off him philby rolled and shoved his hand into hugos facethe fake green eyes staring back unflinching and terrifying philby couldnt look at those eyes he turned away hugo grabbed both of philbys wrists pushing up trying to get philby off philby pushed back trying to hold hugo down their arms began to tremble then to shake light flashed from the computer the lake alive with fire philby managed to pin hugos left arm with his knee and reach for the computer with his right hand hugo rocked side to side attempting to free his arm and making it impossible for philby to properly aim his fingers he missed the return key three times in a row hugo kneed philby in the back freeing his hand which he used to palm philby below the chin and propel him back toward the bed hugo jumped up and reached for the escape key which would close the current windowphilbys link with the dhi server philby had bit his lip he tasted the salty tang of blood in his mouth he was mad elvis was just standing there on the bed like a spectator philby grabbed him and held him just behind the front legs and lunged for hugo using the same technique his family members used to train elvis to use his scratching pole it forced elvis to extend his front clawsclaws that now tore through hugos shirt leaving eight narrow tracks of blood behind as philby dragged him down the boys back and then tossed elvis back onto the bed as hugo let out a gutwrenching scream philby spun hugo around tripped him and dumped him to the floor he stabbed for the return key this action cannot be undone do you wish proceed yn he hit y the bedroom door burst open a wrinklyfaced woman with no makeup an adhesive strip across the bridge of her nose stretching her cheeks and wearing a pair of pajamas covered with cartoons of marge simpson shouted boys both hugo and philby stopped cold what in the devil is going on young man philbys mom said to him the next thing she said was elvis in a loving and kind voice of pure affection hugo stood up unlocked the window threw it open and dove outside philby watched the bandwidth meter spike in the bottom right corner of the computer screen the dhi properties of the holograms were being saved back to the dhi server the return the whole process could take anywhere from ten to sixty seconds precious seconds dell his mother said please mom no philby said seeing his mother march toward his desk remember what happened to me he said in a begging tone if you shut my computer itll happen to all three of themfinn willa and maybeck mom you dont want that to happen shutting the computer putting it into sleep mode would send his friends to sleep along with it stuck in the syndrome finn couldnt take his eyes off the trembling hands of the evil queen held high above her head she reminded him of a major league pitcher in his windup she was about to deliver some kind of spitball sinker spell that would make the spiders and rattlesnakes look like kids stuff something nasty the flames licked off the lake tears ran down willas face as she mouthed thank you to finn the evil queen threw her hands at them with a witchs fury her lips spouting an incantation children in peril children in fright but she stopped before completing it willa had disappeared finn watched as maybeck sparkled became transparent and vanished finn sat bolt upright in bed his own bed at home maybeck blinked furiously from his air mattress finn felt something on his leg and threw back the covers a rattlesnake he screamed a bad word loud enough to be heard two blocks away he shook his leg like a maniac the snake flew up and was caught dangling from one of the paddles on his ceiling fan his father threw open his bedroom door and switched on the light his mother craning over her husbands shoulder when finns ceiling light switched on so did the fan the snake began circling overhead the fan gained speed finn whitman his father thundered glaring at him his father had run out of patience for the kingdom keepers after their earliest adventure wanting his son to focus on academics first and sports second he had little tolerance for finns claims of saving disney from its villains although he appreciated the college money that resulted from his sons participation in the program and even secretly enjoyed some of the attention and fame that rubbed off on him for being finns father this kind of nighttime interruption to his family was exactly what he objected to and found so offensive he didnt need a manual to understand why his son and maybeck were fully clothed in black wearing shoes and sweating profusely while in air conditioning i had a nightmare finn said lying will only make it worse for you the rattlesnake was currently rotating at warp speed wrapped around the fan blade mom please he said flicking his eyes to the ceiling fan his mother spotted the snake and went ashen white sweetie she said to her husband come on back to bed lets deal with this in the morning nothing to be done now mr whitman seemed unmovable terry he said do i have your word you two will go back to sleep no shenanigans the rattlesnake was losing its hold six inches of the snake was now sticking off the end of the fans paddle yes sir mr whitman trusted finns friends more than he did his own son mr whitman made a grunting sound of disapproval allowing his wife to pull him out of the doorway she stepped forward made a face of pure horror and reached for the light switch as she shut off the light she closed the door finn heard a thump but couldnt see in the darkness his father opened the door again and peered inside what was that he said are you testing me son no sir finn answered the rattlesnake had hit the door it was hanging in a coil from the pair of hooks on the back of the door its tongue flicking in the direction of his fathers head finn sprang out of bed sorry dad wont happen again good night he toed the door and shut it in his fathers face his father called softly through the door well discuss this in the morning young man the snake turned toward finn whitman maybeck hissed having backed up to the wall finn dove into his closet and grabbed his laundry bag and a hanger hed seen this on the discovery channel you gotta help me finn whispered oh yeah as if thats going to happen i need you to hold the bag open pass i cant do both at once no way maybeck maybeck approached cautiously and held the bag this feels like the losing end of this deal you want to handle the snake be my guest the snakes rattle was going strongly raising every hair on finns body if his father heard it he might as well let the snake just bite him now maybeck held open the laundry bag his arms extended supernaturally he was basically a zip code away finn hooked the snake with the hanger and lifted it carefully from the doors twin clothes hooks the snake hung heavily from the u of the hanger finn lowered it slowly and maybeck caught the snake in the bag window finn hissed maybeck moved that direction finn opened the window and maybeck extended the bag outside okay finn said let go i cant maybeck said my fingers are frozen letgo finn said uncurling maybecks fingers one by one the bag crashed down in the plants shutting the window finn heaved a sigh of relief maybeck hadnt moved he looked like a statue its out finn said maybeck shook his head and finally managed to step away from the window well have to check the bag in the morning and make sure the snake is gone finn said you can if you want maybeck said finn texted willa and philby willa texted back immediately thanking all three boys philby texted a few minutes later trouble here group skype b skool reading the text over finns shoulder maybeck whispered he thinks he had troubles i gotta hear this the keepers met on video conference fifteen minutes before buses and parental rides departed for school finn we had a tricky situation last night willa as in maybeck and finn saved me finn and philby maybeck looking over finns shoulder said it was the evil queen and cruella charlene same as downtown disney charlene was using her own video image as a mirror while applying mascara willa the fob was missing charlene did you check willa the lost and found yes not there gone its got to be why they crossed you charlene finn and philby come into the park and the three of you lead them to the fob you returned and they stole it none of us saw that coming maybeck whoa charlene they stole it because maybeck we become stuck in the syndrome for one thing philby first the server then the fob if we hadnt managed to hack back into the server last night willa would still be stuck there finn i guess i can see how that helps them break out maleficenti mean it takes us out of the picturebut its sure a lot of planning a lot of work if you ask me philby which means were missing something the bigger picture he then described his fight with hugo philby obviously they knew i would try to return you three they sent hugo to stop me hugo must be the one we cant see in the photo i still cant believe hed do this to me maybeck to us charlene this just gets creepier and creepier she applied one last stroke of mascara and twisted the tube shut willa but the real reason they wanted me was for me to describe jesss sketch the one she showed me at school finn we need to see that up close philby questionhow did the evil queen know youd seen the sketch a general silence finn a greeneyes one of the spies saw jess show willa in light of hugo and luowski this seemed like the best explanation charlene so were not safe at school and were not safe crossed over anyone feel like a vacation she won some laughterbut not much charlene seriously any ideas ive got to get downstairs the busll be here any minute philby stay here a second longer he waited for everyones attention onscreen especially charlenes philby what if we missed a major clue finn saw cruella on the telephone at downtown disney maybeck we all agreed that was bizarre philby but what if she and the queen were dhis at the time silence philby what if the phone call was to request a manual return its possible disneyquest serves as downtowns centerpiece we dont know maybeck cursed finn using the phone as the signal to send them back philby exactly willa thats why they want the fob so badly to make it easier for them to return philby i think so yes maybeck shouted and finn cupped his ear maybeck hold on wait a second philby we know they took control of the server it was them who locked me out not the imagineers i was never buying that we got all hung up on it being about us about controlling us locking us in the syndrome and sure thats probably part of it but it also may be what they want us to think finn it explains them stealing the fob but how could they have done it how could they have turned themselves into dhis philby the same way we turned amanda and jess into dhis another long silence willa but think about it if they need the return if they can cross over as dhis then when thats happening theyre asleep right for a moment it seemed as if the connection had failedno one moved in their respective video windows charlene was no longer concerned with catching her bus philby makes sense finn ill tell you one thing the queen wasnt any dhi last night she was throwing spells all over the place charlene so last night she was real but if they stole the fob for themselves then they must be planning to cross over into one of the parks and a manual return is just too hard for them to pull off willa theyre afraid of jess knowing something about this theyve always tried to control her from clear back at the start if we can see the future then maybe we can stop them thats got to be what theyre worried about charlene and youre right willa if theyre dhis then theyre asleep somewhere we know that much maybeck i see where this is going and im liking it philby if we trap their dhis theyll be stuck in sbs they wont be able to wake up and well have defeated them but before you freak remember we dont have their powers we cant throw up laser jails and probably cant put fear into them the way they can with us its not the same maybeck back up philbo forget trapping their dhis what we want to do is distract their dhis we want to find where theyre sleeping long as theyre sleeping they are totally vulnerable totally we can slap on the cuffs blindfold and gag them so they cant throw spells or do anything to anyone we turn them over to wanda or the imagineers and thats two more behind bars philby considered the words behind bars and thought of wanda and his first contact from wayne his thoughts moved past wanda to maleficent and chernabog and their being locked up somewhere as so often happened with him it just struck him like a lightning bolt the answers to math equations came this same way science assignments too a spark of understanding in his brain philby prison the reason they need to be dhis has to do with maleficent and chernabog finn so they can break them out philby i think so yes its their end game its everything theyre about charlene how could that possibly work philby who knows but thats their plan it adds up the mention of wanda had finn wondering about her theyd gotten her out of jail but she hadnt been back in contact with them did she fear police surveillance or someone worse she had a hearing scheduled for monday morning willa if theyre asleep its somewhere in the parks maybeck out of the way someplace no ones going to bother them finn or find them charlene hello the parks are ginormous maybeck there cant be that many places cast members are all over the place all the time we can figure this out maybeck didnt often play cheerleader none of the others knew quite what to say philby dont forget we surprised them last night by having access to the server they thought theyd locked us out but if they go dhi i should be able to detect it i wont know exactly where they are but the isp submask and router data will help narrow it down that would allow us to have two teams one like maybeck said to challenge their dhis and keep them busy while the second team tries to find where theyre sleeping maybeck thing is theyve got the fob the minute they figure any of this out they return and then were in the deep woods finn we cant rely on sending signals anymore that was close last night i think we should hide one of our cell phones in each of the parks wed all know where to find them if we need out we call philby and he takes us out manually philby makes total sense charlene you expect me to give up my cell phone seriously willa finn we need to check with jess about that drawing finn no problem and i want to talk to wanda we cant ask her to risk anything since she was arrested but who knows how she might help us philby if were dividing up teams i vote for maybeck finn and charlene to go after the sleepers amanda willa and jess can play catandmouse with the evil queen and cruella dhi against dhi willa i dont mean to be a buzzkill but i am so grounded its like my mothers got me on suicide watch or somethingshe wakes me up every couple hours i mean i want so badly to be part of whatever were doing buti just dont know all the keepers spoke at once no one expected anything from willa shed been through enough she apologized profusely it was clear she wanted to be included if they crossed over but if caught by her mother it could threaten them all finn well the rest of us should dress for action each night philby will cross us over when he knows the overtakers have crossed the first thing we do when we enter a park is to find the hidden cell phone in whatever park were in got that thats our way out of the park we call philby for a return philby one small problem when i hit the return youll all return as long as youre somewhere near the landing point in whatever park youre in so that makes the girls job more complicated we need to get the fob back whichever side has the fob has freedom maybeck easier said than done charlene are we forgetting anything willa probably finn so we start tonight willa be careful in school the greeneyes are out there moments later finn disconnected from the conference call a pit in his stomach about probably forgetting something finn arrived at school feeling like an idiot hed forgotten it was a free dress day that should have meant professional sports team jerseys for boys and shortshorts for girlssince neither was allowed at finns schoolbut living in orlando it turned into a disney costume contest for half of the fifteen hundred kids worse a few students came as one or more of the kingdom keepers and finn didnt know whether to feel honored or mocked but he looked tragically normal in a pair of shorts and a striped tshirt even amanda had gotten into it showing up in a pressed white shirt and plaid skirt which he assumed was connected to harry potter at least a third of the remaining girls and more guys than hed expected came as vampires but it was disney and marvel comics that won by a long shot iron man characters alice in wonderland toy story every witch dwarf princess and mermaid in numbers that staggered the imagination added into the mix were girls who dressed as princes and boys dressed as witches so that the bathroom ended up a confusing mix which was exactly where finn found himself as he heard the familiar voice what are you looking at whitless luowskis voice but the body of the russian madman in iron man complete with the scars and bad teeth and something coming off the ends of his hands which were supposed to be bolts of electricity but looked more like christmastree tinsel finn felt sorry for the guy the costume got close but in the end didnt work finn realized that he was looking at himself in the mirrorlike the last time hed run into luowski in there the situation was doubly strange because he didnt remember coming into the bathroom nor did he remember turning on the faucet which was currently running hey greg in addition to the mickey rourke look luowski was wearing the green contacts something finn took note of with added apprehension finn chanced a glance at his watch eight minutes had passed since the endofschool buzzer for a moment he couldnt remember having been in school at all that day he could force himself to imagine if not actually remember having entered the boys room but he had absolutely no recollection of the past eight minutes the evil queen had someone dressed up like her been behind him in the mirror just a few seconds before luowski was that a memory or his imagination he cleared his throat the more important question greg is why are you hanging around the boys room staring at other guys staring at themselves in the mirror iahwho said i was pictures worth a thousand words finn pulled his phone out of his pocket luowski said your girlfriends waiting outside i dont have a girlfriend not what i hear well you hear wrong finn turned around and faced the taller luowski standing about chin height to him but luowski might as well have been sixfeetfive and pounds for the way finn felt he didnt want anyoneincluding greg luowskimessing with amanda take a look yourself romeo luowski motioned to the door finn had something to say to luowski but knew it would earn him a punch in the face so he bit back his words he was back in the hall heading for the front doors not feeling quite right it bothered him that hed lost eight minutes of his life nothing like that had ever happened to him before he and the other keepers had often discussed side effects of being a dhi the extreme fatigue mixed with the occasional insomnia he wondered if the side effects included memory lapse eight minutes gone he swung open the school doors amanda stood at the bottom of the steps turning her head toward him just as finn arrived through the doors his girlfriendwas he supposed to get used to that he felt happy to see heralmost too happy lightheaded weightless he seemed to float down the steps toward her she stood among a group of girls a few covered their mouths hiding their smiles as they saw finn he had no idea how stupid he looked but his vision blurred to where there was only amanda the others girls looked almost photoshopped in blurry and unidentifiable he didnt know why but he looked behind himluowskitherussianmadman stood at the top of the stairs grinning finn was halfway down when amanda approached him walk me home amanda said that was a first hed walked his bike with her plenty of times but he couldnt remember her asking for him to i like that shirt he said having retrieved his bike its jesss you look good in it what a stupid thing to say it fit her pretty tightly and she was going to think him a creep thanks they walked a block two five youre awfully quiet she said luowski was bugging me in the bathroom he said wondering where that kind of honesty came from hes one of them are you sure finn caught her up on the recent street confrontation and luowskis comment about not believing in magic thats fairly direct she said it is and theres more he told her about hugo and philby ohmigod they actually fought like with fists like with well i can see why hes creeping you out yeah so you gave me that message she said finn had forgotten completely about that it felt like a week ago it had been the same morning in us government class oh yeah you really are distracted sorry the note said you wanted to talk to me this explained why she was waiting for him outside school he felt like an even bigger idiot this was one of those days to wipe off the calendar iwethe keepers need you and jess to cross over or be ready to cross over he went on to explain the morning conference call she hesitated i told you about mrs nash threatening to send us back to the fairlies why would she do that anyway i mean besides you two messing up if they wanted you in the fairlies they would have sent you there when they found you two the one thing i learned when i was there she said is that you never can trust anything to do with that place they told us one thing but it was so far from the truth it wasnt funny but if they wanted to observe you or whatever how do we know they arent observing us now how can jess and i be sure mrs nash isnt being paid to spy on us and report back amanda said thats a little paranoid you wouldnt think so if youd been through what weve been through no im sure not i didnt mean to sound sobossy she said i didnt take it that way said finn she reached over and found his hand and for another block she held it and he liked it they stopped in front of the familiar blue house with yellow trim the twentyminute walk had felt more like five time was all messed up for him many of the other houses on the block were spanish influenced and one story tall mrs nashs house looked older and it was two stories finn slapped the kickstand down and faced amanda he knew exactly what he wanted to dohed just never done it exactly like he was about to do it jess stepped out the front door looking panicked finn stepped up to amanda and grabbed her by the shoulders it was almost as if he was compelled to do this as if hed been told stepbystep what to do much to his surprise amanda made no effort to pull away from him hed expected maybe a slap in the face my shirt jess hollered making it sound like a crime something was wrong finn knew it he knew jess was running to stop them from kissing but he didnt want to be stopped he saw luowski in the lavatory mirror and it just as quickly slipped out of his thought like a wet bar of soap in the shower jesss shouting about her shirt turned amandas head in her direction a conspiracy to stop him from doing what he had to do he reached out took amandas chin in his fingers and turned her toward him he brought his lips to hers and as their lips met it wasnt just any kiss but a ringinginyourears blindedbythelight kind of kiss that went on much longer than hed expected amandas eyes opened and there was a world in there a place hed never been he drew back he saw amanda standing there looking stunned and all dreamy as well but he suddenly couldnt remember what he was doing there couldnt remember how hed gotten there he felt startled dizzy then he spotted his bike and wondered if hed ridden here or had he walked the bike why am i here he thought jess skidded to a stop no she roared amandas knees went out from under her shed fainted for a moment finn remembered the kiss and he feltproudthe kiss that knocks them off their feet but there was something about jesss panic that pulled him out of it something about the way amanda collapsed so suddenly what have i done jesss face went ashen she said thats my shirt as if that explained anything whats going on he felt as if he had been shoved out onto a stage and didnt know his lines didnt know the role it was some kind a nightmare hed walked into he tried to wake himself up shes wearing my shirt not me idontunderstand finn shook amanda praying it was a practical joke but sensing there was nothing funny about it then jess shook amandas shoulders and it was clear this wasnt a joke her body was slack like she was asleep she was definitely not moving her breathing was incredibly slow and lethargic all of jesss shouting and crying wasnt going to change things wake up finn said desperately not knowing if he meant it for himself or for her he went woozy could barely keep his balance amanda was unresponsive jess looked up at finn and said what have you done finn blinked and looked around terrified he remembered luowski in the lavatory the kiss but not how it all connected why had he come here in the first place jess looked up with tears in her eyes kneeling by amanda i finn said dont know what happenedi didnt mean help me she said pulling amandas arms toward her mrs nash will be back at four we need to get her inside upstairs onto her bunk wake up he muttered finn i need you now finns senses were dulled his head thick i didnt mean it he said we have to get her inside jess said tears running down her face right now finn took amandas legs jess her arms but jess was crying too hard so finn scooped amanda up in his arms and carried her ive got her he staggered toward the front steps still trying to grasp what had happened the door opened as several girls hurried out to help they got amanda upstairs and onto the lower bunk he had so much he wanted to say but the horrified expression on jesss face said it all well tell nash jess instructed the other girls that amandas sick and is sleeping off a headache thatll cover her at least for tonight whats up one of the girls asked so she fainted so whats the big deal jess and finn met eyes jess said she bumped her head when she fell shell be all right but she might sleep through the night finns heart stopped the surprise hologram of the evil queen luowskis sudden change in attitude hed been so certain hed escaped the queens spell but now her words returned to haunt him as soft as a whisper no one will tell the curse reversed seen by the sister when kissing jezebel you he muttered looking at jess it felt like a bomb going off the pieces of a puzzle forming in your mind and finally fitting it was supposed to be you jess paled considerably she knows finn thought its nash came a voice from the hall back door jess to finn hurry finn hesitated looking down at amanda feeling horribly responsible you cant stay go jess said she pushed a folded piece of paper into his hand he stuffed it into his pocket take this i thought it was me too finn moved for the stairs but a girl waved him back finn stopped teetering on the top step pssst behind him another of the girls had opened a window leading onto the roof she motioned out the window finn had the sneaking suspicion he wasnt the first boy to be hurried out of mrs nashs house the girl at the window pressed her finger to her lips he was to go quietly she pointed to the far right of the roof finn looked back jess had dried her tears but her color had failed to return she hurried to him and handed him a folded napkin he pocketed this as well she knows it was supposed to be her he thought he ducked out and was gone they met at five pm in the back room of crazy glaze maybecks aunt left them alone wearing a worried face she knew better than to ask what was going on philbys time was limited his mother was waiting in the car outside she expected him out no later than six charlene had willa on speakerphone which sat on the table next to a dozen glazed but unfired coffee mugs the collective mood was anxious maybeck was not tossing out his usual jokes finn started off by confessing to them about the video chat where wayne had transfigured into the evil queen his going all clear and her attempt to put him under a spell which he recited word for word he told them about the second encounter with luowski in the boys room and about his kissing amanda and her collapse no one openly criticized him but their disappointment in him was obvious the keepers were a team and by not telling them earlier hed effectively gone solo he didnt need to be reminded where that had now gotten them first charlene then willa now amanda he said but it was supposed to be jess so the evil queen got you with the spell willa said and then the mirror in the bathroom the evil queen is all about mirror mirror maybe luowski reinforced the spell or something the question is philby said ever the practical one how do we break this particular spell if a kiss started it a kiss is not going to end it he glanced over at charlene remembering their kiss reverse the curse maybeck said maybe she told us without meaning to in amandas case the kiss made her into sleeping beauty instead of waking her up from a nap right so someone remind me how sleeping beauty got cursed in the first place she pricks her finger on a spindle that maleficent creates willa said over the speakerphone maleficent seriously now theres a surprise so we find a spindlea disney spindle a park spindleand we give amanda a splinter from it and we see what we see maybeck said what he said when he found himself facing skeptical looks does someone have a better idea she reversed the curse so why shouldnt we it does make sense in a weird maybeck kind of way charlene said there have got to be spindles in the parks we could at least try it right its better than doing nothing can we come back to it philby said he pushed his laptop to charlene asking her to google disney spindle i dont have much time and theres stuff about the log i absolutely have to tell you about charlene went to work typing furiously go ahead finn said but make it quick philby could be a talker and finn had no patience for that he wanted amanda back right now he couldnt remember ever feeling this onedge thisguilty finn and i hacked the mk server last night as you guys know and i downloaded the activity log ill skip the details since getting amanda back is way more important but still this could affect everything basically the ots have made themselves into dhis i have the proof empirical data they first appeared on the animal kingdom server a week ago but get this four id numbers so the evil queen and cruella have companyand we dont know who other ots if so theyre probably ones we havent met yet which is kind of freaky lets hope its not luowski or sally ringwald or some other kidsbut thats my first guess sally warned amanda and charlene that there were more of them than we could imagine maybe she meant dhis thats what id do if i were looking to defeat us create other dhis to take on ours level the playing field make it equal ground good godfrey said maybeck whats more importantmuch more importantis that after a lot of crossing over and returning in ak their data tags make a handshake with a router at disneyquest on the night of the school thing the night we saw them willa said over the phone yeah philby said but thats not possible willa said only she and philby understood the technical side and therefore spoke the same language the firewalls had to have been breached he said they jumped they jumped he confirmed further evidenced by data cloning onto the dhi servers in mk the studios and epcot finn raised his hand like a student in class but philby was focused on the phone and willa so they can go anywhere we can go willa said and places we cant go she added english is spoken here maybeck said philby said heres the fouroneone disneys carefulsuper carefulabout protecting their data each park has only two data pipes leading in and out one is for backup the other is the one typically used they have majorand when i say major i mean majorfirewalls to keep data in and hackers out thats part of what dhi shadow is all aboutits not just projectors when we physically walk outside of the parks and outside of those firewalls were lost by the system when we reenter another park our ids are picked back up and we project maybeck said keep it moving anyway theres a dhi server for each park for a reason our data cant flow through those firewalls but theirs can willa asked the ots have pulled it off somehow philby said its called jumping they jumped from animal kingdom to disneyquest and back they then propagatedspread he said directing the translation to maybeck who made a cruel face back at him their data packs to each of the park servers the only way to do that was to breach the firewalls its radical stuff bigtime stuff and im sorry but i dont see them pulling it off without the help of an imagineer and not just any imagineer but someone high upsomeone with detailed knowledge of the firewalls waynes warning finn said it had to do with the servers and about a friend turning his back that was me charlene said maybe not just you finn said maybe the queens got an imagineer under a spell or theres an allout traitor among them and not to get too conspiracy theory or anything philby said but what if thats how wanda got caught what if an insider sold her out to the cops you want to know why we havent heard from her since your mother bailed her out he asked finn its because shes convinced it will only put us in dangerthat her every move is being monitored that shes contagious and doesnt want us catching her cold you could have heard a pin drop finn said jesss sketches he passed them around the table counterclockwise starting with maybeck both were photocopies finn described them for willa one of a military guy the other the kiss in front a massive building they dont do anything for me maybeck said passing them on but its what the queen wanted from me willa said the most recent one the military guy so just to clarify charlene said you were supposed to kiss jess so she couldnt draw any more of these couldnt see the future do i have that right i wish we knew finn said but yeah i think so i thought you said you kissed amanda at mrs nashs philby said so whats with the multiplex behind you two no clue said finn you know how her visions mix stuff up i thought it might be school but youre rightit could be a movie theater or an outlet mall or something so willa said over the phone we have two sketches that dont necessarily help us but are apparently of huge importance and interest to the queen amandas in a coma because of them we think theres a possible jailbreak attempt but we dont know where or when and the woman who might be able to help us is probably under police surveillance what am i missing you make it sound so ugly charlene said what about the spindle theory finn asked i mean seriously is that all weve got reverse the curse maybeck said as much as id like to say we might find a disney character capable of countering a spell by the evil queen i cant think of any philby said anyone no one piped up no philby said its logical that if a kiss put her into this i suppose a prick from a spindle might get her out maybeck said its got to be worth a try maleficent and the queen are playing for the same team the queen throws a spell onto finn about reversing the curse i mean how can we ignore that weve got to try something finn said we cant just abandon amanda mrs nash will hospitalize her shes already threatened to send the girls back to the fairlies this will seal the deal charlene said do i have to be the one to say what were all thinking but no one wants to say she was internally fuming over the kiss but she held her tongue about that this ive got to hear maybeck said this is exactly what they want us focusing on amanda instead of them finn said i know i know he nodded reluctantly but thats where i am until amandas awake i dont care what the ots are up to how did it feel when you were crossed over without your consent maybeck said attacking charlene cause i can tell you i didnt like it not one bit im just saying we cant ignore everything else thats happening thats all agreed philby said finn said you all know where im at maybeck said heres another idea we lay a trap capture the evil queen and waterboard her until she tells us how to get amanda back spindles seriously what was i thinking there are weaver spindles in epcots morocco charlene reported reading from philbys computer and in china the acrobats spin plates on spindles those are the only ones i can find finn said i vote we get both of those and try them on amanda we do it right now tonight before mrs nash freaks out and does something random but what if they want us focused on amanda when amanda and i questioned sally ringwald she mentioned saturday morning thats tomorrow morning what if tonights the start of the future what if tonight is the jailbreak finn fingered the page torn from jesss diary the boy and the girl kissing the building in the background that looked like steps or maybe a multiplex something was bothering him about it but he couldnt make sense of it he looked up everyone was staring at him they seemed to be waiting for him to say something he looked around the table at his friends he thought about amanda collapsing to the groundthat look in jesss eyes he felt worse than hed ever felt wed better get started he said that night four of the keepers entered epcot prior to closing while philby monitored the dhi server traffic from home prepared to warn them if bandwidth usage indicated the presence of ot holograms finn entrusted dillard cole to park hop and hide three of their four phones in the magic kingdom animal kingdom and the studios in the event they later crossed over finns mother dropped him maybeck and charlene off in the epcot parking lot she planned to stay in the car prepared to help them make a hasty retreat if needed after much begging and promises made by finn that both mother and son knew would never be kept she had visited wanda alcott in her apartment on his behalf if the ots were watching wandahis reasoning wentthe arrival of a grownup at the apartment was unlikely to stir much interest the visit was short but significant finns mother working from a note card and passing along jesss two sketches briefed wanda on the events of the past week culminating in the keeper theory that they had all been betrayed by someone within the imagineerswho was either under the spell of or cooperating freely with the overtakers from what his mother later told finn this news had apparently come as no great surprise to wanda she had been avoiding contact with the keepers because she harbored the same suspicions however now given the immediacy of their need shed agreed to help finn once again in baseball cap and sunglasses hid his phonethe fourth and lastoutside mouse gear in a wallmounted metal fixture near the epcot plaza leaving the phone behind made him painfully aware of the isolation that resulted but should they fail in their efforts and the need arose to cross over later that same night they gave themselves a chance to return and that overruled all other considerations the three keepersfinn maybeck and charleneused the employee passes wayne had provided a year earlier to enter epcot by an employee entrance shortly after eight pm within minutes of their arrival into the park maybeck said do you see who i see no park visitor would have recognized her with her dark hair up in a bun and a rays baseball cap worn backward she looked tomboyish in a loosefitting mantailored shirt and dark green capri pants but for those who knew her well there was no mistaking willa they caught up to her showering her with smiles but i thought charlene said yeah wellmy mother has a library board meeting tonight and my father took a sleeping pill because hes flying to europe tomorrow and they can ground me for eternity for all i care but theres no way im leaving amanda under some stupid spell her act of courage elevated the spirits of the entire group she would team up with maybeck in morocco while finn and charlene took china as already planned philby was home monitoring server activity willa had borrowed her fathers blackberry and called philby to give him a way to reach them charlene had brought a pair of walkietalkies that had a short range her family used them on ski trips it wasnt a perfect setup but finn felt confident they could at least communicate one pair to the other they split up he and charlene caught up to dillard at an outside merchandise stall in front of mexico like two spies finn accepted the pass of a folded sheet of paper from his friend and dillard was gone off to scout china and morocco dillard had written down detailed descriptions of the locations for the phones hed hidden in the other parks for finn desperate to free amanda it felt like the hastily assembled plan was actually coming together he radioed the locations to maybeck so that all four of them now knew how to execute a return if later needed on dillards part playing even a small role in a kingdom keepers mission was the thrill of a lifetime hed often begged finn to turn him into a dhi and make him part of the group finn had told him that was impossible though he was now reconsidering beginning to wonder if expanding the keepers might be necessary the overtakers were outnumbering them something had to be done willa and maybeck headed around the east side of the lake finn and charlene the west remaining alert for crashtest dummies security patrols jesters trolls spiders vultures and a twentyfoot snake they kept to the crowds they acted as if they were in no hurry just kids out for a fun time in epcot the world showcase pavilions slipped past canada and the united kingdoms big ben on one side mexicos mayan temple and norways stave church on the other they worked to blend in keeping their heads down many kids would know what they looked like finn felt like his face had been displayed on a wanted poster their dhi host characters were known from the parks from an internet game and merchandise despite them all wearing sunglassesat nightthey had to protect themselves from being recognized and mobbed by fans near france maybeck spotted a segway ridden by a security guard forbidden from visiting the parks without permission he and willa hid inside the london tea shop and let it pass they then continued past america italy and germany finally facing the brown stucco buildings of morocco halfway across the lake from where theyd started this is my favorite country in all the world showcase willa said in a hush not that maybeck had asked i used to get henna drawings on my hands or ankles these beautiful designs that didnt wash off for weeks i havent spent a lot of time here maybeck said they remained just outside the entrance to the countrys courtyard across the main path that encircled the lake i have this thing about robes priests witches doesnt much matter to me i hate them all robes seriously i dont know where it came from or why it bugs me so much for some kids its clowns or sharks i dont love snakes or spiders either but guys in robesgirls not so muchgive me the creeps and they wear robes in morocco ive never noticed willa said sometimes they do yes sometimes they do he said defensively well if i see a robe ill warn you she said besides he said i like hanging with you better he looked away as if watching for overtakers charlenes way too happy and cheerleader for me most of the time and im not happy i didnt say that but you and me weve got similar energy levels im not talking about smarts im talking aboutenergy youyou know i kinda like philby right kinda maybeck said willa blushed everyone knows you like philby except philby yeah well thats philby maybe thats what makes him so easy to like are you saying im not easy to like maybeck said i did not say that youre very easy to like youve got that right he said willa bit back a smile so tell me something do you like to be called donnie or terry better i couldnt care less he said you must have a preference sadly no call me whatever you like just dont call me late to dinner she said interrupting thats a very old joke donnie he shrugged im an old soul people were already positioning themselves around the lake reserving prime spots for the upcoming fireworks display the keepers planned to use illuminations to their advantage do you think were wasting our time with this spindle thing maybeck asked since it had been largely his idea iahyou and i have both been trapped in the syndrome so i dont have to explain to you why id do anything to break the spell on amanda that doesnt exactly answer my question i can see how it makes sense you think were wasting our time i have no other plan she said no one had any other plan reverse the curse donnie it makes sense it really does i just dont want to be the one wasting our time he sounded younger all of a sudden apologetic finn and philby make a lot of the tough decisions she said especially finn youre holding out on me girl maybeck said catching an expression passing across her face iits something someone told me when i was in sbs if youre nice to me maybe ill share it or maybe ill just share it with the girls i can be very nice thats for me to judge weaver spindles maybeck reminded the crowd inside morocco thinning as the fireworks neared the gift shop yeah theres a gift shop in the world showcase now theres a surprise he said sarcastically they sell small rugs theres a rug loom on display spindles ill create a diversion you grab one of the spindles simple she said why does the black kid have to be the thief thats awful thats not it at all and you know it first of all youre just maybeck to me kay second youre not a thief but you are a boy youre better at this stuff boys are better at stealing if youre chicken ill do it she said okay good you do it ill create the diversion youre serious absolutely okay willa said reluctantly clearly unhappy with the arrangement as the disney voice announced the start of reflections of earth park guests rushed the lake in droves forming a human ring fifty people deep around the entire lake maybeck said if we get separated we meet outside the bathrooms by the train display at germany its just around the i know where it is youre mad at me am not she said clearly lying its just ive never stolen anything in my life and that was a record i was hoping to keep and i have i didnt say that we can flip a coin if you like i like you got a coin he asked checking his pockets ill do it she said just dont say i never did anything for you you wont get caught because my jobs to make sure you dont get caught you never quit do you hey if you dont believe in yourself then who will finn hipchecked charlene turning her down the wide curving jungle path between mexico and norway it deadended into a wide wooden gate a cast members only entrance to the right in the soft shadow of darkness appeared the shape of a woman and charlene startled its okay finn said encouraging charlene forward its wanda shes expecting us wanda alcott greeted them both with hugs holding on to finn like she might a nephew her gratitude for his bailing her out of jail was written all over her face its all arranged wanda said they added the extra show it starts any minute better from here on if its just us girls finn nodded charlene knew the plan but not wandas involvement should anything go wrong and lord knows it can wanda said ive arranged a way out for you and for the other two for that matter the characters are all on your side wanda said the cast members charlene clarified some of them too wanda said but no charlene i mean the characters they have been supportive of all of you from the beginning but that meansfrom the beginning she felt overwhelmed their support could change everything my father was reluctant to organize themquite honestly not knowing whom to trust but the dust has settled hmm and theres every indication now that theyve come together as a group its tremendous progress and its in large part because of the example youve set for so many yearsdecadestheyve been individuals theyve enjoyed the flattery of daily attention like with movie stars that creates some interesting personalitiesjust read the tabloids but so many of them want the magic to remain in the parks their very existence is at stake if the overtakers have their way theyll all be wiped out gone hard to imagine a world like that i dont want to imagine a world like that charlene said its not just the overtakers we have to worry about finn said there are security guys whove come after us before its not like we can trust just any disney employee no there are definite pockets within various groups to watch out for the poison has spread to the imagineers finn said i spoke with your mother in any war there is the threat of double agents and were at war charlene said we will be soon darkness descends wanda said looking up into the night sky she grabbed charlene by the hand nodded to finn and led the girl through the cast member doorway charlene looked back at finn through the gloom her face a mask of worry and concern finn suddenly felt horribly alone fireworks exploded over the lake when maybeck created a diversion he did it maybeckstyle big time he knocked over a tall urn containing tiki torches the resulting cacophony was like a stampede of wild horses the chaos compounded by maybecks intentional fumbling as he tried to rectify the situation he kicked the torches around in a storm of rattling bamboo and set the urn rolling toward the checkout desk the two cast members remaining in the store hurried over to help willa standing alongside a straw basket containing a very reallooking cobra that flicked its tongue at her grabbed the weaving spindle from the loom on display and pulled hard to break the yarn but the display was deceptive the yarn was not really yarn but some kind of unbreakable nylon string it wasnt going to break no matter how hard she pulled so with the cast members laboring to help maybeck with the spilled tiki torches willa began unwrapping the string from the spindle as fast as she could maybeck glanced in willas direction several times clearly annoyed and frustrated by her taking so much time finally she reached the end of the string and the spindle came loose she stuffed it into her pocket and nodded slightly when she caught maybeck looking together with the cast members maybeck collected the torches and stood them back up in the urn and the urn was moved back into place maybeck apologized profusely and slipped out one side of the store as willa left opposite him she turned left toward the brightly exploding sky and the mobs of people watching the spectacle a security guard on a segway was headed right for her then she spotted a second segway on maybecks side willa turned around and walked in the other direction deeper into morocco the stolen spindle felt like it weighed a hundred pounds in her pocket she thought about tossing it but if the security guy was watching her hed see she glanced over her shoulder the security guy had stopped at the store she faced forward and found herself looking into the eyes of an old mana street beggar there was at once something sad about this poor man and yet something else vaguely familiar she stopped abruptly both afraid and intrigued maybeck appeared behind the old man coming around the far corner perhaps the old guy caught the shift in her vision or maybe he had eyes in the back of his head but he knew someone was there he backed up forming a triangle with them should i call the authorities he asked in a creaky old voice do you think they might be interested in a missing spindle but how willas breath caught maybeck stopped he and willa exchanged a look of despair go on your way old man maybeck said old man do you think so as he laughed the silk veil that hung across his chin billowed like a sail he paused a moment looking between them making sure he had their attention iwantyourmagic i will spare your lives if you give it to me now willa felt a shortness of breath there was something about the way hed said magic that cut to her core shed never considered herself as possessing any magic and yet here was this weird old man not only claiming that but wanting her to hand it over it was like someone trying to rob you of something you didnt know you possessed wait a second who are you maybeck stepped back and indicated for willa to do the same think you can outrun me do you that would be a terrible mistake to make i can outrun you on one leg old man said maybeck the silk veil dropped revealing a pointed jaw the old mans body stretched and grew taller willa understood why his jaundiced eyes had seemed so familiar the person who stood before them was not an old man at all it was jafar willas gasp echoed off the walls lest you forget what im capable of jafar said and immediately transformed into a cobrathe clothes falling in a pile on the cobblestone street at his feet the cobra lifted its head and its neck flared maybeck muttered willa i dont do snakes no wonder the cobra in the store had looked so real she realized dontmove not planning on it maybeck said the cobra aimed first at willa then at maybeck one leg huh she said very funny what now willa addressed the cobra we are willing to listen to your proposal the snake moved with insane swiftness into the leg of the fallen pants and suddenly jafar stood before them once more good decision he said each time the fireworks boomed willa flinched colors flashed on the walls surrounding them turning their faces blue red green and white in rhythmic pulses exactly what magic are we talking about maybeck asked the window magic windows like the software maybeck said i dont think were talking software willa said what kind of windows she asked jafar window magic he said i wish this also what the evil one has i must possess as well windows maybeck said still confused and trying to wrap his head around their situation for him jafar was one of the worst disney villains out there he killed people or tried to he placed no value on human life maybeck assumed hed just as soon turn into a cobra and bite them dead as let them walk away so it came down to convincing him he could get what he wanted without knowing exactly what he wanted beside maybeck willa backed up a step jafar seemed in opposition to or ignorant of maleficents overtakers both possibilities fascinated her was there division in the ranks did jafar command a splinter cell speculation fled as she caught sight of a display carousel in the open doorway to the gift shop immediately behind her whats up maybeck said softly in her direction jafar seemed to understand he was outnumbered he looked between them like a fan at a tennis match hang in there with me she said hanging maybeck said jafar raised his thin hideous hand and said dont make me do something id rather not but willa kept moving ever so slowly toward the display carousel and the merchandise it contained necklaces fans hand mirrors aladdin turbans scarves and more jafar said you will give me magic only then will i let you leave alive you are one generous dude maybeck said and right now im thinking theres no one wed rather give our magic to than you trouble is right now we cant be giving our magic out in the open you know we bring the magic and next thing you know all those people out there are going to want it and thats no good for any of us you with me jafar trained his yellow eyes onto maybeck stopping him in his tracks you dont have it do you jafar sounded crushed and angry extremely angry i misjudged you magic is not something you can leave behind one either has it or not and if you dont have it you are of no use to me willa had to hope not only that her current line of thinking was correct but that she had perfect pitch she also had to remember back to second gradewhich for her had been an unpleasant time when her two front teeth had been roughly the size of her thumbnails and her classmates had teased her for being so ugly she grabbed hold of a snakecharmers flute from the display carousel in second grade it had been a recorder flute for the christmas show she drew it to her mouth and played a haunting melody from a faraway land that shed just heard inside the store within the first few notes of the snakecharming melody jafar slapped his ugly hands over his large ears and backed away from her already beginning to sink to the ground shrinking away like a snake inside a wicker basket maybeck looked on in amazement how did you shut up get ready to run i do not need to get ready i am so out of here come over behind me maybeck slid over behind willa and with her continuing to play the melody the two backed away from the recoiling jafar she dropped the flute they turned and ran finn stood in the front row of the crowd of the hundred or so people surrounding a ropedoff area designated for the chinese acrobats fireworks tore holes in the sky as a coach and a group of twelve girls and eight boys appeared in gymnastics uniforms the crowd broke into applause the girls were mostly all tiny and young wearing light blue leotards all with basically the same bobandstraightbangs haircut the somewhat older chinese boys formed a line behind hands clasped behind their backs flexing their arm muscles and awaiting their turn it took a moment for finn to recognize the thirdtolast girl in line as charlene she wore a wig that matched the other girls with the addition of some eye makeup and blush she blended in surprisingly well but just seeing her there made finn think how stupid a plan this was there had to have been a better way than this to get the spindle but there was no turning back now the coacha strong looking older guy with a bald headclapped his hands twice and the show began finn looked away not wanting to see what a fool charlene was about to make of herself despite her claim that shed seen the routine enough times to know it by heart finn knew that seeing it and being able to do it were two different things with his eyes averted and squeezed shut he cowered from what he expected was going to be a collective gasp as charlene missed a move and crashed the show opened with tumbling acts that defied belief diving through hoops two girls at a time somersaults human pyramids no collective gasp finn squinted one eye open surprised to see charlene flying through a hoop and landing in a somersault the crowd cheered not only did she know the routines but she executed them flawlessly flying bodies camera flashes and a cheering crowd occupied the next several minutes a roar erupted celebrating a standing pyramidfour girls across on the bottom row charlene one of them all at once finn felt a hand on his right shouldera very hard hand then another on his left shoulder he was in the grasp of two meanlooking warriorshunswith severe brows and narrow eyes they wore ancient decorative armor and were incredibly intimidating to look at the spectators around finn stepped back and took pictures finn glanced toward charlene who was no longer in the pyramid the girls had stood to the side it was the boys turn more applause the two guards hauled finn out of the crowd as video and digital cameras captured it all there was no messing with these guys their grip unrelenting as they marched him toward a circular building that looked like a giant hat finn said im actually more interested in the acrobats than a private tour they said nothing he wasnt even sure they spoke english they tossed him through an open door and then turned their backs blocking him from leaving he was standing in a vast circular room the air still chinese lute music played a haze filled the air streaked by flickering light from projectors film footage of chinese landscapes played on the degree screen finn looked for any marked exit signs and saw only the one being guarded by the two men behind him he heard footsteps in spite of the loud music a cold shiver passed through him as shanyu from mulan stepped out of the haze leader of the huns a barbarian warlord shanyus shoulders were wide his head large and his expression fierce he wore a thin wispy mustache on an otherwise brutal face you are leader he asked his voice heavily accented me finn said putting the sunglasses up onto the cap im just a park visitor the invisible ones you are leader invisible ones finn thought that was new yes that would be me tell your emperor to send his strongest armies im ready the warrior said i have no emperor finn said we have no army only emperor have no emperor you do not look like emperor i am not an emperor then tell your emperor to send his strongest army why would he do that finn asked leader of invisible ones i am not afraid of me i mean you no harm what exactly do you want what does every man want shanyu asked an xbox a ps finn thought immortality he answered shanyu appeared impressed how is immortality achieved he asked by doing greatness or finn added great evil by winning wars by commanding empires the gods approve of those who do their bidding finn had studied china in fifth grade he understood there had been child emperors younger than he was so he couldnt play the kid card instead he thought the better idea was to impress shanyu or try to but is not the man who builds the bridge for the army more important than the army he asked the man who makes the bows more important than the archer the man who trains the horse more important than the rider shanyu answered the man who commands the army is more important than all of them for the army does his bidding his bidding or the gods bidding shanyu took a step closer you are indeed a wise leader i see that clearly in you i am a humble servant serving the lorddisney my lord is great and powerful his reach is wide his army vast you and the other one enter my kingdom without invitation this makes you both spies in my kingdom spies are put to death i death he was thinking and why was shanyu speaking only of his own kingdom there was no mention of the overtakers as a group if you put me to death how will i tell my emperor you are ready for him so you have emperor this clearly makes you spy nonono metaphorically finn tried again my army is but five strong five battalions five legions five warriors finn said we present no threat to you great lord our fight is with the green one shanyu stepped back at the mention of maleficent it didnt give finn the impression the two were the best of friends when two leaders share a common enemy finn said does that not make them brothers allies you are a sorcerer invisible one a confessed spy spies are killed not negotiated with if you cannot deliver your army he withdrew a curved gleaming sword from its scabbard the ring of steel echoing like a bell five of shanyus warriors appeared seemingly out of nowhere they had him surrounded all five with their hands on their sword hilts finn could picture his head lying on the floor shouldnt we talk about this he asked shanyu kill the girl shanyu called out loudly i will take care of this one myself finn glanced to the door and the backs of the two guards he had to reach charlene before the warriors did she wouldnt see them coming like him she would think they were part of the show with each step shanyu took toward him finn took a step back glad to see that with all the armor he wore the man was not terribly light on his feet the film moved ahead from ancient times to the present a highspeed train zoomed around the circular wall shanyu knew of finns magic the invisible ones hed probably seen their epcot dhis and marveled at the holograms if finn could impress him perhaps he could intimidate him he closed his eyes and relaxed toward a state of all clear knowing it would only last for a matter of seconds light played across his eyelidsa glint from shanyus sword or the bullet trains headlight his limbs tingled a slight smile played across his lips he heard the blade slice the air and fought not to open his eyes he wouldnt be able to hold all clear if he saw a blade aimed for his neck swish the sound moved left to right he opened his eyes an offbalance shanyu glared at him staring in disbelief clearly hed cut through finns neck and had expected his head to fall the general looked over at the swords blade and back at finn finn stepped forward and walked through him shanyu cried out and spun around swinging his sword finn turned immediately and walked through the man for a second time his limbs tingling as his all clear timed out for shanyu finn had vanished each time the general had spun around the boy had stepped toward him and disappeared real magic now he spotted finn and studied him more closely most impressive he muttered we share the same enemy finn said join us he held out his hand shanyu studied finns hand then looked him up and down allies share their resources will you share this power of yours iahit isnt mine to share guards shanyu thundered kill him finn sprinted for the door splitting the warriors as they were turning around he ran hard charlene he hollered approaching the audience huddled around the acrobats he spotted a stick flying endoverend from the center of the show the spindle he jumped up and caught it in midair he spotted her charlene ran across the acrobats mat flew through the air and hit a minitrampoline she flipped over the heads in the crowd landing neatly in stride with finn as the spectators roared you took long enough she said the two running full speed had an appointment with royalty he said shanyu what now finn it was dillard hed turned over a plastic barrel soda cans and ice belched from its open end as dillard sent it rolling toward the oncoming guards like a bowling ball heading for the pins finn spotted a girl waving at them from a dugout canoe beneath a sky thundering with fireworks the guards were forced to dive out of the way of dillards barrel coming through shouted dillard clearing the crowd for finn and charlene by running through angry guests dillard was not fat but he wasnt small when he wanted a crowd to part it parted having cut a path for his friend he held open a space at the railing finn and charlene jumped the railing and hurried down into the canoe waiting there was mulan she raised her bow and arrow dont shoot dillard said clambering over the railing hurry finn said reaching to help dillard aboard mulan fired an arrow thwack it struck something hard finn looked up to see it had landed in a shield carried by one of shanyus warriors mulans two warriors two boys older than him whom finn hadnt seen until that moment pulled on paddles the canoe moved swiftly away from shore and out into the flashing lake color rained from the sky you are safe now mulan said we will pick up your friends at the bridge and we will carry you however far you need to go the river it is long charlene looked down at the spindle in finns hand we got it she said we got it finn echoed mrs whitman picked up finn maybeck willa dillard and charlene from downtown disney where mulan had dropped them the conversation in the canoe had gone something like this so finn said are you really mulan or a cast member playing mulan let me ask you something the beautiful warrior woman responded who were you running from just now cast members ahyeahokay i get it finn said dillard looked confused but impressed maybeck and willa remained silent kneeling near the second thwart from the stern they looked back toward the shore bewilderment on their faces maybeck said no matter how much i think im used to what goes on here it still freaks me out the chinese warriors navigated the lake weaving the canoe between the exploding barges of fireworks the air heavy with the tangy smell of gunpowder by now the reflections of earth team led by sam has seen us mulan explained sam is the crew chief his men have powerboats and we are forbidden from being out here so unless you would like to explain yourself to park security which i have no intention of doing i would suggest you pick up a paddle and help out that put all conversation on hold charlene dillard finn maybeck and willa grabbed paddles and began digging into the water with all their strength the canoe raced silently across the black surface of the lake the gigantic globe of the earth was spreading color across the water if we can make it to the bridge at france before sam catches us mulan called out we can play a trick on him everyone put their backs into it the canoe moved smoothly and silently they left the fiery barges behind well be harder to see over there maybeck said mulan explained the light from the barges will blind them itll buy us some time finn saw a powerboat zooming toward them that would be sam mulan said faster finn cried out less than five minutes later sams security boat motored beneath the bridge leading to france on the walkway that was meant to imitate the quay along the river seine in paris there were some boxes a bicycle a chest and an upsidedown canoe hiding beneath the inverted canoe tucked into balls and holding their shins were two warriors mulan and five kids with barely an inch of space left over the motorboat turned heading back into the lake now riding in the whitmans car finn needed yet another favor from his mom we need to make a stop finn please am i not supposed to ask why if you ask im going to have to lie and since i dont lie to you it might be better if you dont ask she huffed dillard what if anything do you have to do with all this im an innocent bystander that cracked up everyone in the car my sense is dillard mrs whitman said that no one in this car including me is entirely innocent that quieted them down she said where to finn gave her the address by intersection he added it might be good if you stopped like a half block away finn she scolded im just saying what have i gotten myself into mrs whitman complained were trying to save someone mrs whitman charlene said someone important to us maybeck said in a rare moment of genuine concern someone who needs us willa added mrs whitman nodded thoughtfully if i were a kid again she said i would want you all as my friends from then on she didnt ask any more questions finn and willa met jess in back of mrs nashs house maybeck and dillard staked out the street in case greeneyes were secretly watching the foster home charlene stayed by the car having borrowed mrs whitmans phone to call philby to catch him up jess looked tired and unwell as they huddled in the shadow alongside a freestanding garden shed behind mrs nashs house how is she finn asked nothing she answered in a whisper she hasnt moved hasnt changed one bit these should help finn said producing the acrobats spindle willa passed her the weavers spindle youll need to carve off a splinter and prick her finger i really do not want to do this said jess willa said think of it as giving her a shot shes going to wake up this is all going to be over jesss sad eyes said it all she didnt believe willa she may have wanted to but she didnt were going to wait here finn said for the good news you cant stay jess said mrs nash is inside supposedly im putting out the trash she said indicating the bulging plastic bag at her feet i cant do this until later ill email you she said to finn depending what works out youll let us know right away he asked as soon as i can well be waiting finn said yes i know that she thanked them both are you sure youre okay willa asked deeply concerned shes so still so deadlooking finn thought hed carried her he knew itll be over soon finn said shes going to be fine reverse the curse i hope youre right jess disposed of the sack of garbage slipped the two spindles down her pants to hide them and returned inside shes bad off willa said yes i noticed with everyone back in the car and mrs whitman driving she dropped maybeck off first once outside the car he leaned back in and gave willa a hug you were great tonight you too he ran down the driveway and was gone willa was next she sneaked around the house to slip inside there was no car in the drive thankfully shed beaten her mother home then came charlene whose mother waved to mrs whitman from the front door dillard cole mrs whitman said does your mother know where youve been ah hes been over at our house finn said kinda thats what i thought said mrs whitman finn stopped his friend with a hand on the shoulder dude you were awesome tonight finn smiled just dont ever do it again it was way cool dillard said good night and headed inside its nice you two are connecting again mom dont get all mushy on me its amanda his mother said to finn you contacted jess so it must be amanda it is finn said long ago hed promised never to lie to his parents and he worked daily to keep that promise he could and did stretch the truth when needed but he never outright lied you needed something from the park to help her yes did you get it we think so yes so you stole something from epcot borrowed finn borrowed we will return them i promise them his mother said she was way too smart he couldnt give her this kind of data to work with you wouldnt believe me if i told you mom we should leave it at that i believe a lot more than your father believes i know that speaking of which you let me handle your father when we get home go along with whatever i say aye aye finn said and dont try anything without telling me first were in this together now finn like it or not not finn thought but didnt say okay he answered his mother tried too hard with her explanation she would never make a spy finns father gave him the corneroftheeye look that typically made finn feel like running straight to the bathroom instead he shrank off to his room feeling troubled the sound of the blade coming for his neck still fresh in his ears what if hed misjudged his sense of all clear what if the all clear had expired more quickly the simplicity of jesss email message compounded finns pain it didnt work thanks for trying he stared at the computer screen as if by just looking it might change the message neither spindle had worked what a stupid idea it had been finn had been so convinced that reversing the curse would do it he convened an emergency video conference philby willa and maybeck were able to attend charlenes mother had turned off the family wifi for the night so she followed along on the familys landline telephone with random updates from willa philby said i thought one of the spindles would work i have to tell you the more i thought about it the more it made sense charlene said they were the only two google hits that make any sense but remember in the movie its a spindle from a spinning wheel shes right philby said ive been doing some research surprise finn thought and in the original fairy tale after the curse is put on the princess the king forbids anyone from owning a distaff or spindle the distaff holds the raw fiber the spindle collects the spun thread spinning wheel he emphasized and when you google disney world plus wooden wheel you get a single decent lead the waterwheel on tom sawyer island finn said you got it a wooden wheel im not liking this maybeck blurted out he and finn had once been attacked on tom sawyer island by stitch and had been made to swim among alligators the spindle thing was your idea philby protested but this is so totally ot maybeck said they put a spell on amanda and the only solution leads us into a trap i mean come on relax we cant steal a waterwheel finn said no philby said agreeing his voice held that knowitall tone that finn had come to resent but what if we could bring amanda to it shes down for the count maybeck said thats right philby said shes asleep maybeck broke the resulting silence are we done finn answered philbys saying that if amanda is asleep then technically he could cross her over what maybeck exclaimed why not philby asked when were asleep we cross over is that possible charlene asked youre saying shed awake as her dhi philby answered its possible i think its worth a try we cross her over prick her finger with a piece of the waterwheel and when i return you all the amanda at mrs nashs wakes up let me spell this out for you maybeck groaned trap charlene objected the ots couldnt possibly think wed cross her over terry whatever they may have planned it cant be this and remember finn said they wanted jess in that spell not amanda depending on the greeneyes they may not even know its amanda whos down it doesnt change it from being a trap maybeck said we owe it to amanda to try anything we can think of finn proposed but what about the bigger picture maybeck said the jailbreak its going down tonight right sally ringwald basically told us so so you and charlene will go to sleep dressed to cross over in case philby detects network traffic does that satisfy you i dont like it maybeck said by tomorrow morning finn said mrs nash is going to drag amanda off to the hospital maybe even sometime tonight we know how dangerous that is for her philby knows it only makes things worse maybeck philby said much worse we cant just sit around talking finn said we tried and failed so what weve got to try everything a wooden wheel who knows that could be it i can let wanda know our plans she might help or she could be the traitor maybeck said wed never suspect someone whod been arrested would we so noted finn said experiencing a chill and if it is a trap or shes a traitor then its going to be up to you and charlene to get us off the island he would send jess an email keeping her in the loop keeping her hopes up thats what im talking about maybeck said finn arrived in front of cinderella castle alone sitting a few feet from the walt disneymickey mouse statue at the center of the hub he waited and waited knowing philbys next attempt would be to cross over amanda he caught himself holding his breath as a shimmering image of amanda lying down appeared and then fizzled and faded as he watched come on he muttered the same image reappeared it grew stronger and more solid and the blue line formed around it amanda blinked and opened her eyes finn swallowed away a knot in his throat can you hear me he said she blinked but did not look in his direction the spell seemed to still be holding her its me he said we crossed you over into the magic kingdom i think we can help you her eyes popped open again finn scouted the area for signs of ots he felt vulnerable with her apparent inability to move can you sit up he asked moving over to her and helping to raise her back he spotted motion in some shrubs by the ramp up to the castle dont move he whispered in amandas ear he froze a dog came out of the shrubs a big dog itspluto he told amanda pluto was no villain if hed come to help it had to be wandas or waynes doing amanda still hadnt fully come around her eyes moved more freely but she wasnt speaking here boy finn hissed holding out his hand pluto was big and strongerlooking than finn would have expected the dog faced him sniffing the air he wagged his tail and sat down we are here to help finn said pluto turned toward the bushes wagging his tail violently what is it boy pluto barked just once but loudly causing finn to again jump back pluto was trying to warn him of something or someone in the bushes amanda he said softly without taking his eyes off the bushes im here he turned to look she looked tired but she was working on smiling i feel a little zoned i can explain it all at some point but for now can you move we should get away from here pluto darted over to the bushes his tail still wagging finn tentatively followed crossing the street and edging closer to the bushes plutos tail was going like a windshield wiper finn sneaked up and parted the bushes he couldnt believe his eyes minnie he said in a whisper she gave him a sweet humble look lowering her head while looking out the tops of her big eyes im finn he said over there thats amanda minnie nodded finn looked around the area mickey he asked her she lifted her arms and shrugged she looked crestfallen hes not here finn said making it a statement she shook her head not here with you he said thinking aloud or not here in the magic kingdom she shrugged for a second time i he couldnt think what to say he was awestruck mickey and minnie were rock stars he recalled what wanda had told him are there more of you minnie hesitated pluto nudged him from behind he looked back to see amanda trying to get to her feet thanks he hurried back to her minnie and pluto followed he helped amanda stand up and held her by the arm my friends in trouble he told the other two i we need to get onto tom sawyer island minnie smiled and nodded she lifted a finger as if to say just a minute pluto came around and heeled at finns side youre staying with me finn said the dog nodded minnie saluted finn and took off running in the direction of frontierland im guessing he said youre staying to protect us the dog yipped and shes gone ahead for some reason he barked again are you talking to pluto amanda asked with a dry voice are you all right he asked ive been better my head weighs a thousand pounds we need to go he said i can manage are you going to tell me how i got here i kissed you he said i dont think so she said thats not something i would forget i promise i kissed you it was a spell intended for jess he walked her off the hub and toward frontierland condensing and summarizing her story into as brief an explanation as possible pluto nudged between them and leaned into amanda i think finn said he wants you to hold onto his collar plutos tail went wild with excitement amanda reached down and took hold pluto lifted his head proudly his tail shot up like a flagpole this is definitely strange finn said jess was not a mother she had never even owned a pet like the other fairlies she had never met her mother had no idea if she had living relatives the closest thing she had to a family member was amanda whom she thought of as her sister in fact she and amanda often introduced themselves as sisters so as the kingdom keepers carried out their plan to cross amanda over into the magic kingdom in hopes of reversing the curse jess sat by her sisters bedside a few minutes earlier she thought shed witnessed the cross over amanda had twitched and shuddered and more encouragingly her eyes had begun moving rapidly beneath her closed eyelids the other girls in mrs nashs house were supportive of her effort to keep amandas condition secret this included their roommate jeannie pucket who until now had often been a real knucklehead but jeannie had come through for jess not once but a number of timesholding off the curious mrs nash and buying her unconscious roommate precious time it wasnt going to last much longer jess thought it seemed inevitable that mrs nash would find out that in turn would mean doctors and a long downward spiral for poor amanda with her diary open to the kiss a page she had photocopied for finn her eyelids drooped and she briefly nodded off her diary slipped from her hands landed on the bed and fell to the floor the sound of the book landing shocked her awake and she looked around the room as if shed been asleep for hours its nothing jeannie said you dropped your diary is all jeannie leaned down to retrieve it about to hand it to jess she hesitated if you dont mind jess said thats private jeannie knew it was privateit was her diarya source of ongoing tension between the two jeannie could allow her curiosity to get the better of her i know i know still jeannie was reluctant to hand it over her attention fixed on the sketch finally she passed the diary back to jess have you been there she asked whats it like school jess asked what are you talking about winter park where finn and amanda go thats not winter park high jeannie said thats the lake buena vista power plant i just wrote a paper on it for science class science class lake what jess said jeannie traced the stairstep profile of the structure in the background of the kiss its called the lake buena vista cogeneration facility hang on ill show you jeannie dug through some papers on her desk including a bunch of printouts from various web sites she singled out three of these and passed them to jess so jeannie leaned over jesss shoulder selected the second of the three printoutsa photograph taken at a great distance from the power plantand traced the stairstepped roofline of the facility she then pointed to jesss diary and traced the same pattern jess went silent her eyes dancing between the two images she knew her dreams often combined locations or activities what exactly does it do jess asked electricity it powers disney world and local businesses disney world jess felt lightheaded this was not coincidence water and sewage treatment too natural gas everything i got an a on my paper she announced proudly as in electricity for the parks exactly yeah thats the disney part they wanted to own their own electricity and stuff you know so it was more reliable and everything jess traced the two rooflines againfrom the web site and from her drawing they werent simply similar they were identical where exactly is this place its way out on disney property as in the boonies disney property you sure about that hello an a did you know that at one point walt disney had planned for epcot to be this futuristic city with homes all around it how cool would that have been jess barely heard her her brain was stuck back on disney generating its own power shed drawn a disney power plant in her diary without knowing it it had to be hugely significant she had to contact philby now philby had his hands full he kept one eye on the clock in his computers toolbar the other eye jumped between the dozen webcam views from the magic kingdoms security server as he tracked finn through the park his cell phone rested on his lap in vibrate mode the laptop bridging his thighs he sat on the toiletlid closedof what his mother called the powder room a small windowless bathroom with a corner sink near the front door of the house he had the bathrooms door locked there would be no unexpected intrusions by hugo or anyone else tonight he could not afford to leave the keepers stranded the email from jess caused him to perspire he googled lake buena vista cogeneration facility he had a fine memory so when a photograph of the power plant popped up he immediately matched the similarities with jesss diary sketch from what he read the power plant supplied all of walt disney world with power if something happened to the florida electric grid disneys facility promised an uninterrupted flow of electricity to all of its parks and hotels and computer servers he thought jess had foreseen its importance in one of her dreams that the kiss used the power plant as a background did not necessarily connect the two jesss diary pages often mixed images and time lines but it established its importancejesss track record was well proven with the power plants direct connection to the parks and its location outside the parks but still on disney property the ots jumping the disney firewalls suddenly took on tremendous significance control of the power plant meant control of the parksthe overtakers ultimate goal he had no way to reach finn to update him but he did have maybeck and charlene asleep and on standby to be crossed over he brought up his rendering of the router traffic hed mapped from the dhi servers log already chastising himself there had been several pings to a router out in the middle of nowhere on google maps it just came up as an area of swamplandbut now he saw his error for security reasons power plant locations were blocked from internet maps hed been looking at the power plant all along because those pings represented ot dhi traffic the ots had been to the lake buena vista cogeneration plant several times in the past week at that moment his dhi traffic alarm sounded and a red message flashed on his screen bandwidth usage philby tried to focus his breathing rapid his heartbeat out of rhythm theyre there right now pluto was waiting for them this way finn said gently steering amanda while trying to move her more quickly why are we running she asked visitors finn said glancing back plutos hackles had been up for the past several minutes and he kept looking behind them his eyes a knot of concern finn had tried to see whatever it was back there that was bothering pluto but only caught a shadow crossing the empty park path in frontierland you see that he asked amanda there it was again the flash of translucent eyes from the shadows like a deer on the side of a highway amanda skidded to a stop for shed seen them too but for the first time another dog finn asked amandas blue hologram line faded as she lost a considerable percentage of her dhi to fear not a dog she said did you see how high off the ground that was they were walking backward now still moving in the direction of the toms landing raft dock but refusing to take their eyes off the shadows by country bear jamboree where theyd both seen the pair of eyes an animals rapid breathing could be heard drawing closer finn whispered that has to be a dog listen to it its tall very tall pluto is a great dane amanda reminded him and theres another in the movie the ugly dachshund never seen it the dog or the movie she asked they walked faster now keeping their eyes on the moving shadows while trying not to fall they heard a wet slurp from what had to be an extremely large tongue another flash of eyes ehh amanda reached for finn and clutched his arm tightly he actually appreciated the contact though not the reason for it a sliver of light from one of the few lighted streetlamps played like a knifes edge across the path severing the darkness through the shaft of light strode a long hairy creature rail thin malnourished and mangy only a few inches visible at a time like it was being painted by a tiny flashlight it had enormous paws and four stick legs but it was absurdly oversized had pointed teeth and a stream of drool that turned their stomachs finn said harshly thats no dog a wolf amanda said her voice quavering thats the big bad wolf the thing was as tall as a bicycle and looked to be about as fast what now she asked the wolf lumbered out into the light its back haunches moving fluidly its ribs showing through the tangle of filthy hair a bonechilling growl from behind them pluto whod been leading the way had stopped and was turned toward the challenger no boy finn said it was no match but pluto stood his ground as amanda and finn backed up past him putting himself between them and the wolf come pluto amanda whispered harshly the dog did not budge but lowered himself onto his front paws and tucked his tail between his legs pluto looked back at finn with noble eyes he wants us to run finn said you speak dog do you are you strong enough are you kidding believe me im wide awake on three he said are you sure about this no finn said pluto had lived long enough to be the age of an egyptian mummy in dog years in that time hed learned a few tricks not the kind of tricks like roll over or shake hands but the kind of tricks to play on other animals pursuing you over the years these tricks had been refined to the point that they approached actual skillspie in the face tongue in the mousetrap peanut butter in the dog bowl theyd been welldocumented in all the cartoons when faced with the big bad wolfemphasis on big and badpluto had the luxury of seeing it play out as a cartoon where others wouldve panicked he saw an opportunity for entertainment and amusement in a cartoon no matter how hard the punishment the dog always got up to play another day it never crossed his small mind that the wolf would actually eat him in plutos world a dog could fall out of a tree or get hit by a bus and come out of it with nothing more than stars floating around his head and his eyes rolling in their sockets one quick shake and everything was better so it wasnt a question of fear it was a question of how to make this really funny and the more inventive the solution the better he spotted it easily one of those plastic grid fences meant to keep people off sidewalks or out of gardens or away from construction they used them all the time in the park it was currently wrapped around an island of flowers with a sign hanging from it saying a bunch of words he couldnt read but he was pretty sure ended in thank you pluto was no rhodes scholar with the wolfs confident stride picking up pace pluto knew the trick was to get him running that was when he gave the boy the signal for a second the boy and girl just continued walking backward which put a glitch in his plan humans could be so boneheaded so he barked and that got the kids moving they took off toward minnie and the dock like hed fired a starting gun that prompted el lobo to spring into action it bared its teeth squinted its eyes and charged that was when pluto realized this might not be so much fun hed never seen an animal move so fast it was as if the creature had been shot from a catapult pluto had badly misjudged the time necessary to pull of his stunt wolf seconds were different than dog seconds with nothing but fourlegged teeth coming at him pluto found the end of the mesh fence with his own mouth and bit down hard he wrestled a stake from the soft dirt and then backed up as fast as he could drag it dislodging one stake after another the fence stretched across the pathhalfway three quarters the wolfs confidence or hunger had him running much too fast to come to any kind of graceful stop instead as pluto stretched the fence and wrapped it around a small tree the wolfs paws scratched and clawed at the concrete path but found no traction he lost his footing tucked and rolled colliding with the fence which aimed him on an angle toward the water across from pecos bill café the wolf backpedaled but failed to stop his momentum he tumbled head over heels into the water pluto turned and ran seeing clearly there was only one thing scarier than the big bad wolf and that was a big mad wolf minnie waved finn toward the raft that serviced tom sawyer island he and amanda had just heard a violent splash turning in time to see a violently angry wolf swimming violently for shore pluto bounded toward them at full speed the panicked look in his eyes needing no translation the two kids wound through the empty waiting line for the raft ride amanda shrieked and slid to an abrupt stop finn crashed into her from behind an unconscious pirate lay at his feet he was gnarly looking with a scrub beard a pockmarked face and bent nose a bandana worn as a skullcap hid most of a particularly nasty bump finn looked between the fallen pirate and minnie who stood on the edge of the raft a shore line in one hand the other tucked behind her back minnie finn said she hung her head and pulled her hand from behind her back revealing a large wooden pin part of the raft she did this amanda asked finn id say she charmed him thank you minnie amanda said minnie blushed and slowly a smile overtook her she looked devilish as she waved them onto the raft invitingly finn reached to catch amanda by the arm wait amanda turned the question that needs to be asked finn said rushing his words one eye on the wolf swimming for shore perhaps fifty yards away is why is a pirate guarding the raft to tom sawyer island hes a long way from home over in adventureland and whats so important about this raft minnie waved at them more franticallythe big bad wolf was climbing up the shore now shaking the water off overtakers amanda said we know the pirates belong theres no question about that so why guard the island the same island where stitch attacked maybeck and me it doesnt make sense this islands of no importance it isnt even that popular an attraction because the queen knew you might figure out the waterwheels importance she said finn nodded makes sense to me hes here to stop us or to catch us or both and the only problem with that is he wont be the only one bingo he said minnie was jumping up and down and pointing to the wolf who was now back on the path in the distance lumbering toward them his pink tongue swaying from his teeth so well need to be careful amanda said pluto jumped onto the raft as they climbed aboard minnie tossed the line to shore stepped behind the wheel and skippered the raft across the small waterway the wolf reached the loading dock but too late stretching toward the raft now just out of reach minnie behind the wheel reminded finn of mickey in a very old blackandwhite cartoon he couldnt remember the name of it might have been the first animated cartoon walt disney had ever drawn where is mickey i wonder he said to amanda i dont think she wants to hear it amanda said no but its troubling everything about this place is troubling she reached down and placed her faintly outlined dhi hand atop his and he felt it his own outline dulled somewhat by the sense of excitement and terror her reaching out to him represented i like you a lot finn same here you like you a lot too she said and they both laughed thank you for everything youre doing for me i got you into this in the first place he said guiltily im a big girl she said no complaints she rubbed the back of his hand with her fingers the raft bumped to shore pluto jumped off minnie hopped onto the dock and expertly secured the raft to it with a line she extended a hand and helped amanda off the raft finn jumped down we shouldnt be long he said eyeing the waterwheel that was only a matter of yards away minnie saluted we might need a quick escape so maybe you could wait for us here he proposed he didnt want to get minnie in any more trouble her big black eyes tracked across the water to the big bad wolf still lurching from the dock and looking to be considering the swim one thing at a time finn said minnie nodded finn amanda and pluto headed up the path turning toward the waterwheel at harpers mill this feels too easy finn said fearing a trap amanda squeezed his hand and he looked down to realize he was not pure dhi but he was not about to let go to fix it maybeck woke up in an office with gray carpeting three gray desks chairs on wheels and trash baskets lined with clear plastic bags he caught sight of a pair of running shoes with goldandsilver sparkles thrown into the covering like sequins and knew it could only be one person charlene he whispered dryly she crept around to him on hands and knees for once she was not wearing her nightgown but instead a black leotard top and black jeans and those cheerleader shoes where are we shed dressed and gone to sleep as philby had requested maybeck on the other hand had heard from philby its an electrical power plant on disney property were about ten miles from the parks philby tracked the ots dhis here were supposed to observe and report observe what she asked well know when we see it they came to their feet and approached the office door maybeck opened it a crack the facility emanated a constant lowlevel hum a rumbling that came up through the floor the two were looking down a bland corridor office doors on either side at the end of the corridor in both directions were lighted exit signs if youre wondering which way to go charlene said in a whisper check out the wear of the carpet id say right the hallway carpet was discolored and worn to the right it grew progressively lighter and lessused to their left good catch he said the thing is she said if something should go wrong we dont want to both get caught and to be honest id rather you try to rescue me than me try to rescue you so why dont you let me go first you keep watch but hang back i dont know about that why because youre a guy whos the more athletic whos the tougher he countered ill go to the end of the hall and stop to listen ill signal you charlene said since when are you the leader he asked have you got a better plan just be careful he said if its them if its the evil queen and cruella and who knows who else as dhiswell i get it charlene moved down the hall door by door pausing to listen giving him a thumbsup at each she displayed the grace of a gymnast raised on tiptoe almost dancing at last she reached the door beneath the exit sign maybeck followed the droning hum bothered him it was like a bad sound track to a scary movie it made it hard to hear anything harder still to think power plants were huge facilities how were they supposed to find a couple of holograms in a place this size and what would happen to them if they were found first more importantly a power plant ran so there had to be employees on the job he glanced back down the hall his toes and fingers tingling as he saw something bolted to the wall near the ceiling the lake buena vista cogeneration facility had security cameras he and charlene had likely already been spotted as intruders the fifteenfoot diameter wooden waterwheel spun lazily at the side of harpers mill when finn looked back across the water the wolf was gone it might have made him feel better but it did not it made him realize that none of the parks were magical for him anymorenot at night they were mysterious often dangerous and always surprising he kept his senses on full alert worried for amanda and grateful to have pluto by his side we need a splinter from the wheel finn said then we hope for some magic yes well have to break a piece off or something im not sure how well do that i dont love it here she said no i was just thinking how my opinion of the parks has changed no doubt she said pluto finn called winning the dogs attention defend pluto licked finns hand looking dogdumb patrol he tried the dog sat and offered moon eyes guard amanda said harshly pluto barked once sharply and went rigid good boy amanda said she ruffled his ears and pluto pawed at her pluto put his nose to the ground and headed off you charm all the boys he said shut up finn led her over to the moving waterwheel it was fed from the top by a waterspout water cascaded down its paddles turning it if i had a knife or razor blade or something how bout a rock amanda said bending down to pick one up he felt like a moron yes like a rock that might work he conceded he smashed the inside edge of the huge wheel but the wood was old and hard and pressuretreated against the water it was like hitting rock against rock she said it should be one of the spindles one of the spokes right yeah again she made him feel stupid the spokes were constantly moving i can climb on amanda said you know like johnny depp and orlando bloom in pirates im pretty sure that was special effects finn said i can do this amanda said judging the wheels rotation she jumped between the outside slats to inside the moving wheel and ran like a hamster adjusting her stride to match the wheels revolutions as she got the hang of it she turned to finn and said no problem its kind of like a treadmill every few steps she would have the speed wrong and start climbing with the moving wheel then have to adjust its not like i can stay on here forever she said say something run your hand on the slats finn said try to catch a splinter eww amanda said it feels like dog snot disgusting she yanked her hand away jogging to keep pace bad idea finn knew what had to be done just not how to do it he studied the moving mechanism trying to think how philby would see it i need you off of there he told amanda please jump off amanda timed her dismount but slipping between the moving slats was harder getting off than on stuck between slats she got carried up and around and finn pulled her off before she went around again the two tumbled to the ground the only way to do this finn said is to break it at the same moment philby was comparing himself to a sponge left too long under the kitchen faucet there came a point where the sponge could absorb no more water he was currently monitoring a dozen security webcams inside the magic kingdom the dhi bandwidth and was attempting to determine the direction of the unexpected data traffic to see if he could pinpoint where the evil queen and cruella were sleeping during their dhi activity it was too much his brain was ready to burst the closetsized bathroom was getting warm and the air stale the laptops battery was burning up his thighs if his parents caught him in here he and the keepers were doomed juggling all the open windows on his computer and computing hundredthsofasecond differences in transmission times on the log his finger stopped on a particular line of data he reviewed the times again his finger sliding down the transmission column using the router data he could trace the source of the original transmission to a location and the location to a google map it was like a juggler trying to handle seven items at once his finger crossed from the router data to the map and back again just to make sure oh no he said aloud quickly doublechecking his findings the cotter finn said its a pin that holds a wheels axle in place amanda was listening to him but with her back turned she was focused instead on the change in plutos stance and a crunching coming from the bushes i think somethings out there amanda whispered apparently so does pluto finn said equally softly if you have plans for the wheel i suggest you get to it she said finn hurried around the mill house and found the door the inside was small and dark the air stale and moldy smelling his hologram glowed slightly casting a pale light in front of him the wheel axle sat in a closed yoke resting atop a shoulderhigh post it did not connect to any kind of millstone it was all for show a curved band of steel wrapped over the spinning axle securing it in the yoke with a wooden pin bisecting the axle to keep it from slipping out finn could feel his fingers and toes knew his dhi was far from pure given the events of the past several minutes he used a section of pipe from the floor to pound the wooden cotter from the axle which began to creep slowly out of the yoke like a screw unscrewing he hurried back outside and rounding the corner of the mill house stopped dead in his tracks alligators three of them the biggest looked a lot like louis in princess and the frogbut a mean louis standing between the alligators and amanda was a very nervouslooking pluto low on his haunches growling finn amanda called out not taking her eyes off the beasts yeah i see them help yeah he said the waterwheels loose axle caused it to spin offcenter the wheel and its external post vibrated and shook it seemed like the whole mill house might come down finn sped up the process he raised the pipe high over his head and smashed it fullforce down onto the outside post and yoke the alligators slithered back away from the sound pluto crept forward expanding his protection of amanda finn struck the post again the wood split he struck yet again it broke the waterwheel rocked violently sidetoside causing the water to spray getaway finn hollered he grabbed amanda slowly he said with each step backward louis and the two other alligators ventured forward forcing pluto back as well pluto come finn commanded but the dog held his ground he barked once sharply with a thunderous explosion the waterwheel broke loose of the mill house it hit the ground spinning throwing water out in front of it as it rolled straight for the alligators the closest of the giant lizards lost a section of its tail as all three turned and fled into the woods the huge wheel smashed into some trees teetered and fell crashing down onto a section of stone wall along the path wood flying thats it finn said he reached for amanda and took hold of her arm snagging a large splintered piece from one of the struts amanda turned her head knowing what had to be done finn stabbed the tip of her index finger drawing blood oww she cried out immediately sucking on her bleeding finger nowww whawt she asked her words difficult to understand with a finger in her mouth finn considered this a moment i dont think well know until you return although they might know on the other endat mrs nashs he glanced around believing there was at least an hour to go before the manual return pluto moved to the bushes and was barking finn and amanda sat down on the stone wall out of breath so whered those alligators come from she asked he looked over at her gravely thats the question isnt it it was my question she said and the pirate that minnie took out and stitch back when maybeck and i were here last year i mean it just doesnt add up all that for tom sawyer island why amanda sucked her finger and shrugged thats what im saying if all this security was for cinderella castle or space mountain or splash mountain i think we would think that the ots were protecting something valuable to them i dont know what but this island off by itself hard to get to nothing here once you do get here isolated she said and with a fort on one end her eyes met finns relaying a fierce intensity you told me that you guys talked about the ots needing somewhere to sleep while theyre dhisthe way we all sleep in our beds what better place than someplace like this we have at least an hour to get back to the hub finn said we might as welltry we might want to speed it up she said pointing pluto had pulled back the alligators had returned this place is very big maybeck said to charlene they had made their way down the facilitys main floor passing more offices conference rooms and a coffee lounge theyd also passed a halfdozen security cameras the underlying roar of the place grew progressively louder you think security has spotted us by now she asked honestly im wondering why no ones come after us in a weird way i dont think thats the best sign the ots got them it might explain why no one has bothered with us thats depressing maybeck stopped at the end of the hall you do realize charlene said studying her dhis somewhat shaky blue outline that our best defense is being onehundredpercent hologram as if thats going to happen so youre scared too i dont get scared he claimed i getaware but im very aware at the moment yes he paused his hand on the door here we go he opened the door and waved her through they stepped out onto a steel catwalk that surrounded a central space three stories below two huge turbines whined from the turbines ran a tangle of pipes and wires the walls were decorated with signs warning of high voltage death on contact nice calming stuff just barely audible was a womans complaining voice the queen they both wondered maybeck raised his voice just loud enough to be heard check it out a blue uniform hung from the railing perched alongside of it was a blue jay frantically flapping its wings charlene looked first to the uniform then to the blue jay then back to the uniform maybeck said i think we know what happened to the security guards he indicated the blue jay id say someone spelled them the evil queen did that charlene said well it wasnt bambi whose side are they on she asked if someone did that to me i know whose side id be on but with a twisted sister like her who knows so what now she said we split up and we head down toward those voices if one of us is caught maybe the other can do something about it and we listen to whatevers being said he studied their surroundings im taking the stairs on this side he declared charlene took in the interconnected pipes the railing and the catwalks on each level i can climb down there she said fyi there are stairs on the other side might be easier and more obvious they could be watching them im going to climb it she declared whatever maybeck said just dont make me have to rescue you other way around she said not likely well see the blue jay cawed loudly startling them both the faint voices below paused with the cry of the bird maybeck whispered see you down there he tiptoed off toward an exit sign charlene stayed well clear of the blue jay and climbed over the metal rail one foot placed carefully after the other she possessed a climbers eye able to look up at a climbing wall and quickly plot and remember an exact route descending was altogether different it was much more difficult to climb down than up for her plotting a descending route was twice the challenge she hesitated a moment seeing a possible route play out in her minds eyeeach toehold hand and finger grip she would take one pipe to the next one clamp at a time she drew in a deep breath and made her first move philby heard elvis meowing on the other side of the bathroom door tssst he tried to discourage him using the family tonguebetweentheteeth sound meeeeowwww elvis wailed sounding like a police siren tssssssssst bang bang he was jolted back against the well of the toilet dell his mother busy he said you open this door this minute philby said be right out while looking for somewhere in this shoe box room to hide his gear open this door when his mother shouted like that he lacked resistance he obeyed turning the knob seen from his mothers perspective her son fully dressed was sitting on the closed toilet his computer open in his lap a phone also on resting on his thigh her face burning a new shade of crimson she said nothing she simply extended her hands expecting delivery of the goods mom i cant i dont want to hear it young man her hands now shaking with rage remained extended mom its nearly one oclock well discuss it in the morning he glanced at the time how had the time passed so quickly one am finn would be expecting the return mom please just listen ill listen in the morning she added maybe philby had never seen her in this particular state beforelike a teakettle boiling over wayne had said that a friend would turn his back and betray them he hadnt mentioned mothers he closed the laptop and handed it to her feeling like a traitor maybe that was it he thought maybe i am the traitor wayne warned us about guard finn hated to put pluto at risk but the dog seemed their best chance to get out of this with all their limbs intact higher ground amanda said its the best defensive position move slowly finn said they backed up taking small steps never taking their eyes off the alligators pluto saw them but held his ground good dog finn called out they slowly worked up the hill reaching a path amanda said did you know that alligators can run thirtyfive miles per hour tmi finn said if we turn and run amanda proposed theyll have us for breakfast finn said completing her sentence for her im thinking scratchs mine you cant be serious it will force them into single file theyll have to switch directions which slows them down if we hurry we get out the other end of the tunnel ahead of them at which point we head uphill which is not what theyll instinctively think by the time they figure it outif they figure it outwere gone what if we just made a run for it for minnie the raft yeah okay ill put you onto the raft that works finn said me what about you she said ithe thing is after everything weve figured outphilby me the others you and jess i need to check this place out he said the pirate stitch the alligators it just doesnt add up then im not going you should well im not i can do this alone he said keepers work in pairs she said technically she was not a keeper but it seemed like the wrong time to remind her he thought maybe that was her point she said what if i you know used mywhat if i pushed youre mostly dhi at the moment actually im barely dhi trust me i feel much more human than hologram what if once were inside the mine i could push the gators and we could run for minnie being inside the mine will concentrate the push i wouldnt need much for it to work we could tell minnie to leave without us the gators might be fooled and think wed left wed be trapped here he reminded so wed tell her to hang on the other side and wait for our signal it seemed like the best way to get the gators off their trail but a plan not without risk if minnie had to abandon the raft he said i guess if the push works we go for it if not well rethink on three no lets just keep backing up when they reach the path we make our move he said what about pluto she asked hes a dog hell figure it out the two backed up slowly the alligators slithered forward pluto retreated step by step they all moved in a choreographed manner ready finn whispered set she said the first alligatorlouisplaced his paw on the path finn and amanda turned and ran with her arms and legs wrapped around the pipe like a koala bear hugging a tree charlene slid down another three feet finally stopped by a junction clamp the temperature in the main building was warm as were some of the pipes she touched the turbines screamed in a highpitched whine halfdeaf she didnt hear the sound of flapping wings didnt sense the attack until it was upon her a shadow sweeping across her face charlene ducked and swung out with her left arm catching a birds wing it struck a pipe and fell feathers fluttering a second jay divebombed and sank its small talons into her scalp tearing loose two large clumps of hair charlene cried out her scalp was bleeding she sought a toehold but missed catching herself at the last second now a third jay wings tucked came at her like a missile she swung her arm like a baseball bat and sent it into the outfield the bird struck the wall and was knocked unconscious it tumbled and landed atop one of the turbines with a thunk the voices stopped only the whine of the turbines persisted the jay that had torn her hair out cawed and dove once more charlene deftly switched pipes dropped lower and switched back using the elbow in the bigger pipe to shield her a glowing image appeared on the floor below maybeck she wondered fearing it might not be she adjusted to the far side of the pipe putting an intersection of steel and pvc between her and the glow charlene was looking down on a head of dark hair surrounded by a crown the evil queen charlene reared back as the queen looked up a diving blue jay suddenly altered course and flew past charlenethe queen had redirected it it landed on an electrical conduit below the wounded jay atop the turbine managed to fly off the jays cawed furiously over the roar of the turbines a womans low voice shouted hurry up theres no time to waste charlene moved quickly lower down the pipes using clamps and valves as toeholds with speed and agility she descended desperate to overhear more of what was being said how she regretted having separated from maybeck they could be working together worse maybeck was something of a wild horse without a bit or bridle when left on his own she slid down the final few feet of pipe arriving onto the facility floorconcrete with a thick layer of gray epoxy paint she settled herself and dared to look past the pipe she hid behind directly in front of her were more pipes and machinery just past these was a walkway designated by wide lines of bright yellow paint one side of which was a concrete wall with windows looking in on a control room the door to which was propped open its center glass pane broken cubes of safety glass littered the floor inside she saw a bald guy in a chair who looked either asleep or dead there was a redheaded woman in a similar condition next to him cruella de vil the evil queen and akid charlene could only see the back of his headhe was hunched over a computerbut there was no mistaking him for anything but a teenager she couldnt see his face charlene was distracted by movement to her rightthe jays flying like jets in formation they banked right and disappeared behind the machinery something moved in the shadows escaping maybeck the evil queen sensed maybeck and abruptly turned around she and maybeck were on opposite sides of a cinder block wall charlene ducked behind the pipe her back to its warmth she had no way to warn maybeck no way to monitor what was happening then overhead a blue flashthe jays diving for maybeck again she heard a series of caws maybeck shouting then the evil queen growling bring him to me it took philby time to settle down hed never seen his mother quite like that shed stayed a few feet behind him and had marched him to his room like he was a convict hed wanted to ask her for the computer back but thought shed have probably hit him with itdefinitely not worth the risk his bedside clock read he couldnt leave his friends stuck in epcot and the cogeneration facility as dhis he needed web accessand he needed it now he possessed a dirty secret a fifth dhi had been added to the queens growing team hed spotted the addition in the logit was still rocking him with aftershocks mind racing he thought of his fathers desktop mac in his study the trouble was his study was an extra bedroom and to get to it philby would have to pass his parents bedroom he doubted his mother would actually kill him but he knew that to be caught was not an option philby paced his room frustrated and guiltridden he stopped and looked at the lowered shade and thought about hugo attacking him his world was upside down friends were enemies family members were enemies his only friends were asleep in their beds and would never wake up until and unless he returned them the success or failure of their attempt to free amanda fell onto him their survival fell onto him was he really supposed to just climb into bed and go to sleep as if he sneaked down the hall on tiptoe a shaft of yellow light playing from his parents bedroom his mother would be propped up in bed reading he knew how difficult it was for her to get back to sleep if he moved too quickly shed spot him the trick was to slip by incredibly slowly back to the wall so he could watch her if she moved even a tweak hed jump across and she wouldnt know if shed seen him or not step by step his back to the opposite wall of the hallway philby edged into and through the patch of yellow light he was right out where his mother could have seen him but she never raised her head at lastit seemed like several minuteshe was back into shadow and out of her sight he made it to the study door and turned the handle incredibly gently to avoid her hearing locked he didnt know the door could be locked he stared at it in disbelief not a chance she said he startled and nearly screamed didnt dare turn around but finally gathered the courage she was in her pajamas her reading glasses perched on the bridge of her nose that you would even try this is such a disappointment what are you thinking im thinking of my friends im thinking of that time i was caught in the syndrome and how awful it was on you and dad the hospital nothing working they are counting on me he was a grown boy he reminded himself fighting back the tears embarrassed by them do you know what that feels like i think i might have a slight idea do you have any idea what its like to be a mother to love another so so much that you cant breathe i cannot let them down i will not let them down i dont care what the consequences are it has nothing to do with disney nothing to do with magic or entertainment its about friendship mom its about being reliable and responsible and all the stuff you and dad preach but never let me live he watched her nostrils flare which was not a good sign most times that was the signal the time bomb was ticking but her eyes glassed over and her lips trembled and she moved toward him youre such a good boy she said her arms outstretched i am so proud of you youwhat she embraced him in a way hed never felt before more than a hug it felt like she might never let go youre so grownup mom im so sorry she said i was only thinking of myself it makes mei get so scared for you and the others i never want to lose you id never ever forgive myself but thats exactly yes she said i know i understand you do seriously i want to help i want to know everything everything you understand he nodded go on do whatever it is you need to do ill be along in a minute i want to turn off the light so we dont wake your father hows it going jeannie pucketts grating voice jess had nodded off while sitting with her back to the wall next to the bunk bed she blinked repeatedly while orienting herself she immediately realized the impact of the dream shed just been living she reached for her diary give me a few minutes she said her pen already at work she drew the picture in her head allowing it to flow out of her hand rather than force it onto the page it was almost as if the pen were alive and she was there only to keep it upright something miraculous transpired between her hand and the paper a power far beyond anything she would lay claim to lines appeared like a gate or maybe the teeth of a comb shadows behind the teeth of the comb were bookshelves or perhaps a bench the pen kept moving jess looked for what was there what was coming a boxno a windowin the center of the wall between the bookshelves or were the bookshelves church pews was the window really a frame hanging on the wall not bookshelves at all but a cot or a bunk a priest laying on the bunk no a woman a bench on the floor between the bunks they were bunks not a comb but prison bars her pen stopped the woman sat up from the bunk and stood and crossed the far corner of the jail cell standing in the corner jess tried to quickly sketch the woman in four posturessitting standing crossing the room standing in the far corner a woman in robes maleficent smirking but quickly losing it so that her emotions were unreadable the smirk lingered in jesss mind she tried to sketch it couldnt get it right something elsesomething bothering her something about the way maleficent had crossed the cell what was it look at that it was jeannie again it broke the moment the images on the diary page were static again fixed unmoving jess worked to finish what little she could envision she would have to get it to philby by emailand email was a risk in mrs nashs house like everything else that could possibly be fun jeannie rushed to amandas side look at that whats it mean jess collected herself and looked up amandas arms were still by her side but her hands had moved palms toward the foot of the bed they were jerking ever so slightly like a crossing guard signaling a stop on the corner she hasnt done anything like this right this is like totally new right so whats it mean jeannie asked jess shook her head i have no idea she said but in fact she had a pretty good idea shed seen amanda do that before shed even worked with amanda so she could learn how to control it standing twenty feet down in the mine palms outstretched amanda scooped the air as if cupping water and then threw her arms forward and pushed the water out in front of her as the alligators entered they lifted off the ground their feet paddling the air she pushed again and the already levitated alligators sailed out of the mine tunnel come boy she heard finn cry out pluto had been caught in the push as well hed traveled about ten feet and had fallen sprawled on all fours run finn cried the mine shaft angled sharply left the alligators had recovered quickly now only a few feet behind pluto who trailed amanda go go go finn shouted the tunnel straightened out but the floor tipped left off level amanda tripped finn stopped and turned to help her up snap an alligators jaw nearly caught his foot amanda spun and pushed the alligator lifted and flew like it had been caught by a hurricane it collided with the others three white bellies flashed in the dark rocketing away from the two kids with one final turn they reached the mouth of the mine shaft and popped outside you go uphill finn said hide up there ill meet you he turned and ran looking back seeing her hesitate he said up amanda turned around and started climbing up a rocky incline finn with pluto briefly by his side hurried along the path only a matter of yards from hucks landing pluto seeming to understand their role held back waiting for the alligators finn reached minnie and the raft already pushing her off as he explained head across to the other side and wait for our signal we need to trick the alligators minnie nodded and threw a lever forward the raft began to pull away finn ducked back up the path past potters mill looking down in time to see pluto flying through the air and just catching the raft with his front paws minnie lunged and pulled him on board the three alligators didnt hesitate for a second with the raft motoring away they slithered into the dark waters and were gone lost in swirling flashes of green scaly tails the boy in the chair of the power plant control room spun around and charlene nearly shrieked with what she saw this was no disney villain it was just a boy a regular teenage boy if you discounted the shimmering green outline that contained him by the look of him based on philbys description she already knew his name hugo montcliff the scope and ramifications of what she saw so overwhelmed her that she intentionally avoided thinking about it on the one hand this felt like the end of the world on the other maybeck had been captured and there was no time to contemplate what it all meant for the keepers hugo was in the control room throwing switches and spinning dials he barked out an order sounding like a grownup not yet sonny hold off a minute with a sweep of her hand the evil queen outside the control room transfigured the three blue jays into gorillas they stood well over five feet tall and were pure muscle and teeth they obeyed her commandbring him to mespringing into action and surrounding maybeck charlene searched for somethinganythingresembling a weapon a hose a steam valve there had to be some way to help maybeck hugo called out again the sound generated by the machinery altered pitch groaning lower charlene felt it in her teeth the holograms including her own sputtered and dimmed red lights flashed on the wall like those from a police car charlene moved closer now near enough to see through the queen almost like an xray in the queens translucent right hand she held the fobthe return the device appeared solid seemingly unaffected by the loss of electric power i said not yet the queen appeared ready to throw a spell at hugo if he wasnt already under the effect of one hugo made adjustments and the pitch in the room climbed higher the red lights stopped flashing the holograms and their outlines returned but by the time the dhis strengthened two things occurred first maybeck used the moment of his faded image to slip past the gorillas who no longer had hold of him second charlene stepped out from behind the pipe and picked up a shining stainless steel sheet part of a metal box connected to the turbines she held it behind her like a surprise gift and moved bravely toward the queen who turned in her direction at the last second maybeck vanished into the machinery the gorillas appeared dumbfounded to them it was like he was suddenly invisible just as the queen raised her hand to throw a spell while saying well what do we have here charlene pulled the stainless steel panel from behind her back and held it up like a mirror in front of the queens face ohmywhat a beautiful beautiful face that is the queen reached out to vainly take the mirror and as she did loosened her hold on the fob like a magician or pickpocket charlene swept the fob out of the queens hand replacing it with the edge of the mirror and pocketed the fob maybeck appeared from behind her grabbed her arm dragging her into the control room he closed and locked the door we cant allow them to kill the power he said i just realized what theyre trying to do just as finn caught up to amanda he lost her she shimmered sputtered and disappeared as quickly as shed vanished she reappeared that was so weird she said you just kind of broke up and disappeared you too he said holding his hands in front of his face they look okay now very strange she reached out and pulled him down hard behind a rock careful she said pointing another pirate this side of superstition bridge what was that about finn said what just happened the projectors amanda said i guess or maybe philby tried to return us but were too far from the hub so it didnt work might be never seen anything like it the pirates significant he said turning back to the issue at hand too many of these guys too much going on for it not to mean something i agree the fort he said she nodded you dont have to go with me i want to amanda said it could beits probably dangerous i know that she paused two is better than one isnt that a song shut up we dont know what well find it could be nothing he said you dont believe that no then dont say it aye aye said finn its just she sounded frustrated we both know this is it a fort how perfect is that a remote fort at that and on an island give me a break you guys should have figured this out a long time ago we were close we just didnt know it we didnt figure it out stitch she said remembering the story yes he considered this a moment the thing isi like stitch stitch is cute mischievous but cute i could never quite see him looking so mean and chasing me and maybeck like that but now im thinking spell im thinking the evil queen can make us do just about anything she wants cute or not look at whats happened to luowski and the others she feeds off peoples ambitions and desires makes sense to me amanda sneaked a peek around the rock how are we going to do this alligatorinfested water a pirate the size of the front door of mrs nashs house how are you and your arms doing he asked knowing that each push weakened and tired her its pretty lame when im a dhi not much push to the push but i can try there are rocks down there he said if he hit his head on the rocks it wouldnt bother me one bit better than into the water where hed make a lot of noise so we want to come at him from over there she said pointing to the right of the bridge we want you to finn said me maybe not so much they quickly worked out the details of their attack amanda waited as finn crept down the hill and came at the pirate from straightaway you there the pirate called out he snatched an ancient pistol from his belt guns finn thought wondering if it was from a gift shop or for real and having no great desire to find out you take another step the pirate said and youll eat lead palsywalsy only then did the pirates head swivel as he caught movement out of the corner of his eye before he ever saw amanda he was airborne the pirate crashed into an outcropping of rock and did not move for about ten seconds before amanda could ask is hedead the pirate was twitching and reaching for his head run finn said grabbing amandas hand and scurrying across the rickety superstition bridge philby entrenched at his computer accessed the server remotely and typed in his backdoor password waiting for the remote connection a printout of jesss latest sketch sat alongside his keyboard he didnt understand where it was but there was no mistaking who maleficent excitement welled within him his mothers cooperation stunned him secretly he still thought that at any moment she might come storming into his room shouting at him to shut down everything and go back to bed that shed suffered a moment of weakness and had come to her senses so he worked fast frustrated by a slow ethernet connection that was as unpredictable as the weather in the background he registered a sound an unmistakable sound from inside the house the slidingglass door opening the one to the florida rooma large screenedin porch at the back of the house why was his mother going out in the middle of night maybe she was sleepwalking maybe the entire conversation hed had with her had been with a woman sleeptalking he typed faster urging the connection to speed up elvis meowed from the living room there was one thing about elvis he only made that particular sound when he wanted to be picked up or petted when he made it for a second time philby actually looked out his bedroom door as if he could see through walls he could not because there was one thing about his mother she could not resist elvis she spoiled the cat like it was a rich uncle who might bequest his entire estate someday it was a family joke if elvis meowed twice mom wasnt home had she really fallen asleep so quickly shed seemed pretty worked up the screen changed and philby pulled his attention back to his computer he was in thankfully gorillas knew nothing about broken glass as the first of the three explored the broken hole through the control rooms glass door he cut his hand jumping back he stuck his hand in his gaping mouth and whimpered like a baby the injured gorilla then showed the other two his blood and all three stepped away from the door as if it possessed powers behind them the evil queen could not stop adoring herself in the stainless steel mirror she seemed oblivious to everything going on around her you might be wondering what a dame like me is doing in a place like this cruella de vil said to charlene and to tell you the truth i hardly know the way she laughed made charlene wonder if that hadnt been what had shattered the glass its because i know the way of the worldour world the modern world think about it queeny out there is from a world lit only by fire she can hardly be considered worldly like some of us eh girly youll never get away with this charlene said holding up the return fob one click of this button hugo spun around in his chair his hand on a lever i wouldnt be so sure if your friend there takes one more step toward me its lights out everyone if you push that button as the power fails theres no telling what will happen to usto all of us we might be gone forever is that true she asked maybeck who looked ready to pounce he looked over at her with a terrorridden perplexed expression his usual confidence sapped now now little girl dont be foolish cruella said hand that over to me this instant she flicked the ash off the burning cigarette at the end of her ebonyandivory holder aiming the ember at charlenes face you wouldnt want to see me when im mad maybeck scooped up an office chair holding it above his head threateningly whoever you are he said to hugo youre new at this let me tell you something about being a dhi the slightest bit of fear and youre partly human partly hologram its a glitch in the system thats never been worked out so if you think this chair is going to pass through you youre mistaken now let go of that switch charlene matched each advancing step cruella took backing away from her drop the chair hugo shouted his hand still on the switch do it or we all go poof and if goldilocks there pushes that button we might justevaporate maybecks eyes darted cruellas burning cigarette was closing in on charlenes face do it maybeck said he wanted her to push the return if i push the button i drop the fob and well lose it again charlene was thinking she banged into the counter behind her her hand felt a drawer handle she hooked a finger into the handle and pulled the drawer open slightly if she knew where to find the return they could come back to get it she held it in her hand over the open drawer cruella eyed the queen through the office windows clearly wanting her powers to throw spells but the queen was still struck by her own reflection hugo montcliffs hand remained on the oversized switch you hit me with that chair pal and youre going to be the one who throws this switch i suggest we all calm down said cruella this is what we call a stalemate as they crossed superstition bridge finn and amanda heard the voices from within fort langhorn they hurried to the left to avoid being seen i cant believe it finn said it sounds like a convention or something of overtakers you think i promise eager to get a look inside finn moved toward the forts open gate he sneaked a peek his heart beating painfully in his chest with what he saw the horned king from the black cauldron gaston prince john from robin hood hed seen all three in a single glance milling throughout the center courtyard were pirates and a dozen other characters finn had seen before but couldnt name he slipped back next to amanda breathing hard this is it he said winded by nerves their hideout what now if the queen and cruella are asleep theres a good chance theyre in there he said were going in there in the distance across the bridge the pirate was stirring hed be on his feet any minute hed sound the alarm the bridge was the only way off the island weve got serious problems finn said follow me he led her around the side of the fort so the waking pirate wouldnt spot them theyre all in there he told her you cant believe how many then he said somewhat desperately there are only five of us seven counting you and jess ariel told willa there are many many more that theyre waiting for a leader finn skidded to a stop what he gasped why didnt i hear about this she shrugged girl talk she said she knowswe all know how hung up you are on living up to waynes expectations thats not true isnt it said amanda who said im the leader you see she said thats what im talking about they continued along the fort wall sneaking past the door leading to pappys fishing pier and kept following the wall as it turned again dont be mad im not mad said finn youre stewing whats that thats what mrs nash calls it when you get so mad you wont talk she doesnt let us stew everything gets out in the open im not stewing he said if you say so then he stewed some more not knowing what to say they rounded the third corner are we just going to go around in a full circle or what she asked i remember coming here with my family years ago he said and maybe im mixing it up with the tunnels on the other island but im pretty sure theres a secret escape tunnel running from the fort thats what were looking for thats what im looking for yes and if we find it im going in there no way finn not you dont worry thats not what im talking about you cant go in there with a zillion overtakers inside he stopped they pressed their backs to the logs as he said listenlooki dont know exactly how to explain this but im not even sure youre going to wake up tonight okay im freaking out here these people these things are ruining everything and theyre only getting stronger wethe five of usthe keepersand you and jess and wayne and wandawe either stop them orthats just the thing i dont know what i dont know if any of us will be around or if well be lying in bed unable to wake up like you are right now im not playing hero here im afraid im afraid to go to sleep afraid to go to school i cant live like this im going to find those two and stop them obviously theyre only the tip of the iceberg he said the voices of overtakers rising over the wall but im not losing you im not running away she leaned across and kissed him and despite him being a dhi it felt to him as amazing as it had in front of mrs nashs when she pulled her lips off his he said see theres still magic in the parks is that it she asked pointing at first he thought she was disappointed in the kiss then he saw a rock wall coming out from below ground the escape tunnel he said greatly relieved philby found his loyalties tested he didnt want to leave the connection to the server but elvis was still out there meowing philby had definitely heard his mother open the sliding door to the florida room so what was going on what if it wasnt his mother what if hugo had returned blood overcame photons he sneaked out into the living room to check it out the room was dark as was the outside it was late neighbors houses were shuttered for the night in the greenish glow of some of the kitchen appliance displays he spotted elvis rubbing up against the open sliding glass door and meowing the fan in the florida room spun lazily a breeze blew outside clattering the palm fronds philby walked on his toes slinking forward hey pal a low voice not his mothers philby jumped and banged against the sliding doors metal doorjamb a kida giant of a kidhad his hand over philbys mothers mouth and her arm wrenched up behind her back her eyes were bulging pleading to her son through palpable terror you must be luowski philby said his voice eerily calm hed never truly hated before hed never had the urge to hurt someone like he had now the boys size meant nothing what hed heard about him meant nothing he was hurting his mother and that was all there was in the worldthe only thing that existed you will let her go right now philby said oh yeah or else i will rain down a world of hurt on you the likes of which youve never known luowski spit out laughter but philby sensed concern lingering down under the boys calm exterior i dont think so luowski said i think you will do exactly as i say or the world of hurt will be on your conscious pal and it wont be raining down on me believe me he goosed mrs philbys arm up more tightly and philby watched her strain under the pain its conscience nimrod youre out of your depthsbeyond your pay scale philby said as he edged closer you have stepped so far over the line that im not going to let you go back you can beg but i wont hear you tough you nerd boy think so youre going to show me your internet modem and were going to shut that puppy down then were going to give it he stole a glance at his wristwatch fifteen twenty minutes and ill be on my way hed told philby much more than hed meant to whatever was going down with the overtakers it was happening this very minute right now in fifteen minutes it would all be over got to pick on girls big guy philby said big mr greg luowski picks on a mother because hes too afraid of a kingdom keeper am not have they told you what we can do what were capable of im guessing not im guessing the queen either put you under a spell or made it sound like a really cool thing to take us on to join up with her but she left out a few details im willing to bet like the fact that i can walk through a door or a wall when im a dhi like i can walk into your home and find you or your mother and theres nothing you can do to stop me you might want to think about that before you continue down the road youre on greg you will never hear the end of this this will never go away luowski tried hard to look composed never ever you let her go right now or youll have five of us in your house and no evidence that anyone was ever there but you and your parents whatever happens will be put on you the thing is philby was freaking out his own mother but sometimes there was collateral damage he had to accept the fallout you and me luowski philby said leave her out of this or are you too chicken nice try youve seen what finn can do i know you have amanda too i hear how about me greg what can i do did you think about that before you came into my house because you should have luowski was sweating now either from the heat or from everything philby was saying his mother bent her knee and drove the ball of her heel up and into a spot between the boys legs that made luowskis eyes squint shut as he screamed she elbowed him in the chest and dove to the side as her son charged philby never thought about what he was doing he was all about adrenaline and instinctthis caveman urge to protect his mother he lowered his shoulder and hit luowski in the chest like a football tackle knocking the boy off his feet and into a rattan chair the chair spilled over they blew through the screen door shredding it and rolled out onto the patio luowski was more bear than human his strength returned and philby felt it like a machine had been switched on finn had described the supernatural strength of being thrown by luowski but only now as he felt his shoulders crushed by the boys grip did he fully get the picture luowski was an overtaker not just another big kid philby felt luowskis muscles contract he was going to throw him into the wall of the house he was going to crush every bone in his body he was going to kill him greg philbys mothers voice luowski was as programmed as any other kid when an adult called your name you looked a spray hit luowskis facebug spray philby realized by the smell the boygiant released philby and slapped his hands over his eyes crying like a wild animal ahhhhhhh he staggered around the lawn wiped some of it clean and took off running as mrs philby charged at him can outstretched ready to deliver another dose luowski was gone philbys mom stood there panting but a smile curled proudly at her lips we showed him she said what is going on philbys father what the heck happened to my florida room he was in a pair of tightywhities and a tshirt he lookeddisappointed dad it was philby said a gator his mother said interrupting but dell and i handled it didnt we sweetheart philby looked up at his mother maybe she was under a spell as well yeah we did go back to bed his mother told his father we can deal with this in the morning his father looking totally perplexed knew better than to tangle with his wife when she was holding a can of bug spray youre all right he asked the two no philbys mother said were better than just all right were good definitely some kind of spell finn blinked allowing his eyes to adjust some light filtered in from the mouth of the tunnel where amanda stood guard he was helped by the faint glow of his dhi but soon the entrance was well behind him and the depth of the tunnel began to choke out all light a glow came from behind him and he spun around ready to strike out its me amanda hissed what are you doing here we had a plan you had a plan i hadreservations isnt one of the rules that keepers never go alone there are exceptions like when the odds are a hundredtoone against us i explained if were separated it gives you a chance to come rescue me yeah like thats going to happen its called strategy its called stupid im much more help here with you than back looking at the stars and getting all freaked out by the wind in the bushes so youre afraid he said no no she said sarcastically im real used to this hey he said indicating the faintness of his blue outline im scared too in case you hadnt noticed i dont exactly love small spaceslike tunnels for instance but here we are here we are she said they crept forward deeper into the narrow tunnel water dripped down the walls a sharp edge of rock appeared just aheadthe tunnel divided but no finn realizedthe tunnel to the right was blocked by a wooden door now thats interesting finn whispered the wood is new she said really new yes not a bad place to lock yourself away for a little nap the door was locked he understood what had to be done im going in there he said i can go all clear long enough to get through the doori know i can he tried to psych himself up for it as it would require a complete brainwash to get his full dhi back that would leave you alone in there and by the way me alone out here yeah he said please dont his blue line grew stronger without his closing his eyes without concentrating its her he thought he was feeding off her concern for him at one oclock he said you need to be back at the hub please with or without me dont even go there she sized up the door i can push it open it would take everything left in you and it might turn out to be a broom closet no save your strength we may need it do not humor me she said im being confident im feeling confident his blue line was exceptionally strong his toes and fingers tingled he offered her a fleeting smile and he stepped through the door i will crush you like a bug maybeck said his arms still rocksolid as he held the chair aloft when i pull this switch there wont be any you so what then said hugo enough with the yakety yak cruella said just pull the switch get that thing from her and i will hugo said we cant risk them happening together do something cruella aimed the burning cigarette closer to charlenes face charlene glanced at the wall clock trying to stall for the remaining three minutes she couldnt help finn and amanda returnthat would have to still be up to philbybut the fob offered her and maybeck a way out the rising confidence in maybecks eyes suggested he might know what she was thinking click the minute hand moved forward two minutes to go finn was always on time for everything but he wasnt necessarily early tell them why theyre doing this terry charlene said oh yes by all means please said hugo maybecks eyes found the clock because maleficents prison cell is controlled electronically and this facility provides disney worlds backup power judging by the state of alarm on cruellas face hed hit a home run charlene tried to keep her own surprise from showing this was the first shed heard his theory so really charlene said where do you think the rest of us are right now pull the switch you little twit cruella shouted at hugo charlenes thumb warmed the plastic button on the fob rubbing back and forth so tempted to send them all back from where theyd come finn inched forward a tightness gripping his chest immediately his dhis blue outline dimming his eyes slowly adjusted to his own faint glow the cave walls sweated the air dank the space narrow and confined his head swooned he moved forward tentatively as the tunnel turned slightly and he gasped cruella de vil asleep on some furs atop an air mattress he leaned closer her eyeballs danced beneath her eyelids it lookedhorrific just beyond cruella the evil queen slept on her back hands folded across her belly her crown in place her lips and nose were twitching she seemed to be grinning slightly he had them for a moment the shock of the discovery proved too much he simply stared if he could tie them up gag the queen so she couldnt throw spells then wait for sunrise and the return of the characters to their various attractions then maybe just maybe the imagineers had two more prisoners two more generals shanyu would have said he had his two shoelaces a sash around the queens robe a plan formed in his head the way their eyes moved behind their lids was disturbing he couldnt stop himself from looking he checked a watch that hung from cruellas neck in one minute he would be returnedthat is if he and amanda were close enough to the hub he had no desire to test the system but he needed more time he began unlacing his shoes frantically they would never get another chance like this spinning in selfadmiration the evil queens greenoutlined dhi glued to her own reflection noticed three gorillas behind her gorillas in the distant realm of consciousness a flicker of reality spoiled her celebration of her unparalleled beauty returning her to the moment at hand she dropped the stainless steel sheet and it landed loudly charlene caught the changes to the queen through the control room windows there was maybeck his arms beginning to shake from holding the chair for so long cruella advancing the glowing end of her cigarette at charlenes perfect complexion hugo montcliff his hand on a master switch what are you three doing standing around she heard the queen complain i said get them the gorillas charged the door more afraid of the queen than some broken glass charlene was no jessbut she could see the future the gorillas were going for terry he would not have a chance maybeck heard the door break open and understood that he was the target he had never hurt another personnot like he was about to hurt this kid but he brought the chair down onto hugo holding the switch with a vengeance hugo montcliff saw the look in maybecks eyes and knew the fate that awaited him he was in fact going to be squished like a bug he pulled the switch charlene pushed the button the fob fell into the drawer the two facility workers taped into the chairs screamed through their gags in unison the kids and the two costumed freaks vanished like a magic act now you see them now you dont finn was just tying the queens hands together when she sat boltupright he screamed at the top of his lungs and fell back seeing finn so close the queen screamed as well the released terror echoing off the tunnels sheer stone walls cruellas eyes bugged open it took a moment for her to reorient herself in the uncomfortable moment that followed the only sound was the steady drip of condensation coming off the rock walls for finn their coming awake was like living a horror movie the queen began untying her hands with her teeth cruella rolled over on her furs finn saw the queens hands coming looseher ability to throw a spell was only seconds away he backed off looking down at his own hands with their faint blue outline in his current state he wasnt going to walk through the door any time soon well what do we have here the evil queen said knowing perfectly well what she had here she had finn cornered he banged his back into the door he willed himself to all clear but knew it was hopeless he was terrified of the queen what chance did he have whats happening to him cruella asked finn looked down at his handssputtering and translucent like nothing hed ever seen whered he go shouted cruella who turned out the lights the queen said finn stood still wondering why everything had gone pitchblack and why they couldnt see him it took him several long seconds to grasp the situation he was in dhi shadow his dhi no longer providing a glow in the tunnel invisible the projectors had apparently been turned off by who more importantly why his first guess was philby no no no cruella said its the power failure we did it we succeeded by tomorrow morning at seven oclock well be whole aga silence the queen erupted say nothing more hes still here you fool find him i cant see my own nose cruella complained and i have a big nose hold your arms out we should be able to feel him finn knew everything the queen had said was true he made himself small arms at his side and ducked down into a squat his ears intent upon hearing the sound of their shuffling feet as they moved toward him he was going to be caught the tunnel was too narrow to slip past them his best chance was surprise he charged cruella shrieked he felt her arms spin like a propeller he averted his face knowing the queen was next umph she said as he hit her and went down with her onto the air mattress she grabbed for him but he rolled and clawed the wall and moved off her he glued his back to the wet stone anticipating their next move this way the queen roared in their haste the two moved past him do you have him no do you finn hurried past the two air mattresses hands outstretched and found the wooden door he felt left right up downthere a deadbolt lock he turned it the door came open he heard footfalls racing in front of him is that you he called to the sound whats going on i cant see a thing came amandas terrified voice there were noises get to the bridge he said ill explain later get him he heard the queens voice echoing from behind him you cant catch what you cant see finn thought reaching the mouth of the escape tunnel finn and amanda rushed out into total darkness its a blackout he said realizing there wasnt a single light on in the entire park only the moon offered any chance to see or be seen as many times as hed been in the parks at night hed never seen it like this if theres no power how can we exist she called out they rounded the final corner of the fort from inside came shouts and cries the queen must have raised the alarm overtakers began pouring out of the fort behind them who knows he answered but here we are we can talk we can hear each other who cares weve got to get out of here they ran past the wobbly pirate theyd knocked down a few minutes earlier finn crashed into him and the guy went down again a stream of overtakers crowded the bridge miiinnnnnnieee finn shouted they both heard a motor start in the distance finn glanced back at the overtakers faster he called out whats happening mom philby said i dont have time to explain it all not exactly sure anyway shed gone from tyrannical keepers hater to poster mom sitting by her sons side and watching him manipulate a dozen windows on his computer screen simultaneously the server had never faltered but without warning the projection icon had turned red indicating a full parkwide failure of all projectors its some kind of power failure i think he said the projectors are out but the server is still up its probably on a battery backup of some kind but if thats right it wont last long five minutes ten at the outside ive got to get them back i thought you said they were back she said that was maybeck and charlene yeah they returned okay its finn and amanda the sick girl yeahwe hope not so can you help them im late and im kind of busy here ill shut up she said straining to sit back but then sticking her face alongside his shoulder philby executed a few lines of code and pushed enter the screen filled with data that then began to scroll automatically whats that his mother asked its okay he said fed up with her questions but trying to sound patient its begun a few minutes is all and well know finn and amandainvisiblejumped onto the raft joining pluto and minnie go finn said to minnie who startled and looked around trying to see him in the moonlight please take us back minnie threw a lever and the raft pulled away from the dock ahead of the overtakers arrival once to the other side an invisible finn kissed minnie on the cheek before he and amanda jumped off they ran hard pluto at their side keeping up with them effortlessly when pluto barked sharply three times finn looked behind them the wolf head to the ground moving like a tornado toward them weve got company he told amanda how can he possibly who knows smell maybe hes after pluto the hub and cinderella castle came into view and as they did all the lights in the park pulsed once and went dark again with them amandas dhi sparkled eerily translucent and then vanished again with the loss of power almost there finn said he caught up and reached for her trying to feel her he bumped her back with his fist reached down her arm and took her hand he tingled all over he knew that feeling knew it only too well finn awakened in his bed his clothes damp with sweat and the fetid smell of the tunnels his mother sat in a chair two feet away mom oh thank god are you okay finn took inventory of his condition im fine you crossed over duh yes he sat up sharply can i use your phone ive got to text philby she had her phone in her hand she passed it to him im bak others yes all amanda shes good finn released a huge sigh of pentup anxiety he explained things to his mom she raised her hand for a highfive and finn looked at her strangely she lowered her hand too much and then some he said so its over i wish he said i failed he agonized for a moment i had them who the queen cruella i had them his mothers phone rang thats philby for me he answered the call their conversation was intense they spoke in a kingdom keepers shorthand finn relating what had happened on the island and the discovery of the fort philby relayed what maybeck had told him about the activities at the power plant including hugo montcliff being a dhi that news was the hardest to take finn tried to swallow away his terror other kids as dhis where did that leave the keepers philby told finn about charlene winning back the fob and dropping it into a drawer in the control room despite some losses there were gains he realized finn told him something happened during the power failure when i was in projection shadow cruella said something about tomorrow morning that by seven it wouldnt matter the queen stopped her she didnt want me hearing it maybecks theory is that the power failure has to do with the prison break which makes sense but we have no way to know if its true or not explained philby dont we finn said im listening this is your stuff not mine but didnt you say that counting hugo that made five dhis for them yup they had yet to identify the remaining two but finn now had an idea have you checked the server log since the power failure the line crackled are you there finn asked thinking checkingstand by finn heard philbys fingers clacking on the keyboard through the phone philby mumbled i thought i was supposed to handle the techie stuff whatsup bandwidth bump howd you know that philby said stand by more clicking from his end youre not going to believe this philby said try me the prison finn nearly came out of his chair yes i think its in the animal kingdom theres something ive got to show you check your emailnow a moment later finn opened the email from philby recognizing jesss artwork immediately she drew that tonight philby told him over the phone finn studied the diary entry a gate a ladder on its side bunk beds something hanging on the wall or was that a window and if it was a window that small that high on a wallwhere would that be a basement only basements had weird tiny windows like that basements and prison cells finn felt physically sick to his stomach he leaned over his trash can thinking he was going to hurl his mother patted him on the back whats wrong dear it was like being blindfolded and spun around trying to hit the piñata only to have the piñata hit back at you smack you in the head a prison cell finn said i know how theyre going to do it finns mother waited at the curb the car running he knocked on the door rang the bell then knocked again wanda alcott answered fully dressed finn knew there was no way anyone could dress that fast much less an older ladyshe had to be at least thirty it meant shed been awake all night it was past four am doing what he wondered monitoring the situation perhaps i need to talk to him finn said if its about the power failure were looking into it she said we were there he said the cogeneration facility she looked stunned she nodded thoughtfully the supervisor mentioned children one was an ot two were us maybeck and charlene all dhis the returns there we need it back now were not safe until we have it back its in a drawer you have to get someone to get it for us i can do that i know you can thats why im here hes safe i appreciate your concern its not concern not for him the power failure was part of the jailbreak theyre going to bust them out yes im sure that was the intention the power failed there for nearly ten minutes but its all under control theour guests are where they belong no finn said theyre not do you have clearance can you get me into the prison she stared at him i need to see him i need clearance thats not going to happen she said no one sees him youll have to tell me im not telling you im sorry but i cant ill only tell him face to face no more video no more tricks thats impossible by seven this morning finn said theyll be gone and itll be on you think about that she did just that whats happened to you she said when we spoke earlier everything you said at epcot was true youve been a tremendous help an amazing help i need you to help me one more time when did you get so all grownup she asked its been a different sort of night i guess and im tired he said apologetically amanda is fine she returned with the spell broken he waited only a matter of seconds ill try on my own but they wont listen to me you dont even know where it is she said and if i do will that convince you her eyes went wide she opened her mouth to speak but nothing came out good finn said less than a minute later he marched back to the car and indicated for his mother to roll the passenger window down ill be with an adult he said shes waynes daughter i know remember oh yeah i know its late i dont expect you to understand but if your father finds out youll be looking for a new mother i only have one mother that may change she said although she glowed from his comment your father will be at the breakfast table promptly at seventhirty youd better be too buddy boy or i dont know what her eyes grew glassy im scared she said dont be for you not for me i know mom she rolled up the window looked at him once more through the glass and drove off wanda drove finn into the animal kingdom through the backstage vehicle security entrance where it took five minutes of phone calls to get finn approved i still cant believe you knew about this she said from behind the drivers wheel the dashboard clock read am finn felt wide awake philby has a different kind of magic he said ones and zeros hed never been to this particular part of animal kingdom a warehouse structure near the elephant cages it was originally designed as a medical quarantine for western lowland gorillas when a military coup denied our chance to obtain the animals the facility went unused for nearly a decade then the problem arose some modifications were made to transform it into a highsecurity retention facility wanda explained a prison it has continued to be listed as an animal housing facility youll forget you ever saw it saw what he asked thats the spirit she stood before a video camera and pushed a button she then had to swipe an id card and place her index finger on a biosensorthe same kind they used at the park entrances my father has been housed here since the fantasmic threat hes viewed as too importanthe knows too much so hes kind of a prisoner himself a light turned green and the door unlocked they entered the hallway was blocked by a double set of security doors with glass two inches thick they went through a security check as at an airport and then down a flight of stairs another hallway she pushed a doorbell and a moment later the doorjamb buzzed and she let them inside wayne was sitting on a small couch he looked older reminding finn of a lamp that had been repairedmuch the same but something different the twinkle in his eyes remained but his voice was dry and salty like that of a man who didnt speak much welcome he said he motioned finn into a chair facing him finn saw through an open door to a bedroom it was not an office but an apartment wayne lived here he seemed older and weaker finn felt a pang of sadness why finn asked the mans white eyebrows arched why here finn said the funny thing about the past wayne said is its behind us theres nothing we can do that will change it the future is much the sameout of reach when you get to be my age you realize you have only right now this moment you are over there i am here for how much longer neither of us knows lets not worry about me tell me what you want who said i want anything we all want something what do you want finn asked to hear what you want the old man answered finn sighed there was no arguing with wayne why had he tried im listening wayne said jess drew this place i think she didi need to see if its what she drew finn unfolded his computer printout of jesss diary drawing something is going to happen before morning it has been quite the eventful evening wayne said i would doubt much more will happen before morning they tried and they failed the blackout finn said yes ingenious we lost power like everyone else normallywell theres a system in place but my understanding is thats what they sabotaged quite brilliant actually but thankfully it failed you know this because wayne took hold of a television remote and worked the device a flatpanel screen came alive divided into four quadrants four jail cells two contained maleficent and chernabog two others were empty finn gasped maleficents cell was identical to jesss drawing he tapped the printout you have to take me there finn said have to please take me there moments later a guard led them through another series of electronic doors theyll admit us finn but by rule we wont be allowed out until the shift change at seven am you need to understand that before going in seven am finn said he told wayne about cruellas mention of the exact time its less than an hour even so we wont be leaving im good finn said they entered and were passed off to a burly guard with shoulders as wide as a doorway and a nose that looked like it had been flattened by something unnatural two gates later they were passed off to yet another guard and now finn recognized the jail cells from the video he and wayne stopped in front of maleficents cell the prisoner slept peacefully finn whispered to wayne please ask them to turn off the security cameras wayne said back protocol dictates twentyfourseven coverage theyre counting on that wayne viewed him curiously let me guess finn said during the power failure it was pitchdark down here im guessing a fire alarm during the blackout wayne looked impressed finn knew he had scored because that combinationpower failure and firewould mean the cells opened automatically for the prisoners safety most of this had come from philbys extensive research following finns proposal of a variation to maybecks theory there are measures in place wayne said not disagreeing thats about all im allowed to tell you suffice it to say not even a moth left this building at that time no finn said but if you dont turn off the cameras youre going to lose your prisoners thats an oxymoron wayne said the cameras show us the prisoners how much do you know about augmented reality im quite familiar with it we use it a great deal for interior projections disneyquest finn asked do i know about disneyquest of course wayne answered is downtown disney wired for dhi projection finn asked already knowing the answer philby had been knocked sideways by his earlier discovery its on the sheets its in planning i witnessed two dhis projected inside disneyquest outside as well wayne was about to tell him that was impossible ar technology security video cam projection i understand the technology as ive said wayne said continuing to whisper turn off the security cameras finn shouted into the cell maleficent didnt stir didnt twitch wayne looked back and forth between the sleeping fairy and finn he shuffled over to a white wall phone lifted the receiver and spoke the guard wouldnt take his eyes off finn punishing him for the intrusion and inconvenience wayne rejoined finn and pointed to the nearest security camera it had a red light atop it there were cameras for each cell and several more for the hallway finn didnt watch the camera but the prisoner there now wayne said as the red light went off maleficent remained visible in bed satisfied wayne asked lets go said the guard he reached out for finn who broke away give it a moment finn said were done here shift change is coming up wayne said please finn lets not make a scene philby said theres a thirtytofortysecond buffer to keep the dhi video smooth that hit home clearly wayne knew this as well he glanced at his watch an antique mickey mouse watch very well he said the guards impatience enveloped them both it had been a long night with all three men watching maleficent popped and vanished what the the guard hurried to unlock the cell no wayne reached out and stopped the man he turned to finn i think i owe you an apology without jess on our side finn said if id put her under that spell instead of amanda wed have never known somebody had better tell me whats going on the guard said angrily no ones left this wing wayne verified no sir not since shift change at ten pm before the blackout finn said yes sir the guard said to finn suddenly with deference and respect so wayne said he seemed to be waiting for an answer from finn the guard whispered are you telling me thatthing is loose somewhere in here not exactly finn said he asked them to repeat the camera procedure with chernabog five minutes later they determined that he too was nothing but a dhi hologram the guard sweating profusely despite the air conditioning reached for his radio wayne stopped him you dont want to do that he said theyll sound the alarm yes of course well take a rain check wayne said turning to finn so theyre asleep in here they have to be during the combination of blackout and fire alarm they escaped from their cells they couldnt leave the prison because of your precautions they had to get somewhere and get to sleep quickly i imagine theyve been awake for a day or more to ensure their fatigue once asleep once the power went back on their dhis took their places in their cells how brilliant of them wayne said they intend to walk out of here during the shift change finn said a wall device sounded finn recognized it as the same tone used between classes at school lockdown wayne shouted at the guard you told me not to radio the man said fumbling for his walkietalkie i didnt look at the time lock it down the guard hollered into his radio but the eyes of all three were on the wall clock wayne shouted frantically the guards must nap somewhere the guard shook his head his ear to the radio shift changes already under way tell me damn it man show me where they nap ill get them fired now the guard took off with sirens alarming down the hallway up the stairs they ran wayne moved like he was thirty years younger together they reached a plain gray door marked storage the guard tried his key but it wouldnt go in the locks been jimmied the keys not going to work he leaned his shoulder into it it can only be opened from the inside were cooked finn checked the clock the shift change had already begun too late finn wondered its me finn said i can do this im afraid so wayne said the guard looked totally confused the guard has a taser all you need to do is get the door open wayne said we hope finn said wayne nodded what exactly are you two talking about the guard asked finn closed his eyes took a deep breath and pictured the dark train tunnel he walked through the door he heard the guard say something finn would never repeat finns brief all clear passed nearly instantly he was through the door but too tired to hold his all clear he flipped on the light switch the storage room was a small lshaped cinder block mattresses were stacked along the far wall metal shelving held toilet paper paper towels and soap he saw brooms and buckets blankets and plastic bowls the guards had fashioned the space into an improvised bunk room to take unauthorized naps finn stripped back the blankets he jumped back as he discovered a barechested guard the mans hands and feet were taped his mouth gagged finn was able to open the door from the inside the guard outside hurried in finn said two guards two uniforms the shift change he ran down the corridor wayne surprisingly close on his heels the lockdown was in full effect they were blocked from leaving at the first station they encountered wayne shouted back and forth with a guard on the other side making demands that were not accepted wayne finn shouted pointing through the thick glass to a flatpanel display rotating between security views he pointed to the frame showing the facilitys final doorthe door to the outside to freedom check out that guards neck the collar green skin wayne muttered he sounded sad defeated maleficent in a guards uniform chernabog was too big finn said she must have transfigured him into a man hes the one at her side on the video the door shut and the two figures were gone attempts were made to stop the two radio calls shut down the parks security exits by road dog teams searched the park for scents prior to opening but perhaps because of the abundance of wildanimal odors failed at their task the park opening was delayed seventy minutes visitors standing at the gates waiting in the heat they were told a computer malfunction was to blame at last the park was opened and tens of thousands of guests streamed inside maleficent and chernabog were not seen again despite repeated efforts to trap the overtakers on tom sawyer island the fort went unused by them if it had once been a hideout as finn and amanda continued to claim it was no longer seven dhisthe keepers along with amanda and jesssat along the catwalk surrounding the water tower in disneys hollywood studios their dhis shimmered slightly against the night sky but even from several feet away they looked perfectly real the technology improved with every software upgrade what now charlene asked the mood was not good despite the keepers control of the fob and their preventing a takeover of the power plant the evil queen had engineered maleficent and chernabogs escape right under their noses we find them finn said and we find wherever theyve moved their hideout to we can help ariel said but we need a leader all eyes shot down the metal railing at finn we want to help finn said to her but i cant see the characters following one of us ariel laughed one of you oh no she covered her laugh im sorry i dont mean it to sound like that but we have a long and storied history she giggled selfamused our leader theres only one leader finn thought back to shanyus comments about emperors and leadership mickey he said ariels face sagged yes where is he willa asked minnie is so sad no one knows for sure he might be in hiding he might bewe just have no way of knowing theyve taken down his house you know minnies too updating they call it dont believe it its all because of the night none of the keepers had ever heard of a particular night or event as a group they looked at her curiously we heard noises from his house on that night ariel continued oblivious to their confusion a struggle of some kind hes not been seen since the family will listen to him our family what you call the characters he can bring us together we thoughtyou see we understoodwe believed you were sent here to find him for us us philby said but we never knew he was missing weve guarded the secret not even the whitehair knows she meant wayne but why hes too important he is the magic the green one knows she understands his power maleficent charlene muttered amanda squeezed finns hand unseen he squeezed hers back for a very long time no one spoke the crickets and night animals made a buzz that filled the air a breeze blew somewhere down there was frollo the green army there was much to learn finn thought what frosts me philby said is that three weeks later and still theres been no kind of discipline or investigation into luowski and hugo they stopped wearing the contacts amanda said theres no proof of any of it theyre building an army maybeck warned just as we thought wed be wise to do the same is this their general i wonder jess reached into her pocket and passed down the sketch of the uniformed officer it reached ariel and stopped she studied it looked up and studied it again what is it finn asked this is no general she said its captain peter who philby finn and maybeck said in near unison captain peter roseman the disney magic the cruise ship ive worked with captain peter before several times the cruise ship philby said they want to steal the magic willa said not the magicsmall m the magiccapital m finn stood up so quickly his dhi knees went through the chain banister thats the next keepers installment the cruise line we have that opening scheduled for what two weeks maybeck said a saturday grand opening is port canaveral the other keepers clambered to their feet only ariel was slow in getting up weve got to say goodbye for now finn said to the mermaid i hope youll come back and visit actually we may need you and your other friends charlene said well see if wayne can arrange some kind of character spectacular on the cruise finn said ariel nodded not knowing exactly what they were talking about sounds lovely finn thought of minnie and pluto he pulled the fob out of his pocket and held it before them everyone ready nods all around how strange that a thing so small possesses so much power finn said but it does philby said that thing is the key to it all finn nodded he held his hand over ariels and said will you hide this for us of course she said willa knows how to find me finn looked around at the faces of the kingdom keepers thinking were not done here and then he pushed the button acknowledgments the research for the kingdom keepers books continues to branch out and
