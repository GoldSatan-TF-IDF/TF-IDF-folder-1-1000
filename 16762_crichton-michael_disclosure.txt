intended to be late for work on monday juneisat in the morning he stepped into the shower at his home on bainbridge island he knew he had to shave dress and leave the house in ten minutes if he was to make the ferry and arrive at work by in time to go over the remaining points with stephanie kaplan before they went into the meeting with the lawyers from conleywhite he already had a full day at work and the fax he had just received from malaysia made it worse sanders was a division manager at digital communications technology in seattle events at work had been hectic for a week because digicom was being acquired by conleywhite a publishing conglomerate in new york the merger would allow conley to acquire technology important to publishing in the next century but this latest news from malaysia was not good and arthur had been right to send it to him at home he was going to have a problem explaining it to the conleywhite people because they just didnt tom where are you tom his wife susan was calling from the bedroom he ducked his head out of the spray im in the shower she said something in reply but he didnt hear it he stepped out reaching for a towel what i said can you feed the kids his wife was an attorney who worked four days a week at a downtown firm she took mondays off to spend more time with the kids but she was not good at managing the routine at home as a result there was often a crisis on monday mornings tom can you feed them for me i cant sue he called to her the clock on the sink said im already late he ran water in the basin to shave and lathered his face he was a handsome man with the easy manner of an athlete he touched the dark bruise on his side from the company touch football game on saturday mark lewyn had taken him down lewyn was fast but clumsy and sanders was getting too old for touch football he was still in good shape still within five pounds of his varsity weightbut as he ran his hand through his wet hair he saw streaks of gray it was time to admit his age he thought and switch to tennis susan came into the morn still in her bathrobe his wife always looked beautiful in the morning right out of bed she had the kind of fresh beauty that required no makeup are you sure you cant feed them she said oh nice bruise very butch she kissed him lightly and pushed a fresh mug of coffee onto the counter for him ive got to get matthew to the pediatrician by eightfifteen and neither one of them has eaten a thing and im not dressed cant you please feed them pretty please teasing she ruffled his hair and her bathrobe fell open she left it open and smiled ill owe you one sue i cant he kissed her forehead distractedly ive got a meeting i cant be late she sighed oh all right pouting she left sanders began shaving a moment later he heard his wife say okay kids lets go eliza put your shoes on this was followed by whining from eliza who was four and didnt like to wear shoes sanders had almost finished shaving when he heard eliza you put on those shoes and take your brother downstairs right now elizas reply was indistinct and then susan said eliza ann im talking to you then susan began slamming drawers in the hall linen closet both kids started to cry eliza who was upset by any display of tension came into the bathroom her face scrunched up tears in her eyes daddy she sobbed he put his hand down to hug her still shaving with his other hand shes old enough to help out susan called from the hallway mommy she wailed clutching sanderss leg eliza will you cut it out at this eliza cried more loudly susan stamped her foot in the hallway sanders hated to see his daughter cry okay sue ill feed them he turned off the water in the sink and scooped up his daughter come on lize he said wiping away her tears lets get you some breakfast he went out into the hallway susan looked relieved i just need ten minutes thats all she said consuela is late again i dont know whats the matter with her sanders didnt answer her his son matt who was nine months old sat in the middle of the hallway banging his rattle and crying sanders scooped him up in his other arm come on kids he said lets go eat when he picked up matt his towel slipped off and he clutched at it eliza giggled i see your penis dad she swung her foot kicking it we dont kick daddy there sanders said awkwardly he wrapped the towel around himself again and headed downstairs susan called after him dont forget matt needs vitamins in his cereal one dropperful and dont give him any more of the rice cereal he spits it out he likes wheat now she went into the bathroom slamming the door behind her his daughter looked at him with serious eyes is this going to be one of those days daddy yeah it looks like it he walked down the stairs thinking he would miss the ferry and that he would be late for the first meeting of the day not very late just a few minutes but it meant he wouldnt be able to go over things with stephanie before they started but perhaps he could call her from the ferry and then do i have a penis dad no lize why dad thats just the way it is honey boys have penises and girls have vaginas she said solemnly thats right why dad because he dropped his daughter on a chair at the kitchen table dragged the high chair from the corner and placed matt in it what do you want for breakfast lize rice krispies or chex chex matt began to bang on his high chair with his spoon sanders got the chex and a bowl out of the cupboard then the box of wheat cereal and a smaller bowl for matt eliza watched him as he opened the refrigerator to get the milk dad what i want mommy to be happy me too honey he mixed the wheat cereal for matt and put it in front of his son then he set elizas bowl on the table poured in the chex glanced at her enough yes he poured the milk for her no dadahis daughter howled bursting into tears i wanted to pour the milk sorry lize take it outtake the milk out she was shrieking completely hysterical im sorry lize but

it was he was assured just a phase parents were advised to treat it with firmness im sorry sanders said youll just have to eat it lize he sat down at the table beside matt to feed him matt stuck his hand in his cereal and smeared it across his eyes he too began to cry sanders got a dish towel to wipe matts face he noticed that the kitchen clock now said five to eight he thought that hed better call the office to warn them he would be late but hed have to quiet eliza first she was still on the floor kicking and screaming about the milk all right eliza take it easy take it easy he got a fresh bowl poured more cereal and gave her the carton of milk to pour herself here she crossed her arms and pouted i dont want it eliza you pour that milkthis minute his daughter scrambled up to her chair okay dad sanders sat down wiped matts face and began to feed his son the boy immediately stopped crying and swallowed the cereal in big gulps the poor kid was hungry eliza stood on her chair lifted the milk carton and splashed it all over the table uhoh never mind with one hand he wiped the table with the dish towel while with the other he continued to feed matt eliza pulled the cereal box right up to her bowl stared fixedly at the picture of goofy on the back and began to eat alongside her matt ate steadily for a moment it was calm in the kitchen sanders glanced over his shoulder almost eight oclock he should call the office susan came in wearing jeans and a beige sweater her face was relaxed im sorry i lost it she said thanks for taking over she kissed him on the cheek are you happy mom eliza said yes sweetie susan smiled at her daughter and turned back to tom ill take over now you dont want to be late isnt today the big day when they announce your promotion i hope so call me as soon as you hear i will sanders got up cinched the towel around his waist and headed upstairs to get dressed there was always traffic in town before the ferry he would have to hurry to make it he parked in his spot behind rickys shell station and strode quickly down the covered walkway to the ferry he stepped aboard moments before they pulled up the ramp feeling the throb of the engines beneath his feet he went through the doors onto the main deck hey tom he looked over his shoulder dave benedict was coming up behind him benedict was a lawyer with a firm that handled a lot of hightech companies missed the sevenfifty too huh benedict said yeah crazy morning tell me i wanted to be in the office an hour ago but now that schools out jenny doesnt know what to do with the kids until camp starts uhhuh madness at my house benedict said shaking his head there was a pause sanders sensed that he and benedict had had a similar morning but the two men did not discuss it further sanders often wondered why it was that women discussed the most intimate details of their marriages with their friends while men maintained a discreet silence with one another anyway benedict said hows susan shes fine shes great benedict grinned so why are you limping company touch football game on saturday got a little out of hand thats what you get for playing with children benedict said digicom was famous for its young employees hey sanders said i scored is that right damn right winning touchdown crossed the end zone in glory and then i got creamed at the maindeck cafeteria they stood in line for coffee actually i wouldve thought youd be in bright and early today benedict said isnt this the big day at digicom sanders got his coffee and stirred in sweetener hows that isnt the merger being announced today what merger sanders said blandly the merger was secret only a handful of digicom executives knew anything about it he gave benedict a blank stare come on benedict said i heard it was pretty much wrapped up and that bob garvin was announcing the restructuring today including a bunch of new promotions benedict sipped his coffee garvin is stepping down isnt he sanders shrugged well see of course benedict was imposing on him but susan did a lot of work with attorneys in benedicts firm sanders couldnt afford to be rude it was one of the new complexities of business relations at a time when everybody had a working spouse the two men went out on the deck and stood by the port rail watching the houses of bainbridge island slip away sanders nodded toward the house on wing point which for years had been warren magnusons summer house when he was senator i hear it just sold again sanders said oh yes who bought it some california asshole bainbridge slid to the stern they looked out at the gray water of the sound the coffee steamed in the morning sunlight so benedict said you think maybe garvin wont step down nobody knows sanders said bob built the company from nothing fifteen years ago when he started he was selling knockoff modems from korea back when nobody knew what a modem was now the companys got three buildings downtown and big facilities in california texas ireland and malaysia he builds fax modems the size of a dime he markets fax and email software hes gone into cdroms and hes developed proprietary algorithms that should make him a leading provider in education markets for the next century bobs come a long way from some guy hustling three hundred baud modems i dont know if he can give it up dont the terms of the merger require it sanders smiled if you know about a merger dave you should tell me he said because i havent heard anything the truth was that sanders didnt really know the terms of the impending merger his work involved the development of cdroms and electronic databases although these were areas vital to the future of the companythey were the main reason conleywhite was acquiring digicomthey were essentially technical areas and sanders was essentially a technical manager he was not informed about decisions at the highest levels for sanders there was some irony in this in earlier years when he was based in california he had been closely involved in management decisions but since coming to seattle eight years ago he had been more removed from the centers of power benedict sipped his coffee well i hear bobs definitely stepping down and hes going to promote a woman as chairman sanders said who told you that hes already got a woman as cfo doesnt he yes sure for a long time now stephanie kaplan was digicoms chief financial officer but it seemed unlikely she would ever run the company silent and intense kaplan was competent but disliked by many in the company garvin wasnt especially fond of her well benedict said the rumor ive heard is hes going to name a woman to take over within five years does the rumor mention a name benedict shook his head i thought youd know i mean its your company on the deck in the sunshine he took out his cellular phone and called in his assistant cindy wolfe answered mr sanderss office hi its me hi tom you on the ferry yes ill be in a little before nine okay ill tell them she paused and he had the sense that she was choosing her words carefully its pretty busy this morning mr garvin was just here looking for you sanders frowned looking for me yes another pause uh he seemed kind of surprised that you werent in did he say what he wanted no but hes going into a lot of offices on the floor one after another talking to people somethings up tom what nobodys telling me anything she said what about stephanie stephanie called and i told her you werent in yet anything else arthur kahn called from ki to ask if you got his fax i did ill call him anything else no thats about it tom thanks cindy he pushed theendbutton to terminate the call standing beside him benedict pointed to sanderss phone those things are amazing they just get smaller and smaller dont they you guys make that one sanders nodded id be lost without it especially these days who can remember all the numbers this is more than a telephone its my telephone book see look he began to demonstrate the features for benedict its got a memory for two hundred numbers you store them by the first three letters of the namesanders punched in kah to bring up the international number for arthur kahn in malaysia he pushed send and heard a long string of electronic beeps with the country code and area code it was thirteen beeps jesus benedict said where are you calling mars just about malaysia weve got a factory there digicoms malaysia operation was only a year old and it was manufacturing the companys new cdrom playersunits rather like an audio cd player but intended for computers it was widely agreed in the business that all information was soon going to be digital and much of it was going to be stored on these compact disks computer programs databases even books and magazineseverything was going to be on disk the reason it hadnt already happened was that cdroms were notoriously slow users were obliged to wait in front of blank screens while the drives whirred and clickedand computer users didnt like waiting in an industry where speeds reliably doubled every eighteen months cdroms had improved much less in the last five years digicoms speedstar technology addressed that problem with a new generation of drives codenamed twinkle for twinkle twinkle little speedstar twinkle drives were twice as fast as any in the world twinkle was packaged as a small standalone multimedia player with its own screen you could carry it in your hand and use it on a bus or a train it was going to be revolutionary but now the malaysia plant was having trouble manufacturing the new fast drives benedict sipped his coffee is it true youre the only division manager who isnt an engineer sanders smiled thats right im originally from marketing isnt that pretty unusual benedict said not really in marketing we used to spend a lot of time figuring out what the features of the new products were and most of us couldnt talk to the engineers i could i dont know why i dont have a technical background but i could talk to the guys i knew just enough so they couldnt bullshit me so pretty soon i was the one who talked to the engineers then eight years ago garvin asked me if id run a division for him and here i am the call rang through sanders glanced at his watch it was almost midnight in kuala lumpur he hoped arthur kahn would still be awake a moment later there was a click and a groggy voice said uh hello arthur its tom arthur kahn gave a gravelly cough oh tom good another cough you got my fax yes i got it then you know i dont understand whats going on kahn said and i spent all day on the line i had to with jafar gone mohammed jafar was the line foreman of the malaysia plant a very capable young man jafar is gone why there was a crackle of static he was cursed i didnt get that jafar was cursed by his cousin so he left what yeah if you can believe that he says his cousins sister in johore hired a sorcerer to cast a spell on him and he ran off to the orang ash witch doctors for a counterspell the aborigines run a hospital at kuala tingit in the jungle about three hours outside of kl its very famous a lot of politicians go out there when they get sick jafar went out there for a cure how long will that take beats me the other workers tell me itll probably be a week and whats wrong with the line arthur i dont know kahn said im not sure anythings wrong with the line but the units coming off are very slow when we pull units for ip checks we consistently get seek times above the hundredmillisecond specs we dont know why theyre slow and we dont know why theres a variation but the engineers here are guessing that theres a compatibility problem with the controller chip that positions the split optics and the cddriver software you think the controller chips are bad the controller chips were made in singapore and trucked across the border to the factory in malaysia dont know either theyre bad or theres a bug in the driver code what about the screen flicker kahn coughed i think its a design problem tom we just cant build it the hinge connectors that carry current to the screen are mounted inside the plastic housing theyre supposed to maintain electrical contact no matter how you move the screen but the current cuts in and out you move the hinge and the screen flashes on and off sanders frowned as he listened this is a pretty standard design arthur every damn laptop in the world has the same hinge design its been that way for the last ten years i know it kahn said but ours isnt working its making me crazy you better send me some units i already have dhl youll get them late today tomorrow at the latest okay sanders said he paused whats your best guess arthur about the run well at the moment we cant make our production quotas and were turning out a product thirty to fifty percent slower than specs not good news this isnt a hot cd player tom its only incrementally better than what toshiba and sony already have on the market theyre making theirs a lot cheaper so we have major problems we talking a week a month what a month if its not a redesign if its a redesign say four months if its a chip it could be a year sanders sighed great thats the situation it isnt working and we dont know why sanders said who else have you told nobody this ones all vours my friend thanks a lot kahn coughed you going to bury this until after the merger or what i dont know im not sure i can well ill be quiet at this end i can tell you that anybody asks me i dont have a clue because i dont okay thanks arthur ill talk to you later sanders hung up twinkle definitely presented a political problem for the impending merger with conleywhite sanders wasnt sure how to handle it but he would have to deal with it soon enough the ferry whistle blew and up ahead he saw the black pilings of colman dock and the skyscrapers of downtown seattle digicom was located in three different buildings around historic pioneer square in downtown seattle pioneer square was actually shaped like a triangle and had at its center a small park dominated by a wroughtiron pergola with antique clocks mounted above around pioneer square were lowrise redbrick buildings built in the early years of the century with sculpted facades and chiseled dates these buildings now housed trendy architects graphic design firms and a cluster of hightech companies that included aldus advance holo and digicom originally digicom had occupied the hazzard building on the south side of the square as the company grew it expanded into three floors of the adjacent western building and later to the gorham tower on james street but the executive offices were still on the top three floors of the hazzard building overlooking the square sanderss office was on the fourth floor though he expected later in the week to move up to the fifth he got to the fourth floor at nine in the morning and immediately sensed that something was wrong there was a buzz in the hallways an electric tension in the air staff people clustered at the laser printers and whispered at the coffee machines they turned away or stopped talking when he walked by he thought uhoh but as a division head he could hardly stop to ask an assistant what was happening sanders walked on swearing under his breath angry with himself that he had arrived late on this important day through the glass walls of the fourthfloor conference room he saw mark lewyn the thirtythreeyearold head of product design briefing some of the conleywhite people it made a striking scene lewyn young handsome and imperious wearing black jeans and a black armani tshirt pacing back and forth and talking animatedly to the bluesuited conleywhite staffers who sat rigidly before the product mockups on the table and took notes when lewyn saw sanders he waved and came over to the door of the conference room and stuck his head out hey guy lewyn said hi mark listen i have just one thing to say to you lewyn said interrupting fuck em fuck garvin fuck phil fuck the merger fuck em all this reorg sucks im with you on this one guy listen mark can you im in the middle of something here lewyn jerked his head toward the conley people in the room but i wanted you to know how i feel its not right what theyre doing well talk later okay chin up guy lewyn said keep your powder dry and he went back into the conference room the conleywhite people were all staring at sanders through the glass he turned away and walked quickly toward his office with a sense of deepening unease lewyn was notorious for his tendency to exaggerate but even so the its not right what theyre doing there didnt seem to be much doubt what that meant sanders wasnt going to get a promotion he broke into a light sweat and felt suddenly dizzy as he walked along the corridor he leaned against the wall for a moment he wiped his forehead with his hand and blinked his eyes rapidly he took a deep breath and shook his head to clear it no promotion christhe took another deep breath and walked on instead of the promotion he expected there was apparently going to be some kind of reorganization and apparently it was related to the merger the technical divisions had just gone through a major reorganization nine months earlier which had revised all the lines of authority upsetting the hell out of everybody in seattle staff people didnt know who to requisition for laserprinter paper or to degauss a monitor there had been months of uproar only in the last few weeks had the tech groups settled down into some semblance of good working routines now to reorganize again it didnt make any sense at all yet it was last years reorganization that placed sanders in line to assume leadership of the tech divisions now that reorganization had structured the advanced products group into four subdivisions product design programming data telecommunications and manufacturingall under the direction of a division general manager not yet appointed in recent months tom sanders had informally taken over as dgm largely because as head of manufacturing he was the person most concerned with coordinating the work of all the other divisions but now with still another reorganization who knew what might happen sanders might be broken back to simply managing digicoms production lines around the world or worse for weeks there had been persistent rumors that company headquarters in cupertino was going to take back all control of manufacturing from seattle turning it over to the individual product managers in california sanders hadnt paid any attention to those rumors because they didnt make a lot of sense the product managers had enough to do just pushing the products without also worrying about their manufacture but now he was obliged to consider the possibility that the rumors were true because if they were true sanders might be facing more than a demotion he might be out of a job christ out of a job he found himself thinking of some of the things dave benedict had said to him on the ferry earlier that morning benedict chased rumors and he had seemed to know a lot maybe even more than he had been saying is it true youre the only division manager who isnt an engineer and then pointedly isnt that pretty unusual christ he thought he began to sweat again he forced himself to take another deep breath he reached the end of the fourthfloor corridor and came to his office expecting to find stephanie kaplan the cfo waiting there for him kaplan could tell him what was going on but his office was empty he turned to his assistant cindy wolfe who was busy at the filing cabinets wheres stephanie shes not coming why not they canceled your ninethirty meeting because of all the personnel changes cindy said what changes sanders said whats going on theres been some kind of reorganization cindy said she avoided meeting his eyes and looked down at the call book on her desk they just scheduled a private lunch with all the division heads in the main conference room for twelvethirty today and phil blackburn is on his way down to talk to you he should be here any minute lets see what else dhl is delivering drives from kuala lumpur this afternoon gary bosak wants to meet with you at tenthirty she ran her finger down the call book don cherry called twice about the corridor and you just got a rush call from eddie in austin call him back eddie larson was the production supervisor in the austin plant which made cellular telephones cindy placed the call a moment later he heard the familiar voice with the texas twang hey there tommy boy hi eddie whats up little problem on the line you got a minute yes sure are congratulations on a new job in order i havent heard anything yet sanders said uhhuh but its going to happen i havent heard anything eddie is it true theyre going to shut down the austin plant sanders was so startled he burst out laughing what hey thats what theyre saying down here tommy boy conleywhite is going to buy the company and then shut us down hell sanders said nobodys buying anything and nobodys selling anything eddie the austin line is an industry standard and its very profitable he paused youd tell me if you knew wouldnt you tommy boy yes i would sanders said but its just a rumor eddie so forget it now whats the line problem diddly stuff the women on the production line are demanding that we clean out the pinups in the mens locker room they say its offensive to them you ask me i think its bull larson said because women never go into the mens locker room then how do they know about the pinups the night cleanup crews have women on em so now the women working the line want the pinups removed sanders sighed we dont need any complaints about being unresponsive on sex issues get the pinups out even if the women have pinups intheirlocker room just do it eddie you ask me its caving in to a lot of feminist bullshit there was a knock on the door sanders looked up and saw phil blackburn the company lawyer standing there eddie i have to go okay eddie said but im telling you eddie im sorry i have to go call me if anything changes sanders hung up the phone and blackburn came into the room sanderss first impression was that the lawyer was smiling too broadly behaving too cheerfully it was a bad sign philip blackburn the chief legal counsel for digicom was a slender man of forty six wearing a dark green hugo boss suit like sanders blackburn had been with digicom for over a decade which meant that he was one of the old guys one of those who had gotten in at the beginning when sanders first met him blackburn was a brash bearded young civil rights lawyer from berkeley but blackburn had long since abandoned protest for profits which he pursued with singleminded intensitywhile carefully emphasizing the new corporate issues of diversity and equal opportunity blackburns embrace of the latest fashions in clothing and correctness made pc phil a figure of fun in some quarters of the company as one executive put it phils finger is chapped from wetting it and holding it to the wind he was the first with birkenstocks thefirst with bellbottoms the first with sideburns off and the first with diversity many of the jokes focused on his mannerisms fussy preoccupied with appearances blackburn was always running his hands over himself touching his hair his face his suit seeming to caress himself to smooth out the wrinkles in his suit this combined with his unfortunate tendency to rub touch and pick his nose was the source of much humor but it was humor with an edge blackburn was mistrusted as a moralistic hatchet man blackburn could be charismatic in his speeches and in private could convey a convincing impression of intellectual honesty for short periods but within the company he was seen for what he was a gun for hire a man with no convictions of his own and hence the perfect person to be garvins executioner in earlier years sanders and blackburn had been close friends not only had they grown up with the company but their lives were intertwined personally as well when blackburn went through his bitter divorce in he lived for a while in sanderss bachelor apartment in sunnyvale a few years later blackburn had been best man at sanderss own wedding to a young seattle attorney susan handler but when blackburn remarried in sanders was not invited to the wedding for by then their relationship had become strained some in the company saw it as inevitable blackburn was a part of the inner power circle in cupertino to which sanders based in seattle no longer belonged in addition the two men had had sharp disputes about setting up the production lines in ireland and malaysia sanders felt that blackburn ignored the inevitable realities of production in foreign countries typical was blackburns demand that half the workers on the new line in kuala lumpur should be women and that they should be intermingled with the men the malay managers wanted the women segregated allowed to work only on certain parts of the line away from the men phil strenuously objected sanders kept telling him its a muslim country phil i dont give a damn phil said digicom stands for equality phil its their country theyre muslim so what its our factory their disagreements went on and on the malaysian government didnt want local chinese hired as supervisors although they were the bestqualified it was the policy of the malaysian government to train malays for supervisory jobs sanders disagreed with this blatantly discriminatory policy because he wanted the best supervisors he could get for the plant but phil an outspoken opponent of discrimination in america immediately acquiesced to the malay governments discriminatory policy saying that digicom should embrace a true multicultural perspective at the last minute sanders had had to fly to kuala lumpur and meet with the sultans of selangor and pahang to agree to their demands phil then announced that sanders had toadied up to the extremists it was just one of the many controversies that surrounded sanderss handling of the new malaysia factory now sanders and blackburn greeted each other with the wariness of former friends who had long since ceased to be anything but superficially cordial sanders shook blackburns hand as the company lawyer stepped into the office whats going on phil big day blackburn said slipping into the chair facing sanderss desk lot of surprises i dont know what youve heard ive heard garvin has made a decision about the restructuring yes he has several decisions there was a pause blackburn shifted in his chair and looked at his hands know that bob wanted to fill you in himself about all this he came by earlier this morning to talk to everyone in the division i wasnt here uhhuh we were all kind of surprised that you were late today sanders let that pass without comment he stared at blackburn waiting anyway tom blackburn said the bottom line is this as part of the overall merger bob has decided to go outside the advanced products group for leadership of the division so there it was finally out in the open sanders took a deep breath felt the bands of tightness in his chest his whole body was tense but he tried not to show it i know this is something of a shock blackburn said well sanders shrugged ive heard rumors even as he spoke his mind was racing ahead it was clear now that there would not be a promotion there would not be a raise he would not have a new opportunity to yes well blackburn said clearing his throat bob has decided that meredith johnson is going to head up the division sanders frowned meredithjohnson right shes in the cupertino office i think you know her yes i do but sanders shook his head it didnt make any sense merediths from sales her background is in sales originally yes but as you know merediths been in operations the last couple of years even so phil the apg is a technical division youre not technical youve done just fine but ive been involved in this for years when i was in marketing look the apg is basically programming teams and hardware fabrication lines how can she run it bob doesnt expect her to run it directly shell oversee the apg division managers who will report to her merediths official title will be vice president for advanced operations and planning under the new structure that will include the entire apg division the marketing division and the telcom division jesus sanders said sitting back in his chair thats pretty much everything blackburn nodded slowly sanders paused thinking it over it sounds he said finally like meredith johnsons going to be running this company i wouldnt go that far blackburn said she wont have direct control over sales or finance or distribution in this new scheme but i think there is no question bob has placed her in direct line for succession when he steps down as ceo sometime in the next two years blackburn shifted in his chair but thats the future for the present just a minute shell have four apg division managers reporting to her sanders said yes and who are those managers going to be has that been decided well phil coughed he ran his hands over his chest and plucked at the handkerchief in his breast pocket of course the actual decision to name the division managers will be merediths meaning i might not have a job oh hell tom blackburn said nothing of the sort bob wants everyone in the divisions to stay including you hed hate very much to lose you but its meredith johnsons decision whether i keep my job technically blackburn said spreading his hands it has to be but i think its pretty much pro forma sanders did not see it that way at all garvin could easily have named all the division managers at the same time he named meredith johnson to run the apg if garvin decided to turn the company over to some woman from sales that was certainly his choice but garvin could still make sure he kept his division heads in place the heads who had served him and the company so well jesus sanders said ive been with this company twelve years and i expect you will be with us many more blackburn said smoothly look its in everybodys interest to keep the teams in place because as said she cant run them directly uhhuh blackburn shot his cuffs and ran his hand through his hair listen tom i know youre disappointed that this appointment didnt come to you but lets not make too much of meredith appointing the division heads realistically speaking she isnt going to make any changes your situation is secure he paused you know the way meredith is tom i used to sanders said nodding hell i lived with her for a while but i havent seen her in years blackburn looked surprised you two havent kept contact not really no by the time meredith joined the company i was up here in seattle and she was based in cupertino i ran into her once on a trip down there said hello thats about it then you only know her from the old days blackburn said as if it all suddenly made sense from six or seven years ago its longer than that sanders said ive been in seattle eight years so it must be sanders thought back when i was going out with her she worked for novell in mountain view selling ethernet cards to small businesses for local area networks when was that although he remembered the relationship with meredith johnson vividly sanders was hazy about exactly when it had occurred he tried to recall some memorable eventa birthday a promotion an apartment movethat would mark the date finally he remembered watching election returns with her on television balloons rising up toward the ceiling people cheering she was drinking beer that had been early in their relationship jesus phil it must be almost ten years ago that long blackburn said when sanders first met meredith johnson she was one of the thousands of pretty saleswomen working in san joseyoung women in their twenties not long out of college who started out doing the product demos on the computer while a senior man stood beside her and did all the talking to the customer eventually a lot of those women learned enough to do the selling themselves at the time sanders first knew meredith she had acquired enough jargon to rattle on about token rings and obaset hubs she didnt really have any deep knowledge but she didnt need to she was goodlooking sexy and smart and she had a kind of uncanny selfpossession that carried her through awkward moments sanders had admired her back in those days but he never imagined that she had the ability to hold a major corporate position blackburn shrugged a lots happened in ten years tom he said meredith isnt just a sales exec she went back to school got an mba she worked at symantec then conrad and then she came to work with us the last couple of years shes been working very closely with garvin sort of his protege hes been pleased with her work on a number of assignments sanders shook his head and now shes my boss is that a problem for you no it just seems funny an old girlfriend as my boss the worm turns blackburn said he was smiling but sanders sensed he was watching him closely you seem a little uneasy about this tom it takes some getting used to is there a problem reporting to a woman not at all i worked for eileen when she was head of hri and we got along great its not that its just funny to think of meredith johnson as my boss shes an impressive and accomplished manager phil said he stood up smoothed his tie i think when youve had an opportunity to become reacquainted youll be very impressed give her a chance tom of course sanders said im sure everything will work out and keep your eye on the future after all you should be rich in a year or so does that mean were still spinning off the apg division oh yes absolutely it was a muchdiscussed part of the merger plan that after conleywhite bought digicom it would spin off the advanced products division and take it public as a separate company that would mean enormous profits for everyone in the division because everyone would have the chance to buy cheap options before the stock was publicly sold were working out the final details now blackburn said but i expect that division managers like yourself will start with twenty thousand shares vested and an initial option of fifty thousand shares at twentyfive cents a share with the right to purchase another fifty thousand shares each year for the next five years and the spinoff will go forward even with meredith running the divisions trust me the spinoff will happen within eighteen months its a formal part of the merger plan theres no chance that she may decide to change her mind none at all tom blackburn smiled ill tell you a little secret originally this spinoff was merediths idea blackburn left sanderss office and went down the hall to an empty office and called garvin he heard the familiar sharp bark garvin here i talked to tom sanders and id say he took it well he was disappointed of course i think hed already heard a rumor but he took it well garvin said and the new stricture how did he respond hes concerned blackburn said he expressed reservations why he doesnt feel she has the technical expertise to run the division garvin snorted technical expertise thats the last goddamn thing i care about technical expertise is not an issue here of course not but i think there was some uneasiness on the personal level you know they once had a relationship yes garvin said i know that have they talked he says not for several years bad blood there didnt seem to be then whats he concerned about i think hes just getting used to the idea hell come around i think so tell me if you hear otherwise garvin said and hung up alone in the office blackburn frowned the conversation with sanders left him vaguely uneasy it had seemed to go well enough and yet sanders he felt sure was not going to take this reorganization lying down sanders was popular in the seattle division and he could easily cause trouble sanders was too independent he was not a team player and the company needed team players now the more blackburn thought about it the more certain he was that sanders was going to be a problem tom sanders sat at his desk staring forward lost in thought he was trying to put together his memory of a pretty young saleswoman in silicon valley with this new image of a corporate officer running company divisions executing the complex groundwork required to take a division public but his thoughts kept being interrupted by random images from the past meredith smiling wearing one of his shirts naked beneath it an opened suitcase on the bed white stockings and white garter beltabowl of popcorn on the blue couch in the living room the television with the sound turned off and for some reason the image of a dower a purple iris in stained glass it was one of those hackneyed northern california hippie images sanders knew where it came from it was on the glass of the front door to the apartment where he had lived back in sunnyvale back in the days when he had known meredith he wasnt sure why he should keep thinking of it now and he tom he glanced up cindy was standing in the doorway looking concerned tom do you want coffee no thanks don cherry called again while you were with phil he wants you to come and look at the corridor they having problems i dont know he sounded excited you want to call him back not right now ill go down and see him in a minute she lingered at the door you want a bagel have you had breakfast im fine sure im fine cindy really she went away he turned to look at his monitor and saw that the icon for his email was blinking but he was thinking again about meredith johnson sanders had more or less lived with her for about six months it had been quite an intense relationship for a while and yet although he kept having isolated vivid images he realized that in general his memories from that time were surprisingly vague had he really lived with meredith for six months when exactly had they first met and when had they broken up sanders was surprised at how difficult it was for him to fix the chronology in his mind hoping for clarity he considered other aspects of his life what had been his position at digicom in those days was he still working in marketing or had he already moved to the technical divisions he wasnt sure now he would have to look it up in the files he thought about blackburn blackburn had left his wife and moved in with sanders around the time sanders was involved with meredith or was it afterward when things had gone bad maybe phil had moved into his apartment around the time he was breaking up with meredith sanders wasnt sure as he considered it he realized he wasnt sure about anything from that time these events had all happened a decade ago in another city at another period in his life and his memories were in disarray again he was surprised at how confused he was he pushed the intercom cindy ive got a question for you sure tom this is the third week of june what were you doing the third week of june ten years ago she didnt even hesitate thats easy graduating from college of course that would be true okay he said then how about june nine years ago nine years ago her voice sounded suddenly cautious less certain gee lets see june nine years ago june uh i think i was with my boyfriend in europe not your present boyfriend no this guy was a real jerk sanders said how long did that last we were there for a month i mean the relationship with him oh lets see we broke up oh it must have been uh december i think it was december or maybe january after the holidays why just trying to figure something out sanders said already he was relieved to hear the uncertain tone of her voice as she tried to piece together the past by the way how far back do we have office records correspondence and call books id have to check i know i have about three years and what about earlier earlier how much earlier ten years ago he said gee thatd be when you were in cupertino do they have that stuff in storage down there did they put it on fiche or was it just thrown out i dont know you want me to check not now he said and clicked off he didnt want her making any inquiries in cupertino now not right now sanders rubbed his eyes with his fingertips his thoughts drifting back over time again he saw the stainedglass flower it was oversize bright banal sanders had always been embarrassed by the banality of it in those days he had lived in one of the apartment complexes on merano drive twenty units clustered around a chilly little swimming pool everybody in the building worked for a hightech company nobody ever went in the pool and sanders wasnt around much those were the days when he flew with garvin to korea twice a month the days when they all flew coach they couldnt even afford business class and he remembered how he would come home exhausted from the long flight and the first thing he would see when he got to his apartment was that damned stainedglass flower on the door and meredith in those days was partial to white stockings a white garter belt little white flowers on the snaps with tom he looked up cindy was at the doorway she said if you want to see don cherry youd better go now because you have a tenthirty with gary bosak he felt as if she was treating him like an invalid cindy im fine i know just a reminder okay ill go now as he hurried down the stairs to the third floor he felt relieved atthe distraction cindy was right to get him out of the office and he was curious to see what cherrys team had done with the corridor the corridor was what everyone at digicom called vie the virtual information environment vie was the companion piece to twinkle the second major element in the emerging future of digital information as envisioned by digicom in the future information was going to be stored on disks or made available in large databases that users would dial into over telephone lines at the moment users saw information displayed on flat screenseither televisions or computer screens that had been the traditional way of handling information for the last thirty years but soon there would be new ways to present information the most radical and the most exciting was virtual environments users wore special glasses to see computergenerated threedimensional environments which allowed them to feel as though they were literally moving through another world dozens of hightech companies were racing to develop virtual environments it was exciting but very difficult technology at digicom vie was one of garvins pet projects he had thrown a lot of money at it he had had don cherrys programmers working on it around the clock for two years and so far it had been nothing but trouble the sign on the door said vie and underneath when reality is not enough sanders inserted his card in the slot and the door clicked open he passed through an anteroom hearing a halfdozen voices shouting from the main equipment room beyond even in the anteroom he noticed a distinctly nauseating odor in the air entering the main room he came upon a scene of utter chaos the windows were thrown wide there was the astringent smell of cleaning fluid most of the programmers were on the floor working with disassembled equipment the vie units lay scattered in pieces amid a tangle of multicolored cables even the black circular walker pads had been taken apart the rubber bearings being cleaned one by one still more wires descended from the ceiling to the laser scanners which were broken open their circuit boards exposed everyone seemed to be talking at once and in the center of the room looking like a teenage buddha in an electric blue tshirt that said reality sucks was don cherry the head of programming cherry was twentytwo years old widely acknowledged to be indispensable and famous for his impertinence when he saw sanders he shouted out out damned management out why sanders said i thought you wanted to see me too late you had your chance cherry said now its over for a moment sanders thought cherry was referring to the promotion he hadnt gotten but cherry was the most apolitical of the digicom division heads and he was grinning cheerfully as he walked toward sanders stepping over his prostrate programmers sorry tom youre too late were finetuning now finetuning it looks like ground zero here and whats that terrible smell i know cherry threw up his hands i ask the boys to wash every day but what can i say theyre programmers no better than dogs cindy said you called me several times i did cherry said we had the corridor up and running and i wanted you to see it but maybe its just as well you didnt sanders looked at the complex equipment scattered all around him you had it up that was then this is now now were finetuning cherry nodded to the programmers on the floor working on the walker pads we finally got the bug out of the main loop last night at midnight the refresh rate doubled the system really rips now so we have to adjust the walkers and the servos to update responsiveness its amechanicalproblem he said disdainfully but well take care of it anyway the programmers were always annoyed when they had to deal with mechanical problems living almost entirely in an abstract world of computer code they felt that physical machinery was beneath them sanders said what is the problem exactly well look cherry said heres our latest implementation the user wears this headset he said pointing to what looked like thick silver sunglasses and he gets on the walker pad here the walker pad was one of cherrys innovations the size of a small round trampoline its surface was composed of tightly packed rubber balls it functioned like a multidirectional treadmill walking on the balls users could move in any direction once hes on the walker cherry said the user dials into a database then the computer over there cherry pointed to a stack of boxes in the corner takes the information coming from the database and constructs a virtual environment which is projected inside the headset when the user walks on the pad the projection changes so you feel like youre walking down a corridor lined with drawers of data on all sides the user can stop anywhere open any file drawer with his hand and thumb through data completely realistic simulation how many users at the moment the system can handle five at one time and the corridor looks like what sanders said wireframe in the earlier versions the corridor was outlined in skeletal blackandwhite outlines fewer lines made it faster for the computer to draw wireframe cherry sniffed please we dumped that two weeks ago now we are talking d surfaces fully modeled in zbit color with antialias texture maps were rendering true curved surfacesno polygons looks completely real and whatre the laser scanners for i thought you did position by infrared the headsets had infrared sensors mounted above them so that the system could detect where the user was looking and adjust the projected image inside the headset to match the direction of looking we still do cherry said the scanners are for body representation body representation yeah now if youre walking down the corridor with somebody else you can turn and look at them and youll see them because the scanners are capturing a threedimensional texture map in real time they read body and expression and draw the virtual face of the virtual person standing beside you in the virtual room you cant see the persons eyes of course because theyre hidden by the headset theyre wearing but the system generates a face from the stored texture map pretty slick huh you mean you can see other users thats right see their faces see their expressions and thats not all if other users in the system arent wearing a headset you can still see them too the program identifies other users pulls their photo out of the personnel file and pastes it onto a virtual body image a little kludgey but not bad cherry waved his hand in the air and thats not all weve also built in virtual help virtual help sure users always need online help so weve made an angel to help you floats alongside you answers your questions cherry was grinning we thought of making it a blue fairy but we didnt want to offend anybody sanders stared thoughtfully at the room cherry was telling him about his successes but something else was happening here it was impossible to miss the tension the frantic energy of the people as they worked hey don one of the programmers shouted whats the zcount supposed to be over five cherry said i got it to fourthree fourthree sucks get it above five or youre fired he turned to sanders youve got to encourage the troops sanders looked at cherry all right he said finally now whats the real problem cherry shrugged nothing i told you finetuning don cherry sighed well when we jumped the refresh rate we trashed the builder module you see the room is being built in real time by the box with a faster refresh off the sensors we have to build objects much faster otherwise the room seems to lag behind you you feel like youre drunk you move your head and the room swooshes behind you catching up and and it makes the users throw up sanders sighed great we had to take the walker pads apart because teddy barfed all over everything great don whats the matter its no big deal it cleans up ile shook his head although i do wish teddy hadnt eaten huevos rancheros for breakfast that was unfortunate little bits of tortilla everywhere in the bearings you know we have a demo tomorrow for the cw people no problem well be ready don i cant have their top executives throwing up trust me cherry said well be ready theyre going to love it whatever problems this company has the corridor is not one of them thats a promise that cherry said is a guarantee sanders was back in his office by tentwenty and was seated at his desk when gary bosak came in bosak was a tall man in his twenties wearing jeans running shoes and a terminator tshirt he carried a large foldover leather briefcase the kind that trial attorneys used you look pale bosak said but everybody in the building is pale today its tense as hell around here you know that ive noticed yeah i bet okay to start sure cindy mr sanders is going to be unavailable for a few minutes bosak closed the office door and locked it whistling cheerfully he unplugged sanderss desk phone and the phone beside the couch in the corner from there he went to the window and closed the blinds there was a small television in the corner he turned it on he snapped the latches on his briefcase took out a small plastic box and flipped the switch on the side the box began to blink and emitted a low white noise hiss bosak set it in the middle of sanderss desk bosak never gave information until the white noise scrambler was in place since most of what he had to say implied illegal behavior i have good news for you bosak said your boy is clean he pulled out a manila file opened it up and started handing over pages peter john nealy twenty three digicom employee for sixteen months now working as a programmer in apg okay here we go his high school and college transcripts employment file from data general his last employer all in order now the recent stuff credit rating from trw phone bills from his apartment phone bills for his cellular line bank statement savings account last twos twelve months of credit card charges visa and master travel records email messages inside the company and off the internet parking tickets and this is the clincher ramada inn in sunnyvale last three visits his phone charges there the numbers he called last three car rentals with mileage rental car cellular phone the numbers called thats everything and i ran down the numbers he called heres the breakdown a lot of calls to seattle silicon but nealys seeing a girl there shes a secretary works in sales no conflict he also calls his brother a programmer at boeing does parallel processing stuff for wing design no conflict his other calls are to suppliers and code vendors and theyre all appropriate no calls after hours no calls to pay phones no overseas calls no suspicious pattern in the calls no unexplained bank transfers no sudden new purchases no reason to think hes looking for a move id say hes not talking to anybody you care about good sanders said he glanced down at the sheets of paper and paused gary some of this stuff is from our company some of these reports yeah so howd you get them bosak grinned hey you dont ask and i dont tell you howd you get the data general file bosak shook his head isnt this why you pay me yes it is but hey you wanted a check on an employee you got it your kids clean hes working only for you anything else you want to know about him no sanders shook his head great i got to get some sleep bosak collected all the files and placed them back in his folder by the way youre going to get a call from my parole officer uhhuh can i count on you sure gary i told him i was doing consulting for you on telecommunications security and so you are bosak switched off the blinking box put it in his briefcase and reconnected the telephones always a pleasure do i leave the bill with you or cindy ill take it see you gary hey anytime you need more you know where i am sanders glanced at the bill from ne professional services inc of bellevue washington the name was bosaks private joke the letters ne stood for necessary evil ordinarily hightech companies employed retired police officers and private investigators to do background checks but occasionally they used hackers like gary bosak who could gain access to electronic data banks to get information on suspect employees the advantage of using bosak was that he could work quickly often making a report in a matter of hours or overnight bosaks methods were of course illegal simply by hiring him sanders himself had broken a halfdozen laws but background checks on employees were accepted as standard practice in hightech firms where a single document or product development plan might be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to competitors and in the case of pete nealy a check was particularly crucial nealy was developing hot new compression algorithms to pack and unpack video images ontocdrom laser disks his work was vital to the new twinkle technology highspeed digital images coming off the disk were going to transform a sluggish technology and produce a revolution in education but if twinkles algorithms became available to a competitor then digicoms advantage would be greatly reduced and that meant the intercom buzzed tom cindy said its eleven oclock time for the apg meeting you want the agenda on your way down not today he said i think i know what well be talking about in the thirdfloor conference room the advanced products group was already meeting this was a weekly meeting in which the division heads discussed problems and brought everyone up to date it was a meeting that sanders ordinarily led around the table were don cherry the chief of programming mark lewyn the temperamental head of product design all in black armani and mary anne hunter the head of data telecommunications petite and intense hunter was dressed in a sweatshirt shorts and nike running tights she never ate lunch but ordinarily went on a fivemile run after each meeting lewyn was in the middle of one of his storming rages its insulting to everybody in the division i have no idea why she got this position i dont know what her qualifications could be for a job like this and lewyn broke off as sanders came into the room there was an awkward moment everyone was silent glancing at him then looking away i had a feeling sanders said smiling youd be talking about this the room remained silent come on he said as he slipped into a chair its not a funeral mark lewyn cleared his throat im sorry tom i think its an outrage mary anne hunter said everybody knows it should have been you lewyn said its a shock to all of us tom yeah cherry said grinning weve been trying like hell to get you sacked but we never really thought it would work i appreciate all this sanders said but its garvins company and he can do what he wants with it hes been right more often than not and im a big boy nobody ever promised me anything lewyn said youre really okay with this believe me im fine you talked with garvin i talked with phil lewyn shook his head that sanctimonious asshole listen cherry said did phil say anything about the spinoff yes sanders said the spinoff is still happening eighteen months after the merger theyll structure the ipo and take the division public there were little shrugs around the table sanders could see they were relieved going public meant a lot of money to all the people sitting in the room and what did phil say about ms johnson not much just that shes garvins choice to head up the technical side at that moment stephanie kaplan digicoms chief financial officer came into the room a tall woman with prematurely gray hair and a notably silent manner she was known as stephanie stealth or the stealth bomberthe latter a reference to her habit of quietly killing projects she did not consider profitable enough kaplan was based in cupertino but she generally sat in once a month on the seattle division meetings lately she had been up more often lewyn said mere trying to cheer up tom stephanie kaplan took a seat and gave sanders a sympathetic smile she didnt speak lewyn said did you know this meredith johnson appointment was coming no kaplan said it was a surprise to everybody and not everybodys happy about it then as if she had said too much she opened her briefcase and busied herself with her notes as usual she slid into the background the others quickly ignored her well cherry said i hear garvins got a real thing for her johnsons only been with the company four years and she hasnt been especially outstanding but garvin took her under his wing two years ago he began moving her up fast for some reason he just thinks meredith johnson is great lewyn said is garvin fucking her no he just likes her she must be fucking somebody wait a minute mary anne hunter said sitting up whats this if garvin brought in some guy from microsoft to run this division nobodyd say he must be fucking somebody cherry laughed itd depend on who he was im serious why is it when a woman gets a promotion she must be fucking somebody lewyn said look if they brought in ellen howard from microsoft we wouldnt be having this conversation because we all know ellens very competent we wouldnt like it but wed accept it but nobody evenknows meredith johnson i mean does anybody here know her actually sanders said i know her there was silence i used to go out with her cherry laughed so youre the one shes fucking sanders shook his head it was years ago hunter said whats she like yeah cherry said grinning lasciviously whats she like shut up don lighten up mary anne she worked for novell when i knew her sanders said she was about twentyfive smart and ambitious smart and ambitious lewyn said thats fine the worlds full of smart and ambitious the question is can she run a technical division or have we got another screamer freeling on our hands two years earlier garvin had put a sales manager named howard freeling in charge of the division the idea was to bring product development in contact with customers at an earlier point to develop new products more in line with the emerging market freeling instituted focus groups and they all spent a lot of time watching potential customers play with new products behind oneway glass but freeling was completely unfamiliar with technical issues so when confronted with a problem he screamed he was like a tourist in a foreign country who didnt speak the language and thought he could make the locals understand by shouting at them freelings tenure at apg was a disaster the programmers loathed him the designers rebelled at his idea for neoncolored product boxes the manufacturing glitches at factories in ireland and texas didnt get solved finally when the production line in cork went down for eleven days freeling flew over and screamed the irish managers all quit and garvin fired him so is that what we have another screamer stephanie kaplan cleared her throat i think garvin learned his lesson ile wouldnt make the same mistake twice so you think meredith johnson is up to the job i couldnt say kaplan replied speaking very deliberately not much of an endorsement lewyn said but i think shell be better than freeling kaplan said lewyn snorted this is the taller than mickey rooney award n ou can still be very short and win no kaplan said i think shell be better cherry said betterlooking at least from what i hear sexist mary anne hunter said what i cant say shes goodlooking were talking about her competence not her appearance wait a minute cherry said coming over here to this meeting i pass the women at the espresso bar and what are they talking about whether richard gere has better buns than mel gibson theyre talking about the crack in the ass lift and separate all that stuff i dont see why they can talk about were drifting afield sanders said it doesnt matter what you guys say hunter said the fact is this company is dominated by males there are almost no women except stephanie in high executive positions i think its great that bob has appointed a woman to run this division and i for one think we should support her she looked at sanders we all love you tom but you know what i mean yeah we all love you cherry said at least we did until we got our cute new boss lewyn said ill support johnsonif shes any good no you wont hunter said youll sabotage her youll find a reason to get rid of her wait a minute no what is this conversation really about its about the fact that youre all pissed off because now you have to report to a woman mary anne i mean it lewyn said i think toms pissed off because he didnt get the job im not pissed off sanders said well im pissed off cherry said because meredith used to be toms girlfriend so now he has a special in with the new boss maybe sanders frowned lewyn said on the other hand maybe she hates you all my old girlfriends hate me with good reason i hear cherry said laughing sanders said lets get back to the agenda shall we what agenda twinkle there were groans around the table not again goddamn twinkle how bad is it cherry said they still cant get the seek times down and they cant solve the hinge problems the lines running at twentynine percent lewyn said they better send us some units we should have them today okay table it till then its okay with me sanders looked around the table anybody else have a problem mary anne no were fine we still expect prototype cardphones off our test line within two months the new generation of cellular telephones were not much larger than a credit card they folded open for use hows the weight the weights now four ounces which is not great but okay the problem is power the batteries only run minutes in talk mode and the keypad sticks when you dial but thats marks headache were on schedule with the line good he turned to don cherry and hows the corridor cherry sat back in his chair beaming he crossed his hands over his belly i am pleased to report he said that as of half an hour ago the corridor is fanfuckingtastic really thats great news nobodys throwing up please ancient history mark lewyn said wait a minute somebody threw up a vile rumor that was then this is now we got the last delay bug out half an hour ago and all functions are now fully implemented we can take any database and convert it into a d zbit color environment that you can navigate in real time you can walk through any database in the world and its stable its a rock youve tried it with naive users bulletproof so youre ready to demo for conley well blow em away cherry said they wont fucking believe their eyes coming out of the conference room sanders ran into a group of conleywhite executives being taken on a tour by bob garvin robert t garvin looked the way every ceo wanted to look in the pages offortunemagazine he was fiftynine years old and handsome with a craggy face and saltandpepper hair that always looked windblown as if hed just come in from a flyfishing trip in montana or a weekend sailing in the san juans in the old days like everyone else he had worn jeans and denim work shirts in the office but in recent years he favored dark blue caracem suits it was one of the many changes that people in the company had noticed since the death of his daughter three years before brusque and profane in private garvin was all charm in public leading the conleywhite executives he said here on the third floor you have our tech divisions and advanced product laboratories oh tom good he threw his arm around sanders meet tom sanders our division manager for advanced products one of the brilliant young men whos made our company what it is tom say hello to ed nichols the cfo for conleywhite a thin hawkfaced man in his late fifties nichols carried his head tilted back so that he seemed to be pulling away from everything as if there were a bad smell he looked down his nose through halfframe glasses at sanders regarding him with a vaguely disapproving air and shook hands formally mr sanders how do you do mr nichols and john conley nephew of the founder and vice president of the firm sanders turned to a stocky athletic man in his late twenties wireframe spectacles armani suit firm handshake serious expression sanders had the impression of a wealthy and very determined man hi there tom hi john and jim daly from goldman sachs a balding thin storklike man in a pinstripe suit daly seemed distracted befuddled and shook hands with a brief nod and of course meredith johnson from cupertino she was more beautiful than he had remembered and different in some subtle way older of course crowsfeet at the corners of her eyes and faint creases in her forehead but she stood straighter now and she had a vibrancy a confidence that he associated with power dark blue suit blond hair large eyes those incredibly long eyelashes he had forgotten hello tom nice to see you again a warm smile her perfume meredith nice to see you she released his hand and the group swept on as garvin led them down the hall now just ahead is the vie unit youll be seeing that work tomorrow mark lewyn came out of the conference room and said you met the rogues gallery i guess so lewyn watched them go hard to believe those guys are going to be running this company he said i did a briefing this morning and let me tell you they dont knowanythingits scary as the group reached the end of the hallway meredith johnson looked back over her shoulder at sanders she mouthed ill call you and she smiled radiantly then she was gone lewyn sighed id say he said that you have an in with top management there tom maybe so i just wish i knew why garvin thinks shes so great sanders said well she certainly looks great lewyn turned away well see he said well see a twenty past twelve sanders left his office on the fourth floor and headed toward the stairs to go down to the main conference room for lunch he passed a nurse in a starched white uniform she was looking in one office after another where is he he was just here a minute ago she shook her head who sanders said the professor she replied blowing a strand of hair out of her eyes i cant leave him alone for a minute what professor sanders said but by then he heard the female giggles coming from a room farther down the hall and he already knew the answer professor dorfman yes professor dorfman the nurse said nodding grimly and she headed toward the source of the giggles sanders trailed after her max dorfman was a german management consultant now very elderly at one time or another he had been a visiting professor at every major business school in america and he had gained a particular reputation as a guru to hightech companies during most of the s he had served on the board of directors of digicom lending prestige to garvins upstart company and during that time he had been a mentor to sanders in fact it was dorfman who had convinced sanders to leave cupertino eight years earlier and take the job in seattle sanders said i didnt know he was still alive very much so the nurse said he must be ninety well he doesnt act a day over eightyfive as they approached the room he saw mary anne hunter coming out she had changed into a skirt and blouse and she was smiling broadly as if she had just left her lover tom youll never guess whos here max he said thats right oh tom you should see him hes exactly the same ill bet he is sanders said even from outside the room he could smell the cigarette smoke the nurse said now professor in a severe tone and strode into the room sanders looked in it was one of the employee lounges max dorfmans wheelchair was pulled up to the table in the center of the room he was surrounded by pretty assistants the women were making a fuss over him and in their midst dorfman with his shock of white hair was grinning happily smoking a cigarette in a long holder whats he doing here sanders said garvin brought him in to consult on the merger arent you going to say hello hunter said oh christ sanders said you know max he can drive you crazy dorfman liked to challenge conventional wisdom but his method was indirect he had an ironic way of speaking that was provocative and mocking at the same moment he was fond of contradictions and he did not hesitate to lie if you caught him in a lie he would immediately say yes thats true i dont know what i was thinking of and then resume talking in the same maddening elliptical way he never really said what he meant he left it for you to put it together his rambling sessions left executives confused and exhausted but you were such friends hunter said looking at him im sure hed like you to say hello hes busy now maybe later sanders looked at his watch anyway were going to be late for lunch he started back down the hallway hunter fell into step with him frowning he always got under your skin didnt he he got under everybodys skin it was what he did best she looked at him in a puzzled way and seemed about to say more then shrugged its okay with me im just not in the mood for one of those conversations sanders said maybe later but not right now they headed down the stairs to the ground floor in keeping with the strippeddown functionality of modern hightech firms digicom maintained no corporate dining room instead lunches and dinners were held at local restaurants most often at the nearby terrazzo but the need for secrecy about the merger obliged digicom to cater a lunch in the large woodpaneled conference room on the ground floor at twelvethirty with the principal managers of the digicom technical divisions the conleywhite executives and the goldman sachs bankers all present the room was crowded the egalitarian ethos of the company meant that there was no assigned seating but the principal cw executives ended up at one side of the table near the front of the room clustered around garvin the power end of the table sanders took a seat farther down on the opposite side and was surprised when stephanie kaplan slid into the chair to his right kaplan usually sat much closer to garvin sanders was distinctly further down the pecking order to sanderss left was bill everts the head of human resourcesa nice slightly dull guy as whitecoated waiters served the meal sanders talked about fishing on orcas island which was evertss passion as usual kaplan was quiet during most of the lunch seeming to withdraw into herself sanders began to feel he was neglecting her toward the end of the meal he turned to her and said i notice youve been up here in seattle more often the last few months stephanie is that because of the merger no she smiled my sons a freshman at the university so i like to come up because i get to see him whats he studying chemistry he wants to go into materials chemistry apparently its going to be a big field ive heard that half the time i dont know what hes talking about its funny when your child knows more than you do he nodded trying to think of something else to ask her it wasnt easy although he had sat in meetings with kaplan for years he knew little about her personally she was married to a professor at san jose state a jovial chubby man with a mustache who taught economics when they were together he did all the talking while stephanie stood silently by she was a tall bony awkward woman who seemed resigned to her lack of social graces she was said to be a very good golferat least good enough that garvin wouldnt play her anymore no one who knew her was surprised that she had made the error of beating garvin too often wags said that she wasnt enough of a loser to be promoted garvin didnt really like her but he would never think of letting her go colorless humorless and tireless her dedication to the company was legendary she worked late every night and came in most weekends when she had had a bout of cancer a few years back she refused to take even a single day off apparently she was cured of the cancer at least sanders hadnt heard anything more about it but the episode seemed to have increased kaplans relentless focus on her impersonal domain figures and spreadsheets and heightened her natural inclination to work behind the scenes more than one manager had come to work in the morning only to find a pet project killed by the stealth bomber with no lingering trace of how or why it had happened thus her tendency to remain aloof in social situations was more than a reflection of her own discomfort it was also a reminder of the power she wielded within the company and how she wielded it in her own way she was mysteriousand potentially dangerous while he was trying to think of something to say kaplan leaned toward him confidentially and lowered her voice in the meeting this morning tom i didnt really feel i could say anything but i hope youre okay about this new reorganization sanders concealed his surprise in twelve years kaplan had never said anything so directly personal to him he wondered why she would do so now he was instantly wary unsure of how to respond well it was a shock he said she looked at him with a steady gaze it was a shock to many of usshe said quietly there was an uproar in cupertinoa lot of people questioned garvins judgment sanders frowned kaplan never said anything even obliquely critical of garvin never but now this was she testing him he said nothing and poked at his food i can imagine youre uneasy about the new appointment only because it was so unexpected it seemed to come out of the blue kaplan looked at him oddly for a moment as if he had disappointed her then she nodded its always that way with mergers she said her tone was more open less confidential i was at compusoft when it merged with symantec and it was exactly the same lastminute announcements switches in the organization charts jobs promised jobs lost everybody up in the air for weeks its not easy to bring two organizations togetherespecially these two there are big differences in corporate cultures garvin has to make them comfortable she gestured toward the end of the table where garvin was sitting just look at them she said all the conley people are wearing suits nobody in our company wears suits except lawyers theyre east coast sanders said but it goes deeper than that conleywhite likes to present itself as a diversified communications company but its really not so grand its primary business is textbooks thats a lucrative business but youre selling to school boards in texas and ohio and tennessee many of them are deeply conservative so conleys conservative by instinct and experience they want this merger because they need to acquire a hightech capacity going into the next century but they cant get used to the idea of a very young company where the employees work in tshirts and jeans and everybody goes by first names theyre in shock besides kaplan added lowering her voice again there are internal divisions within conleywhite garvin has to deal with that too what internal divisions she nodded toward the head of the table you may have noticed that their ceo isnt here the big man hasnt honored us with his presence he wont show up until the end of the week for now hes only sent his minions their highestranking officer is ed nichols the cfo sanders glanced over at the suspicious sharpfaced man he had met earlier kaplan said nichols doesnt want to buy this company he thinks were overpriced and underpowered last year he tried to form a strategic alliance with microsoft but gates blew him off then nichols tried to buy interdisk but that fell through too many problems and interdisk had that bad publicity about the fired employee so they ended up with us but ed isnt happy about where he landed he certainly doesnt look happy sanders said the main reason is he hates the conley kid seated beside nichols was john conley the bespectacled young lawyer in his twenties distinctly younger than anyone around him conley was speaking energetically jabbing his fork in the air as he made a point to nichols ed nichols thinks conleys an asshole but conleys only a vice president sanders said he cant have that much power kaplan shook her head hes the heir remember so what does that mean his grandfathers picture is on some boardroom wall conley owns four percent of cw stock and controls another twentysix percent still held by the family or vested in trusts controlled by the family john conley has the largest voting block of conleywhite stock and john conley wants the deal yes kaplan nodded conley handpicked our company to acquire and hes going forward fast with the help of his friends like jim daly at goldman sachs dalys very smart but investment bankers always have big fees riding on a merger theyll do their due diligence im not saying they wont but itd take a lot to get them to back out of the deal now uhhuh so nichols feels hes lost control of the acquisition and hes being rushed into a deal thats a lot richer than it should be nichols doesnt see why cw should make us all wealthy hed pull out of this deal if he couldif only to screw conley but conleys driving this deal yes and conleys abrasive ile likes to make little speeches about youth versus age the coming digital era a young vision for the future it enrages nichols ed nichols feels hes doubled the net worth of the company in a decade and now this little twerp is giving him lectures and how does meredith fit in kaplan hesitated meredith is suitable meaning what shes eastern she grew up in connecticut and went to vassar the conley people like that theyre comfortable with that thats all she has the right accent you didnt hear it from me kaplan said but i think they also see her as weak they think they can control her once the merger is completed and garvins going along with that kaplan shrugged bobs a realist she said he needs capitalization hes built his company skillfully but were going to require massive infusions of cash for the next phase when we go headtohead with sony and philips in product development conleywhites textbook operation is a cash cow bob looks at them and sees greenand hes inclined to do what they want to get their money and of course bob likes meredith yes thats true bob likes her sanders waited while she poked at her food for a while and you stephanie what do you think kaplan shrugged shes able able but weak no kaplan shook her head meredith has ability thats not in question but im concerned about her experience shes not as seasoned as she might be shes being put in charge of four major technical units that are expected to grow rapidly i just hope shes up to it there was the clink of a spoon on a glass and garvin stepped to the front of the room even though youre still eating dessert lets get started so we can finish by two oclock he said let me remind you of the new timetable assuming everything continues as planned we expect to make the formal announcement of the acquisition at a press conference here on friday noon and now let me introduce our new associates from conleywhite as garvin named the cw people and they stood up around the table kaplan leaned over and whispered to tom this is all fluffand feathers the real reason for this lunch is youknowwho and finally garvin said let me introduce someone that many of you know but some of you do not the new vice president for advanced operations and planning meredith johnson there was scattered brief applause as johnson got up from her seat and walked to a podium at the front of the room in her dark blue suit she looked the model of corporate correctness but she was strikingly beautiful at the podium she put on hornrimmed glasses and lowered the conference room lights bob has asked me to review the way the new structure will work she said and to say something about what we see happening in the coming months she bent over the podium where a computer was set up for presentations now if i can just work this thing let me see in the darkened room don cherry caught sanderss eye and shook his head slowly ali okay here we are johnson said at the podium the screen behind her came to life animated images generated by the computer were projected onto the screen the first image showed a red heart which broke into four pieces the heart of digicom has always been its advanced products group which consists of four separate divisions as you see here but as all information throughout the world becomes digital these divisions will inevitably merge on the screen the pieces of the heart slid back together and the heart transformed itself into a spinning globe it began to throw off products for the customer in the near future armed with cellular phone builtin fax modem and handheld computer or pda it will be increasingly irrelevant where in the world he or she is and where the information is coming from we are talking about the true globalization of information and this implies an array of new products for our major markets in business and education the globe expanded and dissolved became classrooms on all continents students at desks in particular education will be a growing focus of this company as technology moves from print to digital displays to virtual environments now lets review exactly what this means and where i see it taking us and she proceeded to do it allhypermedia embedded video authoring systems workgroup structures academic sourcing customer acceptance she moved on to the cost structuresprojected research outlays and revenues fiveyear goals offshore variables then to major product challengesquality control user feedback shorter development cycles meredith johnsons presentation was flawless the images blending and flowing across the screen her voice confident no hesitation no pauses as she continued the room became quiet the atmosphere distinctly respectful although this is not the time to go into technical matters she said i want to mention that new cddrive seek times under a hundred milliseconds combined with new compression algorithms should shift the industry standard for cd to fullres digitized video at sixty fields per second and we are talking about platformindependent risc processors supported by zbit color activematrix displays and portable hard copy atoodpi and wireless networking in both lan and wan configurations combine that with an autonomously generated virtual database especially when rombased software agents for object definition and classification are in place and i think we can agree we are looking at prospects for a very exciting future sanders saw that don cherrys mouth was hanging open sanders leaned over to kaplan sounds like she knows her stuff yes kaplan said nodding the demo queen she started out doing demos appearance has always been her strongest point sanders glanced at kaplan she looked away but then the speech ended there was applause as the lights came up and johnson went back to her seat the room broke up people heading back to work johnson left garvin and went directly to don cherry said a few words to him cherry smiled the charmed geek then meredith went across the room to mary anne spoke briefly to her and then to mark lewyn shes smart kaplan said watching her touching base with all the division heads especially since she didnt name them in her speech sanders frowned you think thats significant only if shes planning to make changes phil said she wasnt going to but you never know do you kaplan said standing up dropping her napkin on the table ive got to goand it looks like youre next on her list kaplan moved discreetly away as meredith came up to sanders she was smiling i wanted to apologize tom meredith said for not mentioning your name and the names of the other division heads in my presentation i dont want anybody to get the wrong idea its just that bob asked me to keep it short well sanders said it looks like you won everybody over the reaction was very favorable i hope so listen she said putting her hand on his arm weve got a slew of due diligence sessions tomorrow ive been asking all the heads to meet with me todayif they can i wonderif youre free to come to my office at the endof the day for a drink we can go over things and maybe catch up on old times too sure he said he felt the warmthof her hand on his arm she didnt take it away theyve given me an office on the fifth floor and with any luck there should be furniture in by later today six oclock work for you fine he said she smiled you still partial to dry chardonnay despite himself he was flattered that she remembered he smiled yes i still am ill seeif i can get one and well go over someof the immediate problems like that hundredmillisecond drive okay fine about that drive i know she said her voice lower well deal with it behind her the conleywhite executives were coming up lets talk tonight good see you then tom see you then a the meeting broke up mark lewyn drifted over to him so lets hear it whatd she say to you meredith no the stealthy one kaplan was bending your ear all during lunch whats up sanders shrugged oh you know just small talk come on stephanie doesnt do small talk she doesnt know how and stephanie talked more to you than ive seen her talk in years sanders was surprised to see how anxious lewyn was actually he said we talked mostly about her son hes a freshman at the university but lewyn wasnt buying it he frowned and said shes up to something isnt she she never talks without a reason is it about me i know shes critical of the design team she thinks were wasteful ive told her many times that its not true mark sanders said your name didnt even come up honest to change the subject sanders asked whatd you think of johnson pretty strong presentation i thought yes shes impressive there was only one thing that bothered me lewyn said he was still frowning still uneasy isnt she supposed to be a latebreaking curve forced on us by management at conley thats what i heard why her presentation to put together a graphic presentation like that takes two weeks at a minimum lewyn said in my design group i get the designers on it a month in advance then we run it through for timing then say a week for revisions and redos then another week while they transfer to a drive and thats my own inhouse group working fast for an executive itd take longer they pawn it off on some assistant who tries to make it for them then the executive looks at it wants it all done over again and it takes more time so if this washer presentation id say shes known about her new job for a while months sanders frowned as usual lewyn said the poor bastards in the trenches are the last to know i just wonder what else we dont know sanders was back at his office by he called his wife to tell her he would be home late that he had a meeting at six whats happening over there susan said i got a call from adele lewyn she says garvins screwing everybody and theyre changing the organization around i dont know yet he said cautiously cindy had just walked in the room are you still getting a promotion basically he said the answer is no i cant believe it susan said tom im sorry are you okay are you upset i would say so yes cant talk thats right okay ill leave soup on ill see you when you get here cindy placed a stack of files on his desk when sanders hung up she said she already knew she suspected cindy nodded she called at lunchtime she said i had the sense the spouses are talking i imagine im sure everybodys talking cindy went to the door then paused cautiously she said and how was the lunch meeting meredith was introduced as the new head of all the tech divisions she gave a presentation she says shes going to keep all the division heads in place all reporting to her then theres no change for us just another layer on top so far thats what theyre telling me why what do you hear i hear the same he smiled then it must be true should i go ahead and buy the condo she had been planning this for some time a condo in queen annes hill for herself and her young daughter sanders said when do you have to decide i have another fifteen days end of the month then wait you know just to be safe she nodded and went out a moment later she came back i almost forgot mark lewyns office just called the twinkle drives have arrived from kl his designers are looking at them now do you want to see them im on my way the design group occupied the entire second floor of the western building as always the atmosphere there was chaotic all the phones were ringing but there was no receptionist in the little waiting area by the elevators which was decorated with faded tapedup posters for a bauhaus exhibition in berlin and an old sciencefiction movie calledthe forbin project two japanese visitors sat at a corner table speaking rapidly beside the battered coke machine and the junk food dispenser sanders nodded to them used his card to open the locked door and went inside the floor was a large open space partitioned at unexpected angles by slanted walls painted to look like pastelveined stone uncomfortablelooking wire chairs and tables were scattered in odd places rockandroll music blared everybody was casually dressed most of the designers wore shorts and tshirts it was clearly a creative area sanders went through to foamland the little display of the latest product designs the group had made there were models of tiny cdrom drives and miniature cellular phones lewyns teams were charged with creating product designs for the future and many of these seemed absurdly small a cellular phone no larger than a pencil and another that looked like a postmodern version of dick tracys wrist radio in pale green and gray a pager the size of a cigarette lighter and a microcd player with a flipup screen that could fit easily in the palm of the hand although these devices looked outrageously tiny sanders had long since become accustomed to the idea that the designs were at most two years in the future the hardware was shrinking fast it was difficult for sanders to remember that when he began working at digicom a portable computer was a thirtypound box the size of a carryon suitcase and cellular telephones didnt exist at all the first cellular phones that digicom manufactured were fifteenpound wonders that you lugged around on a shoulder strap at the time people thought they were a miracle now customers complained if their phones weighed more than a few ounces sanders walked past the big foamcutting machine all twisted tubes and knives behind plexiglas shields and found mark lewyn and his team bent over three dark blue cdromplayers from malaysia one of the players already lay in pieces on the table under bright halogen lights the team was poking at its innards with tiny screwdrivers glancing up from time to time to the scope screens whatve you found sanders said ah hell lewyn said throwing up his hands in artistic exasperation not good tom not good talk to me lewyn pointed to the table theres a metal rod inside the hinge these clips maintain contact with the rod as the case is opened thats how you maintain power to the screen yes but power is intermittent it looks like the rods are too small theyre supposed to be fiftyfour millimeters these seem to be fiftytwo fiftythree millimeters lewyn was grim his entire manner suggesting unspeakable consequences the bars were a millimeter off and the world was coming to an end sanders understood that he would have to calm lewyn down hed done it many times before he said we can fix that mark itll mean opening all the cases and replacing the bars but we can do that oh sure lewyn said but that still leaves the clips our specs call for stainless which has requisite tension to keep the clips springy and maintain contact with the bar these clips seem to be something else maybe theyre too stiff so when you open the cases the clips bend but they dont spring back so we have to replace the clips too we can do that when we switch the bars unfortunately its not that easy the clips are heatpressed into the cases ah hell right they are integral to the case unit youre telling me we have to build new housings just because we have bad clips exactly sanders shook his head weve run off thousands so far something like four thousand well weve got to do em again and what about the drive itself its slow lewyn said no doubt about it but im not sure why it might be power problems or it might be the controller chip if its the controller chip were in deep shit if its a primary design problem we have to go back to the drawing board if its only a fabrication problem we have to change the production lines maybe remake the stencils but its months either way when will we know ive sent a drive and power supply to the diagnostics guys lewyn said they should have a report by five ill get it to you does meredith know about this yet im briefing her at six okay call me after you talk to her sure in a way this is good lewyn said how do you mean were throwing her a big problem right away lewyn said well see how she handles it sanders turned to go lewyn followed him out by the way lewyn said are you pissed off that you didnt get the job disappointed sanders said not pissed theres no point being pissed because if you ask me garvin screwed you you put in the time youve demonstrated you can run the division and he put in someone else instead sanders shrugged its his company lewyn threw his arm over sanderss shoulder and gave him a rough hug you know tom sometimes youre too reasonable for your own good i didnt know being reasonable was a defect sanders said being too reasonable is a defect lewyn said you end up getting pushed around im just trying to get along sanders said i want to be here when the division goes public yeah true you got to stay they came to the elevator lewyn said you think she got it because shes a woman sanders shook his head who knows pale males eat it again i tell you sometimes i get so sick of the constant pressure to appoint women lewyn said i mean look at this design group weve got forty percent women here better than any other division but they always say why dont you have more more women more mark he said interrupting its a different world now and not a better one lewyn said its hurting everybody look when i started in digicom there was only one question are you good if you were good you got hired if you could cut it you stayed no more now ability is only one of the priorities theres also the question of whether youre the right sex and skin color to fill out the companys hr profiles and if you turn out to be incompetent we cant fire you pretty soon we start to get junk like this twinkle drive because no ones accountable anymore no one is responsible you cant build products on atheorybecause the product youre making is real and if it stinks it stinks and no one will buy it coming back to his office sanders used his electronic passcard to open the door to the fourth floor then he slipped the card in his trouser pocket and headed down the hallway he was moving quickly thinking about the meeting with lewyn he was especially bothered by one thing that lewyn had said that he was allowing himself to be pushed around by garvinthat he was being too passive too understanding but sanders didnt see it that way when sanders had said it was garvins company he meant it bob was the boss and bob could do what he wanted sanders was disappointed not to get the job but no one had promised it to him ever he and others in the seattle divisions had come over a period of weeks to assume that sanders would get the job but garvin had never mentioned it nor had phil blackburn as a result sanders felt he had no reason to gripe if he was disappointed it was only because he had done it to himself it was classic counting your chickens before they hatched and as for being too passive what did lewyn expect him to do make a fuss yell and scream that wouldnt do any good because clearly meredith johnson had this job whether sanders liked it or not resign that really wouldnt do any good because if he quit he would lose the profits pending when the company went public that would be a real disaster so on reflection all he could do was accept meredith johnson in the new job and get on with it and he suspected that if the situation were reversed lewyn for all his bluster would do exactly the same thing grin and bear it but the bigger problem as he thought it over was the twinkle drive lewyns team had torn up three drives that afternoon and they still didnt have any idea why they were malfunctioning they had found some nonspec components in the hinge which sanders could track down hed find out soon enough why they were getting nonspecmaterials but the real problemthe slowness of the drivesremained a mystery to which they had no clue and that meant that he was going to tom you dropped your card what he looked up absently an area assistant was frowning pointing back down the hall you dropped your card oh he saw the passcard lying there white against the gray carpet thanks he went back to retrieve it obviously he must be more upset than he realized you couldnt get anywhere in the digicom buildings without a passcard sanders bent over picked it up and slipped it in his pocket then he felt the second card already there frowning he took both cards out and looked at them the card on the floor wasnt his card it was someone elses he paused for a moment trying to decide which was his by design the passcards were featureless just the blue digicom logo a stamped serial number and a magstripe on the back he ought to be able to remember his card number but he couldnt he hurried back to his office to look it up on his computer he glanced at his watch it was four oclock two hours before his meeting with meredith johnson he still had a lot to do to prepare for that meeting he frowned as he walked along staring at the carpet he would have to get the production reports and perhaps also the design detail specs he wasnt sure she would understand them but he should be prepared with them anyway and what else he did not want to go into this first meeting having forgotten something once again his thoughts were disrupted by images from his past an opened suitcase the bowl of popcorn the stainedglass window so said a familiar voice you dont say hello to your old friends anymore sanders looked up he was outside the glasswalled conference room inside the room he saw a solitary figure hunched over in a wheelchair staring at the seattle skyline his back to sanders hello max sanders said max dorfman continued to stare out the window hello thomas how did you know it was me dorfman snorted it must be magic what do you think magic his voice was sarcastic thomas i can see you how you have eyes in the back of your head no thomas i have a reflection infront of my head i see you in the glass of course walking with your head down like a defeated putz dorfman snorted again and then wheeled his chair around his eyes were bright intense mocking you were such a promising man and now you are hanging your head sanders wasnt in the mood lets just say this hasnt been one of my better days max and you want everybody to know about it you want sympathy no max he remembered how dorfman had ridiculed the idea of sympathy dorfman used to say that an executive who wanted sympathy was not an executive he was a sponge soaking up something useless sanders said no max i was thinking ahthinking oh i like thinking thinking is good and what were you thinking about thomas the stained glass in your apartment despite himself sanders was startled how did you know that maybe its magic dorfman said with a rasping laugh or perhaps i can read minds you think i can read minds thomas are you stupid enough to believe that max im not in the mood oh well then i must stop if youre not in the mood i must stop we must at all costs preserve your mood he slapped the arm of his wheelchair irritablyyou told me thomas thats how i knew what you were thinking i told you when nine or ten years ago it must have been what did i tell you oh you dont remember no wonder you have problems better stare at the floor some more it may do you good yes i think so keep staring at the floor thomas max for christs sake dorfman grinned at him do i irritate you you always irritate me ali well then perhaps there is hope not for you of course for me i am old thomas hope has a different meaning at my age youwouldnt understand these days i cannot even get around by myself i must have someone push me preferably a pretty woman but as a rule they do not like to do such things so here i am with no pretty woman to push meunlike you sanders sighed max do you suppose we can just have an ordinary conversation what a good idea dorfman said i would like that very much what is an ordinary conversation i mean can we just talk like normal people if it will not bore you thomas yes but i am worried you know how old people are worried about being boring max what did you mean about the stained glass he shrugged i meant meredith of course what else what about meredith how am i to know dorfman said irritably all i know of this is what you told me and all you told me is that you used to take trips to korea or japan and when you came back meredith would tom im sorry to interrupt cindy said leaning in the door to the conference room oh dont be sorry max said who is this beautiful creature thomas im cindy wolfe professor dorfman she said i work for tom oh what a lucky man he is cindy turned to sanders im really sorry tom but one of the executives from conleywhite is in your office and i thought you would want to yes yes dorfman said immediately he must go conleywhite it soundsvery important in a minute sanders said he turned to cindy max and i were in the middle of something no no thomas dorfman said we were just talking about old times you better go max you want to talk more you think its important you come visit me i am at the four seasons you know that hotel it has awonderful lobby such high ceilings very grand especially for an old man so you go right along thomas his eyes narrowed and leave the beautiful cindy with me sanders hesitated watch out for him he said hes a dirty old man as dirty as possible dorfman cackled sanders headed down the hallway to his office as he left he heard dorfman say now beautiful cindy please take me to the lobby where i have a car waiting and on the way if you dont mind indulging an old man i have a few little questions so manyinterestingthings are happening in this company and the secretaries always know everything dont they mr sandersjim daly stood quickly as sanders came into the room im glad they found you they shook hands sanders gestured for daly to sit down and slid behind his own desk sanders was not surprised he had been expecting a visit from daly or one of the other investment bankers for several days members of the goldman sachs team had been speaking individually with people in various departments going over aspects of the merger most of the time they wanted background information although high technology was central to the acquisition none of the bankers understood it very well sanders expected daly to ask about progress on the twinkle drive and perhaps the corridor i appreciate your taking the time daly said rubbing his bald head he was a very tall thin man and he seemed even taller sitting down all knees and elbows i wanted to ask you some things ah off the record sure sanders said its to do with meredith johnson daly said in an apologetic voice if you ah dont mind id prefer we just keep this conversation between us all right sanders said i understand that you have been closely involved with setting up the plants in ireland and malaysia and that there has been a little controversy inside the company about how that was carried out well sanders shrugged phil blackburn and i havent always seen eye to eye showing your good sense in my view daly said dryly but i gather that in these disputes you represent technical expertise and others in the company represent ah various other concerns would that be fair yes id say so what was he getting at well its along those lines that id like to hear your thoughts bob garvin has just appointed ms johnson to a position of considerable authority a step which many in conleywhite applaud and certainly it would be unfair to prejudge how she will carry out her new duties within the company but by the same token it would be derelict of me not to inquire about her past duties do you get my drift not exactly sanders said im wondering daly said what you feel about ms johnsons past performance with regard to the technical operations of the company specifically her involvement in the foreign operations of digicom sanders frowned thinking back im not aware that shes had much involvement he said we had a labor dispute two years ago in cork she was part of the team that went over to negotiate a settlement she lobbied in washington about flatpanel display tariffs and i know she headed the ops review team in cupertino which approved the plans for the new plant at kuala lumpur yes exactly but i dont know that her involvement goes beyond that ali well perhaps i was given wrong information daly said shifting in his chair what did you hear without going into specifics let me say a question of judgment was raised i see sanders said who would have said anything to daly about meredith certainly not garvin or blackburn kaplan it was impossible to know for sure but daly would be talking only to highly placed officers i was wondering daly said if you had any thoughts on her technical judgment speaking privately of course at that moment sanderss computer screen beeped three times a message flashed one minute to direct video linkup dcmdcs sen a kahn rec t sanders daly said is something wrong no sanders said it looks like i have a video feed coming in from malaysia then ill be brief and leave you to it daly said let me put it to you directly within your division is there any concern whether meredith johnson is qualified for this post sanders shrugged shes the new boss you know how organizations are theres always concern with a new boss youre very diplomatic i mean to say is there concern about her expertise shes relatively young after all geographic move uprooting new faces new staffing new problems and up here she wont be so directly under bob garvins ah wing i dont know what to say sanders said well all have to wait and see and i gather that there was trouble in the past when a nontechnical person headed the division a man named ah screamer freeling yes he didnt work out and there are similar concerns about johnson sanders said ive heard them expressed and her fiscal measures these costcontainment plans of hers thats the crux isnt it sanders thought what costcontainment plans the screen beeped again seconds to direct video linkup dcmdcs there goes your machine again daly said unfolding himself from the chair ill let you go thank you for your time mr sanders not at all they shook hands daly turned and walked out of the room sanderss computer beeped three times in rapid succession seconds to direct video linkup dcmdcs he sat down in front of the monitor and twisted his desk lamp so that the light shone on his face the numbers on the computer were counting backward sanders looked at his watch it was five oclockeight oclock in malaysia arthur would probably be calling from the plant a small rectangle appeared in the center of the screen and grew outward in progressive jumps he saw arthurs face and behind him the brightly lit assembly line brandnew it was the epitome of modern manufacturing clean and quiet the workers in street clothes arranged on both sides of the green conveyor belt at each workstation there was a bank of fluorescent lights which flared a little in the camera kahn coughed and rubbed his chin hello tom how are you when he spoke his image blurred slightly and his voice was out of sync since the bounce to the satellite caused a slight delay in the video but the voice was transmitted immediately this unsynchronized quality was very distracting for the first few seconds it gave the linkup a dreamy quality it was a little like talking to someone under water then you got used to it im fine arthur he said well good im sorry about the new organization you know how i feel personally thank you arthur he wondered vaguely how kahn in malaysia would have heard already but in any company gossip traveled fast yeah well anyway tom im standing here on the floor kahn said gesturing behind him and as you can see were still running very slow and the spot checks are unimproved what do the designers say have they gotten the units yet they came today i dont have any news yet theyre still working on it uhhuh okay and have the units gone to diagnostics kahn asked i think so just went yeah okay because we got a request from diagnostics for ten more drive units to be sent in heatsealed plastic bags and they specified that they wanted them sealed inside the factory right as they came off the line you know anything about that no this is the first i heard of it let me find out and ill get back to you okay because i have to tell you it seemed strange to me i mean ten units is a lot customs is going to query it if we send them all together and i dont know what this sealing is about we send them wrapped in plastic anyway but not sealed why do they want them sealed tom kahn sounded worried i dont know sanders said ill get into it all i can think is that its a fullcourt press around here people really want to know why the hell those drives dont work hey us too kahn said believe me its making us crazy when will you send the drives well ive got to get a heatsealer first i hope i can ship wednesday you can have them thursday not good enough sanders said you should ship today or tomorrow at the latest you want me to run down a sealer for you i can probably get one from apple apple had a factory in kuala lumpur no thats a good idea ill call over there and see if ron can loan me one fine now what about jafar hell of a thing kahn said i just talked to the hospital and apparently hes got cramps and vomiting wont eat anything the abo doctors say they cant figure out anything except you know a spell they believe in spells damn right kahn said theyve got laws against sorcery here you can take people to court so you dont know when hell be back nobodys saying apparently hes really sick okay arthur anything else no ill get the sealer and let me know what you find out i will sanders said and the transmission ended kahn gave a final wave and the screen went blank save this transmission to disk or dat he clicked dat and it was saved to digital tape he got up from the desk whatever all this was about hed better be informed before he had his meeting with johnson at six he went to the outer area to cindys desk cindy was turned away laughing on the phone she looked back and saw sanders and stopped laughing listen i got to go sanders said would you mind pulling the production reports on twinkle for the last two months better yet just pull everything since they opened the line sure and call don cherry for me i need to know what his diagnostics group is doing with the drives he went back into his office he noticed his email cursor was blinking and pushed the key to read them while he waited he looked at the three faxes on his desk two were from ireland routine weekly production reports the third was a requisition for a roof repair at the austin plant it had been held up in operations in cupertino and eddie had forwarded it to sanders to try and get action the screen blinked he looked up at the first of his email messages out of nowhere we got a bean counter from operations down here in austin hes going over all the books driving people mad and the word is we got more coming down tomorrow what gives the rumors are flying and slowing hell out of the line tell me what to say is this company for sale or not eddie sanders did not hesitate he couldnt tell eddie what was going on quickly he typed his reply the bean counters were in ireland last week too garvins ordered a companywide review and theyre looking at everything tell everybody down there to forget it and go back to work tom he pushed the send button the message disappeared you called don cherry walked into the room without knocking and dropped into the chair he put his hands behind his head jesus what a day ive been putting out fires all afternoon tell me i got some dweebs from conley down there asking my guys what the difference is between ram and rom like they have time for this pretty soon one of the dweebs hears flash memory and he goes how often does it flash like it was a flashlight or something and my guys have to put up with this i mean this is highpriced talent they shouldnt be doing remedial classes for lawyers cant you stop it nobody can stop it sanders said maybe meredith can stop it cherry said grinning sanders shrugged shes the boss yeah sowhats on your mind your diagnostics group is working on the twinkle drives true that is were working on the bits and pieces thatre left after lewyns nimblefingered artistes tore the hell out of them why did they go to design first nevereverlet a designer near an actual piece of electronic equipment tom designers should only be allowed to draw pictures on pieces of paper and only give them one piece of paper at a time what have you found sanders said about the drives nothing yet cherry said but we got a few ideas were kicking around is that why you asked arthur kahn to send you ten drives heatsealed from the factory you bet your ass kahn was wondering about that so cherry said let him wonder itll do him good keep him from playing with himself id like to know too well look cherry said maybe our ideas wont amount to anything at the moment all we have is one suspicious chip thats all lewyns clowns left us its not very much to go on the chip is bad no the chip is fine whats suspicious about it look cherry said weve got enough rumors flying around as it is i can report that were working on it and we dont know yet thats alt well get the sealed drives tomorrow or wednesday and we should know within an hour okay you thinking big problem or little problem ive got to know sanders said its going to come up in the meetings tomorrow well at the moment the answer is we dont know it could be anything were working on it arthur thinks it might be serious arthur might be right but well solve it thats all i can tell you don i understand you want an answer cherry said do you understand that i dont have one sanders stared at him you could have called whyd you come up in person since you asked cherry said ive got a small problem its delicate sexual harassment thing anotherone it seems like thats all we have around here us and everybody else cherry said i hear unicoms got fourteen suits going right now digital graphics has even more and microsym look out theyre all pigs over there anyway but id like your read on this sanders sighed okay in one of my programming groups the remote db access group the groups all pretty old twentyfive to twentynine years old the supervisor for the fax modem team a woman has been asking one of the guys out she thinks hes cute he keeps turning her down today she asks him again in the parking lot at lunch he says no she gets in her car rams his car drives off nobody hurt and he doesnt want to make a complaint but hes worried thinks its a little out of hand comes to me for advice what should i do sanders frowned you think thats the whole story shes just mad at him because he turned her down or did he do something to provoke this he says no hes a pretty straight guy a little geeky not real sophisticated and the woman shes got a temper no question she blows at the team sometimes ive had to talk to her about that what does she say about the incident in the parking lot dont know the guys asked me not to talk to her says hes embarrassed and doesnt want to make it worse sanders shrugged what can you do people are upset but nobody will talk i dont know don if a woman rammed his car id guess he must have done something chances are he slept with her once and wont see her again and now shes pissed thats my guess that would be my guess too cherry said but of course maybe not damage to the car nothing serious broken taillight he just doesnt want it to get any worse so do i drop it if he wont file charges id drop it do i speak to her informally i wouldnt you go accusing her of improprietyeven informallyand youre asking for trouble nobodys going to support you because the chances are your guydiddo something to provoke her even though he says he didnt sanders sighed listen don they always say they didnt i never heard of one who said you know i deserve this never happens so drop it put a note in the file that he told you the story be sure you characterize the story as alleged and forget it cherry nodded turned to leave at the door he stopped and looked back so tell me this how come were both so convinced this guy must have done something just playing the odds sanders said now fix that damned drive for me a six oclock he said good night to cindy and took the twinkle files up to merediths office on the fifth floor the sun was still high in the sky streaming through the windows it seemed like late afternoon not the end of the day meredith had been given the big corner office where ron goldman used to be meredith had a new assistant too a woman sanders guessed she had followed her boss up from cupertino im tom sanders he said i have an appointment with ms johnson betsy ross from cupertino mr sanders she said she looked at him dont say anything okay everybody says something something about the flag i get really sick of it okay my whole life okay fine ill tell miss johnson youre here tom meredith johnson waved from behind her desk her other hand holding the phone come in sit down her office had a view north toward downtown seattle the space needle the arly towers the sodo building the city looked glorious in the afternoon sun ill just finish this up she turned back to the phone yes ed im with tom now well go over all of that yes hes brought the documentation with him sanders held up the manila folder containing the drive data she pointed to her briefcase which was lying open on the corner of the desk and gestured for him to put it inside she turned back to the phone yes ed i think the due diligence will go smoothly and there certainly isnt any impulse to hold anything back no no well we can do it first thing in the morning if you like sanders put the folder in her briefcase meredith was saying right ed right absolutely she came toward tom and sat with one hip on the edge of the desk her navy blue skirt riding up her thigh she wasnt wearing stockings everybody agrees that this is important ed yes she swung her foot the high heel dangling from her toe she smiled at sanders he felt uncomfortable and moved back a little i promise you ed yes absolutely meredith hung up the phone on the cradle behind her leaning back across the desk twisting her body revealing her breasts beneath the silk blouse well thats done she sat forward again and sighed the conley people heard theres trouble with twinkle that was ed nichols flipping out actually its the third call ive had about twinkle this afternoon youd think that was all there was to this company how do you like the office pretty good he said great view yes the citys beautiful she leaned on one arm and crossed her legs she saw that he noticed and said in the summer id rather not wear stockings i like the bare feeling so much cooler on a hot day sanders said from now to the end of summer it will be pretty much this way i have to tell you i dread the weather she said i mean after california she uncrossed her legs again and smiled but you like it here dont you you seem happy here yes he shrugged you get used to rain he pointed to her briefcase do you want to go over the twinkle stuff absolutely she said sliding off the desk coming close to him she looked him directly in the eyes but i hope you dont mind if i impose on you first just a little sure she stepped aside pour the wine for us okay see if its chilled long enough he went over to the bottle on the side table i remember you always liked it cold thats true he said spinning the bottle in the ice he didnt like it so cold anymore but he did in those days we had a lot of fun back then she said yes he said we did swear she said sometimes i think that back when we were both young and trying to make it i think that was the best it ever was he hesitated not sure how to answer her what tone to take he poured the wine yes she said we had a good time i think about it often sanders thought i never do she said what about you tom do you think about it of course he crossed the room carrying the glasses of wine to her gave her one clinked them sure i do all us married guys think of the old days you know im married now yes she said nodding very married i hear with how many kids three no just two he smiled sometimes it seems like three and your wife is an attorney yes he felt safer now the talk of his wife and children made him feel safer somehow i dont know how somebody can be married meredith said i tried it she held up her hand four more alimony payments to the son of a bitch and im free who did you marry some account executive at costar he was cute amusing but it turned out he was a typical gold digger ive been paying him off for three yearsand he was a lousy lay she waved her hand dismissing the subject she looked at her watch now come and sit down and tell me how bad it is with the twinkle drive you want the file i put it in your briefcase no she patted the couch beside her you just tell me yourself he sat down beside her you look good tom she leaned back and kicked off her heels wiggled her bare toes god what a day lot of pressure she sipped her wine and blew a strand of hair from her face a lot to keep track of im glad were working together tom i feel as though youre the one friend i can count on in all this thanks ill try so how bad is it well its hard to say just tell me he felt he had no choice but to lay it all out for her weve built very successful prototypes but the drives coming off the line in kl are running nowhere near a hundred milliseconds meredith sighed and shook her head do we know why not yet were working on some ideas that lines a startup isnt it two months ago she shrugged then we have problems on a new line thats not so bad but the thing is he said conleywhite is buying this company for our technology and especially for the cdrom drive as of today we may not be able to deliver as promised you want to tell them that im concerned theyll pick it up in due diligence maybe maybe not she leaned back in the couch we have to remember what were really looking at tom weve all seen production problems loom large only to vanish overnight this may be one of those situations were shaking out the twinkle line weve identified some early problems no big deal maybe but we dont know that in reality there may be a problem with controller chips which means changing our supplier in singapore or there may be a more fundamental problem a design problem originating here perhaps meredith said but as you say we dont know that and i dont see any reason for us to speculate at this critical time but to be honest its not a matter of honesty she said its a matter of the underlying reality lets go over it point by point weve told them we have a twinkle drive yes weve built a prototype and tested the hell out of it yes and the prototype works like gangbusters its twice as fast as the most advanced drives coming out of japan yes weve told them were in production on the drive yes well then meredith said weve told them all that anybody knows for sure at this point id say we are acting in good faith well maybe but i dont know if we can tom meredith placed her hand on his arm i always liked your directness i want you to know how much i appreciate your expertise and your frank approach to problems all the more reason why im sure the twinkle drive will get ironed out we know that fundamentally its a good product that performs as we say it does personally i have complete confidence in it and in your ability to make it work as planned and i have no problem saying that at the meeting tomorrow she paused and looked intently at him do you her face was very close to him her lips halfparted do i what have a problem saying that at the meeting her eyes were light blue almost gray he had forgotten that as he had forgotten how long her lashes were her hair fell softly around her face her lips were full she had a dreamy look in her eyes no he said i dont have a problem good then at least that settled she smiled and held out her glass do the honors again sure he got up from the couch and went over to the wine she watched him im glad you havent let yourself go tom you work out twice a week how about you you always had a nice rush nice hard rush he turned meredith she giggled im sorry i cant help it were old friends she looked concerned i didnt offend you did i no i cant imagine you ever getting prudish tom no no not you she laughed remember the night we broke the bed he poured the wine we didnt exactly break it sure we did you had me bent over the bottom of the footboard and i remember and first we broke the footboard and then the bottom of the bed crashed downbut you didnt want to stop so we moved up and then when i was grabbing the headboard it all came i remember he said wanting to interrupt her to stop this those days were great listen meredith and then the woman from downstairs called up remember her the old lithuanian lady she vanted to know if somebody had died or vhat yeah listen going back to the drive she took the wineglass i am making you uncomfortable what did you think i was coming on to you no no nothing like that good because i really wasnt i promise she gave him an amused glance then tilted her head back exposing her long neck and sipped the wine in fact iah ah she winced suddenly what is it he said leaning forward concerned my neck it goes into spasm its right there with her eyes still squeezed shut in pain she pointed to her shoulder near the neck what should i just rub it squeezethere he put down his wineglass and rubbed her shoulder there yes ah hardersqueeze he felt the muscles of her shoulder relax and she sighed meredith turned her head back and forth slowly then opened her eyes oh much better dont stop rubbing he continued rubbing oh thanks that feels good i get this nerve thing pinched something but when it hits its really she turned her head back and forth testing you did that very well but you were always good with your hands tom he kept rubbing he wanted to stop he felt everything was wrong that he was sitting too close that he didnt want to be touching her but it also felt good to touch her he was curious about it good hands she said god when i was married i thought about you all the time you did sure she said i told you he was terrible in bed i hate a man who doesnt know what hes doing she closed her eyes that was never your problem was it she sighed relaxing more and then she seemed to lean into him melting toward his body toward his hands it was an unmistakable sensation immediately he gave her shoulder a final friendly squeeze and took his hands away she opened her eyes she smiled knowingly listen she said dont worry he turned and sipped his wine im not worried i mean about the drive if it turns out we really have problems and need agreement from higher management well get it but lets not jump the gun now okay fine i think that makes sense he felt secretly relieved to be talking once again about the drive back on safe ground who would you take it to directly to garvin i think so i prefer to deal informally she looked at him youve changed havent you no im still the same i think youve changed she smiled you never would have stopped rubbing me before meredith he said its different you run the division now i work for you oh dont be silly its true were colleagues she pouted nobody around here really believes im superior to you they just gave me the administrative work thats all were colleagues tom and i just want us to have an open friendly relationship so do i good im glad we agree on that quickly she leaned forward and kissed him lightly on the lips there was that so terrible lt wasnt terrible at all who knows maybe well have to go to malaysia together to check on the assembly lines they have very nice beaches in malaysia you ever been to kuantan no youd love it im sure ill show it to you we could take an extra day or two stop over get some sun meredith nobody needs to know tom im married youre also a man what does that mean oh tom she said with mock severity dont ask me to believe you never have a little adventure on the side iknow you remember you knew me a long time ago meredith people dont change not that way well i think they do oh come on were going to be working together we might as well enjoy ourselves he didnt like the way any of this was going he felt pushed into an awkward position he felt stuffy and puritanical when he said im married now oh i dont care about your personal life she said lightly im only responsible for your onthejob performance all work and no play tom it can be bad for you got to stay playful she leaned forward come on just one little kiss the intercom buzzed meredith the assistants voice said she looked up in annoyance i told you no calls im sorry its mr garvin meredith all right she got off the couch and walked across the room to her desk saying loudly but after this betsy no more calls all right meredith i wanted to ask you is it okay if i leave in about ten minutes i have to see the landlord about my new apartment yes did you get me that package i have it right here bring it in and then you can leave thank you meredith mr garvin is on two meredith picked up the phone and poured more wine bob she said hi whats up it was impossible to miss the easy familiarity in her voice she spoke to garvin her back turned to sanders he sat on the couch feeling stranded foolishly passive and idle the assistant entered the room carrying a small package in a brown paper bag she gave the package to meredith of course bob meredith was saying i couldnt agree more well certainly deal with that the assistant waiting for meredith to dismiss her smiled at sanders he felt uncomfortable just sitting there on the couch so he got up walked to the window pulled his cellular phone out of his pocket and dialed mark lewyns number he had promised to call lewyn anyway meredith was saying thats a very good thought bob i think we should act on it sanders heard his call dial and then an answering machine picked up a male voice said leave your message at the beep then an electronic tone mark he said its tom sanders ive talked about twinkle with meredith her view is that were in early production and we are shaking out the lines she takes the position that we cant say for sure that there are any significant problems to be flagged and that we should treat the situation as standard procedure for the bankers and cw people tomorrow the assistant walked out of the room smiling at sanders as she passed him and that if we have problems with the drive later on that we have to get management involved with well face that later ive given her your thoughts and shes talking to bob now so presumably well go into the meeting tomorrow taking that position the assistant came to the door to the office she paused briefly to twist the lock in the doorknob then left closing the door behind her sanders frownedshe had locked the door on her way outit wasnt so much the fact that she had done it but the fact that he seemed to be in the middle of an arrangement a planned event in which everyone else understood what was going on and he did not well anyway mark if there is a significant change in all this ill contact you before the meeting tomorrow and forget that phone meredith said coming up suddenly very close to him pushing his hand down and pressing her body against his her lips mashed against his mouth he was vaguely aware of dropping the phone on the windowsill as they kissed and she twisted turning away and they tumbled over onto the couch meredith wait oh god ive wanted you all day she said intensely she kissed him again rolling on top of him lifting one leg to hold him down his position was awkward but he felt himself responding to her his immediate thought was that someone might come in he had a vision of himself lying on his back on the couch with his boss halfstraddling him in her businesslike navy suit and he was anxious about what the person seeing them would think and then he was truly responding she felt it too and it aroused her more she pulled back for a breath oh god you feel so good i cant stand the bastard touching me those stupid glasses oh im sohot ihavent had a decent fuck and then she threw herself back on him kissing him again her mouth mashed on him her tongue was in his mouth and he thoughtjesus shes pushing ithe smelled her perfume and it immediately brought back memories she shifted her body so she could reach down and touch him and she moaned when she felt him through his trousers she fumbled at the zipper he had suddenly conflicting images his desire for her his wife and his kids memories of the past of being with her in the apartment in sunnyvale of breaking the bed images of his wife meredith oooh dont talk no no she was gasping in little breaths her mouth puckering rhythmically like a goldfish he remembered that she got that way he had forgotten until now he felt her hot panting breath on his face saw her flushed cheeks she got his trousers open her hot hand on him oh jesus she said squeezing him and she slid down his body running her hands over his shirt listen meredith just let me she said hoarsely just for a minute and then her mouth was on him she was always good at this images flooding back to him the way she liked to do it in dangerous places while he was driving on the freeway in the mens room at a sales conference on the beach at napili at night the secret impulsive nature the secret heat when he was first introduced to her the exec at contech had saidshe one of the great cocksuckers feeling her mouth on him feeling his back arch as the tension ran through his body he had the uneasy sense of pleasure and danger at once so much had happened during the day so many changes everything was so sudden he felt dominated controlled and at risk he had the feeling as he lay on his back that he was somehow agreeing to a situation that he did not understand fully that was not fully recognized there would be trouble later he did not want to go to malaysia with her he did not want an affair with his boss he did not even want a onenight stand because what always happened was that people found out gossip at the water cooler meaningful looks in the hallway and sooner or later the spouses found out it always happened slammed doors divorce lawyers child custody and he didnt want any of that his life was arranged now he had things in place he had commitments this woman from his past understood none of that she was free he was not he shifted his body meredith god you taste good meredith she reached up and pressed her fingers over his lips ssshhh i know you like it i do like it he said but i then let me as she sucked him she was unbuttoning his shirt pinching his nipples he looked down and saw her straddling his legs her head bent over him her blouse was open her breasts swung free she reached up took his hands and pulled them down placing them on her breasts she still had perfect breasts the nipples hard under his touch she moaned her body squirming as she straddled him he felt her warmth he began to hear a buzzing in his ears a suffusing intoxicated flush in his face as sounds went dull the room seemed distant and there was nothing but this woman and her body and his desire for her in that moment he felt a burst of anger a kind of male fury that he was pinned down that she was dominating him and he wanted to be in control to take her he sat up and grabbed her hair roughly lifting her head and twisting his body she looked in his eyes and saw instantly yes she said and she moved sideways so he could sit up beside her he slipped his hand between her legs he felt warmth and lacy underpants he tugged at them she wriggled helping him and he slid them down to her knees then she kicked them away her hands were caressing his hair her lips at his ear yes she whispered fiercely yes her blue skirt was bunched up around her waist he kissed her hard pulling her blouse wide pressing her breasts to his bare chest he felt her heat all along his body he moved his fingers probing between her lips she gasped as they kissed nodding her head yes then his fingers were in her for a moment he was startled she was not very wet and then he remembered that too the way she would start her words and body immediately passionate but this central part of her slower to respond taking her eventual arousal from his she was always turned on most by his desire for her and always came after he did sometimes within a few seconds but sometimes he struggled to stay hard while she rocked against him pushing to her own completion lost in her own private world while he was fading he always felt alone always felt as if she were using him those memories gave him pause and she sensed his hesitation and grabbed him fiercely fumbling at his belt moaning sticking her hot tongue in his ear but reluctance was seeping back into him now his angry heat was fading and unbidden the thought flashed through his mindits not worth it all his feelings shifted again and now he had a familiar sensation going back to see an old lover being attracted over dinner then getting involved again feeling desire and suddenly in the heat of the moment in the press of flesh being reminded of all the things that had been wrong with the relationship feeling old conflicts and angers and irritations rise up again and wishing that he had never started suddenly thinking of how to get out of it how to stop what was started but usually there was no way to get out of it still his fingers were inside her and she was moving her body against his hand shifting to be sure he would touch the right place she was wetter her lips were swelling she opened her legs wider for him she was breathing very hard stroking him with her fingers oh god i love the way you feel she said usually there was no way to get out ofit his body was tense and ready her hard nipples brushed against his chest her fingers caressed him she licked the bottom of his earlobe with a quick dart of her tongue and instantly there was nothing but his desire hot and angry more intense for the fact that he didnt really want to be there that he felt she had manipulated him to this place now he would fuck her he wanted to fuck her hard she sensed his change and moaned no longer kissing him leaning back on the couch waiting she watched him through halfclosed eyes nodding her head his fingers still touched her rapidly repeatedly making her gasp and he turned pushed her down on her back on the couch she hiked up her skirt and spread her legs for him he crouched over her and she smiled at him a knowing victorious smile it made him furious to see this sense that she had somehow won this watchful detachment and he wanted to catch her to make her feel as out of control as he felt to make her part of this to wipe that smug detachment from her face he spread her lips but did not enter her he held back his fingers moving teasing her she arched her back waiting for him no no please still he waited looking at her his anger was fading as quickly as it had come his mind drifting away the old reservations returning in an instant of harsh clarity he saw himself in the room a panting middle aged married man with his trousers down around his knees bent over a woman on an office couch that was too small what the hell was he doing he looked at her face saw the way the makeup cracked at the corners of her eyes around her mouth she had her hands on his shoulders tugging him toward her oh please no no and then she turned her head aside and coughed something snapped in him he sat back coldly youre right he got off the couch and pulled up his trousers we shouldnt do this she sat up what are you doing she seemed puzzled you want this as much as i do you know you do no he said we shouldnt do this meredith he was buckling his belt stepping back she stared at him in dazed disbelief like someone awakened from sleep youre not serious this isnt a good idea i dont feel good about it and then her eyes were suddenly furious you fuckingson of a bitch she got off the couch fast rushing at him hitting him hard with bunched fists you bastard you prick you fucking bastard he was trying to button his shirt turning away from her blows you shit you bastard she moved around him as he turned away grabbing his hands tearing at his shirt to keep him from buttoning it you cant you cant do this to me buttons popped she scratched him long red welts running down his chest he turned again avoiding her wanting only to get out of there to get dressed and get out of there she pounded his back you fucker you cant leave me like this cut it out meredith he said its over fuckyou she grabbed a handful of his hair pulling him down with surprising strength and she bit his ear hard he felt an intense shooting pain and he pushed her away roughly she toppled backward off balance crashing against the glass coffee table sprawling on the ground she sat there panting you fucking son of a bitch meredith just leave me alone he was buttoning his shirt again all he could think wasget out of here get your stuff and get out of here he reached for his jacket then saw his cellular phone on the windowsill he moved around the couch and picked up the phone the wineglass crashed against the window near his head he looked over and saw her standing in the middle of the room reaching for something else to throw ill kill you she said ill fucking kill you thats enough meredith he said the hell she threw a small paper bag at him it thunked against the glass and dropped to the floor a box of condoms fell out im going home he moved toward the door thats right she said you go home to your wife and your little fucking family alarms went off in his head he hesitated for a moment oh yes she said seeing him pause i know all about you you asshole your wife isnt fucking you so you come in here and lead me on you set me up and then you walk out on me you hostile violent fucking asshole you think you can treat women this way you asshole he reached for the doorknob you walk out on me youre dead he looked back and saw her leaning unsteadily on the desk and he thoughtshes drunk good night meredith he said he twisted the knob then remembered that the door had been locked he unlocked the door and walked out without looking back in the outer room a cleaning woman was emptying trash baskets from the assistants desks ill fucking kill you for this meredith called after him the cleaning woman heard it and stared at sanders he looked away from her and walked straight to the elevator he pushed the button a moment later he decided to take the stairs sanders stared at the setting sun from the deck of the ferry going back to winslow the evening was calm with almost no breeze the surface of the water was dark and still he looked back at the lights of the city and tried to assess what had happened from the ferry he could see the upper floors of the digicom buildings rising behind the horizontal gray concrete of the viaduct that ran along the waters edge he tried to pick out merediths office window but he was already too far away out here on the water heading home to his family slipping back into his familiar daily routine the events of the previous hour had already begun to take on an unreal quality he found it hard to believe that it had happened he reviewed the events in his mind trying to see just where he had gone wrong he felt certain that it was all his fault that he had misled meredith in some important way otherwise she would never have come on to him the whole episode was an embarrassment for him and probably for her too he felt guilty and miserableand deeply uneasy about the future what would happen now what would she do he couldnt even guess he realized then that he didnt really know her at all they had once been lovers but that was a long time ago now she was a new person with new responsibilities she was a stranger to him although the evening was mild he felt chilled he went back inside the ferry he sat in a booth and took out his phone to call susan he pushed the buttons but the light didnt come on the battery was dead for a moment he was confused the battery should last all day but it was dead the perfect end to his day feeling the throb of the ferry engines he stood in thebathroom and stared at himself in the mirror his hair was messed there was a faint smear of lipstick on his lips and another on his neck two buttons of his shirt were missing and his clothes were rumpled he looked as if he had just gotten laid he turned his head to see his ear a tiny bruise marked where she had bitten him he unbuttoned the shirt and looked at the deep red scratches running in parallel rows down his chest christ how was he going to keep susan from seeing this he dampened paper towels and scrubbed away the lipstick he patted down his hair and buttoned his sport coat hiding most of his shirt then he went back outside sat down at a booth by the window and stared into space hey tom he looked up and saw john perry his neighbor on bainbridge perry was a lawyer with marlin howard one of the oldest firms in seattle he was one of those irrepressibly enthusiastic people and sanders didnt much feel like talking to him but perry slipped into the seat opposite him hows it going perry asked cheerfully pretty good sanders said i had agreat day glad to hear it justgreat perry said we tried a case and i tell you we kicked ass great sanders said he stared fixedly out the window hoping perry would take the hint and go away perry didnt yeah and it was a damned tough case too uphill all the way for us he said title vii federal court clients a woman who worked at microtech claimed she wasnt promoted because she was a female not a very strong case to tell the truth because she drank and so on there were problems but we have a gal in our firm louise fernandez a hispanic gal and she is justlethal on these discrimination cases lethal got the jury to award our client nearly half a million that fernandez can work the case law like nothing youve ever seen shes won fourteen of her last sixteen cases she acts so sweet and demure and inside shes justice i tell you sometimes women scare the hell out of me sanders said nothing he came home to a silent house the kids already asleep susan always put the kids to bed early he went upstairs his wife was sitting up in bed reading with legal files and papers scattered across the bedcovers when she saw him she got out of bed and came over to hug him involuntarily his body tensed im really sorry tom she said im sorry about this morning and im sorry about what happened at work she turned her face up and kissed him lightly on the lips awkwardly he turned away he was afraid she would smell merediths perfume or you mad about this morning she asked no he said really im not it was just a long day lot of meetings on the merger yes he said and more tomorrow its pretty crazy susan nodded it must be you just got a call from the office from a meredith johnson he tried to keep his voice casual oh yes uhhuh about ten minutes ago she got back in bed who is she anyway susan was always suspicious when women from the office called sanders said shes the new veep they just brought her up from cupertino i wondered she acted like she knew me i dont think youve ever met he waited hoping he wouldnt have to say more well she said she sounded very friendly she said to tell you everything is fine for the due diligence meeting tomorrow morning at eightthirty and shell see you then okay fine he kicked off his shoes and started to unbutton his shirt then stopped he bent over and picked his shoes up how old is she susan asked meredith i dont know thirtyfive something like that why just wondered im going to take a shower he said okay she picked up her legal briefs and settled back in bed adjusting the reading light he started to leave do you know her susan asked ive met her before in cupertino whats she doing up here shes my new boss shesthe one yeah he said shes the one shes the woman thats close to garvin yeah who told you adele adele lewyn marks wife was one of susans best friends she nodded mary anne called too the phone never stopped ringing ill bet so is garvin fucking her or what nobody knows he said the general belief is that hes not whyd he bring her in instead of giving the job to you i dont know sue you didnt talk to garvin he came around to see me in the morning but i wasnt there she nodded you must be pissed or are you being your usual understanding self well he shrugged what can i do you can quit she said not a chance they passed over you dont youhave to quit this isnt the best economy to find another job and im fortyone i dont feel like starting over besides phil insists theyre going to spin off the technical division and take it public in a year even if im not running it id still be a principal in that new company and did he have details he nodded theyll vest us each twenty thousand shares and options for fifty thousand more then options for another fifty thousand shares each additional year at usually its twentyfive cents a share and the stock will be offered at what five dollars at least the ipo market is getting stronger then say it goes to ten maybe twenty if were hot there was a brief silence he knew she was good with figures no she said finally you cant possibly quit he had done the calculations many times at a minimum sanders would realize enough on his stock options to pay off his mortgage in a single payment but if the stock went through the roof it could be truly fantasticsomewhere between five and fourteen million dollars that was why going public was the dream of anyone who worked in a technical company he said as far as im concerned they can bring in godzilla to manage that division and ill still stay at least two more years and is that what theyve done brought in goodwill he shrugged i dont know do you get along with her he hesitated im not sure im going to take a shower okay she said he glanced back at her she was reading her notes again after his shower he plugged his phone into the charger unit onthe sink and put on a tshirt and boxer shorts he looked at himself in the mirror the shirt covered his scratches but he was still worried about the smell of merediths perfume he splashed aftershave on his cheeks then he went into his sons room to check on him matthew was snoring loudly his thumb in his mouth he had kicked down the covers sanders pulled them back up gently and kissed his forehead then he went into elizas room at first he could not see her his daughter had lately taken to burrowing under a barricade of covers and pillows when she slept he tiptoed in and saw a small hand reach up and wave to him he came forward why arent you asleep laze he whispered i was having a dream she said but she didnt seem frightened he sat on the edge of the bed and stroked her hair what kind of a dream about the beast uhhuh the beast was really a prince but he was placed under a powerful spell by a chantress thats right he stroked her hair who turned him into a hideous beast she was quoting the movie almost verbatim thats right he said why i dont know lize thats the story because he didnt give her shelter from the bitter cold she was quoting again why didnt he dad i dont know he said because he had no love in his heart she said live its time for sleep give me a dream first dad okay theres a beautiful silver cloud hanging over your bed and that dreams no good dad she was frowning at him okay what kind of dream do you want with kermit okay kermit is sitting right here by your head and he is going to watch over you all night and you too yes and me too he kissed her forehead and she rolled away to face the wall as he left the room he could hear her sucking her thumb loudly he went back to the bedroom and pushed aside his wifes legal briefs to get into bed was she still awake susan asked i think shell go to sleep she wanted a dream about kermit his wife nodded kermit is a very big deal now she didnt comment on his tshirt he slipped under the covers and felt suddenly exhausted he lay back against the pillow and closed his eyes he felt susan picking up the briefs on the bed and a moment later she turned off the light mum she said you smell good she snuggled up against him pressing her face against his neck and threw her leg over his side this was her invariable overture and it always annoyed him he felt pinned down by her heavy leg she stroked his cheek is that aftershave for me oh susan he sighed exaggerating his fatigue because it works she said giggling beneath the covers she put her hand on his chest he felt it slide down and slip under the tshirt he had a burst of sudden anger what was the matter with her she never had any sense about these things she was always coming on to him at inappropriate times and places he reached down and grabbed her hand something wrong im really tired sue she stopped bad day huh she said sympathetically yeah pretty bad she got up on one elbow and leaned over him she stroked his lower lip with one finger you dont want me to cheer you up i really dont not even a little he sighed again you sure she asked teasingly really really sure and then she started to slide beneath the covers he reached down and held her head with both hands susan please come on she giggled its only eightthirty you cant bethat tired i am i bet youre not susan damn it im not in the mood okay okay she pulled away from him but i dont know why you put on the aftershave if youre not interested for christs sake we hardly ever have sex anymore as it is thats because youre always traveling it just slipped out im not always traveling youre gone a couple of nights a week thats not always traveling and besides its my job i thought you were going to be more supportive of my job i am supportive complaining is not supportive look for christs sake he said i come home early whenever youre out of town i feed the kids i take care of things so you dont have to worry sometimesshe said and sometimes you stay late at the office and the kids are with consuela until all hours well i have a job too so dont give me this take care of things crap she said youre not home anywhere near as much as i am im the one who has two jobs and mostly you do exactly what you want just like every other fucking man in the world susan jesus you come home early once in a while and you act like a fucking martyr she sat up and turned on her bedside light every woman i know works harder than any man susan i dont want to fight sure make itmy fault im the one with the problem fuckingmen he was tired but he felt suddenly energized by anger he felt suddenly strong and got out of bed and started pacing what does being a man have to do with it am i going to hear how oppressed you are again now listen she said sitting straighter women are oppressed its a fact is it how are you oppressed you never wash a load of clothes you never cook a meal you never sweep a floor somebody does all that for you you have somebody to do everything for you you have somebody to take the kids to school and somebody to pick them up youre a partner in a law firm for christs sake youre about as oppressed as leona helmsley she was staring at him in astonishment he knew why susan had made her oppression speech many times before and he had never contradicted her over time with repetition it had become an accepted idea in their marriage now he was disagreeing he was changing the rules i cant believe you i thought you were different she squinted at him her judicious look this is because a woman got your job isnt it whatre we going to now the fragile male ego its true isnt it youre threatened no its not its crap whos got the fragile ego around here your egos so fucking fragile you cant even take a rejection in bed without picking a fight that stopped her he saw it instantly she had no comeback she sat there frowning at him her face tight jesus he said and turned to leave the room you picked this fight she said he turned back i did not yes you did you were the one who started in with the traveling no you were complaining about no sex i wascommenting christ never marry a lawyer and your ego is fragile susan you want to talk fragile i mean youre so fucking selfinvolved that you had a shitfit this morning because you wanted to look pretty for the pediatrician oh there it is finally you are still mad because i made you late what is it you think you didnt get the job because you were late no he said i didnt you didnt get the job she said because garvin didnt give it to you you didnt play the game well enough and somebody else played it better thats why a woman played it better furious shaking unable to speak he turned on his heel and left the room thats right leave she said walk away thats what you always do walk away dont stand up for yourself you dont want to hear it tom but its the truth if you didnt get the job you have nobody to blame but yourself he slammed the door he sat in the kitchen in darkness it was quiet all around him except for the hum of the refrigerator through the kitchen window he could see the moonlight on the bay through the stand of fir trees he wondered if susan would come down but she didnt he got up and walked around pacing after a while it occurred to him that he hadnt eaten he opened the refrigerator door squinting in the light it was stacked with baby food juice containers baby vitamins bottles of formula he poked among the stuff looking for some cheese or maybe a beer he couldnt find anything except a can of susans diet coke christ he thought not like the old days when his refrigerator was full of frozen food and chips and salsa and lots of beer his bachelor days he took out the diet coke now eliza was starting to drink it too hed told susan a dozen times he didnt want the kids to get diet drinks they ought to be getting healthy food real food but susan was busy and consuela indifferent the kids ate all kinds of crap it wasnt right it wasnt the way he had been brought up nothing to eat nothing in his own damned refrigerator hopeful he lifted the lid of a tupperware container and found a partially eaten peanut butter and jelly sandwich with elizas small toothmarks in one side he picked the sandwich up and turned it over wondering how old it was he didnt see any mold what the hell he thought and he ate the rest of elizas sandwich standing there in his tshirt in the light of the refrigerator door he was startled by his own reflection in the glass of the oven another privileged member of the patriarchy lording it over the manor christ he thought where did women come up with this crap he finished the sandwich and rubbed the crumbs off his hands the wall clock said susan went to sleep early apparently she wasnt coming down to make up she usually didnt it was his job to make up he was the peacemaker he opened a carton of milk and drank from it then put it back on the wire shelf he closed the door darkness again he walked over to the sink washed his hands and dried them on a dish towel having eaten a little he wasnt so angry anymore fatigue crept over him he looked out the window and through the trees and saw the lights of a ferry heading west toward bremerton one of the things he liked about this house was that it was relatively isolated it had some land around it it was good for the kids kids should grow up with a place to run and play he yawned she definitely wasnt coming down itd have to wait until morning he knew how it would go hed get up first fix her a cup of coffee and take it to her in bed then hed say he was sorry and she would reply that she was sorry too theyd hug and he would go get dressed for work and that would be it he went back up the dark stairs to the second floor and opened the door to the bedroom he could hear the quiet rhythms of susans breathing he slipped into bed and rolled over on his side and then he went to sleep tuesday it rained in the morning hard sheets of drumming downpour that slashed across the windows of the ferry sanders stood in line to get his coffee thinking about the day to come out of the corner of his eye he saw dave benedict coming toward him and quickly turned away but it was too late benedict waved hey guy sanders didnt want to talk about digicom this morning at the last moment he was saved by a call the phone in his pocket went off he turned away to answer it fucking a tommy boy it was eddie larson in austin what is it eddie you know that bean counter cupertino sent down well get this thereseightof em here now independent accounting firm of jenkins mckay out of dallas theyre going over all the books like a swarm of roaches and i mean everything receivables payables a and ls year to dateeverythingand now theyre going back through every year to eightynine yeah disrupting everything better believe it the gals dont even have a place to sit down and answer the phone plus everything from ninetyone back is in storage downtown weve got it on fiche here but they say they want original documents they want the damned paper and they get all squinty and paranoid when they order us around treating us like were thieves or something trying to pull a fast one its insulting well sanders said hang in there youve got to do what they ask the only thing that really bothers me eddie said is they got another seven more coming in this afternoon because theyre also doing a complete inventory of the plant everything from the furniture in the offices to the air handlers and the heat stampers out on the line we got a guy there now making his way down the line stopping at each work station says whats this thing called how do you spell it who makes it whats the model number how old is it wheres the serial number you ask me we might as well shut the line down for the rest of the day sanders frowned theyre doing aninventory well thats what they call it but its beyond any damn inventory i ever heard of these guys have worked over at texas instruments or someplace and ill give em one thing they know what theyre talking about this morning one of the jenkins guys came up and asked me what kind of glass we got in the ceiling skylights i said what kind of glass i thought he was shitting me he says yeah is it corning two fortyseven or twofortyseven slash nine or some damned thing like that theyre different kinds of uv glass because uv can affect chips on the production line inever evenheard that uv can affect chips oh yeah this guy says real problem if your asds get over twotwenty thats annual sunny days have you heard of that sanders wasnt really listening he was thinking about what it meant that somebody either garvin or the conleywhite people would ask for an inventory of the plant ordinarily you called for an inventory only if you were planning to sell a facility then you had to do it to figure your writedowns at the time of transfer of assets and tom you there im here so i say to this guy i never heard that about the uv and the chips and we been putting chips in the phones for years never any trouble and then the guy says oh not for installing chips uv affects it if youremanufacturingchips and i say we dont do that here and he says i know so im wondering what the hell does he care what kind of glass we have tommy boy you with me whats the story larson said were going to have fifteen guys crawling all over us by the end of the day now dont tell me this isroutine it doesnt sound like its routine no it sounds like theyre going to sell the plant to somebody who makes chips is what it sounds like and that aint us i agree thats what it sounds like fucking a eddie said i thought you told me this wasnt going to happen tom people here are getting upset and im one of em i understand i mean i got people asking me they just bought a house their wifes pregnant they got a baby coming and they want to know what do i tell em eddie i dont have any information jesus tom youre the division head i know let me check with cork see what the accountants did there they were out there last week i already talked to colin an hour ago operations sent two people out there for one day very polite not like this at all no inventory no inventory okay sanders said he sighed let me get into it tommy boy eddie said i got to tell you right out im concerned you dont already know me too sanders said me too he hung up the phone sanders pushed kap for stephanie kaplan she would know what was going on in austin and he thought she would tell him but her assistant said kaplan was out of the office for the rest of the morning he called mary anne but she was gore too then he dialed the four seasons hotel and asked for max dorfman the operator said mr dorfmans lines were busy he made a mental note to see max later in the day because if eddie was right then sanders was out of the loop and that wasnt good in the meantime he could bring up the plant closing with meredith at the conclusion of the morning meeting with conleywhite that was the best he could do for the moment the prospect of talking to her made him uneasy but hed get through it somehow he didnt really have a choice when he got to the fourthfloor conference room nobody was there at the far end a wall board showed a cutaway of the twinkle drive and a schematic for the malaysia assembly line there were notes scribbled on some of the pads open briefcases beside some of the chairsthe meeting was already under waysanders had a sense of panic he started to sweat at the far end of the room an assistant came in and began moving around the table setting out glasses and water where is everybody he asked oh they left about fifteen minutes ago she said fifteen minutes ago when did they start the meeting started at eight eight sanders said i thought it was supposed to be eightthirty no the meeting started at eightdamnwhere are they now meredith took everybody down to vie to demo the corridor entering vie the first thing sanders heard was laughter when he walked into the equipment room he saw that don cherrys team had two of the conleywhite executives up on the system john conley the young lawyer and jim daly the investment banker were both wearing headsets while they walked on the rolling walker pads the two men were grinning wildly everyone else in the room was laughing too including the normally sourfaced cfo of conleywhite ed nichols who was standing beside a monitor which showed an image of the virtual corridor that the users were seeing nichols had red marks on his forehead from wearing the headset nichols looked over as sanders came up this isfantastic sanders said yes its pretty spectacular simply fantastic its going to wipe out all the criticism in new york once they see this weve been asking don if he can run this on our own corporate database no problem cherry said just get us the programming hooks for your db and well plug you right in take us about an hour nichols pointed to the headset and we can get one of these contraptions in new york easy cherry said we can ship it out later today itll be there thursday ill send one of our people to set it up for you this is going to be agreatselling point nichols said just great he took out his halfframe glasses they were a complicated kind of glasses that folded up very small nichols unfolded them carefully and put them on his nose on the walker pad john conley was laughing angel he said how do i open this drawer then he cocked his head listening hes talking to the help angel cherry said he hears the angel through his earphones whats the angel telling him nichols said thats between him and his angel cherry laughed on the walker pad conley nodded as he listened then reached forward into the air with his hand he closed his fingers as if gripping something and pulled back pantomiming someone opening a file drawer on the monitor sanders saw a virtual file drawer slide out from the wall of the corridor inside the drawer he saw neatly arranged files wow conley said this is amazing angel can i see a file oh okay conley reached out and touched one of the file labels with his fingertip immediately the file popped out of the drawer and opened up apparently hanging in midair we have to break the physical metaphor sometimes cherry said because users have only one hand and you cant open a regular file with one hand standing on the black walker pad conley moved his hand through the air in short arcs mimicking someone turning pages with his hand on the monitor sanders saw conley was actually looking at a series of spreadsheets hey conley said you people ought to be more careful i have all your financial records here let me see that daly said turning around on the walker pad to look you guys look all you want cherry laughed enjoy it while you can in the final system well have safeguards built in to control access but for now we bypass the entire system do you notice that some of the numbers are red that means they have more detail stored away touch one conley touched a red number the number zoomed out creating a new plane of information that hung in the air above the previous spreadsheet wow kind of a hypertext thing cherry said with a shrug sort of neat if i say so myself conley and daly were giggling poking rapidly at numbers on the spreadsheet zooming out dozens of detail sheets that now hung in the air all around them hey how do you get rid of all this stuff can you find the original spreadsheet its hidden behind all this other stuff bend over and look see if you can get it conley bent at the waist and appeared to look under something he reached out and pinched air i got it okay now you see a green arrow in the right corner touch it conley touched it all the papers zoomed back into the original spreadsheet fabulous i want to do it daly said no you cant im going to do it no me me they were laughing like delighted kids blackburn came up i know this is enjoyable for everyone he said to nichols but were falling behind our schedule and perhaps we ought to go back to the conference room all right nichols said with obvious reluctance he turned to cherry you sure you can get us one of these things count on it cherry said count on it walking back to the conference room the conleywhite executives were in a giddy mood they talked rapidly laughing about the experience the digicom people walked quietly beside them not wanting to disrupt the good mood it was at that point that mark lewyn fell into step alongside sanders and whispered hey why didnt you call me last night i did sanders said lewyn shook his head there wasnt any message when i got home he said i talked to your answering machine about sixfifteen i never got a message lewyn said and then when i came in this morning you werent here he lowered his voice christ what a mess i had to go into the meeting on twinkle with no idea what the approach was going to be im sorry sanders said i dont know what happened fortunately meredith took over the discussion lewyn said otherwise i would have been in deepest shit in fact iwell do this later he said seeing johnson drop back to talk to sanders lewyn stepped away where the hell were youjohnson said i thought the meeting was for eightthirty i called your house last night specifically because it was changed to eight theyre trying to catch a plane to austin for the afternoon so we moved everything up i didnt get that message i talked to your wife didnt she tell you i thought it was eightthirty johnson shook her head as if dismissing the whole thing anyway she said in the eight oclock session i had to take another approach to twinkle and its very important that we have some coordination in the light of meredith up at the front of the group garvin was looking back at her meredith john has a question for you be right there she said with a final angry frown at sanders she hurried up to the head of the group back in the conference room the mood was light they were all still joking as they took their seats ed nichols began the meeting by turning to sanders merediths been bringing us up to date on the twinkle drive now that youre here wed like your assessment as well i had to take another approach to twinklemeredith had said sanders hesitated my assessment yes nichols said youre in charge of twinkle arent you sanders looked at the faces around the table turned expectantly toward him he glanced at johnson but she had opened her briefcase and was rummaging through her papers taking out several bulging manila envelopes well sanders said we built several prototypes and tested them thoroughly theres no doubt that the prototypes performed flawlessly theyre the best drives in the world i understand that nichols said but now you are in production isnt that right thats right i think were more interested in your assessment of the production sanders hesitated what had she told them at the other end of the room meredith johnson closed her briefcase folded her hands under her chin and stared steadily at him he could not read her expression what hadshetold them mr sanders well sanders began weve been shaking out the lines dealing with the problems as they arise its a pretty standard startup experience for us were still in the early stages im sorry nichols said i thought youve been in production for two months yes thats true two months doesnt sound like the early stages to me well some of your product cycles are as short as nine months isnt that right nine to eighteen months yes then after two months you must be in full production how do you assess that as the principal person in charge well id say the problems are of the order of magnitude we generally experience at this point im interested to hear that nichols said because earlier today meredith indicated to us that the problems were actually quite serious she said you might even have to go back to the drawing board shit how should he play it now hed already said that the problems were not so bad he couldnt back down sanders took a breath and said i hope i havent conveyed the wrong impression to meredith because i have full confidence in our ability to manufacture the twinkle drive im sure you do nichols said but were looking down the barrel at competition from sony and philips and im not sure that a simple expression of your confidence is adequate how many of the drives coming off the line meet specifications i dont have that information just approximately i wouldnt want to say without precise figures are precise figures available yes i just dont have them at hand nichols frowned his expression said why dont you have them when you knew this is what the meeting was about conley cleared his throat meredith indicated that the line is running at twentynine percent capacity and that only five percent of the drives meet specifications is that your understanding thats more or less how it has been yes there was a brief silence around the table abruptly nichols sat forward im afraid i need some help here he said with figures like that on what do you base your confidence in the twinkle drive the reason is that weve seen all this before sanders replied weve seen production problems that look insurmountable but then get resolved quickly i see so you think your past experience will hold true here yes i do nichols sat back in his seat and crossed his arms over his chest he looked extremely dissatisfied jim daly the thin investment banker sat forward and said please dont misunderstand tom were not trying to put you on the spot he said we have long ago identified several reasons for acquisition of this company irrespective of any specific problem with twinkle so i dont think twinkle is a critical issue today we just want to know where we stand on it and wed like you to be as frank as possible well thereare problems sanders said were in the midst of assessing them now we have some ideas but some of the problems may go back to design daly said give us worst case worst case we pull the line rework the housings and perhaps the controller chips and then go back on causing a delay of nine to twelve months upto six months sanders said jesus somebody whispered daly said johnson suggested that the maximum delay would be six weeks i hope thats right but you asked for worst case do you really think it will take six months you asked for worst case i think its unlikely but possible yes possible nichols sat forward again and gave a big sigh let me see if i understand this right if thereare design problems with the drive they occurred under your stewardship is that correct yes it is nichols shook his head well having gotten us into this mess do you really think youre the person to clean it up sanders suppressed a surge of anger yes i do he said in fact i think im the best possible person to do it as i said weve seen this kind of situation before and weve handled it before im close to all the people involved and i am sure we can resolve it he wondered how he could explain to these people in suits the reality of how products were made when youre working the cycles he said its sometimes not so serious to go back to the boards nobody likes to do it but it may have advantages in the old days we made a complete generation of new products every year or so now more and more we also make incremental changes within generations if we have to redo the chips we may be able to code in the video compression algorithms which werent available when we started that will enhance the enduser perception of speed by more than the simple drive specs we wont go back to build a hundredmillisecond drive well go back to build an eightymillisecond drive but nichols said in the meantime you wont have entered the market no thats true you wont have established your brand name or established market share for your product stream you wont have your dealerships or your oems or your ad campaign because you wont have a product line to support it you may have a better drive but itll be an unknown drive youll be starting from scratch all true but the market responds fast and so does the competition where will sony be by the time you get to market will they be at eighty milliseconds too i dont know sanders said nichols sighed i wish i had more confidence about where we are on this thing to say nothing of whether were properly staffed to fix it meredith spoke for the first time i may be a little bit at fault here she said when you and i spoke about twinkle tom i understood you to say that the problems were quite serious they are yes well i dont think we want to be covering anything up here he said quickly im not covering anything up the words came out almost before he realized it he heard his voice highpitched tight no no meredith said soothingly i didnt mean to suggest you were its just that these technical issues are hard for some of us to grasp were looking for a translation into laymans terms of just where we are if you can do that for us ive been trying to do that he said he knew he sounded defensive but he couldnt help it yes tom i know you have meredith said her voice still soothing but for example if the laser readwrite heads are cut of sync with the msubset instructions off the controller chip what is that going to mean for us in terms of down time she was just grandstanding demonstrating her facility with techtalk but her words threw him off balance anyway because the laser heads were readonly not readwrite and they had nothing to do with the msubset off the controller chip the position controls all came off the xsubset and the xsubset was licensed code from sony part of the driver code that every company used in their cd drives to answer without embarrassing her he had to move into fantasy where nothing he could say was true well he said you raise a good point meredith but i think the msubset should be a relatively simple problem assuming the laser heads are tracking to tolerance perhaps three or four days to fix he glanced quickly at cherry and lewyn the only people in the room who would know that sanders had just spoken gibberish both men nodded sagely as they listened cherry even rubbed his chin johnson said and do you anticipate a problem with the asynchronous tracking signals from the mother board again she was mixing everything up the tracking signals came from the power source and were regulated by the controller chip there wasnt a mother board in the drive units but by now he was in the swing he answered quickly thats certainly a consideration meredith and we should check it thoroughly i expect well find that the asynchronous signals may be phaseshifted but nothing more than that a phaseshift is easy to repair yes i think so nichols cleared his throat i feel this is an inhouse technical issue he said perhaps we should move on to other matters whats next on the agenda garvin said weve scheduled a demo of the video compression just down the hall fine lets do that chairs scraped back everyone stood up and they filed out of the room meredith was slower to close up her files sanders stayed behind for a moment too when they were alone he said what the hell was all that about all what all that gobbledygook about controller chips and read heads you dont know what you were talking about oh yes i do she said angrily i was fixing the mess that you made she leaned over the table and glared at him look tom i decided to take your advice last night and tell the truth about the drive this morning i said there were severe problems with it that you were very knowledgeable and you would tell them what the problems were i set it up for you to say what you told me you wanted to say but then you came in and announced there were no problems of significance but i thought we agreed last night these men arent fools and were not going to be able to fool them she snapped her briefcase shut i reported in good faith what you told me and then you said i didnt know what i was talking about he bit his lip trying to control his anger i dont know what you think is going on here she said these men dont care about technical details they wouldnt know a drive head from a dildo theyre just looking to see if anybodys in charge if anybody has a handle on the problems they want reassurance and you didnt reassure them so i had to jump in and fix it with a lot of technobullshit i had to clean up after you i did the best i could but lets face it you didnt inspire confidence today tom not at all goddamn it he said youre just talking about appearances corporate appearances in a corporate meeting but in the end somebody has to actually build the damn drive ill say and ive been running this division for eight years and running it damn well meredith garvin stuck his head in the door they both stopped talking were waiting meredith he said he turned and looked coldly at sanders she picked up her briefcase and swept out of the room sanders went immediately downstairs to blackburns office i need to see phil sandra his assistant sighed hes pretty busy today i need to see him now let me check tom she buzzed the inner office phil its tom sanders she listened a moment he says go right in sanders went into blackburns office and closed the door blackburn stood up behind his desk and ran his hands down his chest tom im glad you came down they shook hands briefly it isnt working out with meredith sanders said at once he was still angry from his encounter with her yes i know i dont think i can work with her blackburn nodded i know she already told me oh whatd she tell you she told me about the meeting last night tom sanders frowned he couldnt imagine that she had discussed that meeting last night she told me that you sexually harassed her i what now tom dont get excited merediths assured me shes not going to press charges we can handle it quietly in house that will be best for everyone in fact ive just been going over the organization charts and wait a minute sanders said shes saying i harassedher blackburn stared at him tom weve been friends a long time i can assure you this doesnt have to be a problem it doesnt have to get around the company your wife doesnt need to know as i said we can handle this quietly to the satisfaction of everyone involved wait a minute its not true tom just give me a minute here please the most important thingnow is for us to separate the two of you so you arent reporting to her i think a lateral promotion for you would be ideal lateral promotion yes theres an opening for technical vice president in the cellular division in austin i want to transfer you there youll go with the same seniority salary and benefit package everything the same except youll be in austin and you wont have to have any direct contact with her how does that sound austin yes cellular yes beautiful weather nice working conditions university town chance to get your family out of this rain sanders said but conleys going to sell off austin blackburn sat down behind his desk i cant imagine where you heard that tom he said calmly its completely untrue you sure about that absolutely believe me selling austin is the last thing theyd do why it makes no sense at all they why are they inventorying the plant im sure theyre going over the whole operation with a finetooth comb look tom conleys worried about cash flow after the acquisition and the austin plant is as you know very profitable weve given them the figures now theyre verifying them making sure theyre real but theres no chance they would sell it cellular is only going to grow tom you know that and thats why i think a vice presidency there in austin is an excellent career opportunity for you to consider but id be leaving the advanced products division well yes the whole point would be to move you out of this division and then i wouldnt be in the new company when it spins off thats true sanders paced back and forth thats completely unacceptable well lets not be hasty blackburn said lets consider all the ramifications phil he said i dont know what she told you but she told me the whole story but i think you should know and i want you to know tom blackburn said that i dont have any judgment about what may have happened thats not my concern or my interest im just trying to solve a difficult problem for the company phil listen i didnt do it i understand thats probably how you feel but i didnt harass her she harassed me im sure blackburn said it may haveteemedlike that to you at the time but phil im telling you she did everything but rape me he paced angrily philtheharassedme blackburn sighed and sat back in his chair he tapped his pencil on the corner of his desk i have to tell you frankly tom i find that difficult to believe its what happened merediths a beautiful woman tom a very vital sexy woman i think its natural for a man to uh lose control phil you arent hearing me she harassed me blackburn gave a helpless shrug i hear you tom i just i find that difficult to picture well she did you want to hear what really happened last night well blackburn shifted in his chair of course i want to hear your version but the thing is tom meredith johnson is very well connected in this company she has impressed a lot of extremely important people you mean garvin not only garvin meredith has built a power base in several areas conleywhite blackburn nodded yes there too you dont want to hear what i say happened of course i do blackburn said running his hands through his hair absolutely i do and i want to be scrupulously fair but im trying to tell you that no matter what were going to have to make some transfers here and meredith has important allies so it doesnt matter what i say blackburn frowned watching him pace i understand that you are upset i can see that and youre a valued person in this company but what im trying to do here tom is to get you to look at the situation what situation sanders said blackburn sighed were there any witnesses last night no so its your word against hers i guess so in other words its a pissing match so thats no reason to assume im wrong and shes right of course not blackburn said but look at the situation a man claiming sexual harassment against a woman is well pretty unlikely i dont think theres ever been a case in this company it doesnt mean it couldnt happen but it does means that itd be very uphill for you even if meredith wasnt so well connected he paused i just dont want to see you get hurt in this ive already been hurt again were talking about feelings here conflicting claims and unfortunately tom no witnesses he rubbed his nose tugged at his lapels you move me out of the apd and im hurt because i wont get to be part of the new company the company i worked on for twelve years thats an interesting legal position blackburn said im not talking about a legal position im talking about look tom let me review this with garvin meanwhile why dont you go off and think this austin offer over think about it carefully because no one wins in a pissing match you may hurt meredith but youll hurt yourself much more thats my concern here as your friend if you were my friend sanders began i am your friend blackburn said whether you know it at this moment or not he stood up behind his desk you dont need this splashed all over the papers your wife doesnt need to hear about this or your kids you dont need to be the gossip of bainbridge for the rest of the summer that isnt going to do you any good at all i understand that but but we have to face reality tom blackburn said the company is faced with conflicting claims whats happened has happened we have to go on from here and all im saying is id like to resolve this quickly so think it over please and get back to me after sanders left blackburn called garvin i just talked with him he told garvin and he says it was the other way around that she harassed him christ garvin said what a mess yes but on the other hand its what youd expect him to say blackburn said its the usual response in these cases the man always denies it yeah well this is dangerous phil i understand i dont want this thing to blow up on us no no theres nothing more important right now than getting this thing resolved i understand bob you made him the austin offer yes hes thinking it over will he take it my guess is no and did you push it well i tried to convey to him that we werent going to back down on meredith that we were going to support her through this damn right we are garvin said i think he was clear about that so lets see what he says when he comes back to us he wouldnt go off and file would he hes too smart for that we hope garvin said irritably and hung up look at thesituation sanders stood in pioneer park and leaned against a pillar staring at the light drizzle he was replaying the meeting with blackburn blackburn hadnt even been willing to listen to sanderss version he hadnt let sanders tell him blackburn already knew what had happened shes a very sexy woman its natural for a man to lose control that was what everyone at digicom would think every single person in the company would have that view of what had happened blackburn had said he found it difficult to believe that sanders had been harassed others would find it difficult too blackburn had told him it didnt matter what happened blackburn was telling him that johnson was well connected and that nobody would believe a man had been harassed by a woman look at thesituation they were asking him to leave seattle leave the apg no options no big payoff no return for his twelve long years of work all that was gone austin baking hot dry brandnew susan would never accept it her practice in seattle was successful she had spent many years building it they had just finished remodeling the house the kids liked it here if sanders even suggested a move susan would be suspicious shed want to know what was behind it and sooner or later she would find out if he accepted the transfer he would be confirming his guilt to his wife no matter how he thought about it how he tried to put it together in his mind sanders could see no good outcome he was being screwed im your friend tom whether you know it right now or not he recalled the moment at his wedding when blackburn his best man said he wanted to dip susans ring in olive oil because there was always a problem about getting it on the finger blackburn in a panic in case some little moment in the ceremony went wrong that was phil always worried about appearances your wife doesnt need to hear about this but phil was screwing him phil and garvin behind him they were both screwing him sanders had worked hard for the company for many years but now they didnt give a damn about him they were taking merediths side without any question they didnt even want to hear his version of what had happened as sanders stood in the rain his sense of shock slowly faded and with it his sense of loyalty he started to get angry he took out his phone and placed a call mr perrys office its tom sanders calling im sorry mr perry is in court can i give him a message maybe you could help me the other day he mentioned that you have a woman there who handles sexual harassment cases we have several attorneys who do that mr sanders he mentioned a hispanic woman he was trying to remember what else perry had said about her something about being sweet and demure he couldnt recall for sure that would be ms fernandez i wonder if you could connect me sanders said fernandezs office was small her desk stacked high with papers and legal briefs in neat piles a computer terminal in the corner she stood up as he came in you must be mr sanders she was a tall woman in her thirties with straight blond hair and a handsome aquiline face she was dressed in a pale creamcolored suit she had a direct manner and a firm handshake im louise fernandez how can i help you she wasnt at all what he had expected she wasnt sweet and demure at all and certainly not hispanic he was so startled that without thinking he said youre not what i expected she raised an eyebrow my fathers from cuba we left there when i was a child please sit down mr sanders she turned and walked back around her desk he sat down feeling embarrassed anyway thank you for seeing me so quickly not at all youre john perrys friend yes he mentioned the other day that you uh specialized in these cases i do labor law primarily constructive termination and title vii suits i see he felt foolish that he had come he was taken aback by her brisk manner and elegant appearance in fact she reminded him very much of meredith he felt certain that she would not be sympathetic to his case she put on hornrimmed glasses and peered at him across the desk have you eaten i can get you a sandwich if you like im not hungry thanks she pushed a halfeaten sandwich to the side of her desk im afraid i have a court appearance in an hour sometimes things get a bit rushed she got out a yellow legal pad and set it before her her movements were quick decisive sanders watched her sure she was the wrong person he should never have come here it was all a mistake he looked around the office there was a neat stack of bar charts for a courtroom appearance fernandez looked up from the pad her pen poised it was one of those expensive fountain pens would you like to tell me the situation uh im not sure where to begin we could start with your full name and address and your age thomas robert sanders he gave his address and your age fortyone occupation im a division manager at digital communications the advanced products division how long have you been at that company twelve years uhhuh and in your present capacity eight years and why are you here today mr sanders ive been sexually harassed uhhuh she showed no surprise her expression was completely neutral you want to tell me the circumstances my boss ah came on to me and the name of your boss meredith johnson is that a man or a woman a woman uhhuh again no sign of surprise she continued making notes steadily the pen scratching when did this happen last night what were the exact circumstances he decided not to mention the merger she has just been appointed my new boss and we had several things to go over she asked if we could meet at the end of the day she requested this meeting yes and where did the meeting take place in her office at six oclock anybody else present no her assistant came in briefly at the start of the meeting then left before anything happened i see go on we talked for a while about business and we had some wine she had gotten some wine and then she came on to me i was over by the window and suddenly she started kissing me then pretty soon we were sitting on the couch and then she started uh he hesitated how much detail do you want just the broad strokes for now she bit her sandwich you say you were kissing yes and she initiated this yes what was your reaction when she did that i was uncomfortable im married uhhuh what was the general atmosphere in the meeting prior to this kiss it was a regular business meeting we were talking about business but all the time she was making uh suggestive remarks like what oh about how good i looked how i was in shape how glad she was to see me how glad she was to see you fernandez repeated with a puzzled look yes we knew each other before you had a prior relationship yes when was that ten years ago and were you married then no did you both work for the same company at that time no i did but she worked for another company and how long did your relationship last about six months and have you kept up contact no not really any contact at all once intimate no just you know hello in the hallway at the office i see in the last eight years have you ever been to her house or apartment no dinners drinks after work anything no i really havent seen her at all when she joined the company she was in cupertino in operations i was in seattle in advanced products we didnt have much contact so during this time she wasnt your superior no give me a picture of ms johnson how old thirtyfive would you characterize her as attractive yes very attractive she was a miss teenage something as a kid so you would say shes very attractive the pen scratched on the legal pad yes and how about other menwould you say they find her very attractive yes what about her manner with regard to sexual matters does she make jokes sexual jokes innuendoes ribald comments no never body language flirtatious does she touch people not really she certainly knows shes goodlooking and she can play on that but her manner is kind of cool shes the grace kelly type they say grace kelly was very sexually active that she had affairs with most of her leading men i wouldnt know uhhuh what about ms johnson does she have affairs inside the company i wouldnt know i havent heard anything fernandez flipped to a new page on her pad all right and how long has she been your supervisor or is she your supervisor yes she is one day for the first time fernandez looked surprised she glanced at him and took another bite of her sandwich one day yes yesterday was the first day of a new company organization she had just been appointed so the day she is appointed she meets with you in the evening yes all right you were telling me you were sitting on the couch and she was kissing you and what happened then she unzippedwell first of all she started rubbing me your genitals yes and kissing me he found himself sweating he wiped his forehead with his hand i understand this is difficult ill try to make this as brief as possible fernandez said and then then she unzipped my pants and started rubbing me with her hand was your penis exposed yes who exposed it she took it out so she took your penis out of your pants and then rubbed it with her hand is that right she peered at him over her glasses and for a moment he glanced away in embarrassment but when he looked back at her he saw that she was not the least embarrassed that her manner was more than clinical more than professionalthat she was in some deep way detached and very cold yes he said thats what happened and what was your reaction well he gave an embarrassed shrug it worked you were sexually aroused yes did you say anything to her like what im just asking whether you said anything to her like what i dont know did you say anything at all i said something i dont know i was feeling very uncomfortable do you remember what you said i think i just kept saying meredith trying to get her to stop you know but she kept interrupting me or kissing me did you say anything else besides meredith i dont remember how did you feel about what she was doing i felt uncomfortable why i was afraid of getting involved with her because she was my boss now and because i was married now and i didnt want any complications in my life you know an office affair why not fernandez asked the question took him aback why not yes she looked at him directly her eyes cool appraising after all youre alone with a beautiful woman why not have an affair jesus its a question most people would ask im married so what married people have affairs all the time well he said for one thing my wife is a lawyer and very suspicious do i know her her name is susan handler shes with lyman king fernandez nodded ive heard of her so you were afraid that she would find out sure i mean you have an affair in the office and everybodys going to know there isnt any way to keep it quiet so you were concerned about this becoming known yes but that wasnt the main reason what was the main reason she was my boss i didnt like the position i was in she was you know well she had the right to fire me if she wanted to so it was likei hadto do it i was very uncomfortable did you tell her that i tried how did you try well i just tried would you say that you indicated to her that her advances were not welcome eventually yes how is that well eventually we continued this whatever you call it foreplay or whatever and she had her panties off and im sorry how did she come to have her panties off i took them off did she ask you to do that no but i got pretty worked up at one point i was going to do it or at least i was thinking about doing it you were going to have intercourse her voice again cool the pen scratching yes you were a willing participant for a while there yes in what way were you a willing participant she asked what i mean is did you initiate touching her body or breast or genitals without her encouragement i dont know she was pretty much encouraging everything i am asking did you volunteer did you do it on your own or did she for example take your hand and place it on her no i did it on my own what about your earlier reservations i was worked up excited i didnt care at that point all right go on he wiped his forehead im being very honest with you thats exactly what you should be its the best thing all around please go on and she was lying on the couch with her skirt pulled up and she wanted me to enter her to and she was sort of moaning you know saying no no and suddenly i had this feeling again that i didnt want to do this so i said okay lets not and i got off the couch and started getting dressed you broke off from the encounter yourself yes because she had said no no that was just an excuse because i was feeling uneasy at that point uhhuh so you got off the couch and started to get dressed yes and did you say anything at that time to explain your actions yes i said that i didnt think this was a good idea and i didnt feel good about it and how did she respond she got very angry she started throwing things at me then she started hitting me and scratching me do you have any marks yes where are they on my neck and chest have they been photographed yet no all right now when she scratched you how did you respond i just tried to get dressed and get out of there you didnt respond directly to her attack well at one point i pushed her back to get her away from me and she tripped on a table and fell on the floor you make it sound like pushing her was selfdefense on your part it was she was ripping the buttons off my shirt i had to go home and i didnt want my wife to see my shirt so i pushed her away did you ever do anything that was not selfdefense no did you hit her at any time no youre sure about that yes all right what happened then she threw a wineglass at me but by then i was pretty much dressed i went and got my phone from her windowsill and then i went im sorry you got your phone what phone is that i had a cellular phone he took it out of his pocket and showed her we all carry them in the company because we make them and i had been using the phone to make a call from her office when she started kissing me were you in the middle of a call when she started kissing you yes whom were you talking to an answering machine i see she was clearly disappointed go on please so i went and got my phone and got the hell out of there she was screaming that i couldnt do this to her that she would kill me and you responded how nothing i just left and this was at what time about six fortyfive did anybody see you leave the cleaning lady do you happen to know her name no ever seen her before no do you think she worked for your company she had a company uniform on you know for the maintenance firm that cleans up our offices uhhuh and then he shrugged i went home did you tell your wife what happened no did you tell anybody what happened no why not i guess i was in shock she paused and looked back over her notes all right you say you were sexually harassed and you have described a very direct overture by this woman since she was your boss i would have thought youd feel yourself at some risk in turning her down well i was concerned sure but i mean dont i have the right to turn her down isnt that what this is about certainly you have that right im asking about your state of mind i was very upset yet you did not want to tell anybody what had happened you did not want to share this upsetting experience with a colleague a friend a family member perhaps a brother anybody at all no it didnt even occur to me i didnt know how to deal with what i guess i was in shock i just wanted it to go away i wanted to think it had never happened did you make any notes no all right now you mentioned that you didnt tell your wife would you say you concealed it from your wife he hesitated yes do you often conceal things from her no but in this instance you know involving an old girlfriend i didnt think she would be sympathetic i didnt want to deal with her about this have you had other affairs this wasnt an affair im asking a general question in terms of your relationship to your wife no i havent had affairs all right i advise you to tell your wife at once make a full and complete disclosure because i promise you that she will find out if she hasnt done so already however difficult it may be to tell her your best chance to preserve your relationship is to be completely honest with her okay now going back to last night what happened next meredith johnson called the house and spoke to my wife fernandezs eyebrows went up i see did you expect that to happen god no it scared the hell out of me but apparently she was friendly and just called to say that the morning meeting was rescheduled for eightthirty today see but when i got to work today i found that the meeting had actually been scheduled for eight so you arrived late and were embarrassed and so on yes and you believe that it was a setup yes fernandez glanced at her watch im afraid im running out of time bring me up to date about what happened today quickly if you can without mentioning conleywhite he described the morning meeting briefly and his subsequent humiliation his argument with meredith his conversation with phil blackburn the offer of a lateral transfer the fact that the transfer would deny him the benefits of a possible spinoff his decision to seek advice fernandez asked few questions and wrote steadily finally she pushed the yellow pad aside all right i think i have enough to get the picture youre feeling slighted and ignored and your question is do you have a harassment case yes he said nodding well arguably you do its a jury case and we dont know what would happen if we went to trial but based on what you have told me here i have to advise you that your case is not strong sanders felt stunned jesus i dont make the law im just telling you frankly so you can arrive at an informed decision your situation is not good mr sanders fernandez pushed back from her desk and began to stuff papers into her briefcase i have five minutes but let me review for you what sexual harassment actually is under the law because many clients arent clear about it title vii of the civil rights act of made sex discrimination in the workplace illegal but as a practical matter what we call sexual harassment was not defined for many years since the middle nineteeneighties the equal employment opportunities commission has under title vii produced guidelines to define sexual harassment in the last few years these eeoc guidelines have been further clarified by case law so the definitions are quite explicit according to the law for a complaint to qualify as sexual harassment the behavior must contain three elements first it must be sexual that means for example that making a profane or scatological joke is not sexual harassment even though a listener may find it offensive the conduct must be sexual in nature in your case theres no doubt about the explicitly sexual element from what you have told me okay second the behavior must be unwelcome the courts distinguish between behavior that is voluntary and behavior that is welcome for example a person may be having a sexual relationship with a superior and its obviously voluntaryno ones holding a gun to the persons head but the courts understand that the employee may feel that they have no choice but to comply and therefore the sexual relationship was not freely entered intoits not welcome to determine if behavior is really unwelcome the courts look at the surrounding behavior in broad terms did the employee make sexual jokes in the workplace and thus indicate that such jokes from others were welcome did the employee routinely engage in sexual banter or sexual teasing with other employees if the employee engaged in an actual affair did they allow the supervisor into their apartment did they visit the supervisor in the hospital or see them at times when they didnt strictly have to or engage in other actions that would suggest that they were actively and willingly participating in the relationship in addition the courts look to see if the employee ever told the supervisor the behavior was unwelcome if the employee complained to anyone else about the relationship or tried to take any action to evade the unwelcome situation that consideration becomes more significant when the employee is highly placed and presumably more free to act but i didnt tell anybody no and you didnt tell her either at least not explicitly so far as i can determine i didnt feel i could i understand you didnt but its a problem for your case now the third element in sexual harassment is discrimination on the basis of gender the most common is quid pro quothe exchange of sexual favors in return for keeping your job or getting a promotion the threat of that may be explicit or implied i believe you said it was your understanding that ms johnson had the ability to fire you yes how did you gain that understanding phil blackburn told me explicitly yes and what about ms johnson did she make any offer contingent on sex did she make any reference to her ability to fire you in the course of the evening not exactly but it was there it was always in the air how did you know she said things like as long as were working together we might as well have a little fun and she talked about wanting to have an affair during company trips we would make together to malaysia and so on you interpreted this as an implied threat to your job i interpreted it to mean that if i wanted to get along with her i had better go along with her and you didnt want to do that no did you say so i said i was married and that things had changed between us well under most circumstances that exchange alone would probably serve to establish your case if there were witnesses but there werent no now there is a final consideration which we call hostile working environment this is ordinarily invoked in situations where an individual is harassed in a pattern of incidents that may not in themselves be sexual but that cumulatively amount to harassment based on gender i dont believe you can claim hostile work environment on this single incident i see unfortunately the incident you describe is simply not as clearcut as it might be we would then turn to ancillary evidence of harassment for example if you were fired i think in effect i have been fired sanders said because im being pulled out of the division and i wont get to participate in the spinoff i understand but the companys offer to transfer you laterally makes things complicated because the company can arguevery successfullv i thinkthat it does not owe you anything more than a lateral transfer that it has never promised you the golden egg of a spinoff that such a spinoff is in any case speculative intended to occur at some future time and it might never happen that the company is not required to compensate you for your hopesfor some vague expectation of a future that might never occur and therefore the company will claim that a lateral transfer is fully acceptable and that you are being unreasonable if you turn it down that you are in effect quitting not being fired it will place the burden back on you thats ridiculous actually its not suppose for example you found out that you had terminal cancer and were going to die in six months would the company be required to pay the proceeds of the spinoff to your survivors clearly no if youre working in the company when it spins off you participate if youre not you dont the company has no broader obligation youre saying i might as well have cancer no im saying that youre angry and you feel the company owes you something that the court will not agree it does in my experience sexual harassment claims often have this quality people come in feeling angry and wronged and they think they have rights that they simply dont have he sighed would it be different if i were a woman basically no even in the most clearcut situationsthe most extreme and outrageous situationssexual harassment is notoriously difficult to prove most cases occur as yours has behind closed doors with no witnesses its one persons word against anothers in that circumstance where there is no clearcut corroborating evidence there is often a prejudice against the man uhhuh even so onefourth of all sexual harassment cases are brought by men most of those are brought against male bosses but onefifth are brought against women and the number is increasing all the time as we have more women bosses in the workplace i didnt know that it isnt much discussed she said peering over her glasses but its happening and from my point of view its to be expected why do you say that harassment is about powerthe undue exercise of power by a superior over a subordinate i know theres a fashionable point of view that says women are fundamentally different from men and that women would never harass an employee but from where i sit ive seen it all ive seen and heard everything that you can imagine and a lot that you wouldnt believe if i told you that gives me another perspective personally i dont deal much in theory i have to deal with the facts and on the basis of facts i dont see much difference in the behavior of men and women at least nothing that you can rely on then you believe my story whether i believe you is not at issue whats at issue is whether you realistically have a case and therefore what you should do in your circumstances i can tell you that ive heard it all before youre not the first man ive been asked to represent you know what do you advise me to do i cant advise you fernandez said briskly the decision you face is much too difficult i can only lay out the situation she pushed her intercom button bob tell richard and eileen to bring the car around ill meet them in front of the building she turned back to sanders let me review your problems she said she ticked them off on her fingers one you claim that you got into an intimate situation with a younger very attractive woman but you turned her down in the absence of witnesses or corroborating evidence that isnt going to be an easy story to sell to a jury two if you bring a lawsuit the company will fire you youre looking at three years before you come to trial you have to think about how youll support yourself during that time about how youll make your house payments and your other expenses i might take you on a contingency basis but youll still have to pay all direct costs throughout the trial that will be a minimum of one hundred thousand dollars i dont know whether youll want to mortgage your house to pay for it but it has to be dealt with three a lawsuit will bring all this out into the open itll be in the papers and on the evening news for years before the trial begins i cant adequately describe how destructive an experience that isfor you and for your wife and family many families dont survive the pretrial period intact there are divorces suicides illnesses its very difficult four because of theoffer oflateral transfer its not clear what we can claim as damages the company will claim that you have no case and well have to fight it but even with a stunning victory you may end up with only a couple of hundred thousand dollars after expenses and fees and three years of your life and of course the company can appeal delaying payment further five if you bring a lawsuit youll never work in this industry again i know its not supposed to work that way but as a practical matter i never be hired for another thats how it goes it would you be one thing if you were fiftyfive but youre only fortyone i dont know if you want to make that choice at this point in your life jesus he slumped back in the chair im sorry but these are the facts of litigation but its so unjust she put on her raincoat unfortunately the law has nothing to do with justice mr sanders she said its merely a method for dispute resolution she snapped her briefcase shut and extended her hand im sorry mr sanders i wish it were different please feel free to call me again if you have any further questions she hurried out of the office leaving him sitting there after a moment the assistant came in can i do anything for you no sanders said shaking his head slowly no i was just leaving in the car driving to the courthouse louise fernandez recounted sanderss story to the two junior lawyers traveling with her one lawyer a woman said you dont really believe him who knows fernandez said it was behind closed doors theres never a way to know the young woman shook her head i just cant believe a woman would act that way so aggressively why not fernandez said suppose this wasnt a case of harassment suppose this was a question of implied promise between a man and a woman the man claims that behind closed doors he was promised a big bonus but the woman denies it would you assume that the man was lying because a woman wouldnt act that way not about that no in that situation youd think that anything was possible but this isnt a contract the woman said this is sexual behavior so you think women are unpredictable in their contractual arrangements but stereotypical in their sexual arrangements the woman said i dont know if stereotypical is the word id use you just said that you cant believe a woman would act aggressively in sex isnt that a stereotype well no the woman said its not a stereotype because its true women are different from men when it comes to sex and black people have rhythm fernandez said asians are workaholics and hispanics dont confront but this is different i mean there are studies about this men and women dont even talk to each other the same way oh you mean like the studies that show that women are less good at business and strategic thinking no those studies are wrong i see those studies are wrong but the studies about sexual differences are right well sure because sex is fundamental its a primal drive i dont see why its used for all sorts of purposes as a way of relating a way of placating a way of provoking as an offer as a weapon as a threat it can be quite complicated the ways sex is used havent you found that to be true the woman crossed her arms i dont think so speaking for the first time the young man said so whatd you tell this guy not to litigate no but i told him his problems what do you think he should do i dont know fernandez said but i know what he should have done what its terrible to say it she said but in the real world with no witnesses alone in the office with his boss he probably should have shut up and fucked her because right now that poor bastard has no options at all if hes not careful his life is over sanders walked slowly back down the hill toward pioneer square the rain had stopped but the afternoon was still damp and gray the wet pavement beneath his feet sloped steeply downward around him the tops of the skyscrapers disappeared into the lowhanging chilly mist he was not sure what he had expected to hear from louise fernandez but it was certainly not a detailed account of the possibility of his being fired mortgaging his house and never working again sanders felt overwhelmed by the sudden turn that his life had taken and by a realization of the precariousness of his existence two days ago he was an established executive with a stable position and a promising future now he faced disgrace humiliation loss of his job all sense of security had vanished he thought of all the questions fernandez had asked himquestions that had never occurred to him before why hadnt he told anyone why hadnt he made notes why hadnt he told meredith explicitly that her advances were unwelcome fernandez operated in a world of rules and distinctions that he did not understand that had never crossed his mind and now those distinctions turned out to be vitally important your situation is not good mrsanders and yet how could he have prevented this what should he have done instead he considered the possibilities suppose he had called blackburn right after the meeting with meredith and had told him in detail that meredith had harassed him he could have called from the ferry lodged his complaint before she lodged hers would it have made a difference what would blackburn have done he shook his head thinking about it it seemed unlikely that anything would make a difference because in the end meredith was tied in to the power structure of the company in a way that sanders was not meredith was a corporate player she had power allies that was the message the final messageof this situation sanders didnt count he was just a technical guy a cog in the corporate wheels his job was to get along with his new boss and he had failed to do that whatever he did now was just whining or worse ratting on the boss whistleblowing and nobody liked a whistleblower so what could he have done as he thought about it he realized that he couldnt have called blackburn right after the meeting because his cellular phone had gone dead its power drained he had a sudden image of a cara manand awoman in a car driving to a party somebody had told him something once a story about some people in a car it teased him he couldnt quite get it there were plenty of reasons why the phone might be dead the most likely explanation was nicad memory the new phones used rechargeable nickelcadmium batteries and if they didnt completely discharge between uses the batteries could reset themselves at a shorter duration you never knew when it was going to show up sanders had had to throw out batteries before because they developed a short memory he took out his phone turned it on it glowed brightly the battery was holding up fine today but there was something driving ina car something he wasnt thinking about goingto a party he frowned he couldnt get it it hung at the back of his memory too dim to recover but it started him thinking what else wasnt he getting because as he considered the whole situation he began to have the nagging sense that there was something else that he was overlooking and he had the feeling that fernandez had overlooked it too something hadnt come up in her questions to him something that everybody was taking for granted even though meredith something about meredith she had accused him of harassment she had gone to blackburn and accused him the next morning why would she do that no doubt she felt guilty about what had happened at the meeting and perhaps she was afraid sanders would accuse her so she decided to accuse him first her accusation was understandable in that light but if meredith really had power it didnt make sense to raise the sexual issue at all she could just as easily have gone to blackburn and said listen it isnt working out with tom i cant deal with him we have to make a change and blackburn would have done it instead she had accused him of harassment and that must have been embarrassing to her because harassment implied a loss of control it meant that she had not been able to control her subordinate in a meeting even if something unpleasant did happen a boss would never mention it harassment is about power it was one thing if you were a lowly female assistant fondled by a stronger powerful man but in this case meredith was the boss she had all the power why would she claim harassment by sanders because the fact was subordinates didnt harass their bosses it just didnt happen youd have to be crazy to harass your boss harassment is about powerthe undue exerciseofpower by a superior over a subordinate for her to claim sexual harassment was in an odd way to admit that she was subordinate to sanders and she would never do that quite the contrary meredith was new to her job eager to prove that she was in control of the situation so her accusation made no senseunless she was using it as a convenient way to destroy him sexual harassment had the advantage of being a charge that was difficult to recover from you were presumed guilty until proven innocentand it was hard to prove innocence it tarnished any man no matter how frivolous the accusation in that sense harassment was a very powerful accusation the most powerful accusation she could make but then she said that she wasnt going to press charges and the question was why not sanders stopped on the street that was it she assured me shes not going to press charges why wasnt meredith going to press charges at the time that blackburn said that sanders had never questioned it louise fernandez had never questioned it but the fact was merediths refusal to press charges made no sense at all she had already accused him why not press it why not carry it to its conclusion maybe blackburn had talked her out of it blackburn was always so concerned about appearances but sanders didnt think that was what had happened because a formal accusation could still be handled quietly it could be processed inside the company and from merediths standpoint there were real advantages to a formal accusation sanders was popular at digicom he had been with the company a long time if her goal was to get rid of him to banish him to texas why not defuse the inevitable corporate grumbling by letting the accusation work its way through the company grapevine why not make it official the more sanders thought about it the more it seemed that there was only one explanation meredith wasnt going to press charges because she couldnt she couldnt because she had some other problem some other consideration something else was going on we can handle it quietly slowly sanders began to see everything differently in the meeting earlier that day blackburn hadnt been ignoring him or slighting him not at all blackburn was scrambling blackburn was scared we can handle it quietly its best for everyone what did he mean best for everyone what problem did meredith have what problem could she have the more sanders thought about it the moreitseemed that there could be only one possible reason why she wasnt pressing charges against him he took out his phone called united airlines and booked three roundtrip tickets to phoenix and then he called his wife ygoddamn son of a bitch susan said they were sitting in a corner table at terrazzo it was two oclock the restaurant was nearly deserted susan had listened to him for half an hour without interruption or comment he told her everything that had happened in his meeting with meredith and everything that had happened that morning the conleywhite meeting the conversation with phil the conversation with fernandez now he had finished she stared at him i could really learn to despise you you know that you son of a bitch why didnt you tell me she was your exgirlfriend i dont know he said i didnt want to go into it you didnt want to go into it adele and mary anne are talking to me on the phone all day and they know but i dont its humiliating tom well he said you know youve been upset a lot lately and cut the crap tom she said this has nothing to do with me you didnt tell me because you didnt want to susan thats not yes it is tom i was asking you about her last night you could have told me if you wanted to but you didnt she shook her head son of a bitch i cant believe what an asshole you are youve made a real mess of this do you realize what a mess this is yes he said hanging his head dont act contrite with me you asshole im sorry he said youre sorry fuck you youre sorry jesus christ i cant believe you what an asshole you spent the night with your goddamnedgirlfriend i didnt spend the night and shes not my girlfriend what do you mean she was your big heartthrob she wasnt my big heartthrob oh yeah then why wouldnt you tell me she shook her head just answer one question did you fuck her or not no i didnt she stared at him intently stirring her coffee youre telling me the truth yes nothing left out no inconvenient parts skipped no nothing then why would she accuse you what do you mean he said i mean there must be a reason she accused you you must have done something well i didnt i turned her down uhhuh sure she frowned at him you know this is not just about you tom this involves your whole family me and the kids i understand that why didnt you tell me if you told me last night i could have helped you then help me now well there isnt much we can do now susan said with heavy sarcasm not after shes gone to blackburn and made an accusation first now youre finished im not so sure trust me you havent got a move she said if you go to trial itll be living hell for at least three years and i personally dont think you can win youre a man bringing a charge of harassment against a woman theyll laugh you out of court maybe trust me they will so you cant go to trial what can you do move to austin jesus i keep thinking sanders said she accused me of harassment but now she isnt pressing charges and i keep thinking why isnt she pressing charges whocares susan said with an irritable wave of the hand it could be any of a million reasons corporate politics or phil talked her out of it or garvin it doesnt matter why tom face the factsyou have no move not now you stupid son of a bitch susan will you settle down fuck you tom youre dishonest and irresponsible susan weve been married five years i deserve better than this will you take it easy im trying to tell you i think i do have a move tom youdont i think i do because this is a very dangerous situation sanders said its dangerous for everybody what does that mean lets assume that louise fernandez told me the truth about my lawsuit she did shes a good lawyer but she wasnt looking at it from the companys standpoint she was looking at it from the plaintiffs standpoint yeah well youre a plaintiff no im not he said im apotentialplaintiff there was a moment of silence susan stared at him her eyes scanned his face she frowned he watched her put it together youre kidding no you must be out of your mind no look at the situation digicoms in the middle of a merger with a very conservative east coast company a company thats already pulled out of one merger because an employee had a little bad publicity supposedly this employee used some rough language while firing a temp secretary and then conleywhite pulled out theyre very skittish about publicity which means the last thing anybody at digicom wants is a sexual harassment suit against the new female vice president tom do you realize what youre saying yes he said if you do this theyre going to go crazy theyre going to try to destroy you i know have you talked to max about this maybe you should the hell with max hes a crazy old man id ask him because this isnt really your thing tom you were never a corporate infighter i dont know if you can pull this off i think i can itll be nasty in a day or so youre going to wish you had taken the austin job fuck it itll get reallymean tom youll lose your friends fuck it just so youre ready i am sanders looked at his watch susan i want you to take the kids and visit your mother for a few days her mother lived in phoenix if you go home now and pack you can make the eight oclock flight at seatac ive booked three seats for you she stared at him as if she were seeing a stranger youre really going to do this she said slowly yes i am oh boy she bent over picked up her purse from the floor and pulled out her day organizer he said i dont want you or the kids to be involved i dont want anybody pushing a news camera in their faces susan well just a minute she ran her finger down her appointments i can move that and conference call yes she looked up yes i can leave for a few days she glanced at her watch i guess i better hurry and pack he stood up and walked outside the restaurant with her it was raining the light on the street was gray and bleak she looked up at him and kissed him on the cheek good luck tom be careful he could see that she was frightened it made him frightened too ill be okay i love you she said and then she walked quickly away in the rain he waited for a moment to see if she looked back at him but she never did walking back to his office he suddenly realized how alone he felt susan was leaving with the kids he was on his own now he had imagined he would feel relieved free to act without restraint but instead he felt abandoned and at risk chilled he thrust his hands into the pockets of his raincoat he hadnt handled the lunch with susan well and she would be going off mulling over his answers why didnt you tell me he hadnt answered that well he hadnt been able to express the conflicting feelings he had experienced last night the unclean feeling and the guilt and the sense that he had somehow done something wrong even though he hadnt done anything wrong you could have told me he hadnt done anything wrong he told himself but then why hadnt he told her he had no answer to that he passed a graphics shop and a plumbing supply store with white porcelain fixtures in a window display you didnt tell me because you didnt want to but that made no sense why wouldnt he want to tell her once again his thoughts were interrupted by images from the past the white garter belt a bowl of popcorn the stainedglass flower on the door to his apartment cut the crap tom this has nothing to do with me blood in the white bathroom sink and meredith laughing about it why was she laughing he couldnt remember now it was just an isolated image a stewardess putting a tray of airline food in front of him a suitcase on the bed the television sound turned off the stainedglass flower in gaudy orange and purple have you talked to max she was right about that he thought he should talk to max and he would right after he gave blackburn the bad news sanders was back at his office at twothirty he was surprised to find blackburn there standing behind sanderss desk talking on his phone blackburn hung up looking a little guilty oh tom good im glad youre back he walked back around sanderss desk what have you decided ive thought this over very carefully sanders said closing the door to the hallway and ive decided to retain louise fernandez of marin howard to represent me blackburn looked puzzled to represent you yes in the event it becomes necessary to litigate litigate blackburn said on what basis would you litigate tom sexual harassment under title vii sanders said oh tom blackburn said making a mournful face that would be unwise that would be very unwise i urge you to reconsider ive reconsidered all day sanders said but the fact is meredith johnson harassed me she made advances to me and i turned her down now shes a woman scorned and she is being vindictive toward me im prepared to sue if it comes to that tom thats it phil thats whatll happen if you transfer me out of the division blackburn threw up his hands but what do you expect us to do transfer meredith yes sanders said or fire her thats the usual thing one does with a harassing supervisor but you forget shes accused you of harassment too shes lying sanders said but there are no witnesses tom no evidence either way you and she are both our trusted employees how do you expect us to decide who to believe thats your problem phil all i have to say is im innocent and im prepared to sue blackburn stood in the middle of the room frowning louise fernandez is a smart attorney i cant believe she recommended this course of action to you no this is my decision then its very unwise blackburn said you are putting the company in a very difficult position the company is putting me in a difficult position i dont know what to say phil said i hope this doesnt force us to terminate you sanders stared at him meeting his gaze evenly i hope not too he said but i dont have confidence that the company has takenmycomplaint seriously ill fill out a formal charge of sexual harassment with bill everts in hr later today and im asking louise to draw up the necessary papers to file with the state human rights commission christ she should file first thing tomorrow morning i dont see what the rush is theres no rush its just a filing to get the complaint on record im required to do that but this is very serious tom i know it phil id like to ask you to do me a favor as your friend whats that hold off the formal complaint at least with the hrc give us a chance to conduct an inhouse investigation before you take this outside but you arent conducting an inhouse investigation phil yes we are you didnt even want to hear my side of the story this morning you told me it didnt matter thats not true blackburn said you misunderstood me entirely of course it matters and i assure you we will hear your story in detail as part of our investigation i dont know phil sanders said i dont see how the company can be neutral on this issue it seems everything is stacked against me everybody believes meredith and not me i assure you that is not the case it certainly seems like it you told me this morning how well connected she is how many allies she has you mentioned that several times our investigation will be scrupulous and impartial but in any case it seems reasonable to ask you to wait for the outcome before filing with a state agency how long do you want me to wait thirty days sanders laughed but thats the standard time for a harassment investigation you could do it in a day if you wanted to but you must agree tom that were very busy right now with all the merger meetings thats your problem phil i have a different problem ive been unjustly treated by my superior and i feel i have a right as a longstanding senior employee to see my complaint resolved promptly blackburn sighed all right let me get back to you he said he hurried out of the room sanders slumped in his chair and stared into space it had begun fifteen minutes later blackburn met with garvin in the fifthfloor executive conference room also present at the meeting were stephanie kaplan and bill everts the head of human resources at digicom blackburn began the meeting by saying tom sanders has retained outside counsel and is threatening litigation over meredith johnson oh christ garvin said hes claiming sexual harassment garvin kicked the leg of the table that son of a bitch kaplan said what does he say happened i dont have all the details yet blackburn said but in essence he claims that meredith made sexual overtures to him in her office last night that he turned her down and that now she is being vindictive garvin gave a long sigh shit he said this is just what i didnt want to happen this could be adisaster i know bob stephanie kaplan said did she do it christ garvin said who knows in these situations thats always the question he turned to everts has sanders come to you about this not yet no i imagine he will we have to keep it inhouse garvin said thats essential essential kaplan said nodding phil has to make sure it stays inhouse im trying blackburn said but sanders is talking about filing tomorrow with the hrc thats a public filing yes how soon is it made public probably within fortyeight hours depending on how fast hrc does the paperwork christ garvin said fortyeight hours whats the matter with him doesnt he realize what hes doing blackburn said i think he does i think he knows exactly blackmail well pressure garvin said have you talked to meredith not since this morning somebodys got to talk to her ill talk to her but how are we going to stop sanders blackburn said i asked him to hold off the hrc filing pending our investigation for thirty days he said no he said we should be able to conduct our investigation in one day well he got that right garvin said for all kinds of reasons we damn well better conduct the investigation in one day bob i dont know if thats possible blackburn said we have significant exposure here the corporation is required by law to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation we cant appear to be rushed or oh for christs sake garvin said i dont want to hear this legal pissing and moaning what are we talking about two people right and no witnesses right so theres just two people how long does it take to interview two people well it may not be that simple blackburn said with a significant look ill tell you whats simple garvin said this is whats simple conleywhite is a company obsessed with its public image they sell textbooks to school boards that believe in noahs ark they sell magazines for kids they have a vitamin company they have a healthfood company that markets baby foods rainbow mush or something now conleywhites buying our company and in the middle of the acquisition a highprofile female executive the woman in line to become ceo within two years is accused of seeking sexual favors from a married man you know what theyre going to do if that gets out theyre going tobail you know that nichols is looking for any excuse to weasel out of this thing this is perfect for him christ but sanders has already questioned our impartiality blackburn said and im not sure how many people know about the ah prior questions that we quite a few kaplan said and didnt it come up at an officers meeting last year check the minutes garvin said we have no legal problem with current corporate officers is that right thats right blackburn said current corporate officers cannot be questioned or deposed on these matters and we havent lost any corporate officers in the last year nobody retired or moved no okay so fuck him garvin turned to everts bill i want you to go back through the hr records and look carefully at sanders see if hes dotted every i and crossed every t if he hasnt i want to know right everts said but my guess is hes clean all right garvin said lets assume that he is whats it going to take to make sanders go away what does he want blackburn said i think he wants his job bob he cant have his job well thats the problem blackburn said garvin snorted whats our liability assuming he ever got to trial i dont think he has a case based on what happened in that office our biggest liability would come from any perceived failure to respect due process and conduct a thorough investigation sanders could win on that alone if were not careful thats my point so well be careful fine now guys blackburn said i feel strongly obliged to insert a note of caution the extreme delicacy of this situation means that we have to be mindful of the details as pascal once said god is in the details and in this case the competing balance of legitimate legal claims forces me to admit its unclear precisely what our best phil garvin said cut the crap kaplan said mies blackburn said what mies van der rohe said god is in the details who gives a shit garvin said pounding the table the point is sanders has no case he just has us by the balls and he knows it blackburn winced i wouldnt phrase it exactly that way but but thats the fucking situation yes kaplan said toms smart you know a little naive but smart very smart garvin said remember i trained him taught him all he knows hes going to be a big problem he turned to blackburn get to the bottom line whatre we dealing with impartiality right yes and we want to move him out right okay will he accept mediation i dont know i doubt it why not ordinarily we only use mediation to resolve settlement packages for employees who are leaving so i think thats how hell view it lets try anyway tell him its nonbinding and see if we can get him to accept it on that basis give him three names and let him pick one mediate it tomorrow do i need to talk to him probably let me try first and you back up okay kaplan said of course if we go to an outside mediator we introduce an unpredictable element you mean the mediator could find against us ill take the risk garvin said the important thing is to get the thing resolved quietlyand fast i dont want ed nichols backpedaling on me we have a press conference scheduled for friday noon i want this issue dead and buried by then and i want meredith johnson announced as the new head of the division on friday everybody clear on whats going to happen they said they were then do it garvin said and walked out of the room blackburn hurried after him in the hallway outside garvin said to blackburn christ what a mess let me tell you im very unhappy i know blackburn said mournfully he was shaking his head sadly you really screwed the pooch on this one phil christ you could have handled this one better a lot better how what could i have done he says that she hustled him bob its a serious matter meredith johnson is vital to the success of this merger garvin said flatly yes bob of course we must keep her yes bob but we both know that in the past she has she has proven herself an outstanding piece of executive talent garvin said interrupting him i wont allow these ridiculous allegations to jeopardize her career blackburn was aware of garvins unswerving support of meredith for years garvin had had a blind spot for johnson whenever criticisms ofjohnson arose garvin would somehow change the subject shift to something else there was no reasoning with him but now blackburn felt he had to try bob he said merediths only human we know she has her limitations yes garvin said she has youth enthusiasm honesty unwillingness to play corporate games and of course shes a woman thats a real limitation being a woman but bob i tell you i cant stomach the excuses anymore garvin said we dont have women in high corporate positions here nobody does corporate america is rooms full of men and whenever i talk about putting a woman in theres always a but bob that comes up the hell with it phil weve got to break the glass ceiling sometime blackburn sighed garvin was shifting the subject again he said bob nobodys disagreeing with yes they are youre disagreeing phil youre giving me excuses why meredith isnt suitable and im telling you that if i had named some other woman thered be other excuses why that other woman isnt suitable and i tell you im tired of it blackburn said weve got stephanie weve got mary anne tokens garvin said with a dismissing wave sure let the cfo be a woman let a couple of the midrange execs be women throw the broads a bone the fact remains you cant tell me that a bright able young woman starting out in business isnt held back by a hundred littlereasons oh such goodreasons why she shouldnt be advanced why she shouldnt attain a major position of power but in the end its just prejudice and it has to stop we have to give these bright young women a decent opportunity blackburn said well bob i just think it would be prudent for you to get merediths view of this situation i will ill find out what the hell happened i know shell tell me but this thing still has to be resolved yes it does bob and i want you to be clear i expect you to do whatever is necessary to get it resolved okay bob whatever isnecessary garvin said put the pressure on sanders make sure he feels it rattle his cage phil okay bob ill deal with meredith you just take care of sanders i want you to rattle his fucking cage until hes black and blue bob meredith johnson stood at one of the center tables in the design group laboratory going over the tornapart twinkle drives with mark lewyn she came over when she saw garvin standing to one side i cant tell you how sorry i am about all this business with sanders were having some problems with it garvin said i keep going over what happened she said wondering what i should have done but he was angry and out of control he had too much to drink and he behaved badly not that we all havent done that at some time in our lives but she shrugged anyway im sorry apparently hes going to file a harassment charge thats unfortunate she said but i suppose its part of the patterntrying to humiliate me to discredit me with the people in the division i wont let that happen garvin said he resented my getting the job and he couldnt deal with having me as his superior he had to try and put me in my place some men are like that she shook her head sadly for all the talk about the new male sensibility im afraid very few men are like you bob garvin said my concern now meredith is that his filing may interfere with the acquisition i cant see why that would be a problem she said i think we can keep it under control its a problem if he files with the state hrc you mean hes going to gooutside she asked yes thats exactly what i mean meredith stared off into space for the first time she seemed to lose her composure she bit her lip that could be very awkward ill say ive sent phil to see him to ask if we can mediate with an experienced outside person someone like judge murphy im trying to arrange it for tomorrow fine meredith said i can clear my schedule for a couple of hours tomorrow but i dont know what we can expect to come out of it he wont admit what happened im sure and there isnt any record or any witnesses i wanted you to fill me in garvin said on exactly what did happen last night oh bob she sighed i blame myself every time i go over it you shouldnt i know but i do if my assistant hadnt gone off to rent her apartment i could have buzzed her in and none of this would have happened i think you better tell me meredith of course bob she leaned toward him and spoke quietly steadily for the next several minutes garvin stood beside her shaking his head angrily as he listened don cherry put his nikes up on lewyns desk yeah so garvin came in then what happened so garvins standing over there in the corner hopping up and down from one foot to the other the way he does waiting to be noticed he wont come over hes waiting to be noticed and merediths talking to me about the twinkle drive that i have spread all over the table and im showing her what weve found is wrong with the laser heads she gets all that yeah she seems okay shes not sanders but shes okay fast learner and better perfume than sanders cherry said yeah i like her perfume lewyn said anyway sanderss perfume leaves a lot to be desired yeah anyway pretty soon garvin gets tired of hopping and he gives a discreet little cough and meredith notices garvin and she goes oh with a little thrill in her voice you know that little sharp intake of breath uhoh cherry said are we talking humparoonie here or what well thats thething lewyn said she goes running over to him and he holds out his arms to her and i tell you it looks like that ad where the two lovers run toward each other in slow motion uhoh cherry said garvins wife is going to be pissed but thats the thing lewyn said when they finally get together standing there side by side it isnt that way at all theyre talking and shes sort of cooing and batting her eyes at him and hes such a tough guy he doesnt acknowledge it but its working on him shes seriously cute thats why cherry said i mean face it shes got an outstanding molded case with superior fit and finish but the thing is its not like lovers at all im staring trying not to stare and i tell you its not lovers its something else its almost like fatherdaughter don hey you can fuck your daughter millions do no you know what i think i think bob sees himself in her he sees something that reminds him of himself when he was younger some kind of energy or something and i tell you she plays it don he crosses his arms she crosses hers he leans against the wall she leans against the wall she matches him exactly and from a distance im telling you shelooks like him don no yes think about it itd have to be from avery long distance cherry said he took his feet off the table and got up to leave so whatre we saying here nepotism in disguise i dont know but merediths got some kind of rapport with him it isnt pure business hey cherry said nothings pure business i learned that one a long time ago louise fernandez came into her office and dropped her briefcase on the floor she thumbed through a stack of phone messages and turned to sanders whats going on i have three calls this afternoon from phil blackburn thats because i told him i had retained you as my attorney that i was prepared to litigate my claim and i uh suggested that you were filing with the hrc in the morning i couldnt possibly file tomorrow she said and i wouldnt recommend that we do so now in any event mr sanders i take false statements very seriously dont ever characterize my actions again im sorry he said but things are happening very fast just so we are clear i dont like it and if it happens again youll be looking for new counsel that coldness again the sudden coldness now so you told blackburn what was his response he asked me if i would mediate absolutely not fernandez said why not mediation is invariably to the benefit of the company he said it would be nonbinding even so it amounts to free discovery on their part theres no reason to give it to them and he said you could be present he said of course i can be present mr sanders thats no concession you must have an attorney present at all times or the mediation will be invalid here are the three names he gave me as possible mediators sanders passed her the list she glanced at it briefly the usual suspects one of them is better than the other two but i still dont he wants to do the mediation tomorrow tomorrow fernandez stared at him and sat back in her chair mr sanders im all for a timely resolution but this is ridiculous we cant be ready by tomorrow and as i said i dont recommend that you agree to mediate under any circumstances is there something here i dont know yes he said lets have it he hesitated she said any communication you make to me is privileged and confidential all right digicom is about to be acquired by a new york company called conleywhite so the rumors are true yes he said they intend to announce the merger at a press conference on friday and they intend to announce meredith johnson as the new vice president of the company on friday i see she said so thats phils urgency yes and your complaint presents an immediate and serious problem for him he nodded lets say it comes at a very sensitive time she was silent for a moment peering at him over her reading glasses mr sanders i misjudged you i had the impression you were a timid man theyre forcing me to do this are they she gave him an appraising look then she pushed the intercom button bob let me see my calendar i have to clear some things and ask herb and alan to come in tell them to drop whatever theyre doing this is more important she pushed the papers aside are all the mediators on this list available i assume so im going to request barbara murphy judge murphy you wont like her but shell do a better job than the others ill try and set it up for the afternoon if i can we need the time otherwise late morning you realize the risk youre taking i assume you do this is a very dangerous game youve decided to play she pushed the intercom bob cancel roger rosenberg cancel ellen at six remind me to call my husband and tell him i wont be home for dinner she looked at sanders neither will you do you need to call home my wife and kidsare leaving town tonight she raised her eyebrows you told her everything yes you are serious yes he said im serious good she said youre going to need to be lets be frank mr sanders what you have embarked upon is not strictly a legal procedure in essence youre playing the pressure points thats right between now and friday youre in a position to exert considerable pressure on your company thats right and they on you mr sanders they on you he found himself in a conference room facing five people all taking notes seated on either side of fernandez were two young lawyers a woman named eileen and a man named richard then there were two investigators alan and herb one tall and handsome the other chubby with a pockmarked face and a camera hanging around his neck fernandez made sanders go over his story again in greater detail she paused frequently to ask questions noting down times names and specific details the two lawyers never said anything although sanders had the strong impression that the young woman was unsympathetic to him the two investigators were also silent except at specific points after sanders mentioned merediths assistant alan the handsome one said her name again betsy ross like in the flag shes on the fifth floor yes what time does she go home last night she left at sixfifteen i may want to meet her casually can i go up to the fifth floor no all visitors are stopped at reception in the downstairs lobby what if im delivering a package would betsy take delivery of a package no packages go to central receiving okay what about flowers would they be delivered directly yes i guess so you mean like flowers for meredith yes alan said i guess you could deliver those in person fine alan said and made a note they stopped him a second time when he mentioned the cleaning woman he had seen on leaving merediths office digicom uses a cleaning service yes amsamerican management services theyre over on we know them on boyle what time do the cleaning crews enter the building usually around seven and this woman you didnt recognize describe her about forty black very slender gray hair sort of curly tall short what he shrugged medium herb said thats not much can you give us anything else sanders hesitated he thought about it no i didnt really see her close your eyes fernandez said he closed them now take a deep breath and put yourself back its yesterday evening you have been in merediths office the door has been closed for almost an hour you have had your experience with her now you are leaving the room you are going out how does the door open in or out it opens in so you pull the door open you walk out fast or slow im walking fast and you go into the outer room what do you see through the door into the outer room elevators directly ahead feeling disheveled of balance hoping there is no one to see him looking to the right at betsy rossr desk clean bare chair pulled up to the edge of the desk notepad plastic cover on the computer desk light still burning eyes swinging left a cleaning woman at the other assistant desk her big gray cleaning cart stands alongside her the cleaning woman is lifting a trash basket to empty it into the plastic sack that hangs open from one end of the cart the woman pauses in midlift stares at him curiously he is wondering how long she has been there what she has heard from inside the room a tinny radio on the cart is playing music ill fucking kill you for this meredith calls after him the cleaning woman hears it he looks away from her embarrassed and hurries toward the elevator feeling almost panic he pushes the button do you see the woman fernandez said yes but it was so fast and didnt want to look at her sanders shook his head where are you now at the elevator yes can you see the woman no i didnt want to look at her again all right lets go back no no keep your eyes closed well do it again take a deep breath and let it out slowly good this time youre going to see everything in slow motion like a movie now come out through the door and tell me when you see her for the first time coming through the door everything slow his head moving gently up and down with each footstep into the outer room the desk to the right tidy lamp on to the left the other desk the cleaning woman raising the i see her all right now freeze what you see freeze it like a photograph okay now look at her you can look at her now standing with the trash basket in her

shoes good theres something funny about the laces can you see whats funny no theyre dark something funny i cant tell all right open your eyes he looked at the five of them he was back in the room that was weird he said if there was time fernandez said i would have a professional hypnotist take you through the entire evening ive found it can be very useful but theres no time boys its five oclock you better get started the two investigators collected their notes and left what are they going to do if we were litigating this fernandez said we would have the right to depose potential witnessesto question individuals within the company who might have knowledge bearing on the case under the present circumstances we have no right to interrogate anybody because youre entering into private mediation but if one of the digicom assistants chooses to have a drink with a handsome delivery man after work and if the conversation happens to turn to gossip about sex in the office well thats the way the cookie crumbles we can use that information fernandez smiled lets see what we find out first she said now i want to go back over several points in your story particularly starting at the time you decided not to have intercourse with ms johnson again yes but i have a few things to do first i need to call phil blackburn and arrange tomorrows sessions and i have some other things to check on lets break now and meet again in two hours meanwhile have you cleaned out your office no he said you better clean it out anything personal or incriminating get it out from now on expect your desk drawers to be gone through your files to be searched your mail to be read your phone messages checked every aspect of your life is now public okay so go through your desk and your files remove anything of a personal nature okay on your office computer if you have any passwords change them anything in electronic data files of a personal nature get it out okay dont just remove itmake sure you erase it so its unrecoverable okay its not a bad idea to do the same thing at home your drawers and files and computer okay he was thinking at home would they really break into his home if you have any sensitive materials that you want to store bring them to richard here she said pointing to the young lawyer hell have them taken to a safedeposit box where theyll be kept for you dont tell me i dont want to know anything about it okay now lets discuss the telephone from now on if you have any sensitive calls to make dont use your office phone your cellular phone or your phone at home use a pay phone and dont put it on a charge card even your personal charge card get a roll of quarters and use them instead you really think this is necessary i know it is necessary now is there anything in your past conduct with this company which might be said to be out of order she was peering at him over her glasses he shrugged i dont think so anything at all did you overstate your qualifications on your original job application did you abruptly terminate any employee have you had any kind of inquiry about your behavior or decisions were you ever the subject of an internal company investigation and even if you werent did you ever to your knowledge do anything improper however small or apparently minor jesus he said its been twelve years while you are cleaning out think about it i need to know anything that the company might drag up about you because if they can they will okay and one other point i gather from what youve told me that nobody at your company is entirely clear why johnson has enjoyed such a rapid rise among the executives thats right find out it wont be easy sanders said everybodys talking about it and nobody seems to know but for everybody else fernandez said its just gossip for you its vital we need to know where her connections are and why they exist if we know that we have a chance of pulling this thing off but if we dont mr sanders theyre probably going to tear us apart he was back at digicom at six cindy was cleaning up her desk and was about to leave any calls he said as he went into his office just one she said her voice was tight who was that john levin he said it was important levin was an executive with a hard drive supplier whatever levin wanted it could wait sanders looked at cindy she seemed tense almost on the verge of tears something wrong no just a long day a shrug elaborate indifference anything i should know about no its been quiet you didnt have any other calls she hesitated tom i just want you to know i dont believe what they are saying what are they saying he asked about meredith johnson what about her that you sexually harassed her she blurted it out and then waited watching him her eyes moving across his face he could see her uncertainty sanders felt uneasy in turn that this woman he had worked alongside for so many years would now be so openly unsure of him he said firmly its not true cindy okay i didnt think it was its just that everybody is theres no truth to it at all okay good she nodded put the call book in the desk drawer she seemed eager to leave did you need me to stay no good night tom good night cindy he went into his office and closed the door behind him he sat behind his desk and looked at it a moment nothing seemed to have been touched he flicked on his monitor and began going through the drawers rummaging through trying to decide what to take out he glanced up at the monitor and saw that his email icon was blinking idly he clicked it on number of personal messages do you want to read them now he pressed the key a moment later the first message came up sealed twinkle drives are on their way to you today dhl you should have them tomorrow hope you find something jafar is still severely ill they say he may die arthur kahn he pressed the key and another message came up the weenies are still swarming down here any news yet eddie sanders couldnt worry about eddie now he pushed the key and the third message came up i guess you havent been reading back issues of comline starting four years ago afriend sanders stared at the screen comline was digicoms inhouse newsletteran eight page monthly filled with chatty accounts of hirings and promotions and babies born the summer schedule for the softball team things like that sanders never paid any attention to it and couldnt imagine why he should now and who was afriend he clicked the reply button on the screen cant reply sender address not available he clicked the sender info button it should give him the name and address of the person sending the email message but instead he saw dense rows of type from uupsicomuwapcmcomeducharon tue jun remote from dccsys received from uups by dccsysdcccom id aa tue jun pst received from uwapcmcomedu by uupsicom bpsipsinet id aa tue jun received from riverstyxpcmcomedu by uwapcmcomedu smi id aa tue jun pst received by riverstyxpcmcomedu sgi id aa tue jun date tue jun from charon uwapcmcomedu afriend messageid aariverstyxpcm comedu to tsandersdcccom sanders stared the message hadnt come to him from inside the company at all he was looking at an internet routing internet was the vast worldwide computer network connecting universities corporations government agencies and private users sanders wasnt knowledgeable about the internet but it appeared that the message from afriend network namecharonhad originated from uwapcmcomedu wherever that was apparently some kind of educational institution he pushed theprint screenbutton and made a mental note to turn this one over to bosak he needed to talk to bosak anyway he went down the hall and got the sheet as it came out of the printer then he went back to his office and stared at the screen he decided to try a reply to this person from tsandersdcccom to charonuwapcmcomedu any help greatly appreciated sanders he pushed thesendbutton then he deleted both the original message and his own reply sorry you cannot delete this mail sometimes email was protected with a flag that prevented it from being deleted he typedunprotect mail the mail is unprotected he typed delete mail sorry you cannot delete this mail what the hell is this he thought the system must be hanging up maybe it had been stymied by the internet address he decided to delete the message from the system at the control level he typedsystem what level he typed sysop sorry your privileges do not include sysop control christ he said theyd gone in and taken away his privileges he couldnt believe it he typedshow privileges sanders thomas l prior user level sysop user level change tue june pm pst current user level entry no further modifications there it was they had locked him out of the system user level zero was the level that assistants in the company were given sanders slumped back in the chair he felt as if he had been fired for the first time he began to realize what this was going to be like clearly there was no time to waste he opened his desk drawer and saw at once that the pens and pencils were neatly arranged someone had already been there he pulled open the file drawer below only a halfdozen files were there the others were all missing they had already gone through his desk quickly he got up and went out to the big filing cabinets behind cindys desk these cabinets were locked but he knew cindy kept the key in her desk he found the key and unlocked the current years files the cabinet was empty there were no files there at all they had taken everything he opened the cabinet for the previous year empty the year before empty all the others empty jesus he thought no wonder cindy had been so cool they must have had a gang of workmen up there with trolleys cleaning everything out during the afternoon sanders locked the cabinets again replaced the key in cindys desk and headed downstairs the press office was on the third floor it was deserted now except for a single assistant who was closing up oh mr sanders i was just getting ready to leave you dont have to stay i just wanted to check some things where do you keep the back issues of comline theyre all on that shelf over there she pointed to a row of stacked issues was there anything in particular no you go ahead home the assistant seemed reluctant but she picked up her purse and headed out the door sanders went to the shelf the issues were arranged in sixmonth stacks just to be safe he started ten stacks backfive years ago he began flipping through the pages scanning the endless details of game scores and press releases on production figures after a few minutes he found it hard to pay attention and of course he didnt know what he was looking for although he assumed it was something about meredith johnson he went through two stacks before he found the first article new marketing assistant named cupertino may digicom president bob garvin today announced the appointment of meredith johnson as assistant director of marketing and promotion for telecommunications she will report to howard gottfried in m and p ms johnson came to us from her position as vice president for marketing at conrad computer systems of sunnyvale before that she was a senior administrative assistant at the novell network division in mountain viewms johnson who has degrees from vassar college and stanford business school was recently married to gary henley a marketing executive at costar congratulations as a new arrival to digicom ms johnson he skipped the rest of the article it was all prfluffthe accompanying photo was standard bschool graduate against a gray background with light coming from behind one shoulder it showed a young woman with shoulderlength hair in a pageboy style a direct businesslike stare just shy of harsh and a firm mouth but she looked considerably younger than she did now sanders continued to thumb through the issues he glanced at his watch it was almost seven and he wanted to call bosak he came to the end of the year and the pages were nothing but christmas stuff a picture of garvin and his family merry christmas from the boss ho ho ho caught his attention because it showed bob with his former wife along with his three collegeage kids standing around a big tree had garvin been going out with emily yet nobody ever knew garvin was cagey you never knew what he was up to sanders went to the next stack for the following year january sales predictions lets get out and make it happen opening of the austin plant to manufacture cellular phones a photo of garvin in harsh sunlight cutting the ribbon a profile of mary anne hunter that began spunky athletic mary anne hunter knows what she wants out of life they had called her spunky for weeks afterward until she begged them to give it up sanders flipped pages contract with the irish government to break ground in cork secondquarter sales figures basketball team scores against aldus then a black box jennifer garvin jennifer garvin a thirdyear student at boalt hall school of law in berkeley died on march in an automobile accident in san francisco she was twentyfour years old jennifer had been accepted to the firm of harley wayne and myers following her graduation a memorial service was held at the presbyterian church of palo alto for friends of the family and her many classmates those wishing to make memorial donations should send contributions to mothers against drunk drivers all of us at digital communications extend our deepest sympathy to the garvin family sanders remembered that time as difficult for everyone garvin was snappish and withdrawn drinking too much and frequently absent from work not long afterward his marital difficulties became public within two years he was divorced and soon after that he married emily chen a young executive in her twenties but there were other changes too everyone agreed garvin was no longer the same boss after the death of his daughter garvin had always been a scrapper but now he became protective less ruthless some said that garvin was stopping to smell the roses but that wasnt it at all he was newly aware of the arbitrariness of life and it led him to control things in a way that hadnt been true before garvin had always been mr evolution put it on the shore and see if it eats or dies it made him a heartless administrator but a remarkably fair boss if you did a good job you were recognized if you couldnt cut it you were gone everybody understood the rules but after jennifer died all that changed now he had overt favorites among staff and programs and he nurtured those favorites and neglected others despite the evidence in front of his face more and more he made business decisions arbitrarily garvin wanted events to turn out the way he intended them to it gave him a new kind of fervor a new sense of what the company should be but it was also a more difficult place to work a more political place it was a trend that sanders had ignored he continued to act as if he still worked at the old digicomthe company where all that mattered were results but clearly that company was gone sanders continued thumbing through the magazines articles about early negotiations for a plant in malaysia a photo of phil blackburn in ireland signing an agreement with the city of cork new production figures for the austin plant start of production of the a cellular model births and deaths and promotions more digicom baseball scores johnson to take operations post cupertino october meredith johnson has been named new assistant manager for division operations in cupertino replacing the very popular harry warner who retired after fifteen years of service the shift to ops manager takes johnson out of marketing where she has been very effective for the last year since joining the company in her new position she will work closely with bob garvin on international operations for digicom but it was the accompanying picture that caught sanderss attention once again it was a formal head shot but johnson now looked completely different her hair was light blond gone was the neat businessschool pageboy she wore her hair short in a curly informal style she was wearing much less makeup and smiling cheerfully overall the effect was to make her appear much more youthful open innocent sanders frowned quickly he flipped back through the issues he had already looked at then he went back to the previous stack with its yearend christmas pictures merry christmas from the boss ho ho ho he looked at the family portrait garvin standing behind his three children two sons and a daughter that must be jennifer his wife harriet stood to one side in the picture garvin was smiling his hand resting lightly on his daughters shoulder and she was tall and athleticlooking with short light blond curly hair ill be damned he said aloud he thumbed back quickly to the first article to look at the original picture of johnson he compared it to the later one there was no doubt about what she had done he read the rest of the first article as a new arrival to digicom ms johnson brings her considerable business acumen her sparkling humor and her sizzling softball pitch shes a major addition to the digicom team welcome meredith her admiring friends are never surprised to learn that meredith was once a finalist in the miss teen connecticut contest in her student days at vassar meredith was a valued member ofboth the tennis team and the debating society a memberofphi beta kappa she took her major in psychology with a minor in abnormal psych hope you wont be needing that around here meredith at stanford she obtained her mba with honors graduating near the topofher class meredith told us i am delighted to join digicom andilook forward to an exciting career with this forwardlooking company we couldnt have said it better ms johnson no shit sanders said he had known almost none of this from the start meredith had been based in cupertino sanders never saw her the one time he had run into her was soon after her arrival before she changed her hair her hair and what else he looked carefully at the two pictures something else was subtly different had she hadplastic surgery it was impossible to know but her appearance was definitely changed between the two portraits he moved through the remaining issues of the magazine quickly now convinced that he had learned what there was to know now he skimmed only the headlines garvin sends johnson to texas for austin plant oversight johnson will head new operations review unit johnson named operations veep to work directly under garvin johnson triumph in malaysia labor conflict now resolved meredith johnson our rising star a superb manager her skill in technical areas very strong this final headline ran above a lengthy profile of johnson well placed on the second page of the magazine it had appeared in comline only two issues ago seeing it now sanders realized that the article was intended for internal consumptionsoftening up the beachhead before the june landing this article was a trial balloon that cupertino had floated to see if meredith would be acceptable to run the technical divisions in seattle the only trouble was sanders never saw it and nobody had ever mentioned it to him the article stressed the technical savvy that johnson had acquired during her years with the company she was quoted as saying i began my career working in technical areas back with novell the technical fields have always been my first love id love to go back to it after all strong technical innovation lies at the heart of a forwardlooking company like digicom any good manager here must be able to run the technical divisions there it was he looked at the date may published six weeks ago which meant that the article had been written at least two weeks before that as mark lewyn had suspected meredith johnson knew she was going to be the head of the advanced products division at least two months ago which meant in turn that sanders had never been under consideration to become division head he had never had a chance it was a done deal months ago sanders swore took the articles over to the xerox machine and copied them then put the stacks back on the shelf and left the press office he got on the elevator mark lewyn was there sanders said hi mark lewyn didnt answer sanders pushed the button for the ground floor the doors closed i just hope you know what the fuck youre doing lewyn said angrily i think i do because you could fuck this thing up for everybody you know that fuck what up just because you got your ass in the sling its not our problem nobody said it was i dont know whats the matter with you lewyn said youre late for work you dont call me when you say you will what is it trouble at home more shit with susan this has nothing to do with susan yeah i think it does youve been late two days running and even when youre here you walk around like youre dreaming youre in fucking dreamland tom i mean what the hell were you doing going to merediths office at night anyway she asked me to come to her office shes the boss youre saying i shouldnt have gone lewyn shook his head in disgust this innocent act is a lot of crap dont you take any responsibility for anything what look tom everybody in the company knows that meredith is a shark meredith manmuncher they call her the great white everybody knows shes protected by garvin that she can do what she wants and what she wants is to play grabass with cute guys who show up in her office at the end of the day she has a couple of glasses of wine she gets a little flushed and she wants service a delivery boy a trainee a young account guy whatever and nobody can say a word because garvin thinks she walks on water so how come everybody else in the company knows it but you sanders was stunned he did not know how to answer he stared at lewyn who stood very close to him his body hunched hands in his pockets he could feel lewyns breath on his face but he could hardly hear lewyns words it was as if they came to him from a great distance hey tom you walk the same halls you breathe the same air as the rest of us you know whos doing what you go marching up there to her office and you know damned well whats coming merediths done everything but announce to the world that she wants to suck your dick all day long shes touching your arm giving you thosemeaningfullittle looks and squeezes oh tom soniceto see you again and now you tell me you didnt know what was coming in that officefuck youtom youre an asshole the elevator doors opened before them the groundfloor lobby was deserted growing dark in the fading light of the june evening a soft rain fell outside lewyn started toward the exit then turned back his voice echoed in the lobby you realize he said that youre acting like one of those women in all this the way they always go who me i never intended that the way they go oh its not my responsibility i never thought if i got drunk and kissed him and went to his room and lay down on his bed that hed fuck me oh dear me no its bullshit tom irresponsible bullshit and you better think about what im saying because theres a lot of us who have worked every bit as hard as you have in this company and we dont want to see you screw up this merger and this spinoff for the rest of us you want to pretend you cant tell when a womans coming on to you thats fine you want to screw up your own life its your decision but you screw up mine and im going to fucking put you away lewyn stalked off the elevator doors started to close sanders stuck his hand out the doors closed on his fingers he jerked his hand and the doors opened again he hurried out into the lobby after lewyn he grabbed lewyn on the shoulder mark wait listen i got nothing to say to you i got kids i got responsibilities youre an asshole lewyn shrugged sanderss arm off pushed open the door and walked out he strode quickly away down the street as the glass doors closed sanders saw a flash of blond in the moving reflection he turned i thought that was a little unfair meredith johnson said she was standing about twenty feet behind him near the elevators she was wearing gym clothesnavy tights and a sweatshirtand she carried a gym bag in her hand she looked beautiful overtly sexual in a certain way sanders felt tense there was no one else in the lobby they were alone yes sanders said i thought it was unfair i meant to women meredith said she swung the gym bag over her shoulder the movement raising her sweatshirt and exposing her bare abdomen above her tights she shook her head and pushed her hair back from her face she paused a moment and then she began to speak i want to tell you im sorry about all this she said she moved toward him in a steady confident way almost stalking her voice was low i never wanted any of this tom she came a little closer approaching slowly as if he were an animal that might be frightened away i have only the warmest feelings for you still closer only the warmest closer i cant help it tom if i still want you closer if i did anything to offend you i apologize she was very close now her body almost touching his her breasts inches from his arm im truly sorry tom she said softly she seemed filled with emotion her breasts rising and falling her eyes moist and pleading as she looked up at him can you forgive me please you know how i feel about you he felt all the old sensations the old stirrings he clenched his jaw meredith the past is past cut it out will you she immediately changed her tone and gestured to the street listen i have a car here can i drop you somewhere no thanks its raining i thought you might want a lift i dont think its a good idea only because its raining this is seattle he said it rains all the time here she shrugged walked to the door and leaned her weight against it thrusting out her hip then she looked back at him and smiled remind me never to wear tights around you its embarrassing you make me wet then she turned away pushed through the door and walked quickly to the waiting car getting in the back she closed the door looked back at him and waved cheerfully the car drove off sanders unclenched his hands he took a deep breath and let it out slowly his whole body was tense he waited until the car was gone then went outside he felt the rain on his face the cool evening breeze he hailed a taxi the four seasons hotel he said to the driver riding in the taxi sanders stared out the window breathing deeply he felt as though he couldnt get his breath he had been badly unnerved by the meeting with meredith especially coming so close after his conversation with lewyn sanders was distressed by what lewyn had said but you could never take mark too seriously lewyn was an artistic hothead who handled his creative tensions by getting angry he was angry about something most of the time lewyn liked being angry sanders had known him a long time personally he had never understood how adele marks wife put up with it adele was one of those wonderfully calm almost phlegmatic women who could talk on the phone while her two kids crawled all over her tugging at her asking her questions in a similar fashion adele just let lewyn rage while she went on about her business in fact everyone just let lewyn rage because everyone knew that in the end it didnt mean anything yet it was also true that lewyn had a kind of instinct for public perceptions and trends that was the secret of his success as a designer lewyn would say pastel colors and everybody would groan and say that the new design colors looked like hell but two years later when the products were coming off the line pastel colors would be just what everybody wanted so sanders was forced to admit that what lewyn had said about him others would soon be saying lewyn had said the company line that sanders was screwing up the chances for everybody else well screw them he thought as for meredithhe had had the distinct feeling that she had been toying with him in the lobby teasing him playing with him he could not understand why she was so confident sanders was making a very serious allegation against her yet she behaved as if there was no threat at all she had a kind of imperviousness an indifference that made him deeply uneasy it could only mean she knew that she had garvins backing the taxi pulled into the turnaround of the hotel he saw merediths car up ahead she was talking to the driver she looked back and saw him there was nothing to do but get out and walk toward the entrance are you following me she said smiling no sure yes meredith im sure they went up the escalator from the street to the lobby he stood behind her on the escalator she looked back at him i wish you were yeah well im not it would have been nice she said she smiled invitingly he didnt know what to say he just shook his head they rode the rest of the way in silence until they came to the high ornate lobby she said im in room come and see me anytime she headed toward the elevators he waited until she was gone then crossed the lobby and turned left to the dining room standing at the entrance he saw dorfman at a corner table eating dinner with garvin and stephanie kaplan max was holding forth gesturing sharply as he spoke garvin and kaplan both leaned forward listening sanders was reminded that dorfman had once been a director of the companyaccording to the stories a very powerful director it was dorfman who had persuaded garvin to expand beyond modems into cellular telephony and wireless communications back in the days when nobody could see any link between computers and telephones the link was obvious now but obscure in the early s when dorfman had said your business is not hardware your business is communications your business is access to information dorfman had shaped company personnel as well supposedly kaplan owed her position to his glowing endorsement sanders had come to seattle on dorfmans recommendation mark lewyn had been hired because of dorfman and any number of vice presidents had vanished over the years because dorfman found them lacking in vision or stamina he was a powerful ally or a lethal opponent and his position at the time of the merger was equally strong although dorfman had resigned as a director years before he stillowned a good deal of digicom stock he still had garvins ear and he still had the contacts and prestige within the business and financial community that made a merger like this much simpler if dorfman approved the terms of the merger his admirers at goldman sachs and at first boston would raise the money easily but if dorfman was dissatisfied if he hinted that the merger of the two companies did not make sense then the acquisition might unravel everyone knew it everyone understood very well the power he wieldedespecially dorfman himself sanders hung back at the entrance to the restaurant reluctant to come forward after a while max glanced up and saw him still talking he shook his head fractionally no then as he continued to talk he made a subtle motion with his hand tapping his watch sanders nodded and went back into the lobby and sat down he had the stack of comline photocopies on his lap he browsed through them studying again the way meredith had changed her appearance a few minutes later dorfman rolled out in his wheelchair so thomas i am glad you are not bored with your life what does that mean dorfman laughed and gestured to the dining room theyre talking of nothing else in there the only topic this evening is you and meredith everyone is so excited soworried including bob yes of course including bob he wheeled closer to sanders i cannot really speak to you now was there something in particular i think you ought to look at this sanders said handing dorfman the photocopies he was thinking that dorfman could take these pictures to garvin dorfman could make garvin understand what was really going on dorfman examined them in silence a moment such a lovely woman he said so beautiful look at the differences max look at what she did to herself dorfman shrugged she changed her hair very flattering so i think she had plastic surgery as well it wouldnt surprise me dorfman said so many women do these days it is like brushing their teeth to them it gives me the creeps why dorfman said because its underhanded thats why whats underhanded dorfman said shrugging she is resourceful good for her ill bet garvin has no idea what shes doing to him sanders said dorfman shook his head im not concerned about garvin he said im concerned about you thomas and this outrage of yourshmm ill tell you why im outraged sanders said because this is the kind of sneaky shit that a woman can pull but a man cant she changes her appearance she dresses and acts like garvins daughter and that gives her an advantage because i sure as hell cant act like his daughter dorfman sighed shaking his head thomas thomas well i cant can i are you enjoying this you seem to be enjoying this outrage im not then give it updorfman said he turned his wheelchair to face sanders stop talking this nonsense and face what is true young people in organizations advance by alliances with powerful senior people true yes and it is always so at one time the alliance was formalan apprentice and master or a pupil and tutor it was arranged yes but today it is not formal today we speak of mentors young people in business have mentors true okay so how do young people attach themselves to a mentor what is the process first by being agreeable by being helpful to the senior person doing jobs that need to be done second by being attractive to the older personimitating their attitudes and tastes third by advocacyadopting their agenda within the company thats all fine sanders said what does it have to do with plastic surgery do you remember when you joined digicom in cupertino yes i remember you came over from dec in yes at dec you wore a coat and tie every day but when you joined digicom you saw that garvin wore jeans and soon you wore jeanstoo sure that was the style of the company garvin liked the giants you began to go to games in candlestick park he was the boss for christs sake and garvin liked golf so you took up golf even though you hated it i remember you complained to me about how much you hated it chasing the stupid little white ball listen i didnt have plastic surgery to make myself look like his kid because you didnt have tothomas dorfman said he threw up his hands in exasperation can you not see this point garvin liked brash aggressive young men who drank beer who swore who chased women and you did all those things in those days i was young thats what young men do no thomas thats what garvin liked young men to do dorfman shook his head so much of this is unconscious rapport is unconscious thomas but the task of building rapport is different depending on whether you are the same sex as that person or not if your mentor is a man you may act like his son or brother or father or you may act like that man when he was younger you may remind him of himself true yes you see that good but if you are a woman everything is different now you must be your mentors daughter or lover or wife or perhaps sister in any case very different sanders frowned i see this often now that men are starting to work for women many times men cannot structure the relationship because they do not know how to act as the subordinate to a woman not with comfort but in other cases men slip easily into a role with a woman they are the dutiful son or the substitute lover or husband and if they do it well the women in the organization become angry because they feel that they cannot compete as son or lover or husband to the boss so they feel that the man has an advantage sanders was silent do you understand dorfman said youre saying it happens both ways yes thomas it is inevitable it is the process come on max theres nothing inevitable about it when garvins daughter died it was a personal tragedy he was upset and meredith took advantage of stop dorfman said annoyed now you want to change human nature there are always tragedies and people always take advantage this is nothing new meredith is intelligent it is delightful to see such an intelligent resourceful woman who is also beautiful she is a gift from god she is delightful this is your trouble thomas and it has been a long time coming what does that and instead of dealing with your trouble you waste your time with these trivialities he handed back the pictures these are not important thomas max will you you were never a good corporate player thomas it was not your strength your strength was that you could take a technical problem and grind it down push the technicians encourage them and bully them and finally get it solved you could make it work is that not so sanders nodded but now you abandon your strengths for a game that does not suit you meaning what you think that by threatening a lawsuit you put pressure on her and on the company in fact you played into her hands you have let her define the game thomas i had to do something she broke the law she broke the law dorfman mimicked him with a sarcastic whine oh me oh my and you are so defenseless i am filled with sorrow for your plight its not easy shes well connected she has strong supporters is that so every executive with strong supporters has also strong detractors and meredith has her share of detractors i tell you max sanders said shes dangerous shes one of those mba image people focused on image everything image never substance yes dorfman said nodding approvingly like so many young executives today very skilled with images very interested in manipulating that reality a fascinating trend i dont think shes competent to run this division and what if she is not dorfman snapped what difference does it make to you if shes incompetent garvin will eventually acknowledge it and replace her but by then you will be long gone because you will lose this game with her thomas she is better at politics than you she always was sanders nodded shes ruthless ruthless schmoothless she isskilledshe has an instinct you lack it you will lose everything if you persist this way and you will deserve the fate that befalls you because you have behaved like a fool sanders was silent what do you recommend i do ali so now you want advice yes really he smiled i doubt it yes max i do all right

behavior has a reason all behavior is solving a problem evenyour behavior thomas and he spun in his wheelchair and went back to the dining room fucking max he thought walking down third street in the damp evening it was infuriating the way max would never just say what he meant this is your trouble thomas and it has been a long time coming what the hell was that supposed to mean fucking max infuriating and frustrating and exhausting too that was what sanders remembered most about the sessions he used to have when max was on the digicom board sanders would come away exhausted in those days back in cupertino the junior execs had called dorfman the riddler all human behavior is solving a problem even your behavior thomas sanders shook his head it made no sense at all meanwhile he had things to do at the end of the street he stepped into a phone booth and dialed gary bosaks number it was eight oclock bosak would be home just getting out of bed and having coffee starting his working day right now he would be yawning in front of a halfdozen modems and computer screens as he began to dial into all sorts of databases the phone rang and a machine said you have reached ne professional services leave a message and a beep gary this is tom sanders i know youre there pick up a click and then bosak said hey the last person i thought id hear from wherere you calling from pay phone good hows it going with you tom gary i need some things done some data looked up uh are we talking things for the company or private things private uh tom im pretty busy these days can we talk about this next week thats too late but the thing is im pretty busy now gary what is this tom come on you know what this is i need help gary hey and id love to help you but i just got a call from blackburn who told me that if i had anything to do with you anything at all i could expect the fbi going through my apartment at six am tomorrow morning christ when was this about two hours ago two hours ago blackburn was way ahead of him gary hey you know i always liked you tom but not this time okay i got to go click frankly none of this surprises me fernandez said pushing aside a paper plate she and sanders had been eating sandwiches in her office it was nine pm and the offices around them were dark but her phone was still ringing interrupting them frequently outside it had begun to rain again thunder rumbled and sanders saw flashes of summer lightning through the windows sitting in the deserted law offices sanders had the feeling that he was all alone in the world with nobody but fernandez and the encroaching darkness things were happening quickly this person he had never met before today was fast becoming a kind of lifeline for him he found himself hanging on every word she said before we go on i want to emphasize one thing fernandez said you were right not to get in the car with johnson you are not to be alone with her ever again not even for a few moments not ever under any circumstances is that clear yes if you do it will destroy your case i wont all right she said now i had a long talk with blackburn as you guessed hes under tremendous pressure to get this matter resolved i tried to move the mediation session to the afternoon he implied that the company was ready to deal and wanted to get started right away hes concerned about how long the negotiations will take so well start at nine tomorrow okay herb and alan have been making progress i think theyll be able to help us tomorrow and these articles about johnson may be useful too she said glancing at the photocopies of the comline pieces why dorfman says theyre irrelevant yes but they document her history in the company and that gives us leads its something to work on so is this email from your friend she frowned at the sheet of printout this is an internet address yes he said surprised that she knew we do a lot of work with hightechnology companies ill have somebody check it out she put it aside now lets review where we are you couldnt clean out your desk because they were already there right and you would have cleaned out your computer files but youve been shut out of the system yes which means that you cant change anything thats right i cant do anything its like im an assistant she said were you going to change any files he hesitated no but i would have you know looked around nothing in particular you were aware of no mr sanders she said i want to emphasize that i have no judgment here im simply trying to prepare for what may happen tomorrow i want to know what surprises theyll have for us he shook his head there isnt anything in the files thats embarrassing to me youve thought it over carefully yes okay she said then considering the early start i think you better get some sleep i want you sharp tomorrow will you be able to sleep jeez i dont know take a sleeping pill if you need to ill be okay then go home and go to bed mr sanders ill see you in the morning wear a coat and tie tomorrow do you have some kind of a blue coat a blazer fine wear a conservative tie and a white shirt no aftershave i never dress like that at the office this is not the office mr sanders thats just the point she stood up and shook his hand get some sleep and try not to worry i think everything is going to be fine i bet you say that to all your clients yes i do she said but im usually right get some sleep tom ill see you tomorrow he came home to a dark empty house elizas barbie dolls lay in an untidy heap on the kitchen counter one of his sons bibs streaked with green baby food was on the counter beside the sink he set up the coffeemaker for the morning and went upstairs he walked past the answering machine but neglected to look at it and failed to notice the blinking light upstairs when he undressed in the bathroom he saw that susan had taped a note to the mirror sorry about lunch i believe you i love you s it was just like susan to be angry and then to apologize but he was glad for the note and considered calling her now but it was nearly midnight in phoenix which meant it was too late shed be asleep anyway as he thought about it he realized that he didnt want to call her as she had said at the restaurant this had nothing to do with her he was alone in this hed stay alone wearing just shorts he padded into his little office there were no faxes he switched on his computer and waited while it came up the email icon was blinking he clicked it trust nobody afriend sanders shut off the computer and went to bed wednesday in the morning he took comfort in his routine dressing quickly while listening to the television news which he turned up loud trying to fill the empty house with noise he drove into town at stopping at the bainbridge bakery to buy a pullapart and a cup of cappuccino before going down to the ferry as the ferry pulled away from winslow he sat toward the stern so he would not have to look at seattle as it approached lost in his thoughts he stared out the window at the gray clouds hanging low over the dark water of the bay it looked like it would rain again today bad day huh a woman said he looked up and saw mary anne hunter pretty and petite standing with her hands on her hips looking at him with concern mary anne lived on bainbridge too her husband was a marine biologist at the university she and susan were good friends and often jogged together but he didnt often see mary anne on the ferry because she usually went in early morning mary anne what i cant understand is how they got it she said got what sanders said you mean you havent seen it jesus youre in the papers tom she handed him the newspaper under her arm youre kidding no connie walsh strikes again sanders looked at the front page but saw nothing he began flipping through quickly its in the metro section she said the first opinion column on the second page read it and weep ill get more coffee she walked away sanders opened the paper to the metro section as i see it by constance walsh mr piggy at work the power of the patriarchy has revealed itself again this time in a local hightech firm ill call company x this company has appointed a brillant highly competent woman to a major executive position but many men in the company are doing their damnedest to get rid of her one man in particular lets call him mr piggy has been especially vindictive mr piggy cant tolerate a woman supervisor and for weeks he has been running a bitter campaign of innuendo inside the company to keep it from happening when that failed mr piggy claimed that his new boss sexually assaulted him and nearly raped him in her offices the blatant hostility of this claim is matched only by its absurdity some of you may wonder how a woman could rape a man the answer is of course she cant rape is a crime of violence it is exclusively a crime of males who use rape with appalling frequency to keep women in their place that is the deep truth of our society and of all other societies before ours for their part women simply do not oppress men women are powerless in the hands of men and to claim that a woman committed rape is absurd but that didnt stop mr piggy who is interested only in smearing his new supervisor hes even bringing a formal charge of sexual harassment against her in short mr piggy has the nasty habits of a typical patriarch as you might expect they appear everywhere in his life although mr piggys wife is an outstanding attorney he pressures her to give up her job and stay home with the kids after all mr piggy doesnt want his wife out in the business world where she might hear about his affairs with young women and his excessive drinking he probably figures his new female supervisor wouldnt approve of that either maybe she wont allow him to be late to work as he so often is so mr piggy has made his underhanded move and another talented businesswoman sees her career unfairly jeopardized will she be able to keep the pigs in the pen at company x stay tuned for updates christ sanders said he read it through again hunter came back with two cappuccinos in paper cups she pushed one toward him here looks like you need it how did they get the story he said hunter shook her head i dont know it looks to me like theres a leak inside the company but who sanders was thinking that if the story made the paper it must have been leaked by three or four pm the day before who in the company even knew that he was considering a harassment charge at that time i cant imagine who it could be hunter said ill ask around and whos constance walsh you never read her shes a regular columnist at the post intelligence hunter said feminist perspectives that kind of thing she shook her head how is susan i tried to call her this morning and theres no answer at your house susans gone away for a few days with the kids hunter nodded slowly thats probably a good idea we thought so she knows about this yes and is it true are you charging harassment yes jesus yes he said nodding she sat with him for a long time not speaking she just sat with him finally she said ive known you for a long time i hope this turns out okay me too there was another long silence finally she pushed away from the table and got up see you later tom see you mary anne he knew what she was feeling he had felt it himself when others in the company had been accused of harassment there was suddenly a distance it didnt matter how long you had known the person it didnt matter if you were friends once an accusation was made everybody pulled away because the truth was you never knew what had happened you couldnt afford to take sideseven with your friends he watched her walk away a slender compact figure in exercise clothes carrying a leather briefcase she was barely five feet tall the men on the ferry were so much larger he remembered that she had once told susan that she took up running because of her fear of rape ill just outrun them she had said men didnt know anything about that they didnt understand that fear but there was another kind of fear that only men felt he looked at the newspaper column with deep and growing unease key words and phrases jumped out at him vindictive bitter cant tolerate a woman blatant hostility rape crime of males smearing his supervisor affairs with young women excessive drinking late to work unfairly jeopardized pigs in the pen these characterizations were more than inaccurate more than unpleasant they were dangerous and it was exemplified by what happened to john mastersa story that had reverberated among many senior men in seattle masters was fifty a marketing manager at microsym a stable guy solid citizen married twentyfive years two kidsthe older girl in college the younger girl a junior in high school the younger girl starts to have trouble with school her grades go down so the parents send her to a child psychologist the child psychologist listens to the daughter and then says you know this is the typical story of an abused child do you have anything like that in your past gee the girl says i dont think so think back the psychologist says at first the girl resists but the psychologist keeps at her think back try to remember and after a while the girl starts to recall some vague memories nothing specific but now she thinks its possible maybe daddy did do something wrong way back when the psychologist tells the wife what is suspected after twentyfive years together the wife and masters have some anger between them the wife goes to masters and says admit what you did masters is thunderstruck he cant believe it he denies everything the wife says youre lying i dont want you around here she makes him move out of the house the older daughter flies home from college she says what is this madness you know daddy didnt do anything come to your senses but the wife is angry the daughter is angry and the process once set in motion cant be stopped the psychologist is required by state law to report any suspected abuse she reports masters to the state the state is required by law to conduct an investigation now a social worker is talking to the daughter the wife and masters then to the family doctor the school nurse pretty soon everybody knows word of the accusation gets to microsym the company suspends him from his job pending the outcome they say they dont want negative publicity masters is seeing his life dissolve his younger daughter wont talk to him his wife wont talk to him hes living alone in an apartment he has money problems business associates avoid him everywhere he turns he sees accusing faces he is advised to get a lawyer and he is so shattered so uncertain he starts going to a shrink himself his lawyer makes inquiries disturbing details emerge it turns out that the particular psychologist who made the accusation uncovers abuse in a high percentage of her cases she has reported so many cases that the state agency has begun to suspect bias but the agency can do nothing the law requires that all cases be investigated the social worker assigned to the case has been previously disciplined for her excessive zeal in pursuing questionable cases and is widely thought to be incompetent but the state cannot fire her for the usual reasons the specific accusationnever formally presentedturns out to be that masters molested his daughter in the summer of her third grade masters thinks back has an idea he gets his old canceled checks out of storage digs up his old business calendars it turns out that his daughter was at a camp in montana that whole summer when she came home in august masters was on a business trip in germany he did not return from germany until after school had started again he had never even seen his daughter that summer masterss shrink finds it significant that his daughter would locate the abuse at the one time when abuse was impossible the shrink concludes that the daughter felt abandoned and has translated that into a memory of abuse masters confronts the wife and daughter they listen to the evidence and admit that they must have the date wrong but remain adamant that the abuse occurred nevertheless the facts about the summer schedule lead the state to drop its investigation and microsym reinstates masters but masters has missed a round of promotions and a vague cloud of prejudice hangs over him his career has been irrevocably damaged his wife never reconciles eventually filing for divorce he never again sees his younger daughter his older daughter caught between warring family factions sees less of him as time goes on masters lives alone struggles to rebuild his life and suffers a nearfatal heart attack after his recovery he sees a few friends but now he is morose and drinks too much a poor companion other men avoid him no one has an answer to his constant question what did i do wrong what should i have done instead how could i have prevented this because of course he could not have prevented it not in a contemporary climate where men were assumed to be guilty of anything they were accused of among themselves men sometimes talked of suing women for false accusations they talked of penalties for damage caused by those accusations but that was just talk meanwhile they all changed their behavior there were new rules now and every man knew them dont smile at a child on the street unless youre with your wife dont ever touch a strange child dont ever be alone with someone elses child even for a moment if a child invites you into his or her room dont go unless another adult preferably a woman is also present at a party dont let a little girl sit on your lap if she tries gently push her aside if you ever have occasion to see a naked boy or girl look quickly away better yet leave and it was prudent to be careful around your own children too because if your marriage went sour your wife might accuse you and then your past conduct would be reviewed in an unfavorable light well he was such an affectionate fatherperhaps a little too affectionate or he spent so much time with the kids he was always hanging around the house this was a world of regulations and penalties entirely unknown to women if susan saw a child crying on the street she picked the kid up she did it automatically without thinking sanders would never dare not these days and of course there were new rules for business as well sanders knew men who would not take a business trip with a woman who would not sit next to a female colleague on an airplane who would not meet a woman for a drink in a bar unless someone else was also present sanders had always thought such caution was extreme even paranoid but now he was not so sure the sound of the ferry horn roused sanders from his thoughts he looked up and saw the black pilings of the colman dock the clouds were still dark still threatening rain he stood belted his raincoat and headed downstairs to his car n his way to the mediation center he stopped by his office for a few minutes to pick up background documentation on the twinkle drive he thought it might be necessary in the mornings work but he was surprised to see john conley in his office talking with cindy it was in the morning oh tom conley said i was just trying to arrange an appointment with you cindy tells me that you have a very busy schedule and may be out of the office most of the day sanders looked at cindy her face was tight yes he said at least for the morning well i only need a few minutes sanders waved him into the office conley went in and sanders closed the door im looking forward to the briefing tomorrow for john marden our ceo conley said i gather youll be speaking then sanders nodded vaguely he had heard nothing about a briefing and tomorrow seemed very far away he was having trouble concentrating on what conley was saying but of course well all be asked to take a position on some of these agenda items conley said and im particularly concerned about austin austin i mean the sale of the austin facility i see sanders said so it was true as you know meredith johnson has taken an early and strong position in favor of the sale conley said it was one of the first recommendations she gave us in the early stages of shaping this deal mardens worried about cash flow after the acquisition the deals going to add debt and hes worried about funding hightech development johnson thought we could ease the debt load by selling off austin but i dont feel myself competent to judge the pros and cons on this i was wondering what your view was on a sale of the austin plant yes apparently theres tentative interest from both hitachi and motorola so its quite possible that it could be liquidated quickly i think thats what meredith has in mind has she discussed it with you no sanders said she probably has a lot of ground to cover settling in to her new job conley said he was watching sanders carefully as he spoke what do you think about a sale sanders said i dont see a compelling reason for it apart from cashflow issues i think her argument is that manufacturing cellular phones has become a mature business conley said as a technology its gone through its exponential growth phase and its now approaching a commodity the high profits are gone from now on there will be only incremental sales increases against increasing severe foreign competition so telephones arent likely to represent a major income source in the future and of course theres the question of whether we should be manufacturing in the states at all a lot of digicoms manufacturing is already offshore thats all true sanders said but its beside the point first of all cellular phones may be reaching market saturation but the general field of wireless communications is still in its infancy were going to see more and more wireless office nets and wireless field links in the future so the market is still expanding even if telephony is not second i would argue that wireless is a major part of our companys future interest and one way to stay competitive is to continue to make products and sell them that forces you to maintain contact with your customer base to keep knowledgeable about their future interests i wouldnt opt out now if motorola and hitachi see a business there why dont we third i think that we have an obligationasocial obligation if you willto keep highpaying skilled jobs in the us other countries dont export good jobs why should we each of our offshore manufacturing decisions has been made for a specific reason and personally i hope we start to move them back here because there are many hidden costs in offshore fabrication but most important of all even though we are primarily a development unit here making new productswe need manufacturing if theres anything that the last twenty years has shown us its that design and manufacturing are all one process you start splitting off the design engineers from the manufacturing guys and youll end up with bad design youll end up with general motors he paused there was a brief silence sanders hadnt intended to speak so strongly it just came out but conley just nodded thoughtfully so you believe selling austin would hurt the development unit no question about it in the end manufacturing is a discipline conley shifted in his seat how do you think meredith johnson feels on these issues i dont know because you see all this raises a related question conley said having to do with executive judgment to be frank ive heard some rumblings in the division about her appointment in terms of whether she really has a good enough grasp of the issues to run a technical division sanders spread his hands i dont feel i can say anything im not asking you to conley said i gather she has garvins support yes she does and thats fine with us but you know what im driving at conley said the classic problem in acquisitions is that the acquiring company doesnt really understand what they are buying and they kill the goose that lays the golden egg they dont intend to but they do they destroy the very thing they want to acquire im concerned that conleywhite not make a mistake like that uhhuh just between us if this issue comes up in the meeting tomorrow would you take the position you just took against johnson sanders shrugged that could be difficult he was thinking that he probably wouldnt be at the meeting tomorrow but he couldnt say that to conley well conley extended his hand thanks for your candor i appreciate it he turned to go one last thing itd be very helpful if we had a handle on the twinkle drive problem by tomorrow i know it sanders said believe me were working on it good conley turned and left cindy came in how are you today nervous what do you need me to do pull the data on the twinkle drives i want copies of everything i took meredith monday night its on your desk he scooped up a stack of folders on top was a small dat cartridge whats this thats your video link with arthur from monday he shrugged and dropped it in his briefcase cindy said anything else no he glanced at his watch im late good luck tom she said he thanked her and left the office ariving in morning rushhour traffic sanders realized that the only surprise in his encounter with conley was how sharp the young lawyer was as for meredith her behavior didnt surprise him at all for years sanders had fought the bschool mentality that she exemplified after watching these graduates come and go sanders had finally concluded that there was a fundamental flaw in their education they had been trained to believe that they were equipped to manage anything but there was no such thing as general managerial skills and tools in the end there were only specific problems involving specific industries and specific workers to apply general tools to specific problems was to fail you needed to know the market you needed to know the customers you needed to know the limits of manufacturing and the limits of your own creative people none of that was obvious meredith couldnt see that don cherry and mark lewyn needed a link to manufacturing yet time and again sanders had been shown a prototype and had asked the one significant question it looks fine but can you make it on a production line can you build it reliably and quickly for a price sometimes they could and sometimes they couldnt if you took away that question you changed the entire organization and not for the better conley was smart enough to see that and smart enough to keep his ear to the ground sanders wondered how much conley knew of what he hadnt said in their meeting did he also know about the harassment suit it was certainly possible christ meredith wanted to sell austin eddie had been right all along he considered telling him but he really couldnt and in any case he had more pressing things to worry about he saw the sign for the magnuson mediation center and turned right sanders tugged at the knot on his tie and pulled into a space in the parking lot the magnuson mediation center was located just outside seattle on a hill overlooking the city it consisted of three low buildings arranged around a central courtyard where water splashed in fountains and pools the entire atmosphere was designed to be peaceful and relaxing but sanders was tense when he walked up from the parking lot and found fernandez pacing you see the paper today she said yeah i saw it dont let it upset you this is a very bad tactical move on their part she said you know connie walsh no shes a bitch fernandez said briskly very unpleasant and very capable but i expect judge murphy to take a strong position on it in the sessions now this is what i worked out with phil blackburn well begin with your version of the events of monday night then johnson will tell hers wait a minute why should i go first sanders said if i go first shell have the advantage of hearing you are the one bringing the claim so you are obligated to present your case first i think it will be to our advantage fernandez said this way johnson will testify last before lunch they started toward the center building now there are just two things you have to remember first always tell the truth no matter what happens just tell the truth exactly as you remember it even if you think it hurts your case okay okay second dont get mad her lawyer will try to make you angry and trap you dont fall for it if you feel insulted or start to get mad request a fiveminute break to consult with me youre entitled to that whenever you want well go outside and cool off but whatever you do keep cool mr sanders okay good she swung open the door now lets go do it the mediation room was woodpaneled and spare he saw a polished wooden table with a pitcher of water and glasses and some notepads in the corner a sideboard with coffee and a plate of pastries windows opened out on a small atrium with a fountain he heard the sound of soft gurgling water the digicom legal team was already there ranged along one side of the table phil blackburn meredith johnson an attorney named ben heller and two other grimfaced female attorneys each woman had an imposing stack of xeroxed papers before her on the table fernandez introduced herself to meredith johnson and the two women shook hands then ben heller shook hands with sanders heller was a florid beefy man with silver hair and a deep voice well connected in seattle he reminded sanders of a politician heller introduced the other women but sanders immediately forgot their names meredith said hello tom meredith he was struck by how beautiful she looked she wore a blue suit with a creamcolored blouse with her glasses and her blond hair pulled back she looked like a lovely but studious schoolgirl heller patted her hand reassuringly as if speaking to sanders had been a terrible ordeal sanders and fernandez sat down opposite johnson and heller everybody got out papers and notes then there was an awkward silence until heller said to fernandez howd that king power thing turn out we were pleased fernandez said they fixed an award yet next week ben what are you asking two million two million sexual harassments serious business ben awards are going up fast right now the average verdict is over a million dollars especially when the company behaves that badly at the far end of the room a door opened and a woman in her midfifties entered she was brisk and erect and wore a dark blue suit not very different from merediths good morning she said im barbara murphy please refer to me as judge murphy or ms murphy she moved around the room shaking hands with everyone then took a seat at the head of the table she opened her briefcase and took out her notes let me tell you the ground rules for our sessions here judge murphy said this is not a court of law and our proceedings wont be recorded i encourage everyone to maintain a civil and courteous tone were not here to make wild accusations or to fix blame our goal is to define the nature of the dispute between the parties and to determine how best to resolve that dispute i want to remind everyone that the allegations made on both sides are extremely serious and may have legal consequences for all parties i urge you to treat these sessions confidentially i particularly caution you against discussing what is said here with any outside person or with the press l have taken the liberty of speaking privately to mr donadio the editor of thepostintelligencer about the article that appeared today by ms walsh i reminded mr donadio that all parties in company x are private individuals and that ms walsh is a paid employee of the paper the risk of a defamation suit against the pi is very real mr donadio seemed to take my point she leaned forward resting her elbows on the table now then the parties have agreed that mr sanders will speak first and he will then be questioned by mr heller ms johnson will speak next and will be questioned by ms fernandez in the interest of time i alone will have the right to ask questions during the testimony of the principals and i will set limits on the questions of opposing attorneys im open to some discussion but i ask your cooperation in letting me exercise judgment and keep things moving before we begin does anybody have any questions nobody did all right then lets get started mr sanders why dont you tell us what happened from your point of view sanders talked quietly for the next half hour he began with his meeting with blackburn where he learned that meredith was going to be the new vice president he reported the conversation with meredith after her speech in which she suggested a meeting about the twinkle drive he told what happened in the six oclock meeting in detail as he spoke he realized why fernandez had insisted he tell this story over and over the day before the flow of events came easily to him now he found that he could talk about penises and vaginas without hesitation even so it was an ordeal he felt exhausted by the time he described leaving the room and seeing the cleaning woman outside he then told about the phone call to his wife and the early meeting the next morning his subsequent conversation with blackburn and his decision to press charges thats about it he finished judge murphy said i have some questions before we go on mr sanders you mentioned that wine was drunk during the meeting yes how much wine would you say you had less than a glass and ms johnson how much would you say at least three glasses all right she made a note mr sanders do you have an employment contract with the company yes what is your understanding of what the contract says about transferring you or firing you they cant fire me without cause sanders said i dont know what it says about transfers but my point is that by transferring me they might as well be firing me i understand your point murphy said interrupting him im asking about your contract mr blackburn blackburn said the relevant clause refers to equivalent transfer i see so it is arguable fine lets go on mr heller your questions for mr sanders please ben heller shuffled his papers and cleared his throat mr sanders would you like a break no im fine all right now mr sanders you mentioned that when mr blackburn told you on monday morning that ms johnson was going to be the new head of the division you were surprised yes who did you think the new head would be i didnt know actually i thought i might be in line for it why did you think that i just assumed it did anybody in the company mr blackburn or anybody else lead you to think you were going to get the job no was there anything in writing to suggest you would get the job no so when you say you assumed it you were drawing a conclusion based on the general situation at the company as you saw it yes but not based on any real evidence no all right now youve said that when mr blackburn told you that ms johnson was going to get the job he also told you that she could choose new division heads if she wanted and you told him you interpreted that to mean ms johnson had the power to fire you yes thats what he said did he characterize it in any way for example did he say it was likely or unlikely he said it was unlikely and did you believe him i wasnt sure what to believe at that point is mr blackburns judgment on company matters reliable ordinarily yes but in any case mr blackburn did say that ms johnson had the right to fire you yes did ms johnson ever say anything like that to you no she never made any statement that could be interpreted as an offer contingent upon your performance including sexual performance no so when you say that during your meeting with her you felt that your job was at risk that was not because of anything ms johnson actually said or did no sanders said but it was in the situation you perceivedit as being in the situation yes as you had earlier perceived that you were in line for a promotion when in fact you were not the very promotion that ms johnson ended up getting i dont follow you im merely observing heller said that perceptions are subjective and do not have the weight of fact objection fernandez said employee perceptions have been held valid in contexts where the reasonable expectation ms fernandez murphy said mr heller hasnt challenged the validity of your clients perceptions he has questioned their accuracy but surely they are accurate because ms johnson was his superior and she could fire him if she wanted to thats not in dispute but mr heller is asking whether mr sanders has a tendency to build up unjustified expectations and that seems to me entirely relevant but with all due respect your honor ms fernandez murphy said were here to clarify this dispute im going to let mr heller continue mr heller thank you your honor so to summarize mr sanders although you felt your job was on the line you never got that sense from ms johnson no i didnt or from mr blackburn no or in fact from anyone else no all right lets turn to something else how did it happen that there was wine at the six oclock meeting ms johnson said that she would get a bottle of wine you didnt ask her to do that no she volunteered to do it and what was your reaction i dont know he shrugged nothing in particular were you pleased i didnt think about it one way or the other let me put it a different way mr sanders when you heard that an attractive woman like ms johnson was planning to have a drink with you after work what went through your head i thought i better do it shes my boss thats all you thought yes did you mention to anyone that you wanted to be alone with ms johnson in a romantic setting sanders sat forward surprised no are you sure about that yes sanders shook his head i dont know what youre driving at isnt ms johnson your former lover yes and didnt you want to resume your intimate relationship no i did not i was just hoping we would be able to find some way to be able to work together is that difficult i would have thought itd be quite easy to work together since you knew each other so well in the past well its not its quite awkward is it why is that well it just is i had never actually worked with her i knew her in a totally different context and i just felt awkward how did your prior relationship with ms johnson end mr sanders we just sort of drifted apart you had been living together at the time yes and we had our normal ups and downs and finally it just didnt work out so we split up no hard feelings no who left whom it was sort of mutual as i recall whose idea was it to move out i guess i dont really remember i guess it was mine so there was no awkwardness or tension about how the affair ended ten years ago no and yet you felt there was awkwardness now sure sanders said because we had one kind of relationship in the past and now we were going to have another kind of relationship you mean now ms johnson was going to be your superior yes werent you angry about that about her appointment a little i guess only a little or perhaps more than a little fernandez sat forward and started to protest murphy shot her a warning look fernandez put her fists under her chin and said nothing i was a lot of things sanders said i was angry and disappointed and confused and worried so in your mind although you were feeling many different and confusing feelings youre certain that you did not under any circumstances contemplate having sex with ms johnson that night no it never crossed your mind no there was a pause heller shuffled his notes then looked up youre married are you not mr sanders yes i am did you call your wife to tell her you had a late meeting yes did you tell her with whom no why not my wife is sometimes jealous about my past relationships i didnt see any reason to cause her anxiety or make her upset you mean if you told her you were having a late meeting with ms johnson your wife might think that you would renew your sexual acquaintance i dont know what she would think sanders said but in any case you didnt tell her about ms johnson no what did you tell her i told her i had a meeting and i would be home late how late i told her it might run to dinner or after i see had ms johnson suggested dinner to you no so you presumed when you called your wife that your meeting with ms johnson might be a long one no sanders said i didnt but i didnt know exactly how long it would be and my wife doesnt like me to call once and say ill be an hour late and then call again to say itll be two hours that annoys her so its easier for her if i just tell her i may be home after dinner that way she doesnt expect me and doesnt wait for me and if i get home early its great so this is your usual policy with your wife yes nothing unusual no in other words your usual procedure is to lie to your wife about events at the office because in your view she cant take the truth objection fernandez said whats the relevance thats not it at all sanders continued angrily how is it mr sanders look every marriage has its own way to work things out this is ours it makes things smoother thats all its about scheduling at home not about lying but wouldnt you say that you lied when you failed to tell your wife you were seeing ms johnson that night objection fernandez said murphy said i think this is quite enough mr heller your honor im trying to show that mr sanders intended to consummate an encounter with ms johnson and that all his behavior is consistent with that and in addition to show that he routinely treats women with contempt you havent shown that you havent even laid a groundwork for that murphy said mr sanders has explained his reasons and in the absence of contrary evidence i accept them do you have contrary evidence no your honor very well bear in mind that inflammatory and unsubstantiated characterizations do not assist our mutual efforts at resolution yes your honor i want everyone here to be clear these proceedings are potentially damaging to all partiesnot only in their outcome but in the conduct of the proceedings themselves depending on the outcome ms johnson and mr sanders may find themselves working together in some capacity in the future i will not permit these proceedings to unnecessarily poison such future relationships any further unwarranted accusations will cause me to halt these proceedings does anyone have any questions about what ive just said no one did all right mr heller heller sat back no further questions your honor all right judge murphy said well break for five minutes and return to hear ms johnsons version youre doing fine fernandez said youre doing very well your ice was strong you were clear and even murphy was impressed youre doing fine they were standing outside by the fountains in the courtyard sanders felt like a boxer between rounds being worked over by his trainer how do you feel she asked tired a little not too bad you want coffee no im okay good because the hard part is coming up youre going to have to be very strong when she gives her version you wont like what she says but its important that you stay calm okay she put her hand on his shoulder by the way just between us howdidthe relationship end to tell the truth i cant remember exactly fernandez looked skeptical but this was important surely it was almost ten years ago sanders said to me it feels like another lifetime she was still skeptical look sanders said this is the third week in june what was going on in your love life the third week of june ten years ago can you tell me fernandez was silent frowning were you married sanders prompted no met your husband yet uh lets see no not until i must have met my husband about a year later okay do you remember who you were seeing before him fernandez was silent thinking how aboutanything that happened between you and a lover in june ten years ago she was still silent see what i mean sanders said ten years is a long time i remember the affair with meredith but im not clear about the last few weeks of it i dont remember the details of how it ended what do you remember he shrugged we had more fights more yelling we were still living together but somehow we began to arrange our schedules so that we never saw each other you know how that happens because when we did run into each other we fought and finally one night we had a big argument while we were getting dressed to go to a party some formal party for digicom i remember i had to wear a tux i threw my cuff links at her and then i couldnt find them i had to get down on the floor and look but once we were driving to the party we sort of calmed down and we started talking about breaking up in this very ordinary way very reasonable way it just came out both of us nobody shouted and in the end we decided it was best if we broke it off fernandez was looking at him thoughtfully thats it yeah he shrugged except we never got to the party something at the back of his mind a couple in a car going to a party something about a cellular pbone all dressed up going to the party and they make a call and he couldnt get it it hung in his memory just beyond recollection the woman made a call on the cellular pbone and then something embarrassing afterward tom fernandez said shaking his shoulder looks like our time is about up ready to go back im ready he said as they were heading back to the mediation room heller came over he gave sanders an oily smile then turned to fernandez counselor he said i wonder if this is the time to talk about settlement settlement fernandez said showing elaborate surprise why well things arent going so well for your client and things are going fine for my client and this whole inquiry will only get more embarrassing and awkward for him the longer it continues my client isnt embarrassed at all and perhaps it is to everyones advantage to end it now fernandez smiled i dont think thats my clients wish ben but if you have an offer to make we will of course entertain it yes i have an offer all right heller cleared his throat considering toms current compensation base and associated benefits package and taking into consideration his lengthy service with the company were prepared to settle for an amount equal to several years of compensation well add an allowance for your fees and other miscellaneous expenses of termination the cost of a headhunter to relocate to a new position and all direct costs that may be associated with moving his household and all together make it four hundred thousand dollars i think thats very generous ill see what my client says fernandez said she took sanders by the arm and walked a short distance away well no sanders said not so fast she said thats a pretty reasonable offer its as much as youre likely to get in court without the delay and expenses no want to counter no fuck him i think we should counter fuck him fernandez shook her head lets be smart not angry what do you hope to gain from all this tom there must be a figure you would accept i want what ill get when they take the company public sanders said and thats somewhere between five and twelve million you thinkits a speculative estimate for a future event thats what itll be believe me fernandez looked at him would you take five million now yes alternatively would you take the compensation package he outlined plus the stock options you would get at the time of the offering sanders considered that yes all right ill tell him she walked back across the courtyard to heller the two spoke briefly after a moment heller turned on his heel and stalked away fernandez came back grinning he didnt go for it they headed back inside but ill tell you one thing this is a good sign it is yes if they want to settle before johnson gives her testimony its a very good sign in view of the acquisition meredith johnson said i felt it wasimportant that i meet with all the division heads on monday she spoke calmly and slowly looking at everyone seated around the table in turn sanders had the sense of an executive giving a presentation i met with don cherry mark lewyn and mary anne hunter during the afternoon but tom sanders said he had a very busy schedule and asked if we could meet at the end of the day at his request i scheduled the meeting with tom at six oclock he was amazed at the cool way that she lied he had expected her to be effective but he was still astonished to see her in action tom suggested that we could have a drink as well and go over old times that wasnt really my style but i agreed i was especially concerned to establish good relations with tom because i knew he was disappointed he had not gotten the job and because we had a past history i wanted our working relationship to be cordial for me to refuse a drink with him seemed i dont knowstandoffish or stiff so i said yes tom came to the office at six oclock we had a glass of wine and talked about the problems with the twinkle drive however from the outset he kept making comments of a personal nature that i considered inappropriate for example comments about my appearance and about how often he thought about our past relationship reference to sexual incidents in the past and so on son of a bitchsanderss whole body was tense his hands were clenched his jaw was tight fernandez leaned over and put her hand on his wrist meredith johnson was saying had some calls from garvin and others i took them at my desk then my assistant came in and asked if she could leave early to deal with some personal matters i said she could she left the room that was when tom came over and suddenly started kissing me she paused for a moment looking around the room she met sanderss eyes with a steady gaze i was taken aback by his sudden and unexpected overture she said staring evenly at him at first i tried to protest and to defuse the situation but tom is much larger than i am much stronger he pulled me over onto the couch and started to disrobe and to take my clothes off as well as you can imagine i was horrified and frightened the situation was out of control and the fact that it was happening made our future working relationship very difficult to say nothing of how i felt personally as a woman i mean to be assaulted in this way sanders stared at her trying desperately to control his anger he heard fernandez at his earbreathe he took a deep breath and let it out slowly he had not been aware until then that he was holding his breath i kept trying to make light of it meredith continued to make jokes to get free i was trying to say to him oh come on tom lets not do this but he was determined and when he tore my underwear off when i heard the sound of the cloth ripping i realized that i could not get out of this situation in any diplomatic way i had to acknowledge that mr sanders was raping me and i became very scared and very angry when he moved away from me on the couch to free his penis from his trousers prior to penetration i kneed him in the groin he rolled off the couch onto the floor then he got to his feet and i got to my feet mr sanders was angry that i had refused his advances he started shouting at me and then he hit me knocking me down onto the floor but by then i was angry too i remember saying you cant do this to me and swearing at him but i cant say i remember everything that he said or that i said he came back at me one more time but by then i had my shoes in my hand and i hit him in the chest with my high heels trying to drive him away i think i tore his shirt im not sure i was so angry by then i wanted to kill him im sure i scratched him i remember i said i wanted to kill him i was so angry here it was my first day in this new job i was under so much pressure i was trying to do a good job and this thisthing had happened that ruined our relationship and was going to cause a lot of trouble for everybody in the company he went off in an angry rage after he left the question for me was how to handle it she paused shaking her head apparently lost in the emotions of that moment heller said gently how did you decide to handle it well its a problem toms an important employee and he is not an easy person to replace furthermore in my judgment it would not be wise to make a replacement in the middle of the acquisition my first impulse was to see if we could forget the whole thing after all were both adults i was personally embarrassed but i thought that tom would probably be embarrassed too when he sobered up and had a chance to think it over and i thought that maybe we could just go on from there after all awkward things happen sometimes people can overlook them so when the meeting time changed i called his house to tell him he wasnt there but i had a very pleasant conversation with his wife it was clear from our conversation that she did not know that tom had been meeting me or that tom and i knew each other from the past anyway i gave his wife the new meeting time and asked her to tell tom the next day at the meeting things did not go well tom showed up late and changed his story about the twinkle drive minimizing the problems and contradicting me he was clearly undercutting my authority in a corporate meeting and i could not permit that i went directly to phil blackburn and told him everything that had happened i said i did not want to press formal charges but i made it clear that i could not work with tom and that a change would have to be made phil said he would talk to tom and eventually it was decided that we would try to mediate a resolution she sat back and placed her hands flat on the table thats all i think thats everything she looked around at everyone meeting their eyes in turn very cool very controlled it was a spectacular performance and in sanders it produced a quite unexpected effect he felt guilty he felt as if he had done the things that she said he had done he felt sudden shame and looked down at the table hanging his head fernandez kicked him in the ankle hard he jerked his head up wincing she was frowning at him he sat up judge murphy cleared her throat evidently she said we are presented with two entirely incompatible reports ms johnson i have only a few questions before we go on yes your honor youre an attractive woman im sure youve had to fend off your share of unwanted approaches in the course of your business career meredith smiled yes your honor and im sure you have developed some skill at it yes your honor youve said you were aware of tensions from your past relationship with mr sanders considering those tensions i would have thought that a meeting held in the middle of the day without wine would have been more professionalwould have set a better tone im sure thats correct in hindsight meredith said but at the time this was all in the context of the acquisition meetings everybody was busy i was just trying to fit the meeting with mr sanders in before the conleywhite sessions the next day thats all i was thinking about schedules i see and after mr sanders left your office why didnt you call mr blackburn or someone else in the company to report what had happened as i said i was hoping it could all be overlooked yet the episode you describe murphy said is a serious breach of normal business behavior as an experienced manager you must have known the chance of a good working relationship with mr sanders was nil i would have thought youd feel obliged to report what happened to a superior at once and from a practical standpoint i would have thought youd want to go on record as soon as possible as i said i was still hoping she frowned thinking you know i guess i felt responsible for tom as an old friend i didnt want to be the reason why he lost his job on the other hand you are the reason why he lost his job yes again in hindsight i see all right ms fernandez thank you your honor fernandez turned in her chair to face johnson ms johnson in a situation like this when private behavior occurs behind closed doors we need to look at surrounding events where we can so ill ask you a few questions about surrounding events fine youve said that when you made the appointment with mr sanders he requested wine yes where did the wine come from that you drank that night i asked my assistant to get it this is ms ross yes shes been with you a long time yes she came up with you from cupertino yes she is a trusted employee yes how many bottles did you ask ms ross to buy i dont remember if i specified a particular number all right how many bottles did she get three i think three and did you ask your assistant to buy anything else like what did you ask her to buy condoms no do you know if she bought condoms no i dont in fact she did she bought condoms from the second avenue drugstore well if she bought condoms johnson said it must have been for herself do you know of any reason why your assistant would say she bought the condoms for you no johnson said speaking slowly she was thinking it over i cant imagine she would do that just a moment murphy said interrupting ms fernandez are you alleging that the assistant did say that she bought the condoms for ms johnson yes your honor we are you have a witness to that effect yes we do sitting beside johnson heller rubbed the bottom of his lip with one finger johnson showed no reaction at all she didnt even blink she just continued to gaze calmly at fernandez waiting for the next question ms johnson did you instruct your assistant to lock the door to your office when mr sanders was with you i most certainly did not do you know if she locked the door no i dont do you know why she would tell someone that you ordered her to lock the door no ms johnson your meeting with mr sanders was at six oclock did you have any appointments later that day no his was the last isnt it true that you had a seven oclock appointment that you canceled oh yes thats true i had one with stephanie kaplan but i canceled it because i wasnt going to have the figures ready for her to go over there wasnt time to prepare are you aware that your assistant told ms kaplan that you were canceling because you had another meeting that was going to run late i dont know what my assistant said to her meredith replied showing impatience for the first time we seem to be talking a great deal about my assistant perhaps you should be asking her these questions perhaps we should im sure it can be arranged all right lets turn to something else mr sanders said he saw a cleaning woman when he left your office did you also see her no i stayed in my office after he had gone the cleaning woman marian walden says she overheard a loud argument prior to mr sanderss departure she says she heard a man say this isnt a good idea i dont want to do this and she heard a woman say you fucking bastard you cant leave me like this do you recall saying anything like that no i recall saying you cant do this to me but you dont recall saying you cant leave me like this no i do not ms walden is quite clear that was what you said i dont know what ms walden thought she heard johnson said the doors were closed the entire time werent you speaking quite loudly i dont know possibly ms walden said you were shouting and mr sanders has said you were shouting i dont know all right now ms johnson you said that you informed mr blackburn that you could not work with mr sanders after the unfortunate tuesday morning meeting is that right yes thats right sanders sat forward he suddenly realized that he had overlooked that while meredith was making her original statement he had been so upset he hadnt realized that she had lied about when she saw blackburn because sanders had gone to blackburns office right after the meetingand blackburn already knew ms johnson what time would you say you went to see mr blackburn i dont know after the meeting about what time ten oclock not earlier no sanders glanced over at blackburn who sat rigidly at the end of the table he looked tense and bit his lip fernandez said shall i ask mr blackburn to confirm that i imagine his assistant has a log if he has difficulty with exact memory there was a short silence she looked over at blackburn no meredith said no i was confused what i meant to say was i talked to phil after the initial meeting and before the second meeting the initial meeting being the one at which sanders was absent the eight oclock meeting yes so mr sanderss behavior at the second meeting where he contradicted you could not have been relevant to your decision to speak to mr blackburn because you had already spoken to mr blackburn by the time that meeting took place as i say i was confused i have no more questions of this witness your honor judge murphy closed her notepad her expression was bland and unreadable she looked at her watch its now eleventhirty we will break for lunch for two hours im allowing extra time so that counsel can meet to review the situation and to decide how the parties wish to proceed she stood up i am also available if counsel wish to meet with me for any reason otherwise ill see you all back here at onethirty sharp have a pleasant and productive lunch she turned and walked out of the room blackburn stood and said personally id like to meet with opposing counsel right now sanders glanced over at fernandez fernandez gave the faintest of smiles im amenable to that mr blackburn she said the three lawyers stood beside the fountain fernandez was talking animatedly to heller their heads close together blackburn was a few paces away a cellular phone pressed to his ear across the courtyard meredith johnson talked on another phone gesturing angrily as she talked sanders stood off to one side by himself and watched there was no question in his mind that blackburn would seek a settlement piece by piece fernandez had torn meredith johnsons version apart demonstrating that she had ordered her assistant to buy wine to buy condoms to lock the door when sanders was there and to cancel later appointments clearly meredith johnson was not a supervisor surprised by a sexual overture she had been planning it all afternoon her crucial reactionher angry statement that you cant leave mehad been overheard by the cleaning woman and she had lied about the timing and motivation of her report to blackburn there could be no doubt in anyones mind that meredith was lying the only question now was what blackburn and digicom would do about it sanders had sat through enough management sensitivity seminars on sexual harassment to know what the companys obligation was they really had no choice they would have to fire her but what would they do about sanders that was another question entirely he had the strong intuition that by bringing this accusation he had burned his bridges at the company he would never be welcomed back sanders had shot down garvins pet bird and garvin would not forgive him for it so they wouldnt let him back they would have to pay him off theyre calling it quits already huh sanders turned and saw alan one of the investigators coming up from the parking lot alan had glanced over at the lawyers and quickly appraised the situation i think so sanders said alan squinted at the lawyers they should johnson has a problem and a lot of people in the company know about it especially her assistant sanders said you talked to her last night yeah he said herb found the cleaning woman and got her taped and i had a late night with betsy ross shes a lonely lady here in a new town she drinks too much and i taped it all did she know that she doesnt have to alan said its still admissible he watched the lawyers for a moment blackburn must be shitting staples about now louise fernandez was stalking across the courtyard grimfaced hunched overgoddamn it she said as she came up what happened sanders said fernandez shook her head they wont make a deal they wont make a deal thats right they just deny every point her assistant bought wine that was for sanders her assistant bought condoms that was for the assistant the assistant says she bought them for johnson the assistant is an unreliable drunk the cleaning ladys report she couldnt know what she heard she had the radio on and always the constant refrain you know louise this wont stand up in court and bulletproof betty is on the phone running the whole thing telling everybody what to do fernandez swore i have to tell you this is the kind of shit male executives pull they look you right in the eye and say it never happened it just isnt there you have no case it burns my assdamn it better get some lunch louise alan said to sanders he said she sometimes forgets to eat yeah fine sure eat they started toward the parking lot she was walking fast shaking her head i cant understand how they can take this position she said because i knowi could see it in judge murphys eyes that she didnt think thered be an afternoon session at all judge murphy heard the evidence and concluded its all over so did but its not over blackburn and heller arent movingone inch theyre not going to settle theyre basically inviting us to sue so well sue sanders said shrugging not if were smart fernandez said notnow this is exactly what i was afraid would happen they got a lot of free discovery and we got nothing were back to square one and they have the next three years to work on that assistant and that cleaning lady and anything else we come up with and let me tell you in three years we wont even be able tofind that assistant but we have her on tape she still has to appear in court and believe me she never will look digicom has huge exposure if we show that digicom didnt respond in a timely and adequate fashion to what they knew about johnson they could be liable for extremely large damages there was a case on point last month in california nineteen point four milliondollars found for the plaintiff with exposure like that take my word for it the assistant will be unavailable shell be on vacation in costa rica for the rest of her life so what do we do sanders said for better or worse were committed now weve taken this line and we have to continue it somehow we have to force them to come to terms she said but were going to need something else to do that you got anything else sanders shook his head no nothing hell fernandez said whats going on i thought digicom was worried about this allegation becoming public before they finished the acquisition i thought they had a publicity problem sanders nodded i thought they did too then theres something we dont understand because heller and blackburn both act like they couldnt care less what we do now why is that a heavyset man with a mustache walked past them carrying a sheaf of papers he looked like a cop whos he fernandez said never seen him before they were calling on the phone for somebody trying to locate somebody thats why i ask sanders shrugged what do we do now we eat alan said right lets go eat fernandez said and forget it for a while in the same moment a thought popped into his mindforget that phoneit seemed to come from nowhere like a command forget that phone walking beside him fernandez sighed we still have things we can develop its not over yet youve still got things right alan absolutely alan said weve hardly begun we havent gotten to johnsons husband yet or to her previous employer theres lots of stones left to turn over and see what crawls out forget that phone i better check in with my office sanders said and took out his cellular phone to dial cindy a light rain began to fall they came to the cars in the parking lot fernandez said whos going to drive i will alan said they went to his car a plain ford sedan alan unlocked the doors and fernandez started to get in and i thought that at lunch today we would be going to have a party she said going to a party sanders looked at fernandez sitting in the front seat behind the rain spattered windshield he held the phone up to his ear and waited while the call went through to cindy he was relieved that his phone was working correctly ever since monday night when it went dead he hadnt trusted it completely but it seemed to be fine nothing wrong with it at all the couple was going to a party andshe made a call on a cellular phone from the car forget that phone cindy said mr sanderss office and when she called she got an answering machine she left a message on the answering machine and thenshe hung up hello mr sanderss office hello cindy its me oh hi tom still reserved any messages he said uh yes let me look at the book you had a call from arthur in kl he wanted to know if the drives arrived i checked with don cherrys team they got them theyre working on them now and you had a call from eddie in austin he sounded worried and you had anothercall from john levin he called you yesterday too and he said it was important levin was the executive with a hard drive supplier whatever was on his mind it could wait okay thanks cindy are you going to be back in the office today a lot of people are asking i dont know john conley from conleywhite called he wanted to meet with you at four i dont know ill see ill call you later okay she hung up he heard a dial tone and then she had hung up the story tugged at the back of his mind the two people in the car going to the party who had told him that story how did it go on her way to the party adele had made a call from the car and thenshe had hung up sanders snapped his fingers of course adele the couple in the car had been mark and adele lewyn and they had had an embarrassing incident it was starting to come back to him now adele had called somebody and gotten the answering machine she left a message and hung up the phone thenshe and mark talked in the car about the person adele had just called they made jokes and unflattering comments for about fifteen minutes and later they were very embarrassed fernandez said are you just going to stand there in the rain sanders didnt answer he took the cellular phone down from his ear the keypad and screen glowed bright green plenty of power he looked at the phone and waited after five seconds it clicked itself off the screen went blank that was because the new generation of phones had an autoshutdown feature to conserve battery power if you didnt use the phone or press the keypad for fifteen seconds the phone shut itself off so it wouldnt go dead but his phone had gone dead in merediths office why forget that phone why had his cellular phone failed to shut itself off what possible explanation could there be mechanical problems one of the keys stuck keeping the phone on it had been damaged when he dropped it when meredith first kissed him the battery was low because he forgot to charge it the night before no he thought the phone was reliable there was no mechanical fault and it was fully charged no the phone had worked correctly they made jokes and unflattering comments for about fifteen minutes his mind began to race with scattered fragments of conversation coming back to him listen why didnt you call me last night i did mark sanders was certain that he had called mark lewyn from merediths office standing in the parking lot in the rain he again pressed lew on his keypad the phone turned itself back on the little screen flashinglewynand marks home number there wasnt any message when i got home i talked to your answering machine about sixfifteen i never got a message sanders was sure that he had called lewyn and had talked to his answering machine he remembered a mans voice saying the standard message leave a message when you hear the tone standing there with the phone in his hand staring at lewyns phone number he pressed thesendbutton a moment later the answering machine picked up a womans voice said hi youve reached mark and adele at home were not able to come to the phone right now but if you leave a message well call you backbeep that was a different message hehadnt called mark lewyn that night which could only mean he hadnt pressed lew that night nervous in merediths office he must have pressed something else he had gotten somebody elses answering machine and his phone had gone dead because forget that phone jesus christ he said he suddenly put it together he knew exactly what had happened and it meant that there was the chance that tom are you all right fernandez said im fine he said just give me a minute i think ive got something important he hadnt pressed lew he had pressed something else something very close probably one letter off with fumbling fingers sanders pushed lel the screen stayed blank he had no number stored for that combination lem no number stored les no number stored lev bingo printed across the little screen was levin and a phone number for john levin sanders had called john levins answering machine that night john levin called he said it was important ill bet he did sanders thought he remembered now with sudden clarity the exact sequence of events in merediths office he had been talking on the phone and she said forget that phone and pushed his hand down as she started kissing him he had dropped the phone on the windowsill as they kissed and left it there later on when he left merediths office buttoning his shirt he had picked up the cellular phone from the sill but by then it was dead which could only mean that it had remained constantly on for almost an hour it had remained on during the entire incident with meredith in the car when adele finished the callshe hung the phone back in the cradle she didnt press theendbutton so the phone line stayed open and their entire conversation was recorded on the persona answering machine fifteen minutes of jokes and personal commentary all recorded on his answering machine and sanderss phone had been dead because the line stayed open the whole conversation had been recorded standing in the parking lot he quickly dialed john levins number fernandez got out of the car and came over to him whats going on fernandez said are we going to lunch or what just a minute the call went through a click of the pickup then a mans voice john levin john its tom sanders well hey there tom boy levin burst out laughing my man are you having a redhot sex life these days or what i tell you tom my ears were burning sanders said was it recorded jesus christ tom you better believe it i came in tuesday morning to check my messages and i tell you it went on for half an hour i mean john whoever said married life was dull john listendid you keep it there was a pause levin stopped laughing tom what do you think i am a pervert ofcourse i kept it i played it for the whole office they loved it john seriously levin sighed yeah i kept it it sounded like you might be having a little trouble and i dont know anyway i kept it good where is it right here on my desk levin said john i want that tape now listen to me this is what i want you to do driving in the car fernandez said im waiting sanders said theres a tape of the whole meeting with meredith it was all recorded how it was an accident i was talking to an answering machine he said and when meredith started kissing me i put the phone down but didnt end the call so the phone stayed connected to the answering machine and everything we said went right onto the answering machine hot damn alan said slapping the steering wheel as he drove this is an audio tape fernandez said yes good quality i dont know well see johns bringing it to lunch fernandez rubbed her hands together i feel better already yes yes she said because if its any good at all we can really draw blood john levin florid and jovial pushed away his plate and drained the last of his beer now thats what i call a mealexcellenthalibut levin weighed nearly three hundred pounds and his belly pressed up against the edge of the table they were sitting in a booth in the back room of mccormick and schmicks on first avenue the restaurant was noisy filled with the lunchtime business crowd fernandez pressed the headphones to her ears as she listened to the tape on a walkman she had been listening intently for more than half an hour making notes on a yellow legal pad her food still uneaten finally she got up i have to make a call levin glanced at fernandezs plate uh do you want that fernandez shook her head and walked away levin grinned waste not want not he said and pulled the plate in front of him he began to eat so tom are you in shit or what deep shit sanders said he stirred a cappuccino he hadnt been able to eat lunch he watched levin wolf down great bites of mashed potatoes i figured that levin said jack kerry over at aldus called me this morning and said you were suing the company because you refused to jump some woman kerry is an asshole the worst levin nodded the absolute worst but what can you do after connie walshs column this morning everybodys been trying to figure out who mr piggy is levin took another huge bite of food but howd she get the story in the first place i mean shes the one who broke it sanders said maybe you told her john are you kidding levin said you had the tape levin frowned you keep this up tom youre going to piss me off he shook his head no you ask me it was a woman who told her what woman knew only meredith and she wouldnt tell ill bet you anything itll turn out to be a woman levin said if you ever find outwhich i doubt he chewed thoughtfully swordfish is a little rubbery i think we should tell the waiter he looked around the room uh tom yes theres a guy standing over there hopping from one foot to the other i think maybe you know him sanders looked over his shoulder bob garvin was standing by the bar looking at him expectantly phil blackburn stood a few paces behind excuse me sanders said and he got up from the table garvin shook hands with sanders tom good to see you how are you holding up with all this im okay sanders said good good garvin placed his hand in a fatherly way on sanderss shoulder its nice to see you again nice to see you too bob garvin said theres a quiet place in the corner over there i asked them for a couple of cappuccinos we can talk for a minute is that okay thats fine sanders said he was well acquainted with the profane angry garvin this cautious polite garvin made him uneasy they sat in the corner of the bar garvin settled into his chair and faced him well tom we go way back you and i yes we do those damn trips to seoul eating that crappy food and your ass hurting like hell you remember all that yes i do yeah those were the days garvin said he was watching sanders carefully anyway tom we know each other so im not going to bullshit you let me just put all the cards on the table garvin said weve got a problem here and its got to be solved before it turns into a real mess for everybody i want to appeal to your better judgment about how we proceed from here my better judgment sanders said yes garvin said id like to look at this thing from all sides how many sides are there there are at least two garvin said with a smile look tom im sure its no secret that ive supported meredith inside our company ive always believed that shes got talent and the kind of executive vision that we want for the future ive never seen her do anything before thatwould suggest otherwise i know shes only human but shes very talented and i support her uhhuh now perhaps in this case perhaps it is true that shes made a mistake i dont know sanders said nothing he just waited staring at garvins face garvin was doing a convincing impression of an openminded man sanders didnt buy it in fact lets say she has garvin said lets say she did make a mistake she did bob sanders said firmly all right lets say she did an error of judgment lets call it an overstepping of bounds the point is tom faced with a situation like this i still strongly support her why because shes a woman what does that have to do with it well women in business have traditionally been excluded from executive positions tom meredith hasnt been excluded sanders said and after all garvin said shes young shes not that young sanders said sure she is shes practically a college kid she just got her mba a couple of years ago bob sanders said meredith johnsons thirtyfive shes not a kid at all garvin did not seem to hear that he looked at sanders sympathetically tom i can understand that you were disappointed about the job he said and i can understand that in your eyes meredith made a mistake in the way she approached you she didnt approach me bob she jumped me garvin showed a flash of irritation youre no kid either you know thats right im not sanders said but i am her employee and i know she holds you in the highest regard garvin said settling back in his chair as does everybody in the company tom youre vital to our future you know it i know it i want to keep our team together and i keep coming back to the idea that we have to make allowances for women we have to cut them a little slack but were not talking about women sanders said were talking about one particular woman torn and if a man had done what she did you wouldnt be talking about cutting him slack youd fire him and throw him out on his ass possibly so well thats the problem sanders said garvin said im not sure i follow you there tom his tone carried a warning garvin didnt like being disagreed with over the years as his company grew in wealth and success garvin had grown accustomed to deference now approaching retirement he expected obedience and agreement we have an obligation to attain equality garvin said fine but equality means no special breaks sanders said equality means treating people the same youre asking for inequality toward meredith because you wont do what you would do to a manfire him garvin sighed if it was a clear case tom i would but i understand this particular situation isnt so clear sanders considered telling him about the tape something made him hold back he said i think it is but there are always differences of opinion on these matters garvin said leaning across the bar thats a fact isnt it always a difference of opinion tom look what did she do that was so bad i mean really she made a pass fine you could have decided it was flattering shes a beautiful woman after all there are worse things that could happen a beautiful woman puts her hand on your knee or you could have just said no thank you you could have handled it any number of ways youre a grownup but this vindictiveness tom i have to tell you im surprised at you sanders said bob she broke the law that really remains to be seen doesnt it garvin said you can throw open your personal life for a jury to inspect if thats what you want to do i wouldnt want to do it myself and i dont see that it helps anybody to take this into court its a nowin situation all around whatre you saying you dont want to go to court tom garvins eyes were narrow dangerous why not you just dont garvin took a deep breath look lets stay on track here ive talked to meredith she feels as i do that this thing has gotten out of hand uhhuh and im talking to you now too because my hope tom is that we can put this to rest and go back to the way things were now hear me out please go back to the way things were before this unfortunate misunderstanding happened you stay at your job meredith stays at hers you two continue to work together like civilized adults you move forward and build the company take it public and everybody makes a pile of money a year down the line whats wrong with that sanders felt something like relief and a sense of normalcy returning he longed to escape from the lawyers and from the tension of the last three days to sink back into the way things were seemed as appealing as a warm bath i mean look at it this way tom right after this thing happened on monday night nobody blew the whistle you didnt call anybody meredith didnt call anybody i think you both wanted this thing to go away then there was an unfortunate mixup the next day and an argument that neednt have happened if youd been on time for the meeting if you and meredith had been in sync on the story none of this would have happened you two would still be working together and whatever happened between you would remain your private business instead we have this its all a big mistake really so why not just forget it and go forward and get rich tom whats wrong with that nothing sanders said finally good except it wont work sanders said why not a dozen answers flashed through his mind because shes not competent because shes a snake because shes a corporate player all image and this is a technical division that has to get out the product because shes a liar because i have no respect for her because shell do it again because she has no respect for me because youre not treating me fairly because shes your pet because you chose her over me because things have gone too far he said garvin stared at him things can go back no bob they cant garvin leaned forward his voice dropped listen you little feringi pissant i know exactly whats going on here i took you in when you didnt knowbulkogi from bullshit i gave you your start i gave you help i gave you opportunities all along the line now you want to play rough fine you want to see the shit come down just fucking wait tom he stood up sanders said bob youve never been willing to listen to reason on the subject of meredith johnson oh you think have a problem with meredith garvin laughed harshly listen tom she was your girlfriend but she was smart and independent and you couldnt handle her you were pissed when she dropped you and now all these years later youre going to pay her back thats what this is about it has nothing to do with business ethics or breaking the law or sexual harassment or any other damned thing its personal and its petty and youre so full of shit your eyes are brown and he stalked out of the restaurant pushing angrily past blackburn blackburn remained behind for a moment staring at sanders and then hurried after his boss as sanders walked back to his table he passed a booth with several guys from microsoft including two major assholes from systems programming someone made a snorting pig sound hey mr piggy said a low voice suwee suwee couldnt get it up huh sanders walked on a few paces then turned back hey guys he said at least im not bending over and grabbing my ankles in latenight meetings with and he named a programming head at microsoft they all roared with laughter whoa ho mr piggy speaks oink oink sanders said whatre you guys doing in town anyway they run short on ky jelly in redmond whoa the piggy is pissed they were doubled over laughing like college kids they had a big pitcher of beer on the table one of them said if meredith johnson pulled off her pants for me i sure wouldnt call the police about it no way jose service with a smile hard charger ladies first kajung kajung they pounded the table laughing sanders walked away outside the restaurant garvin paced back and forth angrily on the pavement blackburn stood with the phone at his ear where is that fucking car garvin said i dont know bob i told him to wait i know bob im trying to get him christ almighty the simplest things cant even get the fucking cars to work right maybe he had to go to the bathroom so how long does that take goddamn sanders could you believe him no i couldnt bob i just dont understand he wont deal with me on this and im bending over backward here i offer him his job back i offer him his stock back i offer him everything and what does he do jesus hes not a team player bob you got that right and hes not willing to meet us weve got to get him to come to the table yes we do bob hes not feeling it garvin said thats the problem the story ran this morning it cant have made him happy well hes not feeling it garvin paced again theres the car blackburn said pointing down the street the lincoln sedan was driving toward them finally garvin said now look phil im tired of wasting time on sanders we tried being nice and it didnt work thats the long and the short of it so what are we going to do to make him feel it ive been thinking about that phil said whats sanders doing i mean really doing hes smearing meredith right goddamn right he didnt hesitate to smear her he sure as hell didnt and its not true what hes saying about her but the thing about a smear is that it doesnt have to be true it just has to be something people are willing to believe is true so so maybe sanders needs to see what that feels like like what feels like whatre you talking about blackburn stared thoughtfully at the approaching car i think that toms a violent man oh hell garvin said hes not ive known him for years hes a pussycat no blackburn said rubbing his nose i disagree i think hes violent he was a football player in college hes a roughandtumble sort of guy plays football on the company team knocks people around he has a violent streak most men do after all men are violent what kind of shit is this and you have to admit he was violent to meredith blackburn continued shouting yelling pushing her knocking her over sex and violence a man out of control hes much bigger than she is just stand them side by side anybody can see the difference hes much bigger much stronger all you have to do is look and you see he is a violent abusive man that nice exterior is just a cover sanders is one of those men who take out their hostility by beating up defenseless women garvin was silent he squinted at blackburn youll never make this fly i think i can nobody in their right mindll buy it blackburn said i think somebody will yeah who somebody blackburn said the car pulled up to the curb garvin opened the door well all i know he said is that we need to get him to negotiate we need to apply pressure to bring him to the table blackburn said i think that can be arranged garvin nodded its in your hands phil just make sure it happens he got in the car blackburn got in the car after garvin garvin said to the driver where the fuck have you been the door slammed shut the car drove off sanders drove with fernandez in alans car back to the mediation center fernandez listened to sanderss report of the conversation with garvin shaking her head you never should have seen him alone he couldnt have behaved that way if i was there did he really say you have to make allowances for women yes thats noble of him hes found a virtuous reason why we should protect a harasser its a nice touch everyone should sit back and allow her to break the law because shes a woman very nice sanders felt stronger hearing her words the conversation with garvin had rattled him he knew that fernandez was working on him building him back up but it worked anyway the whole conversation is ridiculous fernandez said and then he threatened you sanders nodded forget it its just bluster youre sure absolutely she said just talk but at least now you know why they say men just dont get it garvin gave you the same lines that every corporate guy has been giving for years look at it from the harassers point of view what did they do that was so wrong let bygones be bygones everybody just go back to work well be one big happy family again incredible alan said driving the car it is in this day and age fernandez said you cant pull that stuff anymore how old is garvin anyway almost sixty that helps explain it but blackburn should have told him itscompletely unacceptable according to the law garvin really doesnt have any choice at a minimum he has to transfer johnson not you and almost certainly he should fire her i dont think he will sanders said no of course he wont shes his favorite sanders said more to the point shes his vice president fernandez said she stared out the window as they went up the hill toward the mediation center you have to realize all these decisions are about power sexual harassment is about power and so is the companys resistance to dealing with it power protects power and once a woman gets up in the power structure shell be protected by the structure the same as a man its like the way doctors wont testify against other doctors it doesnt matter if the doctor is a man or a woman doctors just dont want to testify against other doctors period and corporate executives dont want to investigate claims against other executives male or female so its just that women havent had these jobs yes but theyre starting to get them now and now they can be as unfair as any man ever was female chauvinist sows alan said dont you start fernandez said tell him the figures alan said what figures sanders said about five percent of sexual harassment claims are brought by men against women its a relatively small figure but then only five percent of corporate supervisors are women so the figures suggest that women executives harass men in the same proportion as men harass women and as more women get corporate jobs the percentage of claims by men is going up because the fact is harassment is a power issue and power is neither male nor female whoever is behind the desk has the opportunity to abuse power and women will take advantage as often as men a case in point being the delightful ms johnson and her boss isnt firing her garvin says its because the situation isnt clear id say that tape is pretty damn clear fernandez said she frowned did you tell him about the tape no good then i think we can wrap this case up in the next two hours alan pulled into the parking lot and parked the car they all got out all right fernandez said lets see where we are with her significant others alan weve still got her previous employer conrad computer right were on it and also the one before that symantec yes and we have her husband ive got a call into costar for him and the internet business afriend working on it and we have her bschool and vassar right recent history is the most important focus on conrad and the husband okay alan said conrads a problem because they supply systems to the government and the cia they gave me some song and dance about neutral reference policy and nondisclosure of prior employees then get harry to call them hes good on negligent referral he can shake them up if they continue to stonewall okay he may have to alan got back in the car fernandez and sanders started walking up to the mediation center sanders said youre checking her past companies yes other companies dont like to give damaging information on prior employees for years they would never give anything at all except the dates of employment but now theres something called compelled selfpublication and something called negligent referral a company can be liable now for failing to reveal a problem with a past employee so we can try to scare them but in the end they may not give us the damaging information we want how do you know they have damaging information to give fernandez smiled because johnson is a harasser and with harassers theres always a pattern its never the first time you think shes done this before dont sound so disappointed fernandez said what did you think that she did all this because she thought you were so cute i guarantee you she has done it before they walked past the fountains in the courtyard toward the door to the center building and now fernandez said lets go cut ms johnson to shreds precisely at onethirty judge murphy entered the mediation room she looked at the seven silent people sitting around the table and frowned has opposing counsel met we have heller said with what result murphy said we have failed to reach a settlement heller said very well lets resume she sat down and opened her notepad is there further discussion relating to the morning session yes your honor fernandez said i have some additional questions for ms johnson very well ms johnson meredith johnson put on her glasses actually your honor i would like to make a statement first all right ive been thinking about the morning session johnson said speaking slowly and deliberately and mr sanderss account of the events of monday night and ive begun to feel that there may be a genuine misunderstanding here i see judge murphy spoke absolutely without inflection she stared at meredith all right when tom first suggested a meeting at the end of the day and when he suggested that we have some wine and talk over old times im afraid i may have unconsciously responded to him in a way that he might not have intended judge murphy didnt move nobody was moving the room was completely still i believe it is correct to say that i took him at his word and began to imagine a uh romantic interlude and to be frank i was not opposed to that possibility mr sanders and i had a very special relationship some years ago and i remembered it as a very exciting relationship so i believe it is fair to say that i was looking forward to our meeting and that perhaps i presumed that it would lead to an encounter which i was unconsciously quite willing to have occur alongside meredith heller and blackburn sat completely stonefaced showing no reaction at all the two female attorneys showed no reaction this had all been worked out in advance sanders realized what was going on why was she changing her story johnson cleared her throat then continued in the same deliberate way i believe it is correct to say that i was a willing participant in all the events of the evening and it may be that i was too forward at one point for mr sanderss taste in the heat of the moment i may have overstepped the bounds of propriety and my position in the company i think thats possible after serious reflection i find myself concluding that my own recollection of events and mr sanderss recollection of events are in much closer agreement than i had earlier recognized there was a long silence judge murphy said nothing meredith johnson shifted in her chair took her glasses off then put them back on again ms johnson murphy said finally do i understand you to say that you are now agreeing to mr sanderss version of the events on monday night in many respects yes perhaps in most respects sanders suddenly realized what had happenedthey knew about the tape but how could they know sanders himself had learned of it only two hours ago and levin had been out of his office having lunch with them so levin couldnt have told them how could they know and ms johnson murphy said are you also agreeing to the charge of harassment by mr sanders not at all your honor no then im not sure i understand youve changed your story you say you now agree that mr sanderss version of the events is correct in most respects but you do not agree that he has a claim against you no your honor as i said i think it was all a misunderstanding amisunderstanding murphy repeated with an incredulous look on her face yes your honor and one in which mr sanders played a very active role msjohnson according to mr sanders you initiated kissing over his protests you pushed him down on the couch over his protests you unzipped his trousers and removed his penis over his protests and you removed your own clothing over his protests since mr sanders is your employee and dependent on you for employment it is difficult for me to comprehend why this is not a clearcut and indisputable case of sexual harassment on your part i understand your honor meredith johnson said calmly and i realize i have changed my story but the reason i say it is a misunderstanding is that from the beginning i genuinely believed that mr sanders was seeking a sexual encounter with me and that belief guided my actions you do not agree that you harassed him no your honor because i thought i had clear physical indications that mr sanders was a willing participant at times he certainly took the lead so now i have to ask myself why he would take the leadand then so suddenly withdraw i dont know why he did that but i believe he shares responsibility for what happened that is why i feel that at the very least we had a genuine misunderstanding and i want to say that i am sorry truly deeply sorryfor my part in this misunderstanding youre sorry murphy looked around the room in exasperation can anyone explain to me what is going on mr heller heller spread his hands your honor my client told me what she intended to do here i consider it a very brave act she is a true seeker after truth oh spare me fernandez said judge murphy said ms fernandez considering this radically different statement from ms johnson would you like a recess before you proceed with your questions no your honor i am prepared to go forward now fernandez said i see murphy said puzzled all right fine judge murphy clearly felt that there was something everyone else in the room knew that she didnt sanders was still wondering how meredith knew about the tape he looked over at phil blackburn who sat at one end of the table his cellular phone before him he was rubbing the phone nervously phone records sanders thought that must be it digicom would have had somebodymost probably gary bosakgoing through all of sanderss records looking for things to use against him bosak would have checked all the calls made on sanderss cellular phone when he did that he would have discovered a call that lasted fortyfive minutes on monday night it would stand out a whopping big duration and charge and bosak must have looked at the time of the call and figured out what had happened hed realize that sanders hadnt been talking on the phone during that particular fortyfive minutes on monday night therefore there could only be one explanation the call was running to an answering machine which meant there was a tape and johnson knew it and had adjusted her story accordingly that was what had made her change ms johnson fernandez said lets clear up a few factual points first are you now saying that youdidsend your assistant to buy wine and condoms that youdidtell her to lock the door and that youdidcancel your seven oclock appointment in anticipation of a sexual encounter with mr sanders yes i did in other words you lied earlier i presented my point of view but we are not talking about a point of view we are talking about facts and given this set of facts im curious to know why you feel that mr sanders shares responsibility for what happened in that room monday night because i felt i felt that mr sanders had come to my office with the clear intention of having sex with me and he later denied any such intention i felt he had set me up he led me on and then accused me when i had done nothing more than simply respond to him you feel he set you up yes and thats why you feel he shares responsibility yes in what way did he set you up well i think its obvious things had gone very far along when he suddenly got off the couch and said he was not going to proceed id say that was a setup why because you cant go so far and then just stop thats obviously ahostile act intended to embarrass and humiliate me i mean anyone can see that all right lets review that particular moment in detail fernandez said as i understand it were talking about the time when you were on the couch with mr sanders with both of you in a state of partial undress mr sanders was crouched on his knees on the couch his penis was exposed and you were lying on your back with your panties removed and your legs spread is that correct basically yes she shook her head you make it sound so crude but that was the situation at that moment was it not yes it was now at that moment did you say no no please and did mr sanders reply youre right we shouldnt be doing this and then get off the couch yes she said thats what he said then what was the misunderstanding when i said no no i meant no dont wait because he was waiting sort of teasing me and i wanted him to go ahead instead he got off the couch which made me very angry why because i wanted him to do it but ms johnson you said no no i know what i said she replied irritably but in that situation its perfectly clear what i was really saying to him is it of course he knew exactly what i was saying to him but he chose to ignore it ms johnson have you ever heard the phrase no means no of course but in this situation im sorry ms johnson does no mean no or not not in this case because at that time lying on that couch it was absolutely clear what i was really saying to him you mean it was clear to you johnson became openly angry it was clear to him too she snapped ms johnson when men are told that no means no what does that mean i dont know she threw up her hands in irritation i dont know what youre trying to say im trying to say that men are being told that they must take women at their literal word that no means no that men cannot assume that no means maybe or yes but in this particular situation with all our clothes off when things had gone so far what does that have to do with it fernandez said oh come off itjohnson said when people are getting together they begin with little touches then little kisses then a little petting then some more petting then the clothes come off and youre touching various private parts and so on and pretty soon you have an expectation about whats going to happen and you dont turn back to turn back is a hostile act thats what he did he set me up ms johnson isnt it true that women claim the right to turn back at any point up to the moment of actual penetration dont women claim the unequivocal right to change their minds yes but in this instance ms johnson if women have the right to change their minds dont men as well cant mr sanders change his mind it was a hostile act her face had a fixed stubborn look he set me up im asking whether mr sanders has the same rights as a woman in this situation whether he has the right to withdraw even at the last moment no why because men are different how are they different oh for christs sake johnson said angrily what are we talking about here this is alice in wonderland men and women aredifferenteverybody knows that men cant control their impulses apparently mr sanders could yes as a hostile act out of his desire to humiliate me but what mr sanders actually said at the time was i dont feel good about this isnt that true i dont remember his exact words but his behavior was very hostile and degrading toward me as a woman lets consider fernandez said who was hostile and degrading toward whom didnt mr sanders protest the way things were going earlier in the evening not really no i thought he had fernandez looked at her notes early on did you say to mr sanders you look good and you always had a nice hard tush i dont know i might have i dont remember and what did he reply i dont remember fernandez said now when mr sanders was talking on the phone did you come up push it out of his hand and say forget that phone i might have i dont really remember and did you initiate kissing at that point im not really sure i dont think so well lets see how else could it have occurred mr sanders was talking on his cellular phone over by the window you were on another phone at your desk did he interrupt his call set down his phone come over and start kissing you she paused for a moment no then who initiated the kissing i guess i did and when he protested and said meredith did you ignore him press on and say god ive wanted you all day im so hot i havent had a decent fuck fernandez repeated these statements in a flat uninflected monotone as if reading from a transcript i may have i think that might be accurate yes fernandez looked again at her notes and then when he said meredith wait again clearly speaking in a tone of protest did you say oh dont talk no no oh jesus i think possibly i did on reflection would you say these comments by mr sanders were protests that you ignored if they were they were not very clear protests no ms johnson would you characterize mr sanders as fully enthusiastic throughout the encounter johnson hesitated a moment sanders could almost see her thinking trying to decide how much the tape would reveal finally she said he was enthusiastic sometimes not so much at other times thats my point would you say he was ambivalent possibly somewhat is that a yes or a no ms johnson yes all right so mr sanders was ambivalent throughout the session hes told us why because he was being asked to embark on an office affair with an old girlfriend who was now his boss and because he was now married would you consider those valid reasons for ambivalence i suppose so and in this state of ambivalence mr sanders was overwhelmed at the last moment with the feeling that he didnt want to go forward and he told you how he felt simply and directly so why would you characterize that as a setup i think we have ample evidence that it is just the opposite an uncalculated rather desperate human response to a situation which you entirely controlled this was not a reunion of old lovers ms johnson though you prefer to think it was this was not a meeting of equals at all the fact is you are his superior and you controlled every aspect of the meeting you arranged the time bought the wine bought the condoms locked the doorand then you blamed your employee when he failed to please you that is how you continue to behave now and youre trying to put his behavior in a good light johnson said but what im saying is that as a practical matter waiting to the last minute to stop makes people very angry yes fernandez said thats how many men feel when women withdraw at the last minute but women say a man has no right to be angry because a woman can withdraw at any time isnt that true johnson rapped her fingers on the table irritably look she said youre trying to make some kind of federal case here by trying to obscure basic facts what did i do that was so wrong i made him an offer thats all if mr sanders wasnt interested all he had to do was say no but he never said that not once because he intended toset me uphes angry he didnt get the job and hes retaliating the only way he canby smearing me this is nothing but guerrilla warfare and character assassination im a successful woman in business and he resents my success and hes out to get me youre saying all kinds of things to avoid that central and unavoidable fact ms johnson the central and unavoidable fact is that youre mr sanderss superior and your behavior toward him was illegal and it is in fact a federal case there was a short silence blackburns assistant came into the room and handed him a note blackburn read the note and passed it to heller murphy said ms fernandez are you ready to explain whats going on to me now yes your honor it turns out there is an audio tape of the meeting really have you heard it i have your honor it confirms mr sanderss story are you aware of this tape ms johnson no i am not perhaps ms johnson and her attorney would like to hear it too perhaps we should all hear it murphy said looking directly at blackburn heller put the note in his pocket and said your honor id like to request a tenminute recess very well mr heller id say this development warrants it outside in the courtyard black clouds hung low it was threatening to rain again over by the fountains johnson huddled with heller and blackburn fernandez watched them i just dont understand this she said there they all are talking again what is there to talk about their client lied and then changed her story theres no question that johnsons guilty of sexual harassment we have it recorded on tape so what are they talking about fernandez stared for a moment frowning you know i have to admit it johnsons a hell of a smart woman she said yes sanders said shes quick and shes cool uhhuh moved up the corporate ladder fast yes so howd she let herself get into this situation what do you mean sanders said i mean whats she doing coming on to you the very first day at work and coming on so strongly leaving herself open to all these problems shes too smart for that sanders shrugged you think its just because youre irresistible fernandez said with all due respect i doubt it he found himself thinking of the time he first knew meredith when she was doing demos and the way she used to cross her legs whenever she was asked a question she couldnt answer she could always use sex to distract people shes good at that i believe it fernandez said so what is she distracting us from now sanders had no answer but his instinct was that something else was going on who knows how people really are in private he said i once knew this woman she looked like an angel but she liked bikers to beat her up uhhuh fernandez said thats fine im not buying it for johnson because johnson strikes me as very controlled and her behavior with you was not controlled you said it yourself theres a pattern yeah maybe but why the first day why right away i think she had another reason sanders said and what about me do you think i had another reason i assume you did she said looking at him seriously but well talk about that later alan came up from the parking lot shaking his head whatve you got fernandez said nothing good were striking out everywhere he said he flipped open his notepad okay now weve checked out that internet address the message originated in the u district and afriend turns out to be dr arthur a friend hes a professor of inorganic chemistry at the university of washington that name mean anything to you no sanders said im not surprised at the moment professor friend is in northern nepal on a consulting job for the nepalese government hes been there for three weeks hes not expected back until late july so it probably isnt him sending the messages anyway somebodys using his internet address his assistant says thats impossible his office is locked while hes away and nobody goes in there except her so nobody has access to his computer terminal the assistant says she goes in once a day and answers dr friends email but otherwise the computer is off and nobody knows the password but her so i dont know its a message coming out of a locked office sanders said frowning i dont know were still working on it but for the moment its a mystery all right fine fernandez said what about conrad computer conrad has taken a very hard position they will only release information to the hiring company meaning digicom nothing to us and they say that the hiring company has not requested it when we pushed conrad called digicom themselves and digicom told them they werent interested in any information conrad might have hmmm next the husband alan said i talked to someone who worked in his company costar says the husband hates her has lots of bad things to say about her but hes in mexico on vacation with his new girlfriend until next week too bad novell alan said they keep only the last five years current prior to that records are in cold storage at headquarters in utah they have no idea what theyll show but theyre willing to get them out if well pay for it itll take two weeks fernandez shook her head not good no i have a strong feeling that conrad computer is sitting on something fernandez said maybe but well have to sue to get it and theres no time alan looked across the courtyard at the others whats happening now nothing theyre hanging tough still yeah jesus alan said whos she got behind her id love to know fernandez said sanders flipped open his cellular phone and checked in with his office cindy any messages just two tom stephanie kaplan asked if she could meet with you today she say why no but she said it wasnt important and mary anne has come by twice looking for you probably wants to skin me sanders said i dont think so tom shes about the only one whoshes very concerned about you i think okay ill call her he started to dial mary annes number when fernandez nudged him in the ribs he looked over and saw a slender middleaged woman walking up from the parking lot toward them buckle up fernandez said why whos that that fernandez said is connie walsh connie walsh was about fortyfive years old with gray hair and a sour expression are you tom sanders thats right she pulled out a tape recorder connie walsh from the post intelligencer can we talk for a moment absolutely not fernandez said walsh looked over at her im mr sanderss attorney i know who you are walsh said and turned back to sanders mr sanders our papers going with a story on this discrimination suit at digicom my sources tell me that you are accusing meredith johnson of sex discrimination is that correct he has no comment fernandez said stepping between walsh and sanders walsh looked past her shoulder and said mr sanders is it also true that you and she are old lovers and that your accusation is a way to even the score he has no comment fernandez said it looks to me like he does walsh said mr sanders you dont have to listen to her you can say something if you want to and i really think you should take this opportunity to defend yourself because my sources are also saying that you physically abused ms johnson in the course of your meeting these are very serious charges people are making against you and i imagine youll want to respond what do you have to say to her allegations did you physically abuse her sanders started to speak but fernandez shot him a warning glance and put her hand on his chest she said to walsh has ms johnson made these allegations to you because she was the only other one besides mr sanders who was there im not free to say i have the story from very wellinformed sources inside or outside the company i really cant say ms walsh fernandez said i am going to forbid mr sanders to talk to you and you better check with the pi counsel before you run any of these unsubstantiated allegations theyre not unsubstantiated i have very reliable if there is any question in your counsels mind you might have her call mr blackburn and he will explain what your legal position is in this matter walsh smiled bleakly mr sanders do you want to make a comment fernandez said just check with your counsel ms walsh i will but it wont matter you cant squash this mr blackburn cant squash this and speaking personally i have to say i dont know how you can defend a case like this fernandez leaned close to her smiled and said why dont you step over here with me and ill explain something to you she walked with walsh a few yards away across the courtyard alan and sanders remained where they were alan sighed he said wouldnt you give anything to know what they were saying right now connie walsh said it doesnt matter what you say i wont give you my source im not asking for your source im simply informing you that your story is wrong of course youd say that and that theres documentary evidence that its wrong connie walsh paused she frowned documentary evidence fernandez nodded slowly thats right walsh thought it over but there cant be she said you said it yourself they were alone in the room its his word against hers theres no documentary evidence fernandez shook her head and said nothing what is it a tape fernandez smiled thinly i really cant say even if there is what can it show that she pinched his butt a little she made a couple of jokes whats the big deal men have been doing that for hundreds of years thats not the issue in this give me a break so this guy gets a little pinch and he starts screaming bloody murder thats not normal behavior in a man this guy obviously hates and demeans women thats clear just to look at him and theres no question he hit her in that meeting the company had to call a doctor to examine her for a concussion and i have several reliable sources that tell me hes known to be physically abusive he and his wife have had trouble for years in fact shes left town with the kids and is going to file for divorce walsh was watching fernandez carefully as she said it fernandez just shrugged its a fact the wife has left town walsh said flatly unexpectedly she took the kids and nobody knows where she went now you tell me what that means fernandez said connie all i can do is advise you in my capacity as mr sanderss attorney that documentary evidence contradicts your sources about this harassment charge are you going to show me this evidence absolutely not then how do i know it exists you dont you only know i have informed you of its existence and what if i dont believe you fernandez smiled these are the decisions a journalist must make youre saying itd be reckless disregard if you go with your story yes walsh stepped back look maybe youve got some kind of a technical legal case here and maybe you dont but as far as im concerned youre just another minority woman trying to get ahead with the patriarchy by getting down on her knees if you had any selfrespect you wouldnt be doing their dirty work for them actually connie the person who seems to be caught in the grip of the patriarchy is you thats a lot of crap walsh said and let me tell you youre not going to evade the facts here he led her on and then he beat her up hes an exlover hes resentful and hes violent hes a typical man and let me tell you before im through hell wish he had never been born ssanders said is she going to run the story no fernandez said she stared across the courtyard at johnson heller and blackburn connie walsh had gone over to blackburn and was talking to him dont get distracted by this fernandez said its not important the main issue is whatre they going to do about johnson a moment later heller came toward them he said weve been going over things on our side louise and weve concluded that we see no purpose to further mediation and are withdrawing as of now ive informed judge murphy that we will not continue really and what about the tape neither ms johnson nor mr sanders knew they were being taped under law one party must know the interaction is being recorded therefore the tape is inadmissible but ben we argue that the tape should be disallowed both from this mediation and from any subsequent legal proceeding we argue that ms johnsons characterization of the meeting as a misunderstanding between consenting adults is the correct one and that mr sanders bears a responsibility for that misunderstanding he was an active participant louise no way around it he took her panties off nobody held a gun to his head but since there was fault on both sides the proper thing is for the two parties to shake hands let go of all animosity and return to work apparently mr garvin has already proposed this to mr sanders and mr sanders has refused we believe that under the circumstances mr sanders is acting unreasonably and that if he does not reconsider in a timely manner he should be fired for his refusal to show up for work son of a bitch sanders said fernandez laid a restraining hand on his arm ben she said calmly is this a formal offer of reconciliation and return to the company yes louise and what are the sweeteners no sweeteners everybody just goes back to work the reason i ask fernandez said is that i believe i can successfully argue that mr sanders was aware the tape was being made and thus it is indeed admissible i will argue further that it is admissible under discovery of public records over common carriers as defined inwaller v herbsti willargue further that the company knew of ms johnsons long history of harassment and has failed to take proper steps to investigate her behavior either prior to this incident or now and i will argue that the company was derelict in protecting mr sanderss reputation when it leaked the story to connie walsh wait a minute here i will argue that the company had a clear reason for leaking it they desired to cheat mr sanders out of his welldeserved reward for more than a decade of service to the company and youve got an employee in ms johnson who has had some trouble before i will claim defamation and ask for punitive damages of sufficient magnitude to send a message to corporate america ill ask for sixty million dollars ben and youll settle for forty millionthe minute i get the judge to allow the jury to hear this tape because we both know that when the jury hears that tape they will take about five seconds to find against ms johnson and the company heller shook his head youve got a lot of long shots there louise i dont think theyll ever let that tape be played in court and youre talking about three years from now fernandez nodded slowly yes she said three years is a long time youretelling me louise anything can happen yes and frankly im worried about that tape so many untoward things can happen with evidence that is so scandalous i cant guarantee somebody hasnt made a copy already itd be terrible if one fell into the hands of kqem and they started playing it over the radio christ heller said louise i cant believe you said that said what im merely expressing my legitimate fears fernandez said id be derelict if i did not let you know my concerns lets face facts here ben the cats out of the bag the press already has this story somebody leaked it to connie walsh and she printed a story thats very damaging to mr sanderss reputation and it seems that somebody is still leaking because now connie is planning to write some unfounded speculation about physical violence by my client its unfortunate that someone on your side should have chosen to talk about this case but we both know how it is with a hot story in the press you never know where the next leak will come from heller was uneasy he glanced back at the others by the fountain louise i dont think theres any movement over there well just talk to them heller shrugged and walked back what do we do now sanders said we go back to your office we yes fernandez said this isnt the end more is going to happen today and i want to be there when it does driving back blackburn talked on the car phone with garvinvthe mediations over we called it off and were pushing sanders hard to go back to work but hes not responding so far hes hanging tough now hes threatening punitive damages of sixty million dollars christ garvin said punitive damages on what basis defamation from corporate negligence dealing with the fact that we supposedly knew that johnson had a history of harassment i never knew of any history garvin said did you know of any history phil no blackburn said is there any documentary evidence of such a history no blackburn said im sure there isnt good then let him threaten where did you leave it with sanders we gave him until tomorrow morning to rejoin the company at his old job or get out all right garvin said now lets get serious what have we got on him were working on that felony charge blackburn said its early but i think its promising what about women there isnt any record on women i know sanders was screwing one of his assistants a couple of years back but we cant find the records in the computer i think he went in and erased them how could he we blocked his access he must have done it some time ago hes a cagey guy why the hell would he do it some time ago phil he had no reason to expect any of this i know but we cant findthe records now blackburn paused bob i think we should move up the press conference to when late tomorrow good idea garvin said ill arrange it we could even do it noon tomorrow john marden is flying in in the morning he said referring to conleywhites ceo thatll work out fine sanders is planning to string this out until friday blackburn said lets just beat him to the punch weve got him blocked as it is he cant get into the company files he cant get access to conrad or anything else hes isolated he cant possibly come up with anything damaging between now and tomorrow fine garvin said what about the reporter i think shell break the story on friday blackburn said she already has it i dont know where from but she wont be able to resist trashing sanders its too good a story shell go with it and hell be dead meat when she does thats fine garvin said meredith johnson came off the fifthfloor elevator at digicom and ran into ed nichols we missed you at the morning meetings nichols said yeah i had some things to take care of she said anything i should know no she said its boring just some technical matters about tax exemptions in ireland the irish government wants to expand local content at the cork plant and were not sure we can this has been going on for more than a year you look a little tired nichols said with concern a little pale im okay ill be happy when this is all over we all will nichols said you have time for dinner maybe friday night if youre still in town she said she smiled but really ed its just tax stuff okay i believe you he waved and went down the hallway johnson went into her office she found stephanie kaplan there working at the computer terminal on johnsons desk kaplan looked embarrassed sorry to use your computer i was just running over some accounts while i waited for you johnson threw her purse on the couch listen stephanie she said lets get something straight right now im running this division and nobodys going to change that and as far as im concerned this is the time when a new vice president decides whos on their side and who isnt somebody supports me ill remember somebody doesnt ill deal with that too do we understand each other kaplan came around the desk yes sure meredith dont fuck with me never entered my mind meredith good thank you stephanie no problem meredith kaplan left the office johnson closed the door behind her and went directly to her computer terminal and stared intently at the screen sanders walked through the corridors of digicom with a sense of unreality he felt like a stranger the people who passed him in the halls looked away and brushed past him saying nothing i dont exist he said to fernandez never mind she said they passed the main part of the floor where people worked in chesthigh cubicles several pig grunts were heard one person sang softly because i used to fuck her but its all over now sanders stopped and turned toward the singing fernandez grabbed his arm never mind she said but christ dont make it worse than it is they passed the coffee machine beside it someone had taped up a picture of sanders they had used it for a dartboard jesus keep going as he came to the corridor leading to his office he saw don cherry coming the other way hi don you screwed up bad on this one tom he shook his head and walked on even don cherry sanders sighed you knew this was going to happen fernandez said maybe you did this is the way it works outside his office cindy stood up when she saw him she said tom mary anne asked you to call her as soon as you got in okay and stephanie said to say never mind she found out whatever she needed to know she said uh not to call her okay he went in the office and closed the door he sat down behind his desk and fernandez sat opposite him she took her cellular phone out of her briefcase and dialed lets get one thing squared awayms vriess office please louise fernandez calling she cupped her hand over the phone this shouldnt take oh eleanor hi louise fernandez im calling you about connie walsh uhhuh im sure youve been going over it with her yes i know she feels strongly eleanor i just wanted to confirm to you that there is a tape of the event and it substantiates mr sanderss version rather than ms johnsons actually yes i could do that entirely off the record yes i could well the problem with walshs source is that the company now has huge liability and if you print a story thats wrongeven if you got it from a source i think they have an action against you oh yes i think absolutely mr blackburn would sue he wouldnt have any choice why dont youi see uhhuh well that could change eleanor uhhuh and dont forget that mr sanders is considering defamation right now based on the mr piggy piece yes why dont you do that thank you she hung up and turned to sanders we went to law school together eleanor is very competent and very conservative shed never have allowed the story in the first place and would never have considered it now if she didnt place a lot of reliance on connies source meaning im pretty sure i know who gave her the story fernandez said she was dialing again who sanders said right now the important thing is meredith johnson weve got to document the pattern to demonstrate that she has harassed employees before somehow weve got to break this deadlock with conrad computer she turned away harry louise did you talk to conrad uhhuh and a pause she shook her head irritably did you explain to them about their liabilities uhhuh hell so whats our next move because weve got a time problem here harry thats what im concerned about while she was talking sanders turned to his monitor the email light was flashing he clicked it you have messages waiting christ he could only imagine he clicked thereadbutton they flashed up in order from don cherry corridor programming team to all subjects we have delivered the vie unit to conleywhites people the unit is now active into their company db since they gave us the hooks today john conley asked that it be delivered to a suite at the four seasons hotel because their ceo is arriving thursday morning and will see it then another programming triumph brought to you by the swell folks at vie don the magnificent sanders flipped to the next one from diagnostics group to apg team analysis of twinkle drives the problem with the controller timing loop does not seem to come from the chip itself we verified microfluctuations in current from the power unit which was apparently etched with substandard or inadequate resistances on the board but this is minor and does not explain our failure to meet specs analysis is continuing sanders viewed the message with a sense of detachment it didnt really tell him anything just words that concealed the underlying truth they still didnt know what the problem was at another time hed be on his way down to the diagnostics team to ride them hard to get to the bottom of it but now he shrugged and went to the next message from baseball central to all players re new summer softball schedule download file bb to get the new revised summer schedule see you on the field he heard fernandez say on the phone harry weve got to crack this one somehow what time do they close their offices in sunnyvale sanders went to the next message no more group messages do you want to read personal messages he clicked the icon why dont you just admit you are gay unsigned he didnt bother to see where it had come from they would probably have manually entered it as coming from garvins address or something like that he could check the real address inside the system but not without the access privileges they had taken away he went to the next message shes better looking than your assistant and you didnt seem to mind screwing her unsigned sanders clicked to the next one you slimy weasel get out of this company your best advice christ he thought the next one little tommy had a pecker he played with every day but when a lady tried to touch it little tommy said go away the verses ran on down to the bottom of the screen but sanders didnt read the rest he clicked and went on if you werent fucking your daughter so much you might be able to he clicked again he was clicking faster and faster going through the messages guys like you give men a bad name you asshole boris click you filthy lying male pig click high time somebody stuck it to the whining bitches im tired of the way they blame everybody but theirselves tits and blame are sexlinked traits theyre both on the xchromosome keep on truckin he went through them no longer reading eventually he was going so fast he almost missed one of the later ones just received word that mohammed jafar is dying hes still in the hospital and not expected to survive until morning i guess maybe theres something to this sorcery business after all arthur kahn sanders stared at the screen a man dying of sorcery he couldnt begin to imagine what had really happened the very idea seemed to belong to another world not his he heard fernandez say i dont care harry but conrad has information relevant to the pattern and somehow we have to get it out of them sanders clicked to the final message youre checking the wrong company afriend sanders twisted the monitor around so fernandez could see it she frowned as she talked on the phone harry i got to go do what you can she hung up what does it mean were checking the wrong company how does this friend even know what were doing when did this come in sanders looked at the message headers onetwenty this afternoon fernandez made a note on her legal pad that was about the time alan was talking to conrad and conrad called digicom remember so this message has to be coming from inside digicom but its on the internet wherever it appears to be coming from its actually from somebody inside the company trying to help you his immediate thought out of nowhere wasmax but that didnt make any sense dorfman was tricky but not in this way besides max wasnt knowledgeable about the minutetominute workings of the company no this was somebody who wanted to help sanders but who didnt want the help to be traced back youre checking the wrong company he repeated aloud could it be someone at conleywhite hell he thought it could be anybody what does it mean were checking the wrong company he said were checking all her past employers and were having a very difficult he stopped youre checking the wrong company i must be an idiot he said he started typing at his computer what is it fernandez said theyve restricted my access but i still should be able to get this he said typing quickly get what she said puzzled you say harassers have a pattern right right it shows up again and again right right and were checking her past employers to get information about past episodes of harassment right and failing yes but the thing is sanders said shes worked here for the last four years louise were checking the wrong company he watched as the computer terminal flashed searching database and then after a moment he turned the screen so fernandez could see digital communications data reference search report db human resources sub employee records search criteria disposition terminated ao transferred ao resigned supervisor johnson meredith other criteria males only summary search results michael tate terminate drug use hr refmed edwin sheen resign alt employment dsilicon william rogin transfer own request austin frederic cohen resign alt employment squire sx robert ely transfer own request seattle michael backes transfer own request malaysia peter saltz resign alt employment novell ross wald transfer own request cork richard jackson resign alt employment aldus james french transfer own request austin fernandez scanned the list looks like working for meredith johnson can be hazardous to your job youre looking at the classic pattern people last only a few months and then resign or ask to be transferred elsewhere everything voluntary nobody ever fired because that might trigger a wrongful termination suit classic you know any of these people no sanders said shaking his head but three of them are in seattle he said i only see one no aldus is here and squire systems is out in bellevue so richard jackson and frederic cohen are up here too you have any way to get details of termination packages on these people she said that would be helpful because if the company paid anybody off then we have a de facto case no sanders shook his head financial data is beyond minimal access try anyway but whats the point the system wont let me do it fernandez said he frowned you think theyre monitoring me i guarantee it okay he typed in the parameters and pressed the search key the answer came back financial database search is beyond level o access he shrugged just as i thought no cigar but the point is we asked the question fernandez said itll wake them right up sanders was heading toward the bank of elevators when he saw meredith coming toward him with three conleywhite executives he turned quickly then went to the stairwell and started walking down the four flights to the street level the stairwell was deserted one flight below the door opened and stephanie kaplan appeared and started coming up the stairs sanders was reluctant to speak to her kaplan was after all the chief financial officer and close to both garvin and blackburn in the end he said casually hows it going stephanie hello tom her nod to him was cool reserved sanders continued past her going down a few more steps when he heard her say im sorry this is so difficult for you he paused kaplan was one flight above him looking down there was no one else in the stairwell he said im managing i know you are but still it must be hard so much going on at once and nobody giving you information it must be confusing to try to figure everything out nobody giving you information well yes he said speaking slowly it is hard to figure things out stephanie she nodded i remember when i first started out in business she said i had a woman friend who got a very good job in a company that didnt usually hire women executives in her new position she had a lot of stress and crises she was proud of the way she was dealing with the problems but it turned out shed only been hired because there was a financial scandal in her division and from the beginning they were setting her up to take the fall her job was never about any of the things she thought it was she was a patsy and she was looking the wrong way when they fired her sanders stared at her why was she telling him this he said thats an interesting story kaplan nodded ive never forgotten it she said on the stairs above a door clanged open and they heard footsteps descending without another word kaplan turned and continued up shaking his head sanders continued down in the newsroom of the seattleportintelligencerconnie walsh looked up from her computer terminal and said youve got to be kidding no im not eleanor vries said standing over her im killing this story she dropped the printout back on walshs desk but you know who my source is walsh said and you know jake was listening in to the entire conversation we have very good notes eleanor very complete notes i know so given the source how can the company possibly sue walsh said eleanori have the fucking story you haveastory and the paper faces a substantial exposure already already from what the mr piggy column oh for christs sake theres no way to claim identification from that column vries pulled out a xerox of the column she had marked several passages in yellow highlighter company x is said to be a hightech company in seattle that just named a woman to a high position mr piggy is said to be her subordinate he is said to have brought a sexual harassment action mr piggys wife is an attorney with young children you say mr piggys charge is without merit that he is a drunk and a womanizer i think sanders can absolutely claim identification and sue for defamation but this is a column an opinion piece this column alleges facts and it alleges them in a sarcastic and wildly overstated manner lts an opinion piece opinion is protected i dont think thats certain in this case at all im disturbed that i allowed this column to run in the first place but the point is we cannot claim to be absent malice if we allow further articles to go out walsh said you have no guts and youre very free with other peoples guts vries said the storys killed and thats final im putting it in writing with copies to you marge and tom donadio fucking lawyers what a world we live in this story needs to be told dont screw around with this connie im telling you dont and she walked away walsh thumbed through the pages of the story she had been working on it all afternoon polishing it refining it getting it exactly right and now she wanted the story to run she had no patience with legal thinking this whole idea of protecting rights was just a convenient fiction because when you got right down to it legal thinking was just narrowminded petty selfprotectivethe kind of thinking that kept the power structure firmly in place and in the end fear served the power structure fear served men in power and if there was anything that connie walsh believed to be true of herself it was that she was not afraid after a long time she picked up the phone and dialed a number kseatv good afternoon ms henley please jean henley was a bright young reporter at seattles newest independent tv station walsh had spent many evenings with henley discussing the problems of working in the maledominated mass media henley knew the value of a hot story in building a reporters career this story walsh told herself would be told one way or another it would be told robert ely looked up at sanders nervously what do you want he asked ely was young not more than twentysix a tense man with a blond mustache he was wearing a tie and was in his shirtsleeves he worked in one of the partitioned cubicles at the back of digicoms accounting department in the gower building i want to talk about meredith sanders said ely was one of the three seattle residents on his list oh god ely said he glanced around nervously his adams apple bobbed i donti dont have anything to say just want to talk sanders said not here ely said then lets go to the conference room sanders said they walked down the hall to a small conference room but a meeting was being held there sanders suggested they go to the little cafeteria in the corner of accounting but ely told him that wouldnt be private he was growing more nervous by the minute really i have nothing to tell you he kept saying theres nothing really nothing sanders knew he had better find a quiet place at once before ely bolted and ran they ended up in the mens roomwhite tile spotlessly clean ely leaned against a sink i dont know why you are talking to me i dont have anything i can tell you you worked for meredith in cupertino yes and you left there two years ago yes why did you leave why do you think ely said in a burst of anger his voice echoed off the tiles you know why for christs sake everybody knows why she made my life hell what happened sanders asked what happened ely shook his head remembering every day every day robert would you stay late we have some things to go over after a while i tried to make excuses then she would say robert im not sure youre showing the proper dedication to this company and she would put little comments in my performance review subtle little negative things nothing that i could complain about but they were there piling up robert i think you need my help here why dont you see me after work robert why dont you drop by my apartment and well discuss it i really think you should i wasit was terrible the uh person i was living with did not uh i was in a real bind did you report her ely laughed harshly are you kidding shes practically a member of garvins family so you just put up with it ely shrugged finally the person i was living with got another job when he came up here i transferred too i mean of course i wanted to go it just worked out all around would you make a statement about meredith now not a chance you realize sanders said that the reason she gets away with it is that nobody reports her ely pushed away from the sink i have enough problems in my life without going public on this he went to the door paused and turned back just so youre clear ive got nothing to say on the subject of meredith johnson if anybody asks ill say our working relationship was correct at all times and ill also say that i never met you meredith johnson of course i remember her richard jackson said i worked for her for more than a year sanders was in jacksons office on the second floor of the aldus building on the south side of pioneer square jackson was a goodlooking man of thirty with the hearty manner of an exathlete he was a marketing manager at aldus his office was friendly cluttered with product boxes for graphics programs intellidraw freehand superpaint and pagemaker beautiful and charming woman jackson said very intelligent always a pleasure sanders said i was wondering why you left i was offered this job thats why and ive never regretted it wonderful job wonderful company ive had a great experience here is that the only reason you left jackson laughed you mean did meredith manmuncher come on to me he said hey is the pope catholic is bill gates rich ofcourse she came on to me did that have anything to do with your leaving no nojackson said meredith came on to everybody shes sort of an equal opportunity employer in that respect she chasedeverybody when i first started in cupertino she had this little gay guy she used to chase around the table terrorized the poor bastard little skinny nervous guy christ she used to make him tremble and you jackson shrugged i was a single guy just starting out she was beautiful it was okay with me you never had any difficulties never meredith was fabulous shitty lay of course but you cant have everything shes a very intelligent very beautiful woman always dressed great and she liked me so she took me to all these functions i met people made contacts it was great so you saw nothing wrong not a damn thing jackson said she could get a little bossy that got old there were a couple of other women i was seeing but i always had to be on call for her even at the last minute that could be irritating sometimes you begin to think your life is not your own and shes got a mean temper sometimes but what the hell you do what you have to do now im assistant manager here at thirty im doing great great company great town great future and i owe it to her shes great sanders said you were an employee of the company at the time that you were having your relationship isnt that right yeah sure isnt she required by company policy to report any relationship with an employee did she report her relationship with you christ nojackson said he leaned across his desk lets get one thing straight just between you and me i think meredith is great if you have a problem with her its your problem i dont know what it could be you used to live with her for christs sake so there cant be any surprises meredith likes to fuck guys she likes to tell them to do this do that she likes to order them around thats who she is and i dont see anything wrong with it sanders said i dont suppose youd make a statement jackson said get serious listen theres a lot of bullshit around now i hear things like you cant go out with the people you work with christ if i couldnt go out with the people i worked with id still be a virgin thats all anybody can go out with the people you work with thats the only people you get to know and sometimes those people are your superiors big deal women screw men and get ahead men screw women and get ahead everybodys going to screw everybody else anyway if they can because they want to i mean women are just as hot as men they want it just like we do thats real life but you get some people who are pissed off so they file a complaint and say oh no you cant do that to me im telling you its all bullshit like these sensitivity training seminars we all have to go to everybody sits there with their hands in their laps like a fucking red guard meeting learning the correct way to address your fellow workers but afterward everybody goes out and fucks around the same as they always did the assistants go oh mr jackson have you been to the gym you look sostrong batting their eyelashes so what am i supposed to do you cant make rules about this people get hungry they eat doesnt matter how many meetings they attend this is all a gigantic jerk off and anybody who buys into it is an asshole i guess you answered my question sanders said he got up to leave obviously jackson wasnt going to help him look jackson said im sorry youve got a problem here but everyones too damned sensitive these days i see people now kids right out of college and they really think they should never experience an unpleasant moment nobody should ever say anything they dont like or tell a joke they dont like but the thing is nobody can make the world be the way they want it to be all the time things always happen that embarrass you or piss you off thats life i hear women telling jokes about men every day offensive jokes dirty jokes i dont get bent out of shape life is great who has time for this crap not me sanders came out of the aldus building at five oclock tired and discouraged he trudged back toward the hazzard building the streets were wet but the rain had stopped and the afternoon sunlight was trying to break through the clouds he was back in his office ten minutes later cindy was not at her desk and fernandez was gone he felt deserted and alone and hopeless he sat down and dialed the final number on his list squire electronic data systems good evening sanders said frederic cohens office please im sorry mr cohen has gone for the day do you know how i could reach him im afraid i dont do you want to leave voice mail damn he thought what was the point but he said yes please there was a click then hi this is fred cohen leave a message at the tone if its after hours you can try me on my car phone at or my home at sanders jotted the numbers down he dialed the car phone first he heard a crackle of static then i know honey im sorry im late but im on my way i just got tied up mr cohen oh a pause yes this is fred cohen my name is tom sanders i work over at digicom and i know who you are the voice sounded tense i understand you used to work for meredith johnson yes i did i wonder if i could talk to you what about about your experiences working for her there was a long pause finally cohen said what would be the point of that well im in a sort of a dispute with meredith now and i know you are yes and you see i would like to look tom i left digicom two years ago whatever happened is ancient history now well actually sanders said its not because im trying to establish a pattern of behavior and i know what youre trying to do but this is very touchy stuff tom i dont want to get into it if we could just talk sanders said just for a few minutes tom cohens voice was flat tom im married now i have a wife shes pregnant i dont have anything to say about meredith johnson nothing at all but im sorry ive got to go click cindy came back in as he was hanging up the phone she pushed a cup of coffee in front of him everything okay no he said everything is terrible he was reluctant to admit even to himself that he had no more moves left he had approached three men and they had each refused to establish a pattern of behavior for him he doubted that the other men on the list would behave differently he found himself thinking of what his wife susan had said two days beforeyou have no moves now after all this effort it turned out to be true he was finished wheres fernandez shes meeting with blackburn what cindy nodded in the small conference room theyve been there about fifteen minutes now oh christ he got up from his desk and went down the hall he saw fernandez sitting with blackburn in the conference room fernandez was making notes on her legal pad head bent deferentially blackburn was running his hands down his lapels and looking upward as he spoke he seemed to be dictating to her then blackburn saw him and waved him over sanders went into the conference room tom blackburn said with a smile i was just coming to see you good news i think weve been able to resolve this situation i mean really resolve it once and for all uhhuh sanders said he didnt believe a word of it he turned to fernandez fernandez looked up from her legal pad slowly she appeared dazed thats the way it looks blackburn stood and faced sanders i cant tell you how pleased i am tom ive been working on bob all afternoon and hes finally come to face reality the plain fact is the company has a problem tom and we owe you a debt of gratitude for bringing it so clearly to our attention this cant go on bob knows he has to deal with it and he will sanders just stared he couldnt believe what he was hearing but there was fernandez nodding and smiling blackburn smoothed his tie but as frank lloyd wright once said god is in the details you know tom we have one small immediate problem a political problem having to do with the merger were asking your help with the briefing tomorrow for marden conleys ceo but after that well youve been badly wronged tom this company has wronged you and we recognize that we have an obligation to make it up to you whatever way we can still disbelieving it sanders said harshly what exactly are we talking about blackburns voice was soothing well tom at this point thats really up to you he said ive given louise the parameters of a potential deal and all the options that we would agree to you can discuss it with her and get back to us well sign any interim papers you require of course all that we ask in return is that you attend the meeting tomorrow and help us to get through the merger fair enough blackburn extended his hand and held it there sanders stared from the bottom of my heart tom im sorry for all that has happened sanders shook his hand thank you tom blackburn said thank you for your patience and thank you on behalf of this company now sit down and talk with louise and let us know what you decide and blackburn left the room closing the door softly behind him he turned to fernandez what the hell is this all about fernandez gave a long sigh its called capitulation she said total and complete capitulation digicom just folded sanders watched blackburn walk down the hallway away from the conference room he was filled with confused feelings suddenly he was being told it was all over and over without a fight without blood being spilled watching blackburn he had a sudden image of blood in the bathroom sink of his old apartment and this time he remembered where it came from a part of the chronology fell into place blackburn was staying at his apartment during his divorce he was on edge and drinking too much one day he cut himself so badly while shaving that the sink was spattered with blood later on meredith saw the blood in the sink and on the towels and she said did one of you guys fuck her while she was having her period meredith was always blunt that way she liked to startle people to shock them and then one saturday afternoon she walked around the apartment in white stockings and a garter belt and a bra while phil was watching television sanders said to her what are you doing that for just cheering him up meredith replied she threw herself back on the bed now why dont you cheer me up she said and she pulled her legs back opening tom are you listening to me fernandez was saying hello tom are you there im here sanders said but he was still watching blackburn thinking about blackburn now he remembered another time a few years later sanders had started dating susan and phil had dinner with the two of them one night susan went to the bathroom shes great blackburn said shes terrific shes beautiful and shes great but but blackburn had shrugged shes a lawyer so you can never trust a lawyer blackburn had said and laughed one of his rueful wise laughs you can never trust a lawyer now standing in the digicom conference room sanders watched as blackburn disappeared around a corner he turned back to fernandez really had no choice fernandez was saying the whole situation finally became untenable the fact situation with johnson is bad and the tape is dangerous they dont want it played and theyre afraid it will get out they have a problem about prior sexual harassment by johnson shes done it before and they know it even though none of the men you talked to has agreed to talk one of them might in the future and they know it and of course theyve got their chief counsel revealing company information to a reporter sanders said what she nodded blackburn was the one who gave the story to connie walsh he acted in flagrant violation of all rules of conduct for an employee of the company hes a major problem for them and it all just became too much these things could bring down the entire company looking at it rationally they had to make a deal with you yeah sanders said but none of this is rational you know youre acting like you dont believe it fernandez said believe it it just got too big they couldnt sit on it anymore so whats the deal fernandez looked at her notes you got your whole shopping list theyll fire johnson theyll give you her job if you want that or theyll reinstate you at your present position or theyll give you another position in the company theyll pay you a hundred thousand in pain and suffering and theyll pay my fees or theyll negotiate a termination agreement if you want that in any case theyll give you full stock options if and when the division goes public whether you choose to remain with the company or not jesus christ she nodded total capitulation you really believe blackburn means it you can never trust a lawyer yes she said frankly its the first thing that has made any sense to me all day they had to do this tom their exposure is too great and the stakes are too high and what about this briefing theyre worried about the mergeras you suspected when all this began they dont want to blow it with any sudden changes now so they want you to participate in the briefing tomorrow with johnson as if everything was normal then early next week johnson will have a physical exam as part of her insurance for the new job the exam will uncover serious health problems maybe even cancer which will force a regrettable change in management i see he went to the window and looked out at the city the clouds were higher and the evening sun was breaking through he took a deep breath and if i dont participate in the briefing its up to you but i would if i were you fernandez said at this point you really are in a position to bring down the company and what good is that he took another deep breath he was feeling better all the time youre saying this is over he said finally yes its over and youve won you pulled it off congratulations tom she shook his hand jesus christ he said she stood up im going to draw up an instrument outlining my conversation with blackburn specifying these options and send it to him for his signature in an hour ill call you when i have it signed meanwhile i recommend you do whatever preparation you need for this meeting tomorrow and get some much deserved rest ill see you tomorrow okay it was slowly seeping into him the realization that it was over really over it had happened so suddenly and so completely he was a little dazed congratulations again fernandez said she folded her briefcase and left he was back in his office at about six cindy was leaving she asked if he needed her and he said he didnt sanders sat at his desk and stared out the window for a while savoring the conclusion of the day through his open door he watched as people left for the night heading down the hall finally he called his wife in phoenix to tell her the news but her line was busy there was a knock at his door he looked up and saw blackburn standing there looking apologetic got a minute sure i just wanted to repeat to you on a personal level how sorry i am about all this in the press of complex corporate problems like this human values may get lost despite the best of intentions while we intend to be fair to everyone sometimes we fail and what is a corporation if not a human group a group of human beings were all people underneath it all as alexander pope once said were all just human so recognizing your own graciousness through all this i want to say to you sanders wasnt listening he was tired all he really heard was that phil realized he had screwed up and now was trying to repair things in his usual manner by sucking up to someone he had earlier bullied sanders interrupted saying what about bob now that it was over sanders was having a lot of feelings about garvin memories going back to his earliest days with the company garvin had been a kind of father to sanders and he wanted to hear from garvin now he wanted an apology or something i imagine bobs going to take a couple of days to come around blackburn said this was a very difficult decision for him to arrive at i had to work very hard on him on your behalf and now hes got to figure out how to break it to meredith all that uhhuh but hell eventually talk to you i know he will meanwhile i wanted to go over a few things about the meeting tomorrow blackburn said its for marden their ceo and its going to be a bit more formal than the way we usually do things well be in the big conference room on the ground floor itll start at nine and go to ten meredith will chair the meeting and shell call on all the division heads to give a summary of progress and problems in their divisions mary anne first then don then mark then you everyone will talk three to four minutes do it standing wear a jacket and tie use visuals if you have them but stay away from technical details keep it an overview in your case theyll expect to hear mostly about twinkle sanders nodded all right but there isnt really much new to report we still havent figured out whats wrong with the drives thats fine i dont think anybody expects a solution yet just emphasize the success of the prototypes and the fact that weve overcome production problems before keep it upbeat and keep it moving if you have a prototype or a mockup you might want to bring it along okay you know the stuffbright rosy digital future minor technical glitches wont stand in the way of progress merediths okay with that he said he was slightly disturbed to hear that she was chairing the meeting meredith is expecting all the heads to be upbeat and nontechnical there wont be a problem okay sanders said call me tonight if you want to go over your presentation blackburn said or in the morning early lets just finesse this session and then we can move on start making changes next week sanders nodded youre the kind of man this company needs blackburn said i appreciate your understanding and again tom im sorry he left sanders called down to the diagnostics group to see if they had any further word but there was no answer he went out to the closet behind cindys desk and took out the av materials the big schematic drawing of the twinkle drive and the schematic of the production line in malaysia he could prop these on easels while he talked but as he thought about it it occurred to him that blackburn was right a mockup or a prototype would be good to have in fact he should probably bring one of the drives that arthur had sent from kl it reminded him that he should call arthur in malaysia he dialed the number mr kahns office its tom sanders calling the assistant sounded surprised mr kahn is not here mr sanders when is he expected back hes out of the office mr sanders i dont know when hell be back i see sanders frowned that was odd with mohammed jafar missing it was unlike arthur to leave the plant without supervision the assistant said can i give him a message no message thanks he hung up went down to the third floor to cherrys programming group and put his card in the slot to let himself in the card popped back out and the led blinked oooo it took him a moment to realize that they had cut off his access then he remembered the other card he had picked up earlier he pushed it in the slot and the door opened sanders went inside he was surprised to find the unit deserted the programmers all kept strange hours there was almost always somebody there even at midnight he went to the diagnostics room where the drives were being studied there were a series of benches surrounded by electronic equipment and blackboards the drives were set out on the benches all covered in white cloth the bright overhead quartz lights were off he heard rockandroll music from an adjacent room and went there a lone programmer in his early twenties was sitting at a console typing beside him a portable radio blared sanders said where is everybody the programmer looked up third wednesday of the month so oops meets on the third wednesday oh the object oriented programmer support association or oops was an association of programmers in the seattle area it was started by microsoft some years earlier and was partly social and partly trade talk sanders said you know anything about what the diagnostics team found sorry the programmer shook his head i just came in sanders went back to the diagnostics room he flicked on the lights and gently removed the white cloth that covered the drives he saw that only three of the cdrom drives had been opened their innards exposed to powerful magnifying glasses and electronic probes on the tables the remaining seven drives were stacked to one side still in plastic he looked up at the blackboards one had a series of equations and hastily scribbled data points the other had a flowchart list that read a contr incompat vlsi pwr b optic dysfunct voltage regarmservo c laser ro abc d e mechanical j j e gremlins it didnt mean much to sanders he turned his attention back to the tables and peered at the test equipment it looked fairly standard except that there were a series of largebore needles lying on the table and several white circular wafers encased in plastic that looked like camera filters there were also polaroid pictures of the drives in various stages of disassembly the team had documented their work three of the polaroids were placed in a neat row as if they might be significant but sanders couldnt see why they just showed chips on a green circuit board he looked at the drives themselves being careful not to disturb anything then he turned to the stack of drives that were still wrapped in plastic but looking closely he noticed fine needlepoint punctures in the plastic covering four of the drives nearby was a medical syringe and an open notebook the notebook showed a column of figures ppu ii repeat ii and at the bottom someone had scrawled fucking obvious but it wasnt obvious to sanders he decided that hed better call don cherry later tonight to have him explain it in the meantime he took one of the extra drives from the stack to use in the presentation the following morning he left the diagnostics room carrying all his presentation materials the easel boards flapping against his legs he headed downstairs to the ground floor conference room which had an av closet where speakers stored visual material before a presentation he could lock his material away there in the lobby he passed the receptionists desk now manned by a black security guard who watched a baseball game and nodded to sanders sanders went back toward the rear of the floor moving quietly on the plush carpeting the hallway was dark but the lights were on in the conference room he could see them shining from around the corner as he came closer he heard meredith johnson say and then what and a mans voice answered something indistinct sanders paused he stood in the dark corridor and listened from where he stood he could see nothing of the room there was a moment of silence and then johnson said okay so will mark talk about design the man said yes hell cover that okay johnson said then what about the sanders couldnt hear the rest he crept forward moving silently on the carpet and cautiously peered around the corner he still could not see into the conference room itself but there was a large chrome sculpture in the hallway outside the room a sort of propeller shape and in the reflection of its polished surface he saw meredith moving in the room the man with her was blackburn johnson said so what if sanders doesnt bring it up he will blackburn said youre sure he doesntthat the again the rest was lost no heno idea sanders held his breath meredith was pacing her image in the reflection twisting and distorted so when he doesi will say that this is ais thatyou mean exactly blackburn said and if he blackburn put his hand on her shoulder yes you have to sowant me to blackburn said something quiet in reply and sanders heard none of it except the phrase must demolish him can do that make sure counting on you there was the shrill sound of a telephone both meredith and blackburn reached for their pockets meredith answered the call and the two began to move toward the exit they were heading toward sanders panicked sanders looked around and saw a mens room to his right he slipped inside the door as they came out of the conference room and started down the hallway dont worry about this meredith blackburn said itll go fine im not worried she said it should be quite smooth and impersonal blackburn said theres no reason for rancor after all you have the facts on your side hes clearly incompetent he still cant get into the database she said no hes locked out of the system and theres no way he can get into conleywhites system blackburn laughed no way in hell meredith the voices faded moving down the hallway sanders strained to listen finally heard the click of a door closing he stepped out of the bathroom into the hallway the hallway was deserted he stared toward the far door his own telephone rang in his pocket the sound so loud it made him jump he answered it sanders listen fernandez said i sent the draft of your contract to blackburns office but it came back with a couple of added statements that im not sure about i think we better meet to discuss them in an hour sanders said why not now i have something to do first he said ah thomas max dorfman opened the door to his hotel roomand immediately wheeled away back toward the television set you have finally decided to come youve heard heard what dorfman said i am an old man no one bothers with me anymore im cast by the wayside by everyone including you he clicked off the television set and grinned sanders said what have you heard oh just a few things rumors idle talk why dont you tell me yourself im in trouble max of course you are in trouble dorfman snorted you have been in trouble all week you only noticed now theyre setting me up they blackburn and meredith nonsense its true you believe blackburn can set you up philip blackburn is a spineless fool he has no principles and almost no brains i told garvin to fire him years ago blackburn is incapable of original thought then meredith ali meredith yes so beautiful such lovely breasts max please you thought so too once that was a long time ago sanders said dorfman smiled times have changed he said with heavy irony what does that mean you are looking pale thomas i cant figure anything out im scared oh youre scared a big man like you is scared of this beautiful woman with beautiful breasts max of course you are right to be scared she has done all these many terrible things to you she has tricked you and manipulated you and abused you yes yes sanders said you have been victimized by her and garvin yes then why were you mentioning to me the flower hmm he frowned for a moment he didnt know what dorfman was talking about the old man was always so confusing and he liked to be theflower dorfman said irritably rapping his knuckles on the wheelchair arm the stainedglass flower in your apartment we were speaking of it the other day dont tell me you have forgotten it the truth was that he had until that moment then he remembered the image of the stainedglass flower the image that had come unbidden to his mind a few days earlier youre right i forgot you forgot dorfmans voice was heavy with sarcasm you expect me to believe that max i did i he snorted you are impossible i cannot believe you will behave so transparently you didnt forget thomas you merely chose not to confront it confront what in his mind sanders saw the stainedglass flower in bright orange and purple and yellow the flower mounted in the door of his apartment earlier in the week he had been thinking about it constantly almost obsessing about it and yet today i cannot bear this charade dorfman said of course you remember it all but you aredetermined not to think of it sanders shook his head confused thomas you told it all to me ten years ago dorfman said waving his handyou confided in me blubbering you were very upset at the time it was the most important thing in your life at the time now you say it is all forgotten he shook his head you told me that you would take trips with garvin to japan and korea and when you returned she would be waiting for you in the apartment in some erotic costume or whatever some erotic pose and you told me that sometimes when you got home you would see her first through the stained glass isnt that what you told me thomas or do i have it wrong he had it wrong it came back to sanders in a rush then like a picture zooming large and bright before his eyes he saw everything almost as if he was there once again the steps leading up to his apartment on the second floor and the sounds he heard as he went up the steps in the middle of the afternoon sounds he could not identify at first but then he realized what he was hearing as he came to the landing and looked in through the stained glass and he saw i came back a day early sanders said yes thats right you came backunexpectedly the glass in patterns of yellow and orange and purple and through it her naked back moving up and down she was in the living room on the couch moving up and down and what did you do dorfman said when you saw her i rang the bell thats right very civilized of you very nonconfrontational and polite you rang the bell in his mind he saw meredith turning looking toward the door her tangled hair falling across her face she brushed the hair away from her eyes her expression changed as she saw him her eyes widened dorfman prodded and then what what did you do i left sanders said i went back to the i went to the garage and got in my car i drove for a while a couple of hours maybe more it was dark when i got back you were upset naturally he came back up the stairs and again looked in through the stained glass the living room was empty he unlocked the door and entered the living room there was a bowl of popcorn on the couch the couch was creased the television was on soundless he looked away from the couch and went into the bedroom calling her name he found her packing her open suitcase on the bed he said what are you doing leaving she said she turned to face him her body was rigid tense isnt that what you want me to do i dont know he said and then she burst into tears sobbing reaching for a kleenex blowing her nose loudly awkwardly like a child and somehow in her distress he held his arms out and she hugged him and said she was sorry repeating the words again and again through her tears looking up at him touching his face and then somehow dorfman cackled right on the suitcase yes right there on the suitcase on her clothes that were being packed you made your reconciliation yes sanders said remembering she aroused you you wanted her back she excited you she challenged you you wanted to possess her yes love is wonderful dorfman sighed sarcastic again so pure so innocent and then you were together again is that right yes for a while but it didnt work out it was odd how it had finally ended he had been so angry with her at first but he had forgiven her and he thought that they could go on they had talked about their feelings they had expressed their love and he had tried to go on with the best will in the world but in the end neither of them could the incident had fatally ruptured the relationship and something vital had been torn from it it didnt matter how often they told themselves that they could go on something else now ruled the core was dead they fought more often managing in this way to sustain the old energy for a while but finally it just ended and when it was over dorfman said that was when you came and talked to me yes sanders said and what did you come to talk to me about dorfman asked or have you forgotten that too no i remember i wanted your advice he had gone to dorfman because he was considering leaving cupertino he was breaking up with meredith his life was confused everything was in disarray and he wanted to make a fresh start to go somewhere else so he was considering moving to seattle to head the advanced projects division garvin had offered him the job in passing one day and sanders was thinking about taking it he had asked dorfmans advice you were quite upset dorfman said it was an unhappy ending to a love affair yes so you might say that meredith johnson is the reason you are here in seattle dorfman said because of her you changed your career your life you made a new life here and many people knew this fact of your past garvin knew and blackburn knew that is why he was so careful to ask you if you could work with her everyone was so worried about how it would be but you reassured them thomas didnt you yes and your reassurances were false sanders hesitated i dont know max come now you know exactly it must have been like a bad dream a nightmare from your past to hear that this person you had run away from was now coming to seattle pursuing you up here and that she would be your superior in the company taking the job that you wanted that you thought you deserved i dont know dont you in your place i would be angry i would want to be rid of her yes she hurt you once very badly and you would not want to be hurt again but what choice did you have she had the job and she was garvins protege she was protected by garvins power and he would not hear a word against her true true and for many years you had not been close to garvin because garvin didnt really want you to take the seattle job in the first place he had offered it to you expecting you to turn it down garvin likes proteges he likes admirers at his feet he does not like his admirers to pack up and leave for another city so garvin was disappointed with you things were never the same and now suddenly here was this woman out of your past a woman with garvins backing so what choice did you have what could you do with your anger his mind was spinning confused when he thought back to the events of that first daythe rumors the announcement by blackburn the first meeting with herhe did not remember feeling anger his feelings had been so complicated on that day but he had not felt anger he was sure of it thomas thomas stop dreaming there is no time for it sanders was shaking his head he couldnt think clearly thomas youarranged all this whether you admit it or not whether you are aware of it or not on some level what has happened is exactly what you intended and you made sure it would happen he found himself remembering susan what had she said at the restaurant why didnt you tell me i could have belped you and she was right of course she was an attorney she could have advised him if he had told her what happened the first night she would have told him what to do she could have gotten him out of it but he hadnt told her theres not mucb we can do now you wanted this confrontation thomas and then garvinshe was your girlfriend and you didnt like it when she dropped you so now you want to pay her back you worked all week to ensure this confrontation max so dont tell me you are a victim here youre not a victim you call yourself a victim because you dont want to take responsibility for your life because you are sentimental and lazy and naive you think other people should take care of you jesus max sanders said you deny your part in this you pretend to forget you pretend to be unaware and now you pretend to be confused max oh i dont know why i bother with you how many hours do you have until this meeting twelve hours ten yet you waste your time talking to a crazy old man he spun in his wheelchair if i were you i would get to work meaning what well we know what your intentions are thomas but what areher intentions hmmm she is solving a problem too she has a purpose here so what is the problem she is solving i dont know sanders said clearly but how will you find out lost in thought he walked the five blocks to terrazzo fernandez was waiting for him outside they went in together oh christ sanders said as he looked around all the usual suspects fernandez said in the far section straight ahead meredith johnson was having dinner with bob garvin two tables away phil blackburn was eating with his wife doris a thin bespectacled woman who looked like an accountant near them stephanie kaplan was having dinner with a young man in his twentiesprobably her son at the university sanders thought and over to the right by the window the conleywhite people were in the midst of a working dinner their briefcases open at their feet papers scattered all over the table ed nichols sat with john conley to his right and jim daly to his left daly was speaking into a tiny dictating machine maybe we should go somewhere else sanders said no fernandez said theyve already seen us we can sit in the corner over there carmine came over mr sanders he said with a formal nod wed like a table in the corner carmine yes of course mr sanders they sat to one side fernandez was staring at meredith and garvin she could be his daughter she said everybody says so its quite striking the waiter brought menus nothing on it appealed to sanders but they ordered anyway fernandez was looking steadily at garvin hes a fighter isnt he bob famous fighter famous tough guy she knows how to play him fernandez turned away and pulled papers out of her briefcase this is the contract that blackburn sent back it is all in order except for two clauses first they claim the right to terminate you if you are shown to have committed a felony on the job uhhuh he wondered what they might mean and this second clause claims the right to terminate you if you have failed to demonstrate satisfactory performance in the job as measured by industry standards what does that mean he shook his head they must have something in mind he told her about the conversation he had overheard in the conference room as usual fernandez showed no reaction possible she said possible theyre going to do it i meant legally its possible that they intend something of this sort and it would work why a harassment claim brings up the entire performance of an employee if there is dereliction even a very old or minor dereliction it may be used to dismiss the claim i had one client who worked for a company for ten years but the company was able to demonstrate that the employee had lied on the original application form and the case was dismissed the employee was fired so this comes down to my performance it may yes he frowned what did they have on him she is solving a problem too so wbat is the problem she is solving beside him fernandez pulled the tape recorder out of her pocket theres a couple of other things i want to go over she said theres something that happens early on in the tape okay i want you to listen she gave the player to him he held it close to his ear he heard his own voice saying clearly well face that later ive given her your thoughts and shes talking to bob now so presumably well go into the meeting tomorrow taking that position well anyway mark if there is a significant change in all this ill contact you before the meeting tomorrow and forget that phone merediths voice said loudly and then there was the sound of rustling like fabric and a sort of hissing sound and a dullthunk as the phone was dropped the momentary sharp crackle of static more rustling then silence a grunt rustling as he listened he tried to imagine the action in the room they must have moved over to the couch because now the voices were lower less distinct he heard himself say meredith wait oh god she said ive wanted you all day more rustling heavy breathing it was hard to be certain what was happening a little moan from her more rustling she said oh god you feel so good i cant stand the bastard touching me those stupid glasses oh im sohot i havent had a decent fuck more rustling static crackle rustling more rustling sanders listened with a sense of disappointment he could not really create images for what was going onand he had been there this tape would not be persuasive to someone else most of it sounded like obscure noise with long periods of silence meredith oooh dont talk no no he heard her gasping in little breaths then more silence fernandez said thats enough sanders put the player down and shut it off he shook his head you cant tell anything from this about what was really going on you can tell enough fernandez said and dont you start worrying about the evidence thats my job but you heard her first statements she consulted her notepad where she says ive wanted you all day and then she says oh god you feel so good i cant stand the bastard touching me those stupid glasses oh im so hot i havent had a decent fuck you heard that part yes i heard it okay who is she talking about talking about yes who is the bastard she cant stand touching her i assume her husband sanders said we were talking about him earlier before the tape tell me what was said earlier well meredith was complaining about having to pay alimony to her husband and then she said her husband was terrible in bed she said i hate a man who doesnt know what hes doing so you think i cant stand the bastard touching me refers to her husband yes i dont fernandez said they were divorced months ago the divorce was bitter the husband hates her he has a girlfriend now hes taken her to mexico i dont think she means the husband then who i dont know sanders said i suppose it could be anybody i dont think its just anybody listen again listen to how she sounds he rewound the tape held the player to his ear after a moment he put the player down she sounds almost angry fernandez nodded resentful is the term id use shes in the midst of this episode with you and shes talking about someone else the bastard its as if she wants to pay somebody back right at that moment shes getting even sanders said i dont know merediths a talker she always talked about other people old boyfriends that stuff shes not what youd call a romantic he remembered one time when they were lying on the bed in the apartment in sunnyvale feeling a sort of relaxed glow a sunday afternoon listening to kids laughing in the street outside his hand resting on her thigh feeling the sweat and in this thoughtful way she said you know i once went out with this norwegian guy and he had a curved dick curved like a sword sort of bent over to the side and he jesus meredith whats the matter its true he really did not now whenever this sort of thing happened shed sigh as if she was obliged to put up with his excessive sensitivity why is it that guys always want to think theyre the only ones we dont we know were not just not now okay and shed sigh again sitting in the restaurant fernandez said even if its not unusual for her to talk during sexeven if she is indiscreet or distancingwho is she talking about here sanders shook his head i dont know louise and she says she cant stand him touching her as if she has no choice and she mentions his silly glasses she looked over at meredith who was eating quietly with garvin him i dont think so why not everybody says no everybody says bob isnt screwing her everybody could be wrong sanders shook his head itd be incest youre probably right the food came sanders poked at his pasta puttanesca picking out the olives he wasnt feeling hungry beside him fernandez ate heartily they had ordered the same thing sanders looked over at the conleywhite people nichols was holding up a clear plastic sheet of millimeter transparencies slides of what he wondered his halfframe glasses were perched on his nose he seemed to be taking a long time beside him conley glanced at his watch and said something about the time the others nodded conley glanced over at johnson then turned back to his papers daly said something have that figure its here conley said pointing to the sheet this is really very good fernandez said you shouldnt let it get cold okay he took a bite it had no taste he put the fork down she wiped her chin with her napkin you know you never really told me why you stopped at the end my friend max dorfman says i set it all up uhhuh fernandez said do you think that too i dont know i was just asking what you were feeling at the time at the time you pulled away he shrugged i just didnt want to uhhuh didnt feel like it when you got there huh no i didnt then he said you really want to know what it was she coughed she coughed fernandez said sanders saw himself again in the room his trousers down around his knees bent over meredith on the office couch he remembered think ing what the hell am i doing and she had her hands on his shoulders tugging him toward her oh please no no and then she turned her head aside and coughed that cough was what did it that was when he sat back and said youre right and got off the couch fernandez frowned i have to say fernandez said a cough doesnt seem like a big deal it was he pushed his plate away i mean you cant cough at a time like that why is this some etiquette i dont know about fernandez said no coughing in the clinch its not that at all sanders said its just what it means im sorry youve lost me what does a cough mean he hesitated you know women always think that men dont know whats going on theres this whole idea that men cant find the place they dont know what to do all that stuff how men are stupid about sex i dont think youre stupid what does a cough mean a cough means youre not involved she raised her eyebrows that seems a little extreme its just a fact i dont know my husband has bronchitis he coughs all the time not at the last moment he doesnt she paused thinking about it well he certainly does right afterward he breaks out in a fit of coughing we always laugh about how he does that right after is different but at the moment right in the intense moment im telling you nobody coughs more images flashed through his mind her cheeks turn red her neck is blotchy or her upper chest nipples no longer hard they were hard at first but not now the eyes get dark sometimes purple below lips swollen breathing changes sudden surging heat shift in the hips shifting rhythm tension but something else something liquid forehead frowning wincing biting so many different ways but nobody coughs he said again and then he felt a kind of sudden embarrassment and pulled his plate back and took a bite of pasta he wanted a reason not to say more because he had the feeling that he had overstepped the rules that there was still this area this kind of knowledge this awareness that everyone pretended didnt exist fernandez was staring at him curiously did you read about this somewhere he shook his head chewing do men discuss it things like this he shook his head no women do i know he swallowed but anyway she coughed and that was why i stopped she wasnt involved and i was veryangry about it i guess i mean she was lying there panting and moaning but she was really uninvolved and i felt exploited something like that manipulated sometimes i think maybe if she hadnt coughed right then sanders shrugged maybe i should ask her fernandez said nodding her head in merediths direction sanders looked up and saw that she was coming over to their table oh hell calmly calmly everythings fine meredith came over a big smile on her face hello louise hello tom sanders started to get up dont get up tom please she rested her hand on his shoulder gave it a little squeeze i just came by for a moment she was smiling radiantly she looked exactly like the confident boss stopping to say hello to a couple of colleagues back at her table sanders saw garvin paying the bill he wondered if he would come over too louise i just wanted to say no hard feelings meredith said everybody had a job to do i understand that and i think it served a purpose clearing the air i just hope we can go on productively from here meredith was standing behind sanderss chair as she talked he had to twist his head and crane his neck to look at her fernandez said dont you want to sit down well maybe for a minute sanders stood to get her a chair he was thinking that to the conley people all this would look exactly right the boss not wanting to intrude waiting to be pressed by her coworkers to join them as he brought the chair he glanced over and saw that nichols was looking at them peering over his glasses so was young conley meredith sat down sanders pushed the chair in for her you want anything fernandez said solicitously i just finished thanks coffee anything im fine thanks sanders sat down meredith leaned forward bobs been telling me about his plans to take this division public its very exciting it looks like full speed ahead sanders watched her with astonishment now bob has a list of names for the new company when we spin it off next year see how these sound to you speedcore speedstar primecore talisan and tensor i think speedcore makes racing parts for stock cars speedstar is right on the money but maybe too right on primecore sounds like a mutual fund how about talisan or tensor tensor is a lamp fernandez said okay but talisan is pretty good i think the appleibm joint venture is called taligent sanders said oh youre right too close how about microdyne thats not bad or adg for advanced data graphics do either of those work do you think microdyne is okay i thought so too and there was one more anodyne thats a painkiller fernandez said what is an anodyne is a painkiller a narcotic oh forget that last one synstar sounds like a drug company yeah it does but weve got a year to come up with a better one and microdyne isnt bad to start sort of combining micro with dynamo good images dont you think before they could answer she pushed her chair back ive got to go but i thought youd like to hear the thinking thanks for your input good night louise and tom ill see you tomorrow she shook hands with them both and crossed the room to garvin together she and garvin went over to the conley table to say hello sanders stared at her good images he repeated christ shes talking about names for a company but she doesnt even know what the company is it was quite a show sure sanders said shes all show but it had nothing to do with us its for them he nodded toward the conleywhite people sitting across the restaurant garvin was shaking hands all around and meredith was talking to jim daly daly made a joke and she laughed throwing her head back showing her long neck the only reason she talked to us was so that when i get fired tomorrow she wont be seen as having planned it fernandez was paying the bill you want to go she said i still have some things to check really what do you have to check alan may have gotten something more for us theres a possibility at the conley table garvin was saying goodbye he gave a final wave then crossed the room to talk to carmine meredith remained at the conleywhite table she was standing behind john conley with her hands resting on his shoulders while she talked to daly and ed nichols ed nichols said something peering over his glasses and meredith laughed and came around to look over his shoulder at a sheet of figures he was holding her head was very close to nichols she nodded talked pointed to the sheet youre cbecking the wrong company sanders stared at meredith smiling and joking with the three men from conleywhite what had phil blackburn said to him yesterday the thing is tom meredith johnson is very well connected in this company she bas impressed a lot of important people like garvin not only garvin meredith bas built a power base in several areas conley white yes tbere too alongside him fernandez stood up sanders stood and said you know what louise what weve been checking the wrong company fernandez frowned then looked over at the conleywhite table meredith was nodding with ed nichols and pointing with one hand her other hand flat on the table for balance her fingers were touching ed nichols he was peering at the sheets of data over his glasses stupid glasses sanders said no wonder meredith wouldnt press harassment charges against him it would have been too embarrassing for her relationship with ed nichols and no wonder garvin wouldnt fire her it made perfect sense nichols was already uneasy about the mergerhis affair with meredith might be all that was holding it in place fernandez sighed you think so nichols yeah why not fernandez shook her head even if its true it doesnt help us they can argue paramour preference they can argue lots of thingsif theres even an argument that needs to be made this isnt the first merger made in the sack you know i say forget it you mean to tell me he said that theres nothing improper with her having an affair with someone at conleywhite and being promoted as a result nothing at all at least not in the strict legal sense so forget it suddenly he remembered what kaplan had saidshe was looking in the wrong direction when they fired her im tired he said we all are they look tired too across the room the meeting was breaking up papers were being put back into briefcases meredith and garvin were chatting with them they all started leaving garvin shook hands with carmine who opened the front door for his departing guests and then it happened there was the sudden harsh glare of quartz lights shining in from the street outside the group huddled together trapped in the light they cast long shadows back into the restaurant whats going on fernandez said sanders turned to look but already the group was ducking back inside closing the door there was a moment of sudden chaos they heard garvin saygoddamn it and spin to blackburn blackburn stood a stricken look on his face and rushed over to garvin garvin was shifting from foot to foot he was simultaneously trying to reassure the conleywhite people and chew out blackburn sanders went over everything okay its the goddamned press garvin said kseatv is out there this is an outrage meredith said theyre asking about some harassment suit garvin said looking darkly at sanders sanders shrugged ill speak to them blackburn said this is just ridiculous ill say its ridiculous garvin said its an outrage is what it is everyone seemed to be talking at once agreeing that it was an outrage but sanders saw that nichols looked shaken now meredith was leading them out of the restaurant the back way onto the terrace blackburn went out the front into the harsh lights he held up his hands like a man being arrested then the door closed nichols was saying not good not good dont worry i know the news director over there garvin was saying ill put this one away jim daly said something about how the merger ought to be confidential dont worry garvin said grimly its going to be confidential as hell by the time i get through then they were gone out the back door into the night sanders went back to the table where fernandez was waiting a little excitement fernandez said calmly more than a little sanders said he glanced across the room at stephanie kaplan still having dinner with her son the young man was talking gesturing with his hands but kaplan was staring fixedly at the back door where the conleywhite people had departed she had a curious expression on her face then after a moment she turned back and resumed her conversation with her son the evening was black damp and unpleasant he shivered as he walked back to his office with fernandez how did a television crew get the story probably from walsh fernandez said but maybe another way its really a small town anyway never mind that youve got to prepare for the meeting tomorrow ive been trying to forget that yeah well dont ahead they saw pioneer square with windows in the buildings still brightly lit many of the companies here had business with japan and stayed open to overlap with the first hours of the day in tokyo you know fernandez said watching her with those men i noticed how cool she was yes meredith is cool very controlled yes she is so why did she approach you so overtlyand on her first day what was the rush what is the problem she is trying tosolve max had said now fernandez was asking the same thing everyone seemed to understand except sanders youre not a victim so solve it he thought get to work he remembered the conversation when meredith and blackburn were leaving the conference room it should be quite smooth andimpersonal after allyou have thefactson your sidehes clearly incompetent he still cant get into the database no he s locked out ofthesystem and theres no way he can get into conley whiter system no way in hell meredith they were right of course he couldnt get into the system but what difference would it make if he could solve the problemmax had saiddo whatyou dobest solve the problem hell sanders said itll come fernandez said it was ninethirty on the fourth floor cleaning crews worked in the central partition area sanders went into his office with fernandez he didnt really know why they were going there there wasnt anything he could think to do now fernandez said let me talk to alan he might have something she sat down and began to dial sanders sat behind his desk and stared at the monitor on the screen his email message read youre still checking the wrong company afriend i dont see how he said looking at the screen he felt irritable playing with a puzzle that everyone could solve except him fernandez said alan louise what have you got uhhuh uhhuh is that well thats very disappointing alan no i dont know now if you can yes when would you be seeing her all right whatever you can she hung up no luck tonight but weve only got tonight yes sanders stared at the message on the computer screen somebody inside the company was trying to help him telling him he was checking the wrong company the message seemed to imply that there was a way for him to check the other company and presumably whoever knew enough to send this message also knew that sanders had been cut out of the digicom system his privileges revoked what could he do nothing fernandez said who do you think this afriend is i dont know suppose you had to guess i dont know what comes into your mind she said he considered the possibility that afriend was mary anne hunter but mary anne wasnt really a technical person her strength was marketing she wasnt likely to be sending routed messages over the internet she probably didnt know what the internet was so not mary anne and not mark lewyn lewyn was furious at him don cherry sanders paused considering that in a way this was just like cherry but the only time that sanders had seen him since this began cherry had been distinctly unfriendly not cherry then who else could it be those were the only people with executive sysop access in seattle hunter lewyn cherry a short list stephanie kaplan unlikely at heart kaplan was plodding and unimaginative and she didnt know enough about computers to do this was it somebody outside the company it could be gary bosak he thought gary probably felt guilty about having turned his back on sanders and gary had a hackers devious instinctsand a hackers sense of humor it might very well be gary but it still didnt do sanders any good you were always good at technical problems that was always your strength he pulled out the twinkle cdromdrive still in plastic why would they want it wrapped that way never mind he thought stay focused there was something wrong with the drive if he knew what he would have the answer who would know wrapped in plastic it was something to do with the production line it must be he fumbled with the material on his desk and found the dat cartridge he inserted it into the machine it came up showing his conversation with arthur kahn kahn was on one side of the screen sanders on the other behind arthur the brightly lit assembly line beneath banks of fluorescent lights kahn coughed and rubbed his chin hello tom how are you im fine arthur he said well good im sorry about the new organization but sanders wasnt listening to the conversation he was looking at kahn he noticed now that kahn was standing very close to the camera so close that his features were slightly blurred out of focus his face was large and blocked any clear view of the production line behind him you know how i feel personally kahn was saying on the screen his face was blocking the line sanders watched a moment more and then switched the tape off lets go downstairs he said you have an idea call it a lastditch hope he said the lights clicked on harsh lights shining on the tables of the diagnostic team fernandez said what is this place this is where they check the drives the drives that dont work right fernandez gave a little shrug im afraid im not me neither sanders said im not a technical person i can just read people she looked around the room can you read this he sighed no fernandez said are they finished i dont know he said and then he saw it theywerefinished they had to be because otherwise the diagnostics team would be working all night trying to get ready for the meeting tomorrow but they had covered the tables up and gone to their professional association meeting because they were finished the problem was solved everybody knew it but him that was why they had only opened three drives they didnt need to open the others and they had asked for them to be sealed in plastic because the punctures air he said air they think its the air what air she said the air in the plant the plant in malaysia right this is about air in malaysia no air in the plant he looked again at the notebook on the table ppu followed by a row of figures ppu stood for particulates per unit it was the standard measure of air cleanliness in a plant and these figures ranging from two to eleven they were way off they should be running zero particulates one at most these figures were unacceptable the air in the plant was bad that meant that they would be getting dirt in the split optics dirt in the drive arms dirt in the chip joins he looked at the chips attached to the board christ he said what is it look i dont see anything theres a space between the chips and the boards the chips arent seated it looks okay to me its not he turned to the stacked drives he could see at a glance that all the chips were seated differently some were tight some had a gap of a few millimeters so you could see the metal contacts this isnt right sanders said this should never happen the fact was that the chips were inserted on the line by automated chip pressers every board every chip should look exactly the same coming off the line but they didnt they were all different because of that you could get voltage irregularities memory allocation problemsall kinds of random stuff which was exactly what they were getting he looked at the blackboard the list of the flowchart one item caught his eye d mechanicalvv the diagnostics team had put two checks beside mechanical the problem with the cdromdrives was a mechanical problem which meant it was a problem in the production line and the production line was his responsibility hed designed it hed set it up hed checked all the specs on that line from beginning to end and now it wasnt working right he was sure that it wasnt his fault something must have happened after he had set up the line somehow it had been changed around and it didnt work anymore but what had happened to find out he needed to get onto the databases but he was locked out there wasnt any way to get online immediately he thought of bosak bosak could get him on so for that matter could one of the programmers on cherrys teams these kids were hackers they would break into a system for a moment of minor amusement the way ordinary people went out for coffee but there werent any programmers in the building now and he didnt know when they would be back from their meeting those kids were so unreliable like the kid that had thrown up all over the walker pad that was the problem they were just kids playing with toys like the walker pad bright creative kids fooling around no cares at all and ohjesus he sat forward louise yes theres a way to do this do what get into the database he turned and hurried out of the room he was rummaging through his pockets looking for the second electronic passcard fernandez said are we going somewhere yes we are do you mind telling me where new york sanders said the lights flicked on one after another in long banks fernandez stared at the room what is this the exercise room from hell its a virtual reality simulator sanders said she looked at the round walker pads and all the wires the cables hanging from the ceiling this is how youre going to get to new york thats right sanders went over to the hardware cabinets there were large handpainted signs reading do not touch and hands off you little wonk he hesitated looking for the control console i hope you know what youre doing fernandez said she stood by one of the walker pads looking at the silver headset because i think somebody could get electrocuted with this yeah i know sanders lifted covers off monitors and put them back on again moving quickly he found the master switch a moment later the equipment hummed one after another the monitors began to glow sanders said get up on the pad he came over and helped her stand on the walker pad fernandez moved her feet experimentally feeling the balls roll immediately there was a green flash from the lasers what was that the scanner mapping you dont worry about it heres the headset he brought the headset down from the ceiling and started to place it over her eyes just a minute she pulled away what is this the headset has two small display screens they project images right in front of your eyes put it on and be careful these things are expensive how expensive a quarter of a million dollars apiece he fitted the headset over her eyes and put the headphones over her ears i dont see any images its dark in here thats because youre not plugged in louise he plugged in her cables oh she said in a surprised voice what do you know i can see a big blue screen like a movie screen right in front of me at the bottom of the screen there are two boxes one saysonand one says off just dont touch anything keep your hands on this bar he said putting her fingers on the walker handhold im going to mount up this thing on my head feels funny sanders stepped up onto the second walker pad and brought the headset down from the ceiling he plugged in the cable ill be right with you he said he put on the headset sanders saw the blue screen surrounded by blackness he looked to his left and saw fernandez standing beside him she looked entirely normal dressed in her street clothes the video was recording her appearance and the computer eliminated the walker pad and the headset i can see you she said in a surprised voice she smiled the part of her face covered by the headset was computer animated giving her a slightly unreal cartoonlike quality walk up to the screen how just walk louise sanders started forward on the walker pad the blue screen became larger and larger until it filled his field of vision he went over to theonbutton and pushed it with his finger the blue screen flashed in huge lettering stretching wide in front of them it said digital communications data systems beneath that was listed a column of oversize menu items the screen looked exactly like an ordinary digicom monitor screen the kind on everybodys office desk now blown up to enormous size a gigantic computer terminal fernandez said wonderful just what everybody has been hoping for just wait sanders poked at the screen selecting menu items there was a kind ofwhooshand the lettering on the screen curved inward pulling back and deepening until it formed a sort of funnel that stretched away from them into the distance fernandez was silent that shut her up he thought now as they watched the blue funnel began to distort it widened became rectangular the lettering and the blue color faded beneath his feet a floor emerged it looked like veined marble the walls on both sides became wood paneling the ceiling was white its a corridor she said in a soft voice the corridor continued to build itself progressively adding more detail drawers and cabinets appeared in the walls pillars formed along its length other hallways opened up leading down to other corridors large light fixtures emerged from the walls and turned themselves on now the pillars cast shadows on the marble floors its like a library she said an oldfashioned library this part is yes how many parts are there im not sure he started walking forward she hurried to catch up to him through his earphones he heard the sound of their feet clicking on the marble floor cherry had added thata nice touch fernandez asked have you been here before not for several weeks not since it was finished where are we going im not exactly sure but somewhere in here theres a way to get into the conleywhite database she said where are we now were in data louise this is all just data this corridor is data there is no corridor everything you see is just a bunch of numbers its the digicom company database exactly the same database that people access every day through their computer terminals except its being represented for us as a place she walked alongside him i wonder who did the decorating its modeled on a real library in oxford i think they came to the junction with other corridors stretching away big signs hung overhead one said accounting another said human resources a third said marketing i see fernandez said were inside your company database thats right this is amazing yeah except we dont want to be here somehow we have to get into conleywhite how do we do that i dont know sanders said i need help help is here said a soft voice nearby sanders looked over and saw an angel about a foot high it was white and hovered in the air near his head it held a flickering candle in its hands goddamn louise said am sorry the angel said is that a command i do not recognize goddamn no sanders said quickly its not a command he was thinking that he would have to be careful or they would crash the system very well i await your command angel i need help help is here how do i enter the conleywhite database i do not recognize the conleywhite database that made sense sanders thought cherrys team wouldnt have programmed anything about conleywhite into the help system he would have to phrase the question more generally sanders said angel i am looking for a database very well database gateways are accessed with the keypad where is the keypad sanders said make a fist with your hand sanders made a fist and a gray pad formed in the air so that he appeared to be holding it he pulled it toward him and looked at it pretty neat fernandez said i also know jokes the angel said would you like to hear one no sanders said very well i await your command sanders stared at the pad it had a long list of operator commands with arrows and push buttons fernandez said what is that the worlds most complicated tv remote just about he found a push button markedotherthat seemed likely he pressed it nothing happened he pressed it again the gateway is opening the angel announced where i dont see anything the gateway is opening sanders waited then he realized that the digicom system would have to connect to any remote database the connection was going through that was causing a delay connecting now the angel said the wall of the corridor began to dissolve they saw a large gaping black hole and nothing beyond it thats creepy fernandez said white wireframe lines began to appear outlining a new corridor the spaces filled one by one creating the appearance of solid shapes this one looks different fernandez said were connecting over a t highspeed data line sanders said but even so its much slower the corridor rebuilt itself as they watched this time the walls were gray they faced a blackandwhite world no color the systems trying to generate a simpler environment color means more data to push around so this is black and white the new corridor added lights a ceiling a floor after a moment sanders said shall we go in you mean the conleywhite database is in there thats right sanders said i dont know she said she pointed what about this directly in front of them was a kind of flowing river of blackand white static it ran along the floor and also along the walls it made a loud hissing sound i think thats just static off the phone lines you think its okay to cross we have to he started forward immediately there was a growl a large dog blocked their path it had three heads that floated above its body looking in all directions whats that probably a representation of their system security cherry and his sense of humor he thought can it hurt us for gods sake louise its just a cartoon somewhere of course there was an actual monitoring system running on the conleywhite database perhaps it was automatic or perhaps there was a real person who actually watched users come and go on the system but now it was nearly one oclock in the morning in new york the dog was most likely just an automatic device of some kind sanders walked forward stepping through the flowing river of static the dog growled as he approached the three heads swiveled watching him as he passed with cartoon eyes it was a strange sensation but nothing happened he looked back at fernandez coming she moved forward tentatively the angel remained behind hovering in the air angel are you coming it didnt answer probably cant cross a gateway sanders said not programmed they walked down the gray corridor it was lined with unmarked drawers on all sides it looks like a morgue fernandez said well at least were here this is their company database in new york yes i just hope we can find it find what he didnt answer her he walked over to one file cabinet at random and pulled it open he scanned the folders building permits he said for some warehouse in maryland looks like why arent there labels even as she said it sanders saw that labels were slowly emerging out of the gray surfaces i guess it just takes time sanders turned and looked in all directions scanning the other labels okay thats better hr records are on this wall over here he walked along the wall he pulled open a drawer uhoh fernandez said what somebodys coming she said in an odd voice at the far end of the corridor a gray figure was approaching it was still too distant to make out details but it was striding directly toward them what do we do i dont know sanders said can he see us i dont know i dont think so we can see him but he cant see us i dont know sanders was trying to figure it out cherry had installed another virtual system in the hotel if someone was on that system then he or she could probably see them but cherry had said that his system represented other users as well such as somebody accessing the database from a computer and somebody using a computer wouldnt be able to see them a computer user wouldnt know who else was in the system the figure continued to advance it seemed to come forward in jerks not smoothly they saw more detail they could start to see eyes a nose a mouth this is really creepy fernandez said the figure was still closer the details were filling in no kidding sanders said it was ed nichols up close they saw that nicholss face was represented by a black andwhite photograph wrapped crudely around an eggshaped head atop a gray moving body that had the appearance of a mannequin or a puppet it was a computergenerated figure which meant that nichols wasnt on the virtual system he was probably using his notebook computer in his hotel room nichols walked up to them and continued steadily past them he cant see us fernandez said why does his face look that way cherry said that the system pulls a photo from the file and pastes it on users the nicholsfigure continued on walking down the corridor away from them whats he doing here lets find out they followed him back down the corridor until nichols stopped at one file cabinet he pulled it open and began to go through the records sanders and fernandez came up and stood by his shoulder and watched what he was doing the computergenerated figure of ed nichols was thumbing through his notes and email he went back two months then three months then six months now he began to pull out sheets of paper which seemed to hang in the air as he read them memos notations personal and confidential copies to file sanders said these are all about the acquisition more notes came out nichols was pulling them quickly one after another hes looking for something specific nichols stopped he had found what he was looking for his gray computer image held it in his hand and looked at it sanders read it over his shoulder and said certain phrases aloud to fernandez memo dated december last year met yesterday and today with garvin and johnson in cupertino re possible acquisition of digicom bla bla very favorable first impression excellent grounding in critical areas we seek to acquire bla bla highly capable and aggressive executive staff at all levels particularly impressed with competence of ms johnson despite youth ill bet you were impressed ed the computergenerated nichols moved down the hall to another drawer and opened it he didnt find what he wanted and closed it he went on to another drawer then he began reading again and sanders read this one too memo to john marden cost issues re digicom acquisition bla bla concern for hightechnology development costs in new company bla bla here we are ms johnson has undertaken to demonstrate her fiscal responsibility in new malaysia operation suggests savings can be made expected cost savings how the hell could she do that do what fernandez said demonstrate fiscal responsibility in the malaysia operation that was my operation uhoh fernandez said youre not going to believe this sanders glanced over at her fernandez was staring down the corridor he turned to look someone else was coming toward them busy night he said but even from a distance he could see that this figure was different the head was more lifelike and the body was fully detailed the figure walked smoothly naturally this could be trouble he said sanders recognized him even from a distance its john conley fernandez said right and hes on the walker pad which means conley abruptly stopped in the middle of the corridor and stared he can see us sanders said he can how hes on the system we installed in the hotel thats why hes so detailed hes on the other virtual system so he can see us and we can see him uhoh you said it conley moved forward slowly he was frowning he looked from sanders to fernandez to nichols and back to sanders he seemed uncertain what to do then he held his finger to his lips a gesture for silence can he hear us fernandez whispered no sanders said in a normal voice can we talk to him no conley seemed to make a decision he walked over to sanders and fernandez until he was standing very close he looked from one to the other they could see his expression perfectly then he smiled he extended his hand sanders reached out and shook it he didnt feel anything but through the headset he saw what looked like his hand gripping conleys then conley shook fernandezs hand this is extremely weird fernandez said conley pointed toward nichols then he pointed to his own eyes then to nichols again they crossed the gateway past the barking dog and came back into the victorian library fernandez sighed it feels good to be home again doesnt it conley was walking along showing no surprise but then he had seen the corridor before sanders walked quickly the angel floated alongside them but you realize fernandez said that none of this makes any sense because nichols is the one whos been opposed to the acquisition and conley is the one pushing for it thats right sanders said its perfect nichols is having it off with meredith he promotes her behind the scenes as the new head of the division and how does he hide that fact by continuously bitching and moaning to anybody who will listen you mean its a cover sure thats why meredith never answered his complaints in any of the meetings she knew he wasnt a real threat and conley she said conley was still walking alongside them conley genuinely wants the acquisition and he wants it to work well conleys smart and i think he realizes that meredith isnt competent for the job but conley sees meredith as the price of nicholss support so conley has gone along with the choice of meredithat least for the time being and what are we doing now finding out about the last missing piece which is sanders was looking down the hallway markedoperationsthis wasnt really his area of the database except in specific places of overlap the files were marked alphabetically he went down the row until he founddigicommalaysia sa he opened it up and searched the file section markedstartuphe found his own memos feasibility studies site reports government negotiations first set specifications memos from their singapore suppliers more government negotiations all stretching back two years what are you looking for building plans he expected to see the thick sheets of blueprints and inspection summaries but instead there was just a thin file he opened the first sheet and a three dimensional image of the factory floated in the air in front of him it was just an outline at first but it rapidly filled in and became solidlooking sanders fernandez and conley stood on three sides of it looking at it it was like a very large detailed dolls house they peered in through the windows sanders pushed a button the model became transparent then turned into a cutaway now they could see the assembly line the physical plant a green line the conveyor beltstarted moving and the machines and workers assembled the cdrom drives as the parts came down the line what are you looking for revisions he shook his head this is the first set of plans the second sheet was marked revisions first set with the date he opened it up the model of the plant seemed to shimmer for a moment but it remained the same nothing happened the next sheet was marked revisions detail only again when he opened it the plant shimmered briefly but was unchanged according to these records the plant was never revised sanders said but we know it was whats he doing fernandez said she was looking at conley sanders saw that conley was slowly mouthing words his facial movements exaggerated hes trying to tell us something she said to sanders can you see whatit is no sanders watched a moment but the cartoonlike quality of conleys face made it impossible to read his lips finally sanders shook his head conley nodded and took the keypad out of sanderss hand he pushed a button markedrelatedand sanders saw a list of related databases flash up in the air it was an extensive list including the permits from the malay government the architects notes the contractor agreements health and medical inspections and more all together there were about eighty items on the list sanders felt sure he would have overlooked the one in the middle of the list that conley was now pointing to operations review unit whats that fernandez said sanders pressed the name and a new sheet fluttered up he pushed a button markedsummaryand read the sheet aloud the operations review unit was formed four years ago in cupertino by philip blackburn to address problems not normally within operations management purview the mission of the review unit was to improve management efficiency within digicom over the years the operations review unit has successfully resolved a number of management problems at digicom uhhuh fernandez said nine months ago the operations review unit then headed by meredith johnson of cupertino operations undertook a review of the proposed manufacturing facility in kuala lumpur malaysia the immediate stimulus for the review was a conflict with the malay government over the number and ethnic composition of workers employed at the proposed facility uhoh fernandez said led by ms johnson with legal assistance from mr blackburn the operations review unit had outstanding success in resolving the many problems facing digicoms malaysian operation what is this a press release fernandez said looks like it sanders said he read on specific issues concerned the number and ethnic composition of workers employed at the facility the original plans called for seventy workers to be employed responding to the requests of the malay government operations review was able to increase the number of workers to eightyfive by reducing the amount of automation at the plant thus making the facility more suitable to the economy of a developing country sanders looked over at fernandez and screwing us completely he said why he continued in addition a costsavings review generated important fiscal benefits in a number of areas costs were reduced with no detriment to product quality at the plant airhandling capacity was revised to more appropriate levels and outsourcing supplier contracts were reallocated with substantial savings benefit to the company sanders shook his head thats it he said thats the whole ball game i dont understand fernandez said this makes sense to you youre damned right it does he pushed thedetailbutton for more pages i am sorry the angel said there is no more detail angel where are the supporting memos and files sanders knew that there had to be massive paperwork behind these summary changes the renegotiations with the malay government alone would fill drawers of files the angel said i am sorry there is no more detail available angel show me the files very well after a moment a sheet of pink paper flashed up the detail files on operations review unitmalaysia have been deleted sunday authorization dcc hell sanders said what does that mean somebody cleaned up sanders said just a few days ago who knew all this was going to happen angel show me all communications between malaysia and dc for the past two weeks do you wish telephone or video links video press v he pushed a button and a sheet uncurled in the air date linking to duration auth a kahn m johnson acss a kahn m johnson adss a kahn m johnson dcsc a kahn t sanders dose a

is that had been his own transmission to kahn two days earlier where are the others a message flashed up the video files on operations review unitmalaysia have been deleted sunday authorization dcc scrubbed again he was pretty sure who had done it but he had to be sure angel how do i check deletion authorization press the data you desire the angel said sanders pressed the authorization number a small sheet of paper came upward out of the top sheet and hung in the air authorization dcc is digital communications cupertinooperations executive special privileges noted no operator id necessary it was done by somebody very high up in operations in cupertino a few days ago meredith probably and it means im screwed why because now i know what was done at the malaysia plant i know exactly what happened meredith went in and changed the specs but shes erased the data right down to her voice transmissions to kahn which means i cant prove any of it standing in the corridor sanders poked the sheet and it fluttered back down dissolving into the top sheet he closed his file put it back in the drawer and watched the model dissolve and disappear he looked over at conley conley gave a little resigned shrug he seemed to understand the situation sanders shook his hand gripping air and waved goodbye conley nodded and turned to leave now what fernandez said its time to go sanders said the angel began to sing its time to go so long again till next weeks show angel be quiet the angel stopped singing he shook his head just like don cherry whos don cherry fernandez asked don cherry is a living god the angel said they walked back to the entrance to the corridor and then climbed out of the blue screen back in cherrys lab sanders took off the headset and after a moment of disorientation stepped off the walker pad he helped fernandez remove her equipment oh she said looking around were back in the real world if thats what you call it he said im not sure its that much more real he hung up her headset and helped her down from the walker pad then he turned off the power switches around the room fernandez yawned and looked at her watch its eleven oclock what are you going to do now there was only one thing he could think of he picked up the receiver on one of cherrys data modem lines and dialed gary bosaks number sanders couldnt retrieve any data but perhaps bosak couldif he could talk him into it it wasnt much of a hope but it was all he could think to do an answering machine said hi this is ne professional services im out of town for a few days but leave a message and then a beep sanders sighed gary its eleven oclock on wednesday im sorry i missed you im going home he hung up his last hope gone out of town for a few days shit he said now what fernandez said yawning i dont know he said ive got half an hour to make the last ferry i guess ill go home and try to get some sleep and the meeting tomorrow she asked you said you need documentation sanders shrugged louise ive done all that i can do i know what im up against ill manage somehow then ill see you tomorrow yeah he said see you tomorrow he felt less sanguine on the ferry going home looking back at the lights of the city in the rippling black water fernandez was right he ought to be getting the documentation he needed max would criticize him if he knew he could almost hear the old mans voice oh so youre tired thats a good reason thomas he wondered if max would be at the meeting tomorrow but he found he couldnt really think about it he couldnt imagine the meeting he was too tired to concentrate the loudspeaker announced that they were five minutes from winslow and he went below decks to get into his car he unlocked the door and slipped behind the wheel he looked in the rearview mirror and saw a dark silhouette in the backseat hey gary bosak said sanders started to turn just keep looking forward bosak said ill get out in a minute now listen carefully theyre going to screw you tomorrow theyre going to pin the malaysia fiasco on you i know and if that doesnt work theyre going to hit you with employing me invasion of privacy felonious activity all that crap theyve talked to my parole officer maybe youve seen hima fat guy with a mustache sanders vaguely remembered the man walking up to the mediation center the day before i think so yes gary listen i need some documents dont talk theres no time they pulled all the documents relating to the plant off the system nothings there anymore its gone i cant help you they heard the sound of the ferry horn all around them drivers were starting their engines but im not going down for this felony crap and youre not either take this he reached forward and handed sanders an envelope whats this summary of some work i did for another officer of your company garvin you might want to fax it to him in the morning why dont you im crossing the border tonight i have a cousin in bc ill stay there for a while you can leave a message on my machine if it turns out okay all right stay cool guy the shits really going to hit the fan tomorrow lots of changes coming up ahead the ramp went down with a metallic clang the traffic officers were directing cars off the ferry gary youve been monitoring me yeah sorry about that they told me i had to then whos afriend bosak laughed he opened the door and got out im surprised at you tom dont you know who your friends are the cars were beginning to pull out sanders saw brake lights on the car ahead of him flash red and the car began to move gary he said turning but bosak was gone he put the car in gear and drove off the ferry a the top of the driveway he stopped to pick up his mail there was a lot of it he hadnt checked the mailbox for two days he drove down to the house and left the car outside the garage he unlocked the front door and went in the house seemed empty and cold it had a lemony odor then he remembered that consuela had probably cleaned up he went into the kitchen and set up the coffeemaker for the morning the kitchen was clean and the childrens toys had been picked up consuela had definitely been there he looked at the answering machine a red numeral was blinking sanders replayed the calls the first was from john levin asking him to call saying it was urgent then sally asking if the kids could arrange a play date but then the rest were all hangups and as he listened they all seemed to sound exactly the same the thin hissing background static of an overseas call and then the abrupt click of disconnection again and again someone was trying to call him one of the later calls was apparently placed by an operator because a womans lilting voice said im sorry there is no answer do you wish to leave a message and then a mans voice replied no and then disconnection sanders played it back listening to that no he thought it sounded familiar foreign but still familiar no he listened several times but could not identify the speaker no one time he thought the man sounded hesitant or was it hurried he couldnt tell do you wish to leave a message no finally he gave up rewound the machine and went upstairs to his office hed had no faxes his computer screen was blank no further help from afriend tonight he read through the paper that bosak had given him in the car it was a single sheet a memo addressed to garvin containing a report summary on a cupertino employee whose name was blanked out there was also a xerox of a check made out to ne professional services signed by garvin it was after one when sanders went into the bathroom and took a shower he turned the water up hot held his face close to the nozzle and felt the stinging spray on his skin with the sound of the shower roaring in his ears he almost missed hearing the telephone ringing he grabbed a towel and ran into the bedroom hello he heard the static hiss of an overseas connection a mans voice said mr sanders please this is mr sanders speaking mr sanders sir the voice said i do not know if you will remember me this is mohammed jafar thursday the morning was clear sanders took an early ferry to work and got to his office at eight he passed the downstairs receptionist and saw a sign that said main conference room in use for a horrified moment he thought that he had again mistaken the time for his meeting and hurried to look in but it was garvin addressing the conleywhite executives garvin was speaking calmly and the executives were nodding as they listened then as he watched garvin finished and introduced stephanie kaplan who immediately launched into a financial review with slides garvin left the conference room and immediately his expression turned grim as he walked down the hallway toward the espresso bar at the end of the corridor ignoring sanders sanders was about to head upstairs when he heard phil blackburn say i really feel i have a right to protest the way this matter has been handled well you dont garvin said angrily you dont have any rights at all sanders moved forward toward the espresso bar from his position across the hallway he was able to see into the bar blackburn and garvin were talking by the coffee machines but this is extremely unfair blackburn said fuck unfair garvin said she named you as the source you stupid asshole but bob you told me i told you what garvin said eyes narrowing you told me to handle it to put pressure on sanders thats right phil and you told me that you were going to take care of it but you knew i talked to i knew you had done something garvin said but i didnt know what now shes named you as a source blackburn hung his head i just think its extremely unfair really but what do you expect me to do youre the fucking lawyer phil youre the one always sweating about how things look you tell me what do i do blackburn was silent for a moment finally he said ill get john robinson to represent me he can work out the settlement agreement okay fine garvin nodded thats fine but i just want to say to you on a personal level bob that i feel my treatment in this matter has been very unfair goddamn it phil dont talk to me about your feelings your feelings are for sale now listen with both ears dont go upstairs dont clean out your desk go right to the airport i want you on a plane in the next half hour i want you fucking out of here right now is that clear i just think you should acknowledge my contribution to the company i am you asshole garvin said now get the fuck out of here before i lose my temper sanders turned and hurried upstairs it was hard for him to keep from cheering blackburn was fired he wondered if he should tell anybody perhaps cindy he thought but when he got to the fourth floor the hallways were buzzing everyone was out of their offices talking in the corridors obviously rumors of the firing had already leaked sanders was not surprised that staffers were in hallways even though blackburn was disliked his firing would cause widespread uneasiness such a sudden change involving a person so close to garvin conveyed to everyone a sense of peril everything was at risk outside his office cindy said tom can you believe it they say garvin is going to fire phil youre kidding sanders said cindy nodded nobody knows why but apparently it had something to do with a news crew last night garvins been downstairs explaining it to the conleywhite people behind him somebody shouted its on the email the hallway was instantly deserted everyone vanished into their offices sanders stepped behind his desk and clicked the email icon but it was slow coming up probably because every employee in the building was clicking at exactly the same time fernandez came in and said is it true about blackburn i guess so sanders said its just coming over the email now from robert garvin president and ceo to all the digicom family it is with great sadness and a deep sense of personal loss that i today announce the resignation of our valued and trusted chief corporate counsel philip a blackburn phil has been an outstanding officer of this company for nearly fifteen years a wonderful human being and a close personal friend and advisor as well i know that like me many of you will miss his wise counsel and good humor profoundly in the days and weeks to come and i am sure that you will all join me in wishing him the best of good fortune in his new endeavors a hearty thank you phil and good luck this resignation is effective immediately howard eberhardt will serve as acting counsel until such time as a new permanent appointment is made robert garvin fernandez said what does it say it says i fired his sanctimonious ass it had to happen fernandez said especially since he was the source on the connie walsh story sanders said how did you know that eleanor vries she told you no but eleanor vries is a very cautious attorney all those media attorneys are the safest way to keep your job is to refuse to let things run when in doubt throw it out so i had to ask myself why did she let the mr piggy story run when its clearly defamatory the only possible reason is that she felt walsh had an unusually strong source inside the companya source that understood the legal implications a source that in giving the story was in essence also saying we wont sue if you print it since highranking corporate officers never know anything about law it means the source could only be a highranking lawyer phil yes jesus does this change your plans fernandez said sanders had been considering that i dont think so he said i think garvin would have fired him later in the day anyway you sound confident yeah i got some ammunition last night and i hope more today cindy came in and said are you expecting something from kl a big file yes this ones been coming in since am it must be a monster she put a dat cartridge on his desk it was exactly like the dat cartridge that had recorded his video link with arthur kahn fernandez looked at him he shrugged at eightthirty he transmitted bosaks memo to garvins private fax machine then he asked cindy to make copies of all the faxes that mohammed jafar had sent him the previous night sanders had been up most of the night reading the material that jafar had sent him and it made interesting reading jafar of course was not ill he had never been ill that had been a little story that kahn had contrived with meredith he pushed the dat videocassette into the machine and turned to fernandez you going to explain she said i hope itll be selfexplanatory sanders said on the monitor the following appeared seconds to direct video linkup dcmdcc sen a kahn rec m johnson on the screen he saw kahn at the factory and then a moment later the screen split and he saw meredith at her office in cupertino what is this fernandez said a recorded video communication from last sunday i thought the communications were all erased they were here but there was still a record in kl a friend of mine sent it to me on the screen arthur kahn coughed uh meredith im a little concerned dont be meredith said but we still arent able to manufacture to specs we have to replace the air handlers at the very least put in better ones not now but we have to meredith not yet but those handlers are inadequate meredith we both thought theyd be okay but they arent never mind kahn was sweating he rubbed his chin nervously its only a matter of time before tom figures it out meredith hes not stupid you know hell be distracted so you say and besides hes going to quit kahn looked startled he is i dont think he trust me hell quit hes going to hate working for me sitting in sanderss office fernandez leaned forward staring at the screen she said no shit kahn said why will he hate it meredith said believe me he will tom sanders will be out in my first fortyeight hours but how can you be sure what choice does he have tom and i have a history everybody in the company knows that if any problem comes up nobody will believe him hes smart enough to understand that if he ever wants to work again hell have no choice but to take whatever settlement hes offered and leave kahn nodded wiping the sweat from his cheek and then we say sanders made the changes at the plant hell deny that he did he wont even know remember hell be gone by then arthur and if he isnt trust me hell be gone hes married has a family hell go but if he calls me about the production line just evade it arthur be mystified you can do that im sure now who else does sanders talk to there the foreman sometimes jafar jafar knows everything of course and hes one of those honest sorts im afraid if make him take a vacation he just took one make him take another one arthur i only need a week here jesus kahn said im not sure she cut in arthur yes meredith this is the time when a new vice president counts favors that will be repaid in the future yes meredith thats all the screen went blank there were white streaking video lines and then the screen was dark pretty cut and dried fernandez said sanders nodded meredith didnt think the changes would matter because she didnt know anything about production she was just cutting costs but she knew that the changes at the plant would eventually be traced back to her so she thought she had a way to get rid of me to make me quit the company and then she would be able to blame me for the problems at the plant and kahn went along with it sanders nodded and they got rid of jafar sanders nodded kahn told jafar to go visit his cousin in johore for a week to get out of town to make it impossible for me to reach jafar but he never thought that jafar would call me he glanced at his watch now where is it what on the screen there was a series of tones and they saw a handsome dark skinned newscaster at a desk facing a camera and speaking rapidly in a foreign language whats this fernandez said the channel three evening news from last december sanders got up and pushed a button on the tape machine the cassette popped out what does it show cindy came back from the copying machine with wide eyes she carried a dozen stacks of paper each neatly clipped whatre you going to do with this dont worry about it he said but this is outrageous tom what shes done i know he said everybody is talking she said the word is that the merger is off well see sanders said with cindys help he began arranging the piles of paper in identical manila folders fernandez said what exactly are you going to do merediths problem is that she lies sanders said shes smooth and she gets away with it shes gotten away with it her whole life im going to see if i can get her to make a single very big lie he looked at his watch it was eight fortyfive the meeting would start in fifteen minutes the conference room was packed there were fifteen conleywhite executives down one side of the table with john marden in the middle and fifteen digicom executives down the other side with garvin in the middle meredith johnson stood at the head of the table and said next well hear from tom sanders tom i wonder if you could review for us where we stand with the twinkle drive what is the status of our production there of course meredith sanders stood his heart pounding he walked to the front of the room by way of background twinkle is our code name for a standalone cdromdrive player which we expect to be revolutionary he turned to the first of his charts cdromis a small laser disk used to store data it is cheap to manufacture and can hold an enormous amount of information in any formwords images sound video and so on you can put the equivalent of six hundred books on a single small disk or thanks to our research here an hour and a half of video and any combination for example you could make a textbook that combines text pictures short movie sequences animated cartoons and so on production costs will soon be at ten cents a unit he looked down the table the conleywhite people were interested garvin was frowning meredith looked tense but for cdromto be effective two things need to happen first we need a portable player like this he held up the player and then passed it down the conleywhite side a fivehour battery and an excellent screen you can use it on a train a bus or in a classroomanywhere you can use a book the executives looked at it turned it over in their hands then they looked back at sanders the other problem with cdrom technology sanders said is that its slow its sluggish getting to all that wonderful data but the twinkle drives that we have successfully made in prototype are twice as fast as any other drive in the world and with added memory for our packing and unpacking images it is as quick as a small computer we expect to get the unit cost for these drives down to the price of a videogame unit within a year and we are manufacturing the drives now we have had some early problems but we are solving them meredith said can you tell us more about that i gather from talking to arthur kahn that were still not clear on why the drives have problems actually we are sanders said it turns out that the problems arent serious at all i expect them to be entirely resolved in a matter of days really she raised her eyebrows then weve found what the trouble is yes we have thats wonderful news yes it is very good news indeed ed nichols said was it a design problem no sanders said theres nothing wrong with the design we made here just as there was nothing wrong with the prototypes what we have is a fabrication problem involving the production line in malaysia what sort of problems it turns out sanders said that we dont have the proper equipment on the line we should be using automatic chip installers to lock the controller chips and the ram cache on the board but the malays on the line have been installing chips by hand literally pushing them in with their thumbs and it turns out that the assembly line is dirty so were getting particulate matter in the split optics we should have levelseven air handlers but we only have levelfive handlers installed and it turns out that we should be ordering components like hinge rods and clips from one very reliable singapore supplier but the components are actually coming from another supplier less expensive less reliable meredith looked uneasy but only for a moment improper equipment improper conditions improper components she shook her head im sorry correct me if im wrong but didnt you set up that line tom yes i did sanders said i went out to kuala lumpur last fall and set it up with arthur kahn and the local foreman mohammed jafar then how is it that we have so many problems unfortunately there was aseries of bad judgment calls in setting up the line meredith looked concerned tom we all know that youre extremely competent how could this have happened sanders hesitated this was the moment it happened because the line was changed he said the specifications were altered altered how i think thats something for you to explain to this group meredith he said since you ordered the changes i ordered them thats right meredith tom you must be mistaken she said coolly i havent had anything to do with that malaysia line actually you have sanders said you made two trips there in november and december of last year two trips to kuala lumpur yes because you mishandled a labor dispute with the malaysian government i went there and resolved the dispute but i had nothing to do with the actual production line id say youre mistaken meredith i assure you she said coldly i am not i had nothing to do with the line and any socalled changes actually you went there and inspected the changes you ordered im sorry tom i didnt ivenever even seen the actual line on the screen behind her the videotape of the newscast began to play silently with the sound off the newscaster in coat and tie speaking to the camera sanders said you never went to the plant itself absolutely not tom i dont know who could have told you such a thing or why you would say it now the screen behind the newscaster showed the digicom building in malaysia then the interior ofthe plant the camera showed the production lines and an official inspection tour taking place they saw phil blackburn and alongside him meredith johnson the camera moved in on her as she chatted with one ofthe workers there was a murmur in the room meredith spun around and looked this is outrageous this is out of context i dont know where this could have come from malaysia channel three their version ofthe bbc im sorry meredith the newscast segment finished and the screen went blank sanders made a gesture and cindy began moving around the table handing a manila folder to each person meredith said wherever this socalled tape came from sanders said ladies and gentlemen if you will openyour packets you will find the first ofa series of memosfrom the operations review unit which was under the directionof ms johnson in the period in question i direct your attention to the first memo dated november eighteenth of last year you will notice that it has been signed by meredith johnson and it stipulates that the line will be changed to accommodate the labor demands ofthe malay government in particular this first memo states that automated chip installers will not be included but that this work will be done by hand that made the malay government happy but it meant we couldnt manufacture the drives johnson said but you see what you are overlooking is that the malays gave us no choice in that case we should never have built the plant there sanders said cutting her off because we cant manufacture the intended product at those revised specifications the tolerances are inadequate johnson said well that may be your own opinion the second memo dated december third indicates that a costsavings review diminished airhandling capacities on the line again this is a variance in the specifications that i established again it is criticalwe cant manufacture highperformance drives under these conditions the long and the short of it is that these decisions doomed the drives to failure now look johnson said ifanybody believes that the failure of these drives is anything but your the third memo sanders said summarizes cost savings from the operations review unit youll see that it claims an eleven percent reduction in operating costs that savings has already been wiped out by fabrication delays not counting our timetomarket delay costs even if we immediately restore the line this eleven percent savings translates into a production cost increase over the run of nearly seventy percent first year its a hundred and ninety percent increase now the next memo sanders said explains why this costcutting was adopted in the first place during acquisition talks between mr nichols and ms johnson in the fall of last year ms johnson indicated she would demonstrate that it was possible to reduce hightechnology development costs which were a source of concern to mr nichols when they were meeting at ohchrist ed nichols said staring at the paper meredith pushed forward stepping in front of sanders excuse me tom she said speaking firmly but i really must interrupt you im sorry to have to say this but no one here is fooled by this little charade she swept her arm wide encompassing the room or by your socalled evidence she spoke more loudly you werent present when these management decisions were carefully taken by the best minds in this company you dont understand the thinking that lies behind them and the false postures you are striking now the socalled memos that you are holding up to convince us no one here is persuaded she gave him a pitying look its all empty tom empty words empty phrases when it comes right down to it youre all show and no substance you think you can come in here and secondguess the management team im here to tell you that you cant garvin stood abruptly and said meredith let me finish meredith said she was flushed angry because this is important bob this is the heart of what is wrong with this division yes there were some decisions taken that may be questionable in retrospect yes we tried innovative procedures which perhaps went too far but that hardly excuses the behavior we see today this calculated manipulative attitude by an individual who will do anythinganything at allto get ahead to make a name for herself at the expense of others who will savage the reputation of anyone who stands in her pathi mean that stands inhis paththis ruthless demeanor that we are seeing no one is fooled by this tom not for a minute were being asked to accept the worst kind of fraudulence and we simply wont do it its wrong this is all wrong and it is bound to catch up with you im sorry you cant come here and do this it simply wont workit hasnt worked thats all she stopped to catch her breath and looked around the table everyone was silent motionless garvin was still standing he appeared to be in shock slowly meredith seemed to realize that something was wrong when she spoke again her voice was quieter i hope that i have that i have accurately expressed the sentiments of everyone here thats all i intended to do there was another silence then garvin said meredith i wonder if you would leave the room for a few minutes stunned she stared at garvin for a long moment then she said of course bob thank you meredith walking very erect she left the room the door clicked shut behind her john marden sat forward and said mr sanders please continue with your presentation in your view how long will it be until the line is repaired and fully functioning it was noon sanders sat in his office with his feet on his desk and stared out the window the sun was shining brightly on the buildings around pioneer square the sky was clear and cloudless mary anne hunter wearing a business suit came in and said i dont get it get what that news tape meredith must have known about it because she was there when they were shooting it oh she knew about it all right but she never thought id get it and she never thought shed appear in it she thought theyd only show phil you knowa muslim country in a story about executives they usually just show the men uhhuh so but channel three is the government station sanders said and the story that night was that the government had been only partially successful in negotiating changes in the digicom plantthat the foreign executives had been intransigent and uncooperative it was a story intended to protect the reputation of mr sayad the finance minister so the cameras focused on her because because she was a woman foreign shedevil in a business suit cant make a deal with aferingiwoman something like that anyway the story focused on her and you got the tape yeah hunter nodded well she said its fine with me she left the room and sanders was alone again staring out the window after a while cindy came in and said the latest word is the acquisition is off sanders shrugged he was flat drained he didnt care cindy said are you hungry i can get you some lunch im not hungry what are they doing now garvin and marden are talking still its been more than an hour they just brought in conley only conley nobody else no and nichols has left the building what about meredith nobodys seen her he leaned back in his chair he stared out the window his computer gave three beeps seconds to direct video linkup dcmdcs sen a kahn rec t sanders kahn was calling sanders smiled grimly cindy came in and said arthurs going to call i see that seconds to direct video linkup dcmdcs sanders adjusted his desk lamp and sat back the screen blossomed and he saw the shimmering image resolve it was arthur in the plant oh tom good i hope its not too late arthur said too late for what sanders said i know theres a meeting today theres something i have to tell you whats that arthur well im afraid i havent been entirely straightforward with you tom its about meredith she made changes in the line six or seven months ago and im afraid she intends to blame that on you probably in the meeting today i see i feel terrible about this tom arthur said hanging his head i dont know what to say dont say anything arthur sanders said kahn smiled apologetically i wanted to tell you earlier i really did but meredith kept saying that you would be out i didnt know what to do she said there was a battle coming and i had better pick the winner you picked wrong arthur sanders said youre fired he reached up and snapped off the television camera in front of him whatre you talking about youre fired arthur but you cant do this to rue kahn said his image faded began to shrink you cant the screen was blank fifteen minutes later mark lewyn came by the office he tugged at the neck of his black armani tshirt i think im an asshole he said yeah you are its just i didnt understand the situation he said thats right you didnt whatre you going to do now i just fired arthur jesus and what else i dont know well see how it shakes out lewyn nodded and went away nervously sanders decided to let him be nervous for a while in the end their friendship would be repaired adele and susan were good friends and mark was too talented to replace in the company but lewyn could sweat for a while itd do him good at one oclock cindy came in and said the word is max dorfman just went into the conference with garvin and marden what about john conley hes gone hes with the accountants now then thats a good sign and the word is nichols was fired why do they think that he flew home an hour ago fifteen minutes later sanders saw ed nichols walking down the hallway sanders got up and went out to cindys desk i thought you said nichols went home well thats what i heard she said its crazy you know what theyre saying about meredith now what they say shes staying on i dont believe it sanders said bill everts told stephanie kaplans assistant that meredith johnson is not going to be fired that garvin is backing her one hundred percent phil is going to take the rap for what happened in malaysia but garvin still believes meredith is young and this shouldnt be held against her so shes staying in her job i dont believe it cindy shrugged thats what they say she said he went back to his office and stared out the window he told himself it was just a rumor after a while the intercom buzzed tom meredith johnson just called she wants to see you in her office right away bright sunlight streamed in through the big windows on the fifth floor the assistant outside merediths office was away from her desk the door was ajar he knocked come in meredith johnson said she was standing leaning back against the edge of her desk her arms folded across her chest waiting hello tom she said meredith come in i wont bite he came in leaving the door open i must say that you outdid yourself this morning tom i was surprised at how much you were able to learn in a short time and it was really quite resourceful the approach you took in the meeting he said nothing yes it was a really excellent effort you feeling proud of yourself she said staring hard at him meredith you think youve finally paid me back well i have news for you tom you dont knowanythingabout whats really going on she pushed away from the desk and as she moved away he saw a cardboard packing box on the desktop beside the telephone she walked around behind the desk and began putting pictures and papers and a pen set into the box this whole thing was garvins idea for three years garvins been looking for a buyer he couldnt find one finally he sent me out and i found him one i went through twentyseven different companies until i got to conleywhite they were interested and i sold them hard i put in the hours i did whatever i had to do to keep the deal moving forwardwhatever ihad to do she pushed more papers into the box angrily sanders watched her garvin was happy as long as i was delivering nichols to him on a platter johnson said he wasnt fussy about how i was doing it he wasnt even interested he just wanted it done i busted my ass for him because the chance to get this job was a big break for me a real career opportunity why shouldnt i have it i did the work i put the deal together i earned this job i beat you fairly sanders said nothing but thats not how it turns out is it garvin wont support me when the going gets tough everybody said he was like a father to me but he was just using me he was just making a deal any way he could and thats all hes doing now just another fucking deal and who cares who gets hurt everybody moves on now ive got to find an attorney to negotiate my severance package nobody gives a damn she closed the box and leaned on it but i beat you fair and square tom i dont deserve this ive been screwed by the damned system no you havent sanders said staring her straight in the eye youve been fucking your assistants for years youve been taking every advantage of your position that you could youve been cutting corners youve been lazy youve been living on image and every third word out of your mouth is a lie now youre feeling sorry for yourself you think the system is whats wrong but you know what meredith the system didnt screw you the system revealed you and dumped you out because when you get right down to it youre completely full of shit he turned on his heel have a nice trip wherever youre going he left the room and slammed the door behind him he was back in his office five minutes later still angry pacing back and forth behind his desk mary anne hunter came in wearing a sweatshirt and exercise tights she sat down and put her running shoes up on sanderss desk whatre you all worked up about the press conference what press conference theyve scheduled a press conference for four oclock who says marian in pr swears it came from garvin himself and marians assistant has been calling the press and the stations sanders shook his head its too soon considering all that had happened the press conference should not be held until the following day i think so hunter said nodding they must be going to announce that the merger has fallen through you heard what theyre saying about blackburn no what that garvin made him a milliondollar settlement i dont believe it thats what they say ask stephanie nobodys seen her supposedly she went back to cupertino to deal with finances now that the merger is off hunter got up and walked to the window at least its a nice day yeah finally i think ill go for a run i cant stand this waiting i wouldnt leave the building she smiled yeah i guess not she stood at the window for a while finally she said well what do you know sanders looked up what hunter pointed down toward the street minivans with antennas on the top i guess there is going to be a press conference after all they held the press conference at four in the main downstairs conference room strobes flashed as garvin stood before the microphone at the end of the table i have always believed he said that women must be better represented in high corporate office the women of america represent our nations most important underutilized resource as we go into the twentyfirst century and this is true in high technology no less than in other industries it is therefore with great pleasure that i announce as part of our merger with conleywhite communications that the new vice president at digital communications seattle is a woman of great talent drawn from within the ranks in our cupertino headquarters she has been a resourceful and dedicated member of the digicom team for many years and i am sure she will be even more resourceful in the future i am pleased to introduce now the new vice president for advanced planning ms stephanie kaplan there was applause and kaplan stepped to the microphone and brushed back her shock of gray hair she wore a dark maroon suit and smiled quietly thank you bob and thanks to everyone who has worked so hard to make this division so great i want to say particularly that i look forward to working with the outstanding division heads we have here mary anne hunter mark lewyn don cherry and of course tom sanders these talented people stand at the center of our company and i intend to work hand in hand with them as we move into the future as for myself i have personal as well as professional ties here in seattle and i can say no more than that i am delighted just delighted to be here and i look forward to a long and happy time in this wonderful city back in his office sanders got a call from fernandez i finally heard from alan are you ready for this arthur a friend is on sabbatical in nepal nobody goes into his office except his assistant and a couple of his most trusted students in fact theres only one student who has been there during the time he is away a freshman in the chemistry department named jonathan kaplan sanders said thats right you know who he is fernandez said hes the bosss son stephanie kaplans just been named the new head of the division fernandez was silent for a moment she must be a very remarkable woman she said garvin arranged a meeting with fernandez at the four seasons hotel they sat in the small dark bar off fourth avenue in the late afternoon you did a hell of a job louise he said but justice was not served i can tell you that an innocent woman took the fall for a clever scheming man come on bob she said is that why you called me over here to complain honest to god louise this harassment thing has gotten out of hand every company i know has at least a dozen of these cases now where will it end im not worried she said itll shake out eventually maybe but meanwhile innocent people i dont see many innocent people in my line of work she said for example its come to my attention that digicoms board members were aware of johnsons problem a year ago and did nothing to address it garvin blinked who told you that its completely untrue she said nothing and you could never have proved it fernandez raised her eyebrows and said nothing who said that garvin said i want to know look bob she said the fact is theres a category of behavior that no one condones anymore the supervisor who grabs genitals who squeezes breasts in the elevator who invites an assistant on a business trip but books only one hotel room all that is ancient history if you have an employee behaving like that whether that employee is male or female gay or straight you are obliged to stop it okay fine but sometimes its hard to know yes fernandez said and theres the opposite extreme an employee doesnt like a tasteless remark and files a complaint somebody has to tell her its not harassment by then her boss has been accused and everybody in the company knows he wont work with her anymore theres suspicion and bad feelings and its all a big mess at the company i see that a lot thats unfortunate too you know my husband works in the same firm i do uhhuh after we first met he asked me out five times at first i said no but finally i said yes were happily married now and the other day he said to me that given the climate now if we met today he probably wouldnt ask me out five times hed just drop it see thats what im talking about i know but those situations will settle out eventually in a year or two everybody will know what the new rules are yes but but the problem is that theres that third category somewhere in the middle between the two extremes fernandez said where the behavior is gray its not clear what happened its not clear who did what to whom thats the largest category of complaints we see so far societys tended to focus on the problems of the victim not the problems of the accused but the accused has problems too a harassment claim is a weapon bob and there are no good defenses against it anybody can use the weaponand lots of people have its going to continue for a while i think garvin sighed its like that virtual reality thing you have fernandez said those environments that seem real but arent really there we all live every day in virtual environments defined by our ideas those environments are changing its changed with regard to women and its going to start changing with regard to men the men didnt like it when it changed before and the women arent going to like it changing now and some people will take advantage but in the final analysis itll all work out when when will it all end garvin said shaking his head when women have fifty percent of the executive positions she said thats when it will end you know i favor that yes fernandez said and i gather you have just appointed an outstanding woman congratulations bob mary anne hunter was assigned to drive meredith johnson to the airport to take a plane back to cupertino the two women sat in silence for fifteen minutes meredith johnson hunched down in her trench coat staring out the window finally when they were driving past the boeing plant johnson said i didnt like it here anyway choosing her words carefully hunter said it has its good and bad points there was another silence then johnson asked are you a friend of sanders yes hes a nice guy johnson said always was you know we used to have a relationship i heard that hunter said tom didnt do anything wrong really johnson said he just didnt know how to handle a passing remark uhhuh hunter said women in business have to be perfect all the time or they just get murdered one little slip and theyre dead uhhuh you know what im talking about yes hunter said i know there was another long silence johnson shifted in her seat she stared out the window the system johnson said thats the problem i was raped by the fucking system sanders was leaving the building on his way to the airport to pick up susan and the kids when he ran into stephanie kaplan he congratulated her on the appointment she shook his hand and said without smiling thank you for your support he said thank you for yours its nice to have a friend yes she said friendships are nice so is competence im not going to keep this job very long tom nichols is out as cfo of conley and their number two man is a modest talent at best theyll be looking for someone in a year or so and when i go over there someone will have to take over the new company here i imagine it should be you sanders bowed slightly but thats in the future kaplan said crisply in the meantime we have to get the work here back on track this division is a mess everyones been distracted by this merger and the product lines have been compromised by cupertinos ineptitude weve got a lot to do to turn this around ive set the first production meeting with all the division heads for seven am tomorrow morning ill see you then tom and she turned away sanders stood at the arrivals gate at seatac and watched the passengers come off the phoenix plane eliza came running up to him shouting daddy as she leapt into his arms she had a suntan did you have a nice time in phoenix it was great dad we rode horses and ate tacos and guess what what i saw a snake a real snake uhhuh a green one it

daddy about the snake how are you susan said looking at his face im fine tired is it finished yes its finished they walked on susan slipped her arm around his waist ive been thinking maybe im traveling too much we ought to spend more time together thatd be nice he said they walked toward the baggage claim carrying his daughter feeling her small hands on his shoulder he glanced over and saw meredith johnson standing at the checkin counter of one of the departure gates she was wearing a trench coat her hair was pulled back she didnt turn and see him susan said somebody you know no he said

the involvement of attorneys in such matters her speech was received coolly meredith johnson was named vice president for operations and planning at ibms paris office she subsequently married the united states ambassador to france edward harmon following his divorce she has since retired from business afterword the episode related here is based on a true story its appearance in a novel is not intended to deny the fact that the great majority of harassment claims are brought by women against men on the contrary the advantage of a rolereversal story is that it may enable us to examine aspects concealed by traditional responses and conventional rhetoric however readers respond to this story it is important to recognize that the behavior of the two antagonists mirrors each other like a rorschach inkblot the value of a rorschach test lies in what it tells us about ourselves it is also important to emphasize that the story in its present form is fiction because allegations of sexual harassment in the workplace involve multiple conflicting legal rights and because such claims now create substantial risk not only for the individuals but for corporations it has been necessary to disguise the real event with care all the principals in this case agreed to be interviewed with the understanding that their identities would be concealed i am grateful to them for their willingness to help clarify the difficult issues inherent in investigations of sexual harassment in addition i am indebted to a number of attorneys human relations officers individual employees and corporate officials who provided valuable perspectives on this evolving issue it is characteristic of the extreme sensitivity surrounding any discussion of sexual harassment that everyone i talked to asked to remain anonymous
