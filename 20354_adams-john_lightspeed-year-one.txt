pixels as it were you will find all types of science fiction from nearfuture sociological soft sf to farfuture starspanning hard sf and anything and everything in between every month we publish a mix of original fiction and reprints and feature a variety of authorsfrom the bestsellers and awardwinners you already know to the best new voices you havent heard of yet so when you read lightspeed our hope is that youll see where science fiction comes from where it is now and where its going which brings us to the anthology that youre reading right now this is the first in a planned series of print anthologies that will annually collect all of the fiction originally published in the magazine this first volume will collect all of the fiction originally published in lightspeed from june to may

lightspeed itself and yours truly were also nominated for the hugo award and lightspeed won the million writers award for best new online magazine were hugely honored to have received all these accolades but wed like to think that these accolades are only a sign of more great things to come while fiction is lightspeeds focus and only our fiction is included in this anthology lightspeed is also a nonfiction magazine alongside of our fiction selections we run articles that riff off the ideas in the fiction for instance in our debut issue we have a story about relativistic travel so we asked sf author and expert astronomer mike brotherton to tell us about the science behind that familiar sf trope we also regularly feature brief interviews with the authors we call author spotlights in which the authors talk a bit about the stories behind their stories but theres more to lightspeed than that too lightspeed is also a podcast which features two stories each month in audio format produced by grammy and audie awardwinning narratorproducer stefan rudnicki and finally lightspeed is not just a weekly online magazine its also a monthly ebook magazine so if youd rather read it every

the anthology if you do i hope youll go to our website at wwwlightspeedmagazinecom to let us know what you think and alsotell a friend im alive i love you ill see you in reno vylar kaftan we have a history of missed connections you and i years ago when you called goodbye from the shuttle launch my flight was landing in zurich id changed planes been rerouted from frankfurt thats why you got my voicemail id have answered if i could and wouldve wished you luck even if you wanted a life without me i never managed to see europa like you didjust europe where i met my first husband the one i wished was you when i heard your message i was glad you were happyyes ive always wanted you happy even during our divorce i thought of you traveling to alpha centauri time dilating between us like a portal i envisioned it like a slowmotion movie youd be back in forty years id be sixtyfour and youd only be half my age i saved your message for weeks until i accidentally deleted it it felt symbolic wed be happier apart i thought to myself but apart was always the way we connected the word defines us relative to each other one cannot be apart without the other einstein spent ten years thinking about a mirror that troubled him if he traveled at the speed of light and looked into a handheld mirror would he see his reflection or not setting aside vampirism or poorlymade glass that cracks at high speeds the answer is that he must relativity means that you cant tell how fast youre going unless you have a point of reference weve been together for as long as i can remember just kids running around the sacramento suburbs i liked you because youd play with a girl i ran faster fought harder and hit harder than any boyand i knew it remember that time we played capture the flag and you couldnt find mine i shoved it in a drainpipe you could still see its corner that counts i was the girl next doorsafe reliable undesirable when i was thirteen and you were sixteeni was crazyinlove with you but you were blind best friends forever you told me i thought that youd never see me as a woman your own age i had to hear about all those girls you dated remember that awful redhead who stole cigarettes from her grandmother i bet she got lung cancer best friends i told you too we were together yet completely apart i used to wonder how to make you see me should i tell you what i felt stay silent and hope youd see but you made the choice for me you left for the military so i joined the peace corpsthe polar opposite of what you did this drew us together again like magnets its why we ended up living together in san francisco roommates and lovers i didnt know this then of courseall of this i figured out during the journey to alpha centauri two magnets apart continue to exert force on each other their power lies in the space between einstein says that nothing moves at the speed of light because the faster things get the heavier they become its true that as i accelerated everything had more weight two decades of childrearing juggling flute practice with my photography career balancing a marriages weight against single independence but weight is relative and whats heavy on earth is light on the moon and monstrous on jupiter yet the mass remains the same the more things change the more they stay the same when i think about the changes in my parents livesand how much more ive already seen in fewer yearsi think of moores law my world is doubling every year somewhere in old italy galileo is searching the skies with his telescope wondering why his life doesnt feel as full as it should its because i have it all four centuries laterhis life and millions of others the doubling sequence surprises people whove never thought it through reno you told me once reno nevada when we lived in san francisco in that tiny apartment above a mission district taqueria do you remember that conversation we were sitting on that awful brown loveseat youd rescued from a dumpster you were heating dinner in the microwave and the room smelled like curry the fog rolled through the city and we both wore old sweaters i didnt yet know the relevance of reno if were separated you said why reno its inland when the big quake hits the bay renos safe or if theres a missile strike or something no one strikes reno youre paranoid i said you shrugged im aware wed been living together for six months we made good roommatesboth of us loud and neither of us tidy you took out the trash and i sorted the mail we both did dishes when needed and not more often i didnt mind your waterskis propped against the fridge or your physics books scattered on the pizzastained carpet you didnt mind the way i always slammed doors and drawers no matter how quiet i tried to be it was a good arrangement but not what i wanted i knew you loved me of course it was written in your eyes when you looked at me a physics problem with no clear answer if an irresistible force meets an immovable object what happens then they meet thats all we know relative to each other they are in contact from within the object or the force there is no way to tell if youre in motion for a while i was charon to your pluto keeping the same faces to each other as we circled around endlessly and through all of this you still thought of me as a moon and yourself as a planet but its not so easy as that our orbit is erratic an ellipse among circles an offbeat pattern in a regular solar system do you see the sun far in the distance even when our orbit sweeps close to the sun it takes four hours for its light to reach us its a centerpoint that keeps us captured we circle it so we dont fly off into space its a point of reference and it proves to us that were always in motion we keep moving along with everything else even if we cant see where or how by the time we got together it was more for convenience than anything else it was what we did have sex fight break up meet someone else and when the new relationship burned out like a magnesium ribbon flared and gone wed find each other again the best thing between us was the sex we foughtoh yes we foughtand then had makeup sex hard hot and heavy youd drive into me just before i was readymaking me readythen finish just after me both of us collapsed together trapped in each others gravity wells when you slept id stroke your rough calloused fingers and the superglued cuts in your feet from waterskiing id think about our next fight and my body tingled with wanting you ill marry you you said once if you cant find anyone else i laughed because i thought you were kidding you couldnt even propose right it was the last push on a decaying orbit i was not your fallback option from the time you said that our path downwards was guaranteed calculable we fought about the phone bill chinese leftovers a broken plate that didnt get swept up when you told me about your new job repairing relativity shuttles i was secretly glad your work would take you to reno out of my path i was completely over you over usor at least i was then when you left i was on the rebound ready for someone new gunther the german engineer was everything you werent so i married him once you knew his first few digits they repeated in a predictable pattern he was a wonderful father for our two sons i thought of you sometimes as i raised my boys perfect squares in their rational world i never forgot you thanks to genetics we expected gunthers heart problems before they happened he lasted twentyfive years with me then slipped away my kids were on their own by then and i had time and money i was free to choose irrationally and so i took up waterskiing when you came back i was surprised you came to my doorand even more surprised that you wanted me i didnt think youd stay with mea hot young thirtysomething with this driedout old lady you kept saying you liked my maturity you found me sexy but it was different for me i saw you like my kids more like a son than a mate if i cant find anyone else thats a terrible proposal it makes a woman feel like youre just putting up with her i did find someone else i had twentyfive happy years with him while you were living through just a few months i accumulated the weight of yearsof a woman building decades with her partner of a mother renewing herself by raising her children all of this weight i gainednot to mention my newfound belly but i married you anyway you wanted to be with me you said all your recent thoughts told you so my age didnt matteryou still wanted me the woman youd loved all this time you said as for me now i had what id always wantedbut it wasnt what i thought it would be one night after we made love on the beach i watched the stars they shone with light from billions of years ago the stars offered us time apart thats why i sold everything i hadto see what youd seen the new relativity shuttles were even faster than yours had been and now they were open to tourists it had been forty years here after all im sorry i didnt leave a note i figured it was all relative gunther was always patient with me slow hed wait for me to orgasm like he was holding a car door open for me and then hed finish quickly and silently sometimes i pretended he was you to make things more exciting once i pretended he was albert einstein it was the accent i swear with you the electromagnetic pull bonded us together we could ionize briefly visiting other molecules and forming weak bondsbut we always came back together circling each other endlessly an electron and a proton you and me for a long time i thought i was the electron spinning wild patterns around you then i realized the electron was you because i always knew either where you were or how fast you were going but never both so i left you and went to the stars like youd done alpha centauri the brilliant star burned into my mind it was a vacation for me a short time away from earth for the first time i saw the lights up close the luxury ship went the speed of light much faster than you had gone faster than before i figured youd be dead once i got back it simplified things stopped the fighting youd be ashes like youd always wanted i wouldnt even have to see your body i thought about it as i looked through the viewport and realized that i was still thinking of you that was when i understood that no matter how far i went or how fast i still responded to you in every way every action produces an equal and opposite reaction our bond pulls me back and i love you reasons why i have loved you yes yes again because youre you none of these are love perhaps but theyre forces of physics and if love isnt subject to physics then it has no grounding in our universe i cant believe thats true just when i got back you left again like one metal ball clacking another the opposite side of our kinetic motion toy you were off for the andromeda galaxy moving at the speed of light simpler indeed i was sixtyeight you were gone it was time to move on the world had changed since i left the human lifespan was up to years i hadnt imagined this possibility i had decades left for music art whatever i dreamed of my health was goodthey killed a malignant breast tumor and grew me a new liver twicebut otherwise my body kept working for years but my nervous system paralysisthat was incurable i opted for cryogenesis hoping theyd find a cure if they did years from now theyd revive me and heal me it was exciting i wondered if itd be hard to fall asleep like christmas evenot knowing what christmas day would bring but of course the freezing was instant as i lay down in the cryochamber i thought to myself reno thats where i should have gone when disaster struck i was thinking of you and then i was frozen like charon and pluto if im a train leaving philadelphia at going miles an hour and youre a train on the same track leaving san francisco at going miles an hour at what time will we collide and run each other off the tracks more importantly if we move at the speed of light and i shine a light in your direction will you blink and tell me to stop blinding you or will you not see me coming until its too late if einstein is flying next to our train looking into a mirror and wondering where his reflection has gonewill you ask him whether anything stands still or if everything is always in motion relative to everything else of course and ask about reno if our trains crash there should we consider that theyve stopped moving or are they still in motion on earth relative to everything else in the universe everyones joined in the same future except you time moves so quicklyaccelerating to the point where we can hardly imagine whats next i went to sleep expecting to be cured instead the ai woke me and said i no longer needed my body it downloaded my mind and now i see you and i are eccentric but part of a solar system and i know now where we belong its easy for me to travel along circuits to expand my mind everywhere in the networkand then condense myself so small as to be negligible in the universe here in one corner of a virtual city i see theyve sent a ship after you moving at the speed of light itll reach you eventually theyll download you and youll fly back to me here where we belong i think i never left your orbit i wrote you a long message to explain all this but i think ill erase it and just leave ten words ill tell you the rest when you arrivewhen our perpetual motion comes to a relative stop the cassandra project jack mcdevitt its an odd fact that the biggest science story of the twentyfirst centuryprobably the biggest everbroke in that tabloid of tabloids the national bedrock i was in the middle of conducting a nasa press conference several days before the minerva liftoffthe return to the moonand i was fielding softball questions like is it true that if everything goes well the mars mission will be moved up and what is marcia beckett going to say when she becomes the first person to set foot on lunar soil since eugene cernan turned off the lights fiftyfour years ago president gorman and his russian counterpart dmitri alexandrov were scheduled to talk to the press from the white house an hour later so i was strictly a setup guy or that was the plan anyway until warren cole mentioned the dome it was a good time for nasa we all knew the dangers inherent in overconfidence but two orbital missions had gone up without a hitch either of them could have landed and waved back at us and the rumor was that sid myshko had almost taken the game into his own hands and that the crew had put it to a vote whether theyd ignore the protocol and go down to the surface regardless of the mission parameters sid and his five crewmates denied the story of course id just made the point to the pool of reporters that it was richard nixon whod turned off the lightsnot the astronaut eugene cernanwhen warren cole began waving his hand cole was the ap journalist seated in his customary spot up front he was frowning his left hand in the air staring down at something on his lap that i couldnt see warren i said whatve you got jerry he looked up making no effort to suppress a grin have you seen the story that the bedrocks running he held up his ipad that started a few people checking their own devices no i havent i said hoping he was making it up i dont usually get to bedrock this early in the week somebody snorted then a wave of laughter rippled through the room what i said my first thought had been that we were about to have another astronaut scandal like the one the month before with barnaby salvator and half the strippers on the beach what are they saying the russians released more lunar orbital pictures from the sixties he snickered theyve got one here from the far side of the moon if you can believe this theres a dome back there a dome yeah he flipped open his notebook does nasa have a comment youre kidding right i said he twisted the ipad raised it higher and squinted at it yep its a dome all right the reporters in the pool all had a good chuckle and then they looked up at me well i said i guess buck rogers beat us there after all it looks legitimate jerry cole said but he was still laughing i didnt have to tell him what we all knew that it was a doctored picture and that it must have been a slow week for scandals if the image was doctored the deed had to have been done by the russians moscow had released the satellite images only a few hours before and forwarded them to us without comment apparently nobody on either side had noticed anything unusual except the bedrock staff i hadnt looked at the images prior to the meeting i mean once youve seen a few square miles of lunar surface youve pretty much seen it all the domeif thats really what it wasappeared on every image in the series they were dated april the bedrock carried the image on its front page where they usually show the latest movie celebrity whos being accused of cheating or has gone on a drunken binge it depicted a crater wall with a large arrow graphic in the middle of a dark splotch pointing at a dome that you couldnt have missed anyhow the headline read aliens on the moon russian pictures reveal base on far side images taken before apollo i sighed and pushed back from my desk we just didnt need this but it did look like an artificial construct the thing was on the edge of a crater shaped like the head of a bullet it was either a reflection an illusion of some sort or it was a fraud but the russians had no reason to set themselves up as a laughing stock and it sure as hell looked real i was still staring at it when the phone rang it was mary nasas administrator my boss jerry she said i heard what happened at the press conference this morning whats going on mary damned if i know push some buttons see what you can find out its going to come up again when the presidents out there we need to have an answer for him vasili koslov was my public relations counterpart at russias space agency he was in washington with the presidential delegation and he was in full panic mode when i got him on the phone i saw it jerry he said i have no idea what this is about i just heard about it a few minutes ago im looking at it now it does look like a dome doesnt it yes i said did your people tamper with the satellite imagery they must have i have a call in ill let you know as soon as i hear something i called jeanie escovar in the archives jeanie have you seen the national bedrock story yet no she said my god what is it this time not what you think im sending it to you now could you have somebody check to see where this place is what place oh waiti got it find out where it is and see if you can get me some imagery of the same area from our satellites i heard her gasp then she started laughing jeanie this is serious why you dont actually believe theres a building up there do you somebodys going to ask the president about it they have a press conference going on in about twenty minutes we want him to be able to say its ridiculous heres a picture of the area and youll notice theres nothing there we want him to be able to say the bedrocks running an optical illusion but hell have to do it diplomatically and without embarrassing alexandrov good luck on that the bedrock story was already getting attention on the talk shows angela hart who at that time anchored the morning report for the world journal was interviewing a physicist from mit the physicist stated that the picture could not be accurate probably a practical joke he said or a trick of the light but angela wondered why the russians would release the picture at all they had to know it would get a lot of attention she said and of course though she didnt mention it it would become a source of discomfort for the russian president and the two cosmonauts who were among the minerva crew vasili was in a state of shock when he called back they didnt know about the dome he said nobody noticed but it is on the original satellite imagery our people were just putting out a lot of the stuff from the luna missions imagery that hadnt been released before i cant find anybody who knows anything about it but im still trying vasili i said somebody must have seen it at the time in i guess you guess you think its possible something like this came in and nobody picked up on it no im not suggesting that at all jerry i justi dont know what im suggesting ill get back to you when i have something more minutes later jeanie called its the east wall of the cassegrain crater and ive forwarded nasa imagery of the same area i switched on the monitor and ran the images there was the same crater wall the same pockmarked moonscape but no dome nothing at all unusual dated july more than a year after the soviet imagery i called mary and told her the russians just screwed up the president cant say that all he has to say is that nasa has no evidence of any dome or anything else on the far side of the moon probably he should just turn it into a joke make some remark about setting up a martian liaison unit she didnt think it was funny when the subject came up at the presidential press conference gorman and alexandrov both simply had a good laugh alexandrov blamed it on khrushchev and the laughter got louder then they moved on to how the minerva missionthe longawaited return to the moonmarked the beginning of a new era for the world the story kicked around in the tabloids for two or three more days the washington post ran an oped using the dome to demonstrate how gullible we all are when the media says anything then cory abbott whod just won a golden globe for his portrayal of einstein in albert and me crashed his car into a street light and blacked out the entire town of dekker california and just like that the dome story was gone on the morning of the launch roscosmos the russian space agency issued a statement that the image was a result of defective technology the minerva lifted off on schedule and while the world watched it crossed to the moon and completed a few orbits its lander touched down gently on the mare maskelyne marcia beckett surprised everyone when she demurred leading the way out through the airlock sending instead cosmonaut yuri petrov who descended and then signaled his crewmates to join him when all were assembled on the regolith petrov made the statement that in the light of later events has become immortal we are here on the moon because during the last century we avoided the war that would have destroyed us all and we have come together now we stand as never before united for all mankind i wasnt especially impressed at the time it sounded like the usual generalized nonsense which shows you what my judgment is worth i watched on my office monitor and as the ceremony proceeded i looked past the space travelers across the barren wasteland of the mare maskelyne wondering which was the shortest path to the cassegrain crater i knew i should have just let it go but i couldnt i could imagine no explanation for the russians doctoring their satellite imagery vasili told me that everyone with whom hed spoken was shocked that the images had been dug out of the archives and distributed without inspection and as far as could be determined without anyone distorting them i just dont understand it jerry he said mary told me not to worry about it we have more important things to do she said there was no one left at nasa from the s in fact i knew of only one person living at cape kennedy who had been part of the agency when apollo went to the moon amos kelly whod been one of my grandfathers buddies he was still in the area where he served with the friends of nasa a group of volunteers who lent occasional support but mostly threw parties i looked him up hed come to the agency in as a technician eventually hed become one of the operational managers he was in his mideighties but he sounded good sure jerry i remember you its been a long time he said when i got him on the phone id been a little kid when he used to stop by to pick up my grandfather for an evening of poker what can i do for you this is going to sound silly amos nothing sounds silly to me i used to work for the government did you see the story in the tabloids about the dome how could i miss it you ever hear anything like that before you mean did we think there were martians on the moon he laughed turned away to tell someone that the call was for him and then laughed again is that a serious question jerry i guess not good by the way youve done pretty well for yourself at the agency your granddad would have been proud thanks he told me how much he missed the old days missed my grandfather how theyd had a good crew best years of my life i could never believe theyd just scuttle the program the way they did finally he asked what the russians had said about the images i told him what vasili told me well he said maybe they havent changed that much after all twenty minutes later he called back i was reading the story in the bedrock it says that the object was in the cassegrain crater yes thats correct there was talk of a cassegrain project at one time back in the sixties i dont know what it was supposed to be whether it was anything more than a rumor nobody seemed to know anything definitive about it i recall at the time thinking it was one of those things so highly classified that even its existence was off the table the cassegrain project yes but you have no idea what it was about none im sorry wish i could help would you tell me if you knew its a long time ago jerry i cant believe security would still be an issue amos you were pretty high in the agency not that high do you remember anything else nothing nada as far as i know nothing ever came of any of it so the whole thing eventually went away searching nasas archives on cassegrain yielded only data about the crater so i took to wandering around the facility talking offhandedly with senior employees it must feel good to see us back on the moon huh ralph makes all the frustration worthwhile by the way did you ever hear of a cassegrain project they all laughed crazy russians on the day the minerva slipped out of lunar orbit and started home mary called me into her office well want to get the crew onstage for the press when they get back jerry you might give the staging some thought okay will it be at edwards negative were going to do it here at the cape we talked over some of the details the scheduling guest speakers points wed want to make with the media then as i was getting ready to leave she stopped me one more thing the cassegrain business i straightened and came to attention mary gridley was a nononsense hardcharger she was in her fifties and years of dealing with bureaucratic nonsense had left her with little patience she was physically diminutive but she could probably have intimidated the pope i want you to leave it alone she picked up a pen put it back down and stared at me jerry i know youve been asking around about that idiot dome listen youre good at what you do youll probably enjoy a long happy career with us but that wont happen if people stop taking you seriously you understand what i mean after the shuttle landing and subsequent celebration i went on the road we need to take advantage of the moment mary said therell never be a better time to get some good press so i did a pr tour giving interviews addressing prayer breakfasts and rotary meetings doing what i could to raise the consciousness of the public nasa wanted moonbase it was the next logical step should have had it decades ago and would have if the politicians hadnt squandered the nations resources on pointless wars and interventions but it would be expensive and we hadnt succeeded yet in getting the voters on board that somehow had become my responsibility in seattle i appeared at a chamber of commerce dinner with arnold banner an astronaut whod never gotten higher than the space station but nevertheless he was an astronaut and he hailed from the apollo era during the course of the meal i asked whether hed ever heard of a cassegrain project he said something about tabloids and gave me a disapproving look we brought in astronauts wherever we could in los angeles at a marine charities fundraiser we had both marcia beckett and yuri petrov which would have been the highlight of the tour except for frank allen frank was in his nineties he looked exhausted his veins bulged and i wasnt sure he didnt need oxygen he was the fourth of the apolloera astronauts i talked with during those two weeks and when i asked about the cassegrain project his eyes went wide and his mouth tightened then he regained control cassandra he said looking past me into a distant place its classified not cassandra frank cassegrain oh yeah of course i have a clearance how high secret not enough just give me a hint what do you know jerry ive already said too much even its existence is classified cassandra when i got back to the cape i did a search on cassandra and found that a lot of people with that name had worked for the agency over the years other cassandras had made contributions in various ways leading programs to get kids interested in space science collaborating with nasa physicists in analyzing the data collected by spaceborn telescopes editing publications to make nasa more accessible to the lay public theyd been everywhere you couldnt bring in a nasa guest speaker without discovering a cassandra somewhere among the people whod made the request buried among the names so deeply that i almost missed it was a single entry the cassandra project storage b redstone so secret its existence was classified the reference was to the redstone arsenal in huntsville alabama where nasa stores rocket engines partiallycompleted satellites control panels from test stands and a multitude of other artifacts dating back to apollo i called them a baritone voice informed me i had reached the nasa storage facility sgt saber speaking i couldnt resist smiling at the name but i knew hed heard all the jokes i identified myself then sergeant you have a listing for the cassandra project i gave him the number can i get access to the contents one minute please mr carter while i waited i glanced around the office at the photos of neil armstrong and lawrence bergman and marcia beckett in one i was standing beside bergman whod been the guy whod sold the president on returning to the moon in another i was standing by while marcia spoke with some alabama school kids during a tour of the marshall space flight center marcia was a charmer of the first order ive always suspected she got the minerva assignment partially because they knew the public would love her when were you planning to come mr carter im not sure yet within the next week or so let us know in advance and therell be no problem its not classified then no sir im looking at its history now it was originally classified but that was removed by the restricted access depository act more than twenty years ago i had to get through another round of ceremonies and press conferences before i could get away finally things quieted down the astronauts went back to their routines the vips went back to whatever it was they normally do and life on the cape returned to normal i put in for leave you deserve it mary said next day armed with a copy of the restricted access depository act i was on my way to los angeles to pay another visit to a certain elderly retired astronaut i cant believe it frank allen said he lived with his granddaughter and her family of about eight in pasadena she shepherded us into her officeshe was a tax expert of some sortbrought some lemonade and left us alone what cant you believe that they declassified it that the story never got out in the first place frank was back at the desk id sunk into a leather settee whats the story frank was the dome really there yes nasa doctored its own cassegrain imagery to eliminate all traces i dont know anything about that so what do you know they sent us up to take a look in late he paused we landed almost on top of the damned thing before apollo yes i sat there in shock and ive been around a while so i dont shock easily they advertised the flight as a test run jerry it was supposed to be purely an orbital mission everything else the dome the descent everything was top secret didnt happen you actually got to the dome he hesitated a lifetime of keeping his mouth shut was getting in the way yes he said we came down about a half mile away max was brilliant max donnelly the lunar module pilot what happened i remember thinking the russians had beaten us theyd gotten to the moon and we hadnt even known about it there werent any antennas or anything just a big silvery dome about the size of a twostory house no windows no hammer and sickle markings nothing except a door we had sunlight the mission had been planned so we wouldnt have to approach it in the dark he shifted his position in the chair and bit down on a grunt you okay frank i asked my knees they dont work as well as they used to he rubbed the right one then rearranged himselfgently this time we didnt know what to expect max said he thought the thing was pretty old because there were no tracks in the ground we walked up to the front door it had a knob i thought the place would be locked but i tried it and the thing didnt move at first but then something gave way and i was able to pull the door open what was inside a table there was a cloth on the table and something flat under the cloth and thats all there was nothing else not a thing he shook his head max lifted the cloth under it was a rectangular plate made from some kind of metal he stopped and stared at me there was writing on it writing what did it say i dont know never found out it looked like greek we brought the plate back home with us and turned it over to the bosses next thing they called us in and debriefed us reminded us it was all top secret whatever the thing said it must have scared the bejesus out of nixon and his people because they never said anything and i guess the russians didnt either you never heard anything more at all well other than the next apollo mission which went back and destroyed the dome leveled it how do you know i knew the crew we talked to each other right they wouldnt say it directly just shook their heads nothing to worry about anymore outside kids were shouting tossing a football around greek thats what it looked like a message from plato he just shook his head as if to say who knew well frank i guess that explains why they called it the cassandra project she wasnt a greek was she you have another theory maybe cassegrain was too hard for the people in the oval office to pronounce i told mary what i knew she wasnt happy i really wish youd left it alone jerry theres no way i could have done that not now anyhow she let me see her frustration you know what itll mean for the agency right if nasa lied about something like this and it becomes public knowledge nobody will ever trust us again it was a long time ago mary anyhow the agency wasnt lying it was the administration yeah she said good luck selling that one to the public the nasa storage complex at the redstone arsenal in huntsville is home to rockets a lunar landing vehicle automated telescopes satellites a space station and a multitude of other devices that had kept the american space program alive if not particularly robust over almost seventy years some were housed inside sprawling warehouses others occupied outdoor exhibition sites i parked in the shadow of a saturn v the rocket that had carried the apollo missions into space ive always been impressed with the sheer audacity of anybody whod be willing to sit on top of one of those things while someone lit the fuse had it been up to me wed probably never have lifted off at kitty hawk i went inside the archive office got directions and a pass and fifteen minutes later entered one of the warehouses an attendant escorted me past cages and storage rooms filled with all kinds of boxes and crates somewhere in the center of it all we stopped at a cubicle while the attendant compared my pass with the number on the door the interior was visible through a wall of wire mesh cartons were piled up all labeled several were open with electronic equipment visible inside them the attendant unlocked the door and we went in he turned on an overhead light and did a quick survey settling on a box that was one of several on a shelf my heart rate started to pick up while he looked at the tag this is it mr carter he said cassandra is this everything he checked his clipboard this is the only listing we have for the cassandra project sir okay thanks my pleasure there was no lock he raised the hasp on the box lifted the lid and stood back to make room he showed no interest in the contents he probably did this all the time so i dont know why that surprised me inside i could see a rectangular object wrapped in plastic i couldnt see what it was but of course i knew my heart was pounding by then the object was about a foot and a half wide and maybe half as high and it was heavy i carried it over to a table and set it down wouldnt do to drop it then i unwrapped it the metal was black polished reflective even in the halflight from the overhead bulb and sure enough there were the greek characters eight lines of them the idea that plato was saying hello seemed suddenly less farfetched i took a picture several pictures finally reluctantly i rewrapped it and put it back in the box so said frank what did it say i have the translation here i fished it out of my pocket but he shook his head my eyes arent that good jerry just tell me who wrote it and what it says we were back in the office at franks home in pasadena it was a chilly rainswept evening across the street i could see one of his neighbors putting out the trash it wasnt written by the greeks i didnt think it was somebody came through a long time ago two thousand years or so they left the message apparently they wrote it in greek because it must have looked like their best chance to leave something wed be able to read assuming we ever reached the moon so what did it say its a warning the creases in franks forehead deepened is the sun going unstable no i looked down at the translation it says that no civilization anywhere has been known to survive the advance of technology frank stared at me say that again they all collapse they fight wars or they abolish individual death which apparently guarantees stagnation and an exit i dont know they dont specify sometimes the civilizations become too vulnerable to criminals or the inhabitants become too dependent on the technology and lose whatever virtue they might have had anyway the message says that no technological civilization anywhere has been known to get old nothing lasts more than a few centuriesour centuriesonce technological advancement begins which for us maybe starts with the invention of the printing press the oldest known civilization lasted less than a thousand years frank frowned he wasnt buying it they survived hell they had an interstellar ship of some kind they said they were looking for a place to start again where they came from is a shambles youre kidding it says that maybe if we know in advance we can sidestep the problem thats why they left the warning great if they survive they say theyll come back to see how were doing we were both silent for a long while so what happens now frank said weve reclassified everything its top secret again i shouldnt be telling you this but i thought he rearranged himself in the chair winced and rotated his right arm maybe thats why they called it cassandra he said wasnt she the woman who always brought bad news i think so there was something else about her yeahthe bad news i said when she gave it nobody would listen cats in victory david barr kirtley lynx awoke before dawn he got out of bed brushed his whiskers and licked his fur clean he dressed in boots and a tunic then donned his rucksack and set out into the dusty streets the sun was just beginning to peek up over the thatched rooftops most of the other catmen of the village were still asleep lynx hiked west out of town through the foothills and into the wasteland where he wandered amid the stark beauty of the stony plains winding arroyos and towering plateaus he loved walking here and today hed secretly resolved to explore as far to the west as he could his parents would disapprove like all the adults of the village they harbored a vague mistrust of the wasteland maybe due to the strange mechanical artifacts that they said were sometimes discovered beneath the sands but the more time lynx spent out here the more he felt that such misgivings were baseless all morning he climbed hills clambered over fields of boulders and strode between pillars of stone finally around midday his westward progress was blocked by a narrow canyon that stretched as far as he could see in either direction the canyon floor was forty feet below and the walls were too sheer to climb so lynx turned north skirting the cliff edge and searching for a way across finally he came to a place where a giant tree had grown up from the canyon floor beside the near wall the tree was dead now but its pale branchless trunk would provide easy access down into the canyon though there was no telling whether wait what was that he thought he saw movement below a few hundred yards away the canyon wall was broken by a wide low cavern a figure detached itself from the darkness and wandered down onto the sand lynx ducked then slowly raised his head again as the figure came to a halt as far as lynx knew nothing lived out here except lizards and birds but this figure was the size of a catman and walked upright then the thought came to him a dogman here impossible but it had to be he knew he should flee get help but the dogmen were almost extinct this might be the only chance hed ever get to see one and he should make sure it was really a dogman before he alarmed the whole village he dropped his rucksack and kicked off his boots he paced flexing his hand and foot claws then he dashed to the edge of the cliff and leapt onto the tree his claws dug into the wood and he hung there a moment then scrambled down the trunk and dropped lightly to the canyon floor he sneaked toward the cave ducking behind one boulder then another then another a strong breeze blew into his face and this was good for the wind would muffle his footsteps and carry his scent off behind him he lay down and crawled on elbows and knees until he was just a dozen yards away from the mysterious figure then peeked around a rock yes a dogman it was burlier than any catman and lynx could make out its grotesque floppy ears it wore a grungy tunic and a heavy broadsword then the creature turned its head and lynx glimpsed its profilea flat face with saggy jowls and wrinkled folds of flesh around the eyes a horrible misshapen creature an abomination lynx began to crawl backward then paused as he spied a second figure emerging from the cave this one was not so terrible a female slender perhaps as young as lynx her snout was white her large eyes banded with brown and her long silky ears hung past her shoulders she too wore a sword a rapier in lynxs imagination dogmen had always been ugly and fearsome and male he wondered about the female what was she to the hulking beast beside her his ally his wife she had a sweet look to her or was that deceptive had she ever killed a catman suddenly the big male straightened and poked his nose in the air sniffing loudlyonce twice lynx felt a prickle of terror while hed been distracted the breeze had shifted and he was now upwind of the dogmen the male roared catmen and whipped out his sword he turned and stared straight at lynx who leapt up from his hiding spot and sprinted away dodging around boulders and vaulting over ditches behind him came heavy footfalls and throaty growls as the male chased him gained on him lynx spotted the tree his escape the female cried no stop him lynx ran to the tree sprang onto it and scuttled upward the male bellowed and leapt after him and lynx heard the swoosh of the broadsword then the thunk of metal on wood the whole tree shuddered as the sword struck just below his feet he climbed out of reach the female dogman shrieked in despair and the male let loose a frustrated howl lynx fled the canyon as the dogmens terrible barking rose up from below him and echoed in his ears it wasnt until much later when he was far from that place that he noticed any pain then he found that he was missing a few inches off the end of his tail blood pooled there and fell in thick droplets to the sand night had fallen by the time lynx got back to the village he headed straight to the temple raced through the main doors and burst into the antechamber a scribe sat at a small wooden desk and scribbled in a ledger with a quill pen when he saw lynxs agitation the scribe stood can i help you lynx gasped for breath i have to see father cougar the scribe stared disapprovingly father cougar is delivering the evening service lynx said there are dogmen living in the wasteland hiding in the caves dogmen are you sure yes im sure they chased me with swords lynx held up the tip of his tail which was clotted with blood the scribe grew alarmed all right wait here he hurried over to a pair of heavy wooden doors then slipped through closing the doors behind him lynx stepped forward and pressed his ear to the wood father cougars booming voice filled the other room lynx could only make out some of the words but he grasped the essence of the sermon father cougar was preaching as ever about how these were the end times and about the coming victory when cat would return to earth the dogmen would be destroyed forever and the catmen would regain their pure feline forms father cougars voice died away he must be conferring with the scribe finally the scribe reappeared and said follow me he led lynx down a hallway to a cozy chamber whose walls were hung with tapestries father cougar wearing his vestments sat on a sofa in the corner he said warmly lynx come in come in lynx picked a chair and sat down father cougar settled back and stroked his scruffy gray whiskers now tell me what happened lynx explained about coming across the dogmen in the wasteland father cougar listened intently then said and they saw you lynx hesitated then admitted yes father cougar narrowed his eyes how lynx stared at the floor im sorry father was curious father cougar sighed deeply as i thought he leaned forward his gaze steady how many times must i tell you curiosity is the gravest of sins and now you see what your curiosity has cost us if you had avoided detection we could have easily located these dogmen and captured them but now theyll be expecting us and will move on the danger to those who track them is greatly increased and what if the dogmen should slip away you may very well have cost us the great victory we have awaited so long lynx felt ashamed despondent everything father cougar was saying was absolutely true father cougar shook his head well theres no helping it now he turned to the scribe and instructed go to the inn fetch the templars the scribe nodded once and hurried off lynx felt awe templars yes father cougar said they arrived this morning two of them pursuing these dogmen you saw theyll want to question you of course lynx agreed at once his shame quickly giving way to excitement templars holy ones invincible warriors of cat in ages past their order had eradicated the frogmen the birdmen and the monkeymen and now only the dogmen remained the scribe returned a short time later leading the templars they were the tallest most muscular catmen that lynx had ever seen both wore long white tabards and upon their surcoats were embroidered the holy form of cat father cougar gestured to them lynx these are our templar friends lion and tiger the templars nodded politely tiger was brawnier stern and dignified with gray in his fur and black stripes around his eyes lion had a great tawny mane and seemed almost to vibrate with barely restrained energy and he was younger perhaps only five or ten years older than lynx himself lion said quickly tell us about the dogmen so lynx repeated his story when he gave a description of the dogmen the templars glanced at each other when he got to the part about his escape from the canyon the scribe interrupted show them your tail lynx held up his injured tail lion clapped his hands together and said to tiger well look at that bloodied by dogmen and he escaped to tell of it he turned to lynx thats more than many templars can boast lynx felt an almost unbearable rush of pride lion said ive heard enough he turned to tiger lets find this cave father cougar said you mean to leave at once yes lion replied i see no reason to dally the dogmen certainly will not take me with you lynx exclaimed ill lead you there father cougar looked worried that might be dangerous your parents lynx said its my fault for letting the dogmen see me you have to let me make up for it no one knows the wasteland like i do father cougar turned to the templars i suppose its up to you tiger opened his mouth for the first time i dont think lion spoke over him yes let him come the dogmen cut him with their swords he deserves a chance to pay them back in kind he grinned at lynx and said but well cut more than just their tails wont we tiger said nothing come on lion said and gestured for lynx to follow lynx went with the templars back to the inn where they gathered supplies lion pulled a shortsword out from among his belongings and tossed it to lynx who caught it and put it on then lynx led the templars into the wasteland the sun was rising by the time they reached the cave tiger scouted about kneeling in places to sniff the earth then said this way the trail led westward deeper into the wastes that night the templars made camp beneath the open sky and in the morning they continued on again as far as lynx knew no catman had ever come this far before his boldness waned and he started to wonder what hed gotten himself into on the third day the templars stopped to rest beside a circular black pit a hundred yards across thick yellow grass grew all around the pit and vines hung over its edge and into the darkness there was something eerie and intriguing about the formation lynx wondered aloud could the dogmen be hiding in there tiger said the tracks lead on lion shrugged it cant hurt to check call us if you see anything lynx wandered over to the pit its sides were rough and angular and he scrambled easily down the many shelves of rock until he reached the cavern floor stray beams of sunlight lanced down through the opening overhead and caught the dust that floated in the air lynx turned in a slow circle then stopped as he saw something utterly unexpected he drew his sword and cried out lion lion halfburied in the side of the cave lay a strange object that was bigger than a cottage and made of a silver metal from the objects side protruded a structure that seemed to be a wing the object was extraordinarily weathered and its side was ripped open that dark gash beckoned to lynx he took a step forward then another from the cliff wall above lion called out wait lynx glanced back lion was climbing down into the cavern tiger stood above at the pits edge lion said what are you doing have you ever seen anything like it lynx said im going to look inside he crept nearer why lion called sharply i lynx was very close now i just this is curiosity lion warned this is wrong it isnt lynx insisted half to himself though why it wasnt he could not really say he slipped through the gash for a moment everything was dark then a hundred spots of lightred blue yellow greenflickered to life all around him he crouched in alarm hed never seen anything like these lights but his attention was quickly drawn away from them and toward a metal coffin that was built into the far wall its lid was made of glass and inside he could make out the rough outline of a body suddenly a loud voice spoke seeming to come from all around the language was unfamiliar lynx whirled but saw no one the coffin slowly opened lynx backed away cursing himself once again his curiosity had betrayed him had led him to intrude upon this strange tomb and now he had awoken something ancient and powerful his fearful imagination conjured up images of a living corpse with blazing red eyes but what actually emerged was no less surprising a monkeyman he seemed dazed and was dressed in some gray uniform its chest and shoulders decorated with insignia he glanced at lynx then staggered past him lynx stared in wonder and horror the monkeymen were supposed to have been wiped out centuries ago a second shape much smaller leapt from the coffin and lynx gasped as he observed its perfect grace for all his life he had seen this holy form depicted a thousand times and now there was no mistaking it this was the creator of the universe the giver of all life cat the ninelived had returned to earth at last lynx kneeled and whispered my lord cat did not acknowledge him and lynx was unsure what to do through the gash came the voices of the templars who now stood just outside tiger was saying with a mix of fear and awe it fell from the sky see it broke through into this cavern lion replied angrily the dogmen flee and we stand here engaged in idle he stopped abruptly as the monkeyman lurched through the gash and out into the cave lynx followed after the templars stood awestruck the monkeyman ignored them he stumbled about studying the damage to his winged tomb with one hand he grasped his forehead he still seemed disoriented lynx felt disoriented himself he wandered over to the templars tugged lions sleeve and made him look toward the tomb where cat was just emerging lion fell instantly to his knees and tiger did the same cat ignored them and strode along after the monkeyman then cat lay down reached into a gap between the tomb and the cave floor and batted his paw at something within the monkeyman grunted at cat and used the edge of one boot to lightly brush cat away from the hole lion leapt to his feet and cried you dare he ran up to the monkeyman and seized him by the shoulder the monkeyman shoved him back and yelled at him in a strange language an amulet on the monkeymans belt buzzed get your hands off me catman scum puzzled the monkeyman glanced at the amulet then he shouted at lion and again his magic amulet translated report what unit are you with and what the hell are you wearing lion backed away he moved to stand beside tiger and said in a low voice a surviving monkeyman he struck me you saw i should have the honor of slaying him the monkeymans amulet spoke in a strange tongue presumably translating lions words tiger said i dont know he comes to us from the sky as a companion of cat dare we slay him lion said cats holy word commands it tiger said cat himself stands before us now everything is changed lion glanced at cat who sat licking himself lion approached him knelt and said my lord i am lion your most faithful servant i am yours to command what is your wish for this monkeyman say the word and i will spill his blood in your name cat lifted his head gave lion an inscrutable stare and went back to licking himself lion still kneeling glanced at tiger and hissed why does he not answer tiger growled softly it is not our place to question his motives he will speak when he wills it lion turned back to cat answer me lord i beg you or if you will not give us some sign that we may do your will the monkeyman seemed to finally shake off his confusion and comprehend the danger he glanced back and forth between lion and cat then crouched and whistled to cat and spoke the amulet translated hey come here here kitty kitty kitty come on lion said darkly he presumes to command cat the monkeyman ignored this and kept calling cat gazed at the monkeyman but did not stir lion said cat rejects him wait the monkeyman held up a hand just leo come here dammit he whistled again here kitty kitty lion reached for his sword and said he dies but at that moment cat languidly uncurled himself and strolled across the dirt to the monkeyman who scratched cats whiskers then his ears his neck and his back cat purred and rubbed against the monkeymans shins lion froze cat shows him favor tiger observed cat has a special plan for him the monkeyman picked up cat and held him like a shield cat continued to purr lion glared at the monkeyman for a long time then strode over to him stood very close and said softly i do not know why cat chooses to prolong your miserable existence abomination but let no one say that i was curious he brushed by him and walked away the monkeyman lowered his head to cat and whispered good cat the catmen set out again now joined by cat and his strange monkeyman companion the monkeyman brought along a sort of satchel in which he carried cat who seemed pleased enough with the arrangement lion remained hostile to the monkeyman no matter how often tiger insisted that the victory was now at hand and that lion should be rejoicing the templars often knelt before cat and asked him for guidance but cat never deigned to reply sometimes the monkeyman would stare into the amulet but whatever it told him must have displeased him for he would shake it strike it and yell at it lynx was desperate to question the monkeyman but that would be showing curiosity so instead he tried to mimic the stony indifference of the templars still lynx couldnt keep his eyes off of cat the monkeyman noticed this finally he said do you want to hold him lynx was stunned he glanced at the templars who were now well ahead i couldnt sure the monkeyman reached into the satchel lifted cat free and handed him over to lynx who scratched cats ears the way the monkeyman had cat purred see the monkeyman said after a moment he added whats your name lynx hesitated then told him im charles the monkeyman said lynx didnt respond after a moment the monkeyman lowered his voice and said tell me lynx what year is this lynx was perplexed but the monkeyman seemed earnest lynx passed cat back to him and said slowly using what calendar i dont understand dating from when why this was the strangest question lynx had ever heard from the creation of the world the monkeyman said nothing for a long time he and lynx resumed walking finally the monkeyman asked in a low tone and what is this victory you really dont know cat hasnt told you the monkeyman said cat isnt overly fond of explaining himself as you may have noticed so lynx spoke of the victory when he saw that the monkeyman was utterly confused he found himself explaining more and more soon he had gone all the way back to the beginning back to when cat had created the world and all its inhabitants including his most favored creation cats whom cat had made in his own image to them alone cat had granted the gift of speech but the cats had grown curious about what other animals might say and so the cats disobeyed and shared the gift of speech with birds frogs dogs and monkeys but those other animals were wicked and spoke only lies when cat returned and saw what had happened he was very angry and punished those animals twisting them into catmen birdmen frogmen dogmen and monkeymen the catmen wailed and beseeched cat to restore them to their perfect forms but cat decreed that he would not until the catmen had wiped the earth clean of the abominationsany animal who spoke and was not feline but cat in his ultimate mercy also decreed that this redemption was inevitable and promised that in the last days he would return to earth to lead the catmen to ultimate glory lynx finished so that is the victory that is why cat has come again but his ways are strange we did not know that he would be accompanied by a monkeyman the monkeyman said and these dogmen were pursuing are the last on earth perhaps lynx said they are among the last certainly and the other monkeymen like me are all dead lynx confirmed long ago that night lynx was awoken by the sound of the monkeyman sobbing softly lynx thought he weeps for his vanquished race it had not occurred to lynx that abominations might be capable of such grief this monkeyman was the last of his kind probably and in the end when the victory came he too would be cleansed from the earth that made lynx feel almost sad he did not get back to sleep for a long time the templars tracked the dogmen ever deeper into the wasteland supplies were running low and nothing edible grew here but lion said good the dogmen will have the same problem theyll have to turn and face us and he was right the next day the catmen mounted a low windswept pass and lynx spotted the dogmen waiting amidst a jumble of boulders the male stood there holding his great broadsword the female reached for her rapier but the male barked at her and she reluctantly backed away the male stepped forward seeming worn and haggard but for all that he was still even bigger and more imposing than lynx remembered lion sighed only two and one a female he drew his sword and strode forward stay back ill handle this lynx looked to tiger hell fight alone tiger was stoic he prefers it this way why bring me all this way lynx said why give me a sword if he never meant for me to help thats just how he is the monkeyman moved to stand beside them how he is is arrogant and reckless why do you endure it tiger said softly youll see why lion closed in on the male who roared and thrust at him with savage force lion parried casually spun in a crouch and came up with both fists wrapped around the hilt of his sword he slammed his fists into his opponents jowled face and the male thudded to the ground lion kicked away the dogmans sword and just like that it was over lynx exclaimed hes amazing tiger nodded he hurried forward and lynx and the monkeyman followed tiger knelt to tie up the male as lion strode toward the female shed drawn her rapier and as lion came on she backed away in a fighting stance her movements swift and graceful lion held his sword at his side she thrust at his throat her speed was remarkable but lion whipped up his sword and easily blocked the blow the female backed away launching a series of feints and attacks lion laughed contemptuous as he parried each one but her last thrust deflected off his blade and scratched his shoulder he glanced at the small circle of blood that blossomed on his white tabard not bad i might have to try he moved to close with her but again she slipped away tiger looked uneasy he whispered at close range hes unstoppable but he has no patience the female kept retreating staying always just beyond the reach of lions sword she attacked again and again she got through pricking his other shoulder he hardly seemed to notice his expression was dark now he kept advancing lynx said we have to help tiger hesitated he would not like that lion roared slashing at the females head she backed out of reach then quickly counterattacked striking his chest three stains now blazed on his tabard the blood from his shoulder wounds soaked down to his elbows he seemed to be slowing lynx said if you wont help him i will he drew his shortsword and ran in a wide arc so that he circled behind the female then charged her as he neared she pivoted and thrust at his face lynx ducked and retreated instantly she turned back to lion but now he had closed with her and she was doomed when she attacked he locked her wrist and wrenched her sword away he smashed an elbow into her face and hurled her over his hip then lion was upon her straddling her pounding his fists into her face knocking her head this way and that soon she was unconscious with blood oozing from her muzzle but the blows kept falling lynx murmured wait but lion ignored him finally lion stood his chest wound had bled a red blotch around the holy form of cat that was embroidered on his surcoat lynx said are you all right lions eyes were full of fury i told you to stay back you couldve gotten us both killed he shoved lynx aside and stormed on past tiger came forward and knelt to bind the female he said he gets like this just let him calm down itll be all right the templars marched the dogmen east the prisoners were not spoken to and when night fell they were bound at wrist and ankle tiger took the first watch while lion dozed lynx sat a dozen yards away off by himself leaning on a boulder the monkeyman settled down beside him and nodded at the prisoners so what happens to them now lynx said the templars will want to show them off charge money to see them that sort of thing the monkeymans voice was soft you said these might be the last dogmen on earth they might lynx agreed and then theyll be executed yes the monkeyman caught lynxs gaze held it and youre going to let that happen lynx glanced over at tiger but the templar was too far away to hear them lynx hissed of course the monkeyman said no one has ever called me squeamish and i have no love for dogmen but to wipe out an entire race thats evil lynx you must know that whatever some old legend says youre just a monkeyman you wouldnt understand i understand more than you can imagine the monkeyman said ive flown among the stars and slept for ages and i remember earth as it was when monkeymenas you call usruled all we made you lynx you catmen in our labs the dogmen too and all the rest we made you to be soldiers and i guess we did our jobs too well because i awake to find that youve beaten us but that doesnt this is blasphemy lynx said i warn you not even cats favor will protect you if what him the monkeyman jabbed a thumb toward the satchel where cat slept hes an animal like any other i raised him from a kitten lynx stood i should kill you for that the monkeyman glared up at him fine kill me like you killed my race whatve i got to live for he gestured toward lion rouse your maniac friend there tell him to chop off my head hed like that and would you i thought you were different lynx scowled and stomped away he sat down beside tiger who asked whats wrong lynx said furiously nothing tiger glanced at the monkeyman then said monkeys lie thats why they should never have been granted the gift of speech lynx crossed his arms and agreed yes they lie for the next two days lynx refused to speak to the monkeyman but doubts gnawed at him much as he hated to admit it the monkeyman was right about one thing lynx was different from the templars he had always thought of himself as faithful but traveling with them had made him see just how shallow and perfunctory his belief really was lions faith was like fireit gave intensity to everything he did but it was a fire that was raging out of control and would someday consume him and tigers faith was like a mountainimmense solid and immovable but lynx realized that his own faith was more like the wasteland itself existing only in the absence of anything else the monkeymans briefly spouted heresies made sense to lynx in a way that the wisdom of father cougar never really had that afternoon lynx found himself walking for a moment beside the female before he could stop himself he blurted out you fought well she looked up startled to be spoken to what lion was off ahead of them tiger was back a ways out of earshot lynx said softly the other day you fought well i think you wouldve beaten him if i hadnt interfered beaten a templar you should be proud of that oh she said puzzled thank you sure lynx said awkwardly and hurried off the monkeyman sidled up from behind him why did you do that lynx maintained a stony silence for a moment then said i i was just curious the monkeyman said lynx sighed the monkeyman added curiosity is no sin if youre not curious youll never learn thats blasphemy lynx said but his tone was flat the monkeyman didnt respond after a time lynx said even if i agreed with youabout the dogmen i meanwhat can i do the monkeyman whispered you can pretend to be asleep tonight and when i create a distraction you can crawl over to the dogmen and cut their bonds and let them escape lynx was startled i didnt mean i know the monkeyman gave him a thin smile but think about it ill create the distraction what you do then is up to you wait lynx said this was too much what sort of distraction youll see your little outburst the other night gave me an idea lynx considered this during whose watch whose do you think lions of course he was by far the more easily distracted think about it the monkeyman repeated and fell behind again as night came on the templars made camp atop a low hill tiger slumbered and lynx pretended to he still couldnt decide whether to help the dogmen after several hours he heard movement and peeked out one eye the monkeyman came up to stand behind lion and said you seem like the religious type lion turned to him do not mock me monkeyman lion was now facing away from lynx and the prisoners the monkeyman sat down on a stone not at all i just thought you might be interested in some of the religious ideas of the monkeymen the chattering of abominations does not interest me lion began to turn away wait the monkeyman said for example did you know that many monkeymen believed that they were made in the image of the creator of the universe lion laughed at that did they ever look in a mirror surely they could not believe that the creator of the universe was so ungainly and absurd the monkeyman shrugged others had another idea about how they came to be it was called evolution by natural selection lions back was still turned lynx glanced at the prisoners he thought he could crawl to them without attracting attention if he was caught at this the templars would kill him and what if father cougar was right about cat and the victory and all of it lynx stared at the female he was impressed by her liked her though theyd barely spoken he didnt want to see her die if he helped her escape the catmen would have other opportunities to apprehend her if necessary but if she died he began to crawl toward her lion was saying even if that were possible it would take thousands of years millions the monkeyman corrected the world is not that old well these monkeymen had some ideas about that too the females eyes were wide as lynx crawled up beside her he glanced over her shoulder at lion who was absorbed in the argument lynx drew the shortsword and whispered if i set you free will you swear to run away and never come back and never trouble any catman ever again she stared at him a moment then nodded quickly all right lynx sliced her bonds then squirmed over to the male to cut those ropes too lion exclaimed that is heresy the monkeyman replied that is fact lion stood up he towered over the monkeyman and said take it back im just telling you what silence lion used the back of his fist to strike the monkeyman across the face knocking him to the dirt lynx freed the male and together the prisoners began to crawl off lion drew his sword and strode toward the monkeyman who sprang up and backed away lion said come here no get away from me the monkeyman turned and stumbled down the hill and lion went after him lynx thought lion will kill him the monkeyman knew this would happen he knew he was sacrificing himself lynx glanced at the prisoners who were now on their feet and hurrying away lion and the monkeyman were soon lost in the darkness but lynx could hear them cursing he considered waking tiger who might restrain lion but tiger might also notice the prisoners fleeing then the monkeyman let out an anguished wail and tiger opened his eyes lynx had no choice he cried tiger the templar reached for his sword what lynx pointed lion hes gone crazy tiger leapt up and lynx followed as they reached the bottom of the hill lion stepped from the shadows tiger shouted what have you done lion was smug the monkeyman blasphemed with every word i have silenced him no lynx thought hurrying forward scanning the ground for a corpse but the monkeyman was alive weeping kneeling over the smashed remains of his magic amulet there was a gash over his brow and his eyes were forlorn as he uttered a string of gibberish lion had spared the monkeymans life but now there wasnt a single being on earth that the monkeyman could talk to lynx said im so sorry charles at the sound of his name the monkeyman looked up charles he repeated he took a deep breath wiped his eyes and rose to his feet lynx took him by the arm and they hiked back up the hill they entered camp just behind tiger who said where are the prisoners lion looked stricken he glanced about tiger cursed he ran across the camp and stared off down the far side of the hill nothing theyre gone i lion hesitated then he pointed to the monkeyman its his fault his fault tiger raged was it his job to watch the prisoners or was it yours lion stomped away then turned back and glared at the monkeyman he knows something maybe tiger said no ones ever freed themselves from my ropes before we could question him if you hadnt silenced him lion scowled tiger gathered up some belongings it wont matter well catch the dogmen again and well have the truth from their own lips his tone was grim and well take no more chances no more prisoners the dogmen die the catmen walked all through the night and at dawn they came upon a shallow cave in which the dogmen were huddled together sick and weary the templars strode forward drawing their swords and advancing on the dogmen who stood to meet them the male pounded his meaty fist into his palma futile gesture of defiance the dogmen were unarmed and would be slaughtered lynx and the monkeyman watched helplessly but then lynx called out wait tiger paused and glanced back lynx said let cat judge them lion sneered cats feelings toward dogmen are well known then whats the harm tiger thought this over he lowered his blade all right lynx approached the monkeyman who was confused lynx nodded at the satchel and the monkeyman got the idea he lifted cat free and set him on the ground lynx knelt my lord we have need of your wisdom what is your wish for these dogmen please give us a sign cat looked up at lynx and said nothing lion growled why trouble cat with this he has already decreed death for all dogmen long ago lynx stood up and took a step back he called gently here kitty kitty lion said what are you doing lynx backed up until he stood between the dogmen then he crouched and called here kitty kitty kitty cat continued to stare lynx said to the dogmen come on like this he added softly please just try after a moment the female bent down and called here kitty kitty the male did the same lion was outraged what is this but sure enough cat stirred he picked his way across the ground until he stood before lynx and the dogmen lynx reached out and scratched between cats ears and cat purred the female stroked cats back cat wound among lynx and the dogmen and rubbed against their legs the templars stood stunned tiger intoned cat shows them favor lion said no the cat i serve shows no mercy to dogmen tiger gestured look its some trick lion said this this is not cat it cannot be maybe this is one of the cats who that is heresy tiger warned the cats were transformed into catmen all of them lynx cried out cat returns to earth with a new message of peace no lion shouted no cat the eternal does not change his mind tiger turned away and sheathed his sword lion stared at him in horror what are you doing i will not stand against the incarnation lion was shocked what tiger said i must think on all this he stared coldly over his shoulder at the dogmen and said to them you have a reprieve from me for now he began to walk away to lion he said do as you like lion looked all around at cat at the dogmen at the monkeyman finally lion shot lynx a withering glare then followed after tiger lynx waited until the templars were a good distance off then he let out a long sigh of relief he thought to himself i cant believe it we won but his gladness was tempered by apprehension the templars would return and even if they didnt theyd spread their tale what would father cougar think or lynxs parents and what would become of cat and the monkeyman and the dogmen now others would come seeking them he knew for a moment the group all watched each other uncertainly then the monkeyman laughed he stepped forward and introduced himself to the male charles and then again to the female charles she glanced at lynx who gave her a bemused smile and shrugged cat purred and rubbed against lynxs shins in that moment he felt a bit of hope if they all just stuck together he thought things might work out in the end he bent down and petted cat and scratched his chin he whispered good cat amaryllis carrie vaughn i never knew my mother and i never understood why she did what she did i ought to be grateful that she was crazy enough to cut out her implant so she could get pregnant but it also meant she was crazy enough to hide the pregnancy until termination wasnt an option knowing the whole time that shed never get to keep the baby that shed lose everything that her household would lose everything because of her i never understood how she couldnt care i wondered what her family thought when they learned what shed done when their committee split up the household scattered thembroke them because of her did she think i was worth it it was all about quotas theyre using cages up north i heard off shore anchored nina said fifty feet acrosstwice as much protein grown with half the resources and wed never have to touch the wild population again we could double our quota i hadnt really been listening to her we were resting just for a moment she sat with me on the railing at the prow of amaryllis and talked about her big plans wind pulled the sails taut and the fiberglass hull cut through waves without a sound we sailed so smooth garrett and sun hauled up the nets behind us dragging in the catch amaryllis was elegant a foot sleek vessel with just enough cabin and cargo spacean antique but more than seaworthy she was a good boat with a good crew the best marie nina said pleading i sighed and woke up weve been over this we cant just double our quota but if we got authorization dont you think were doing all right as it is we had a good crewwe were well fed and not exceeding our quotas i thought wed be best off not screwing all that up not making waves so to speak ninas big brown eyes filled with tearsid said the wrong thing because i knew what she was really after and the status quo wasnt it thats just it she said weve met our quotas and kept everyone healthy for years now i really think we should try we can at least ask cant we the truth was no i wasnt sure we deserved it i wasnt sure that kind of responsibility would be worth it i didnt want the prestige nina didnt even want the prestigeshe just wanted the baby its out of our hands at any rate i said looking away because i couldnt bear the intensity of her expression pushing herself off the rail nina stomped down amaryllis port side to join the rest of the crew hauling in the catch she wasnt old enough to want a baby she was lithe fit and golden running barefoot on the deck sunbleached streaks gleaming in her brown hair actually no she was old enough shed been with the house for seven yearsshe was twenty now it hadnt seemed so long whoa sun called there was a splash and a thud as something in the net kicked against the hull he leaned over the side the muscles along his broad coppery back flexing as he clung to a net that was about to slide back into the water nina petite next to his strong frame reached with him i ran down and grabbed them by the waistbands of their trousers to hold them steady the fourth of our crew garrett latched a boat hook into the net together we hauled the catch onto the deck wed caught something big heavy and full of powerful muscles we had a couple of aggregatorslarge buoys made of scrap steel and woodanchored fifty miles or so off the coast schooling fish were attracted to the aggregators and we found the fishmainly mackerel sardines sablefish and whiting an occasional shark or marlin found its way into the nets but those we let go they were rare and outside our quotas that was what i expected to seesomething unusually large thrashing among the slick silvery mass of smaller fish this thing was large yes as big as ninano wonder it had almost pulled them overbut it wasnt the right shape sleek and streamlined a powerful swimmer silvery like the rest of the catch what is it nina asked tuna i said by process of elimination i had never seen one in my life bluefin i think no ones caught a bluefin in thirty years garrett said sweat was dripping onto his face despite the bandanna tying back his shaggy dark hair i was entranced looking at all that protein i pressed my hand to the fishs flank feeling its muscles twitch maybe theyre back wed been catching the tunas food all along after all in the old days the aggregators attracted as many tuna as mackerel but no one had seen one in so long everyone assumed they were gone lets put him back i said and the others helped me lift the net to the side it took all of us and when we finally got the tuna to slide overboard we lost half the nets catch with it a wave of silvery scales glittering as they hit the water but that was okay better to be under quota than over the tuna splashed its tail and raced away we packed up the rest of the catch and set sails for home the californian crew got their banner last season and flew its red and greenpower and fertilityfrom the top of the boats mast for all to see elsie of the californian was due to give birth in a matter of weeks as soon as her pregnancy was confirmed she stopped sailing and stayed in the household sheltered and treasured loose hands resting atop mountainous belly she would sometimes come out to greet her households boat as it arrived nina would stare at her elsie might have been the first pregnant woman nina had seen as least since surviving puberty and developing thoughts of carrying a mountainous belly of her own elsie was there now an icon cast in bronze before the setting sun her body canted slightly against the weight in her belly like a ship leaning away from the wind we furled the sails and rowed to the pier beside the scale house nina hung over the prow looking at elsie who was waving at californians captain on the deck of the boat solid and dashing everything a captain ought to be he waved back at her their boat was already secured in its home slip their catch weighed everything tidy nina sighed at the image of a perfect life and nobody yelled at her for not helping best thing to do in a case like this was let her dream until she grew out of it might take decades but still my amaryllis crew handed crates off to the dockhand who shifted our catch to the scale house beyond that were the processing houses where onshore crews smoked canned and shipped the fish inland the new oceanside community provided sixty percent of the protein for the whole region which was our mark of pride our reason for existing within the community itself the ten sailing crews were proudest of all a fishing crew that did its job well and met its quotas kept the whole system running smoothly i was lucky to even have the amaryllis and be a part of it i climbed up to the dock with my folk after securing the boat and saw that anders was the scalemaster on duty the weeks trip might as well have been for nothing then thirtyfive years ago my mother ripped out her implant and broke up her household might as well have been yesterday to a man like anders the old man took a nailbiting forty minutes to weigh our catch and add up our numbers at which point he announced youre fifty pounds over quota quotas were the only way to keep the stock healthy to prevent overfishing shortages and ultimately starvation the committee based quotas on how much you needed not how much you could catch to exceed thatto pretend you needed more than other peopleshowed so much disrespect to the committee the community to the fishing stock my knees weak i almost sat down id gotten it exactly right i knew i had i glared at him garrett and sun a pair of brawny sailors helpless before the scalemaster in his dull gray tunic of authority glared at him some days felt like nothing i did would ever be enough id always be too far one way or the other over the line of just right most days id accept the scalemasters judgment and walk away but today after setting loose the tuna and a dozen pounds of legitimate catch with it it was too much youre joking i said fifty pounds really anders said marking the penalty on the chalkboard behind him where all the crews could see it you ought to know better an experienced captain like you he wouldnt even look at me couldnt look me in the eye while telling me i was trash what do you want me to do throw the surplus overboard we can eat those fifty pounds the livestock can eat those fifty pounds itll get eaten dont worry but its on your record then he marked it on his clipboard as if he thought wed come along and alter the public record might as well not sail out at all next week eh i said the scalemaster frowned and turned away a fifty pound surplusif it even existedwould go to make up another crews shortfall and next week our catch would be needed just as much as it had been this week however little some folk wanted to admit it we could get our quota raised like nina wanted and we wouldnt have to worry about surpluses at all no then wed worry about shortfalls and not earning credits to feed the mouths we had much less the extra one nina wanted surpluses must be penalized or everyone would go fishing for surpluses and having spare babies and then where would we be too many mouths not enough food no resiliency to survive disaster and all the disease and starvation that followed id seen the pictures in the archives of what happened after the big fall just enough and no more moderation but so help me i wasnt going to dump fifty pounds just to keep my record clean were done here thank you captain marie anders said his back to me like he couldnt stand the sight of me when we left i found nina at the doorway staring i pushed her in front of me back to the boat so we could put amaryllis to bed for the night the amaryllis scales arent that far off garrett grumbled as we rowed to her slip ten pounds maybe not fifty anders had his foot on the pad throwing it off id bet on it sun said ever notice how were only ever off when anders is running the scales wed all noticed is that true but why would he do that said nina innocent nina everyone looked at me a weight seemed to settle on us what nina said what is it it was the kind of thing no one talked about and nina was too young to have grown up knowing the others had all known what they were getting into signing on with me but not nina i shook my head at them well never prove that anders has it in for us so theres no good arguing well take our licks and thats the end of it sun said too many black marks like that theyll break up the house that was the worry wasnt it how many black marks nina said he cant do that can he garrett smiled and tried to take the weight off he was the first to sign on with me when i inherited the boat wed been through a lot together well just have to find out anders schedule and make sure we come in when someone else is on duty but most of the time there were no schedulesjust whoever was on duty when a boat came in i wouldnt be surprised to learn that anders kept a watch for us just to be here to rig our weighin amaryllis glided into her slip and i let garrett and sun secure the lines i leaned back against the side stretching my arms staring up along the mast nina sat nearby clenching her hands her lips elsie and californians captain had gone i gave her a pained smile you might have a better chance of getting your extra mouth if you went to a different crew the californian maybe are you trying to get rid of me nina said sitting up i put my arms across her shoulders and pulled her close nina came to me a clumsy thirteenyear old from bernardino up the coast my household had a space for her and i was happy to get her shed grown up smart and eager she could take my place when i retired inherit amaryllis in her turn not that id told her that yet never never ever she only hesitated a moment before wrapping her arms around me and squeezing back our household was an oasis wed worked hard to make it so id inherited the boat attracted the crew one by onegarrett and sun to run the boat round and bustling dakota to run the house and she brought the talented jj and we fostered nina wed been assigned fishing rights and then we earned the land allocation ten years of growing working sweating nurturing living and the place was gorgeous wed dug into the side of a hill above the docks and built with adobe in the afternoon sun the walls gleamed golden the part of the house projecting out from the hill served as a wall protecting the garden and well our path led around the house and into the courtyard wed found flat shale to use as flagstones around the cultivated plots and to line the well turning it into a spring a tiny spring but any open fresh water seemed like a luxury on the hill above were the windmill and solar panels everyone who wanted their own room had one but only sun didthe detached room dug into the hill across the yard dakota jj and nina had pallets in the largest room garret and i shared a bed in the smaller room what wasnt house was garden we had producing fruit trees an orange and a lemon that also shaded the kitchen space corn tomatoes sunflowers green beans peas carrots radishes two kinds of peppers and anything else we could make grow on a few square feet a pot full of mint and one of basil for the most part we fed ourselves and so could use our credits on improving amaryllis and bringing in specialties like rice and honey or fabric and rope that we couldnt make in quantity dakota wanted to start chickens next season if we could trade for the chicks i kept wanting to throw that in the face of people like anders it wasnt like i didnt pay attention i wasnt a burden the crew arrived home jj had supper ready dakota and jj had started out splitting household work evenly but pretty quickly they were trading choresturning compost versus hanging laundry mending the windmill versus cleaning the kitchenuntil jj did most everything involving the kitchen and living spaces and dakota did everything with the garden and mechanics by jjs sympathetic expression when he gave me my servingsmoked mackerel and vegetables tonightsomeone had already told him about the runin with the scalemaster probably to keep him or dakota from asking how my day went i stayed out later than usual making a round of the holding not that i expected to find anything wrong it was for my own peace of mind looking at what wed built with my own eyes putting my hand on the trunk of the windmill running the leaves of the lemon tree across my palms ensuring that none of it had vanished that it wasnt going to it had become a ritual in bed i held tight to garrett to give and get comfort skin against skin under the sheet under the warm air coming in through the open skylight above our bed bad day he said can never be a bad day when the ship and crew come home safe i said but my voice was flat garrett shifted running a hand down my back arranging his arms to pull me tight against him our legs twined together my nerves settled he said ninas right we can do more we can support an extra mouth if we appealed you really think thatll do any good i said i think youd all be better off with a different captain he tilted his face toward mine touched my lips with his pressed until i responded a minute of that and we were both smiling you know we all ended up here because we dont get along with anyone else but you make the rest of us look good i squirmed against him in mock outrage giggling plenty of crewsplenty of householdsdont ever get babies he said it doesnt mean anything i dont care about a baby so much i said im just tired of fighting all the time it was normal for children to fight with their parents their households and even their committees as they grew but it wasnt fair for me to feel like i was still fighting with a mother id never known the next day when nina and i went down to do some cleaning on amaryllis i tried to convince myself it was my imagination that she was avoiding me not looking at me or pretending not to look when in fact she was stealing glances the way she avoided meeting my gaze made my skin crawl a little shed decided something she had a secret we caught sight of elsie again walking up from the docks a hundred yards away but her silhouette was unmistakable that distracted nina who stopped to stare is she really that interesting i said smiling trying to make it a joke nina looked at me sideways as if deciding whether she should talk to me then she sighed i wonder what its like dont you wonder what its like i thought about it a moment and mostly felt fear rather than interest all the things that could go wrong even with a banner of approval flying above you nina wouldnt understand that not really marie how can you be so so indifferent because im not going to spend the effort worrying about something i cant change besides id much rather be captain of a boat than stuck on shore watching i marched past her to the boat and she followed head bowed we washed the deck checked the lines cleaned out the cabin took inventory and made a stack of gear that needed to be repaired wed take it home and spend the next few days working on it before we went to sea again nina was quiet most of the morning and i kept glancing at her head bent to her work biting her lip wondering what she was thinking on so intently what she was hiding turned out she was working up the courage i handed the last bundle of net to her then went back to double check that the hatches were closed and the cabin was shut up when i went to climb off the boat myself she was sitting at the edge of the dock her legs hanging over the edge swinging a little she looked ten years younger like she was a kid again like she had when i first saw her i regarded her brows raised questioning until finally she said i asked sun why anders doesnt like you why none of the captains talk to you much so that was what had happened sunmatteroffact and sensiblewould have told her without any circumspection and nina had been horrified smiling i sat on the gunwale in front of her id have thought youd been here long enough to figure it out on your own i knew something had happened but i couldnt imagine what certainly noti mean no one ever talks about it but what happened to your mother her household i shrugged because it wasnt like i remembered any of it id pieced the story together made some assumptions was told what happened by people who made their own assumptions who wanted me to understand exactly what my place in the world was they were scattered over the whole region i think ten of themit was a big household successful until i came along i dont know where all they ended up i was brought to new oceanside raised up by the first amaryllis crew then zeke and ann retired took up pottery went down the coast and gave me the ship to start my own household happy ending and your motherthey sterilized her after you were born i mean i assume so like i said i dont really know do you suppose she thought it was worth it i imagine she didnt i said if she wanted a baby she didnt get one did she but maybe she just wanted to be pregnant for a little while nina looked so thoughtful swinging her feet staring at the rippling water where it lapped against the hull she made me nervous i had to say something youd better not be thinking of pulling something like that i said theyd split us up take the house take amaryllis oh no nina said shaking her head quickly her denial vehement i would never do that id never do anything like that good i said relieved i trusted her and didnt think she would then again my mothers household probably thought that about her too i hopped over to the dock we collected up the gear slinging bags and buckets over our shoulders and starting the hike up to the house halfway there nina said you dont think well ever get a banner because of your mother thats what you were trying to tell me yeah i kept my breathing steady concentrating on the work at hand but it doesnt change who you are what you do the old folk still take it out on me its not fair she said she was too old to be saying things like that but at least now shed know and she could better decide if she wanted to find another household if you want to leave ill understand i said any house would be happy to take you no she said no ill stay none of itit doesnt change who you are i could have dropped everything and hugged her for that we walked awhile longer until we came in sight of the house then i asked you have someone in mind to be the father hypothetically she blushed berry red and looked away i had to grinso that was how it stood when garrett greeted us in the courtyard nina was still blushing she avoided him and rushed along to dump her load in the workshop garrett blinked after her whats up with her nina being nina the next trip on amaryllis went well we made quota in less time than i expected which gave us half a days vacation we anchored off a deserted bit of shore and went swimming lay on deck and took in the sun ate the last of the oranges and dried mackerel that jj had sent along with us it was a good day but we had to head back some time and face the scales i weighed our haul three times with amaryllis scale got a different number each time but all within ten pounds of each other and more importantly twenty pounds under quota not that it would matter we rowed into the slip at the scale house and anders was the scalemaster on duty again i almost hauled up our sails and turned us around never to return i couldnt face him not after the perfect trip nina was rightit wasnt fair that this one man could ruin us with false surpluses and black marks silently we secured amaryllis to the dock and began handing up our cargo i managed to keep from even looking at anders which probably made me look guilty in his eyes but wed already established i could be queen of perfection and he would consider me guilty anders frown was smug his gaze judgmental i could already hear him tell me i was fifty pounds over quota another haul like that hed say well have to see about yanking your fishing rights id have to punch him i almost told garrett to hold me back if i looked like i was going to punch him but he was already keeping himself between the two of us as if he thought i might really do it if the old scalemaster managed to break up amaryllis id murder him and wouldnt that be a worse crime than any i might represent anders drew out the moment looking us all up and down before finally announcing sixty over this time and you think youre good at this my hands tightened into fists i imagined myself lunging at him at this point what could i lose wed like an audit nina said slipping past sun garrett and me to stand before the stationmaster frowning hands on her hips excuse me anders said an audit i think your scale is wrong and wed like an audit right she looked at me it was probably better than punching him yes i said after a flabbergasted moment yes we would like an audit that set off two hours of chaos in the scale house anders protested hollered at us threatened us i sent sun to the committee house to summon official oversighthe wouldnt try to play nice and they couldnt brush him off june and abe two senior committee members arrived austere in gray and annoyed whats the complaint june said everyone looked at me to answer i almost denied itthat was my first impulse dont fight dont make waves because maybe i deserved the trash i got or my mother did but she wasnt here was she but nina was looking at me with her innocent brown eyes and this was for her i wore a perfectly neutral businesslike expression when i spoke to june and abe this wasnt about me it was about business quotas and being fair scalemaster anders adjusts the scales calibration when he sees us coming i was amazed when they turned accusing gazes at him and not at me anders mouth worked trying to stutter a defense but he had nothing to say the committee confirmed that anders was rigging his scale they offered us reparations out of anders own rations i consideredit would mean extra credits extra food and supplies for the household wed been discussing getting another windmill petitioning for another well instead i recommended that any penalties they wanted to levy should go to community funds i just wanted amaryllis treated fairly and i wanted a meeting to make one more petition before the committee garrett walked with me to the committee office the next morning i should have been the one to think of requesting an audit i said nina isnt as scared of the committee as you are as you were he said im not but i stopped because he was right he squeezed my hand his smile was amused his gaze warm he seemed to find the whole thing entertaining mei was relieved exhausted giddy ashamed mostly relieved we amaryllis had done nothing wrong i had done nothing wrong garrett gave me a long kiss then waited outside while i went to sit before the committee june was in her chair along with five other committee members behind their long table with their slate boards tally sheets and lists of quotas i sat across from them alone hands clenched in my lap trying not to tap my feet trying to appear as proud and assured as they did a stray breeze slipped through the open windows and cooled the cinderblock room after polite greetings june said you wanted to make a petition wethe amaryllis crewwould like to request an increase in our quota just a small one june nodded weve already discussed it and were of a mind to allow an increase would that be suitable suitable as what as reparation as an apology my mouth was dry my tongue frozen my eyes stung wanting to weep but that would have damaged our chances as much as just being me did theres one more thing i managed with an increased quota we can feed another mouth it was an arrogant thing to say but i had no reason to be polite they could chastise me send me away without a word lecture me on wanting too much when there wasnt enough to go around tell me that it was more important to maintain what we had rather than try to expandexpansion was arrogance we simply had to maintain but they didnt they didnt even look shocked at what i had said june so elegant i thought with her long gray hair braided and resting over her shoulder a knitted shawl draped around her as much for decoration as for warmth reached into the bag at her feet and retrieved a folded piece of cloth which she pushed across the table toward me i didnt want to touch it i was still afraid as if id reach for it and june would snatch it away at the last moment i didnt want to unfold it to see the red and green pattern in full in case it was some other color instead but i did even though my hand shook and there it was i clenched the banner in my fist no one would be able to pry it out is there anything else youd like to speak of june asked no i said my voice a whisper i stood nodded at each of them held the banner to my chest and left the room garrett and i discussed it on the way back to the house the rest of the crew was waiting in the courtyard for us dakota in her skirt and tunic hair in a tangled bun jj with his arms crossed looking worried sun shirtless hands on hips inquiring and nina right there in front bouncing almost i regarded them trying to be inscrutable gritting my teeth to keep from bursting into laughter i held our banner behind my back to hide it garrett held my other hand well nina finally said how did it go what did they say the surprise wasnt going to get any better than this i shook out the banner and held it up for them to see and oh id never seen all of them wideeyed and wondering mouths gaping like fish at once nina broke the spell laughing and running at me throwing herself into my arms we nearly fell over then we were all hugging and dakota started worrying right off talking about what we needed to build a crib all the fabric wed need for diapers and how we only had nine months to save up the credits for it i recovered enough to hold nina at arms length so i could look her in the eyes when i pressed the banner into her hands she nearly dropped it at first skittering from it as if it were fire so i closed her fingers around the fabric and held them there its yours i said i want you to have it i glanced at garrett to be sure and yes he was still smiling staring at me nina held it to her chest much like i had but you its yours she started crying then so did i gathering her close and holding her tight while she spoke through tears dont you want to be a mother in fact i rather thought i already was no time like the present carol emshwiller a lot of new rich people have moved into the best houses in townthose big ones up on the hill that overlook the lake what with the depression some of those houses have been on the market for a long time theyd gotten pretty run down but the new people all seem to have plenty of money and fixed them up right away added docks and decks and tall fences it was our fathers mine included who did all the work for them i asked my dad what their houses were like and he said just like ours only richer as far as we know none of those people have jobs its as if all the families are independently wealthy those people look like us only not exactly theyre taller and skinnier and theyre all blonds they dont talk like us either english does seem to be their native language but its an odd english their kids keep saying shoe dad and bite the boot they shout to each other to evolve at first their clothes were funny toothe men had weird jackets with tight waists and their pants were too short the girls and women actually wore longish wide skirts they dont have those anymore they must have seen right away how funny they looked compared to us and gone to pennys and got some normal clothes like ours they kept their odd shoes though like they couldnt bear not to have them they look really soft theyre kind of square and the big toe is separate and they had to wait for their hair to grow out some before they could get haircuts like ours this year our boys have longer hair than the girls so their boys were all wrong every single one of those new people first thing put two flamingos out on their front lawns but then a few days later they wised up and took them away it wasnt long before every single one of them had either a dog or a cat when sunday came they all went to the unitarian church and the women wore the most ridiculous hats but took them off as soon as they saw none of us wore any they wore their best clothes too but only a few of us do even though they come to church mom says i shouldnt make friends with their kids until we know more about them and i especially shouldnt visit any of their houses she says the whole town doesnt trust them even though everybody has made money on them one way or another their kids have a funny way of walking not that funny actually but as if they dont want anybody to talk to them and as if theyre better than we aremaybe just because theyre taller but we dont look that different it seems as if theyre pretending were not here or maybe that theyre not here in school they eat lunch together at the very farthest table and bring their own food like our cafeteria food isnt good enough they obviouslyall of themdont want to be here ive got one of the new people in my class i feel sorry for her marietta smith ill bet all those new people are smiths and joneses and browns and blacks shes tall and skinny like they all are shes by herself in my class usually theres two or three of them in each class shes really scared i tried to help her the first daysi thought she needed a girl friend really badlybut she didnt even smile back when i smiled straight at her the boys are all wondering if those new boys would be on the basketball team but so far they dont even answer when theyre asked jerry asked huxley jones and huxley said under his breath evolve why dont you trouble is my name is smith too but its really smith ive always wanted to change it to something more complicated id rather be karpinsky or jesperson or minnifee like some of the kids in my class i kind of understand those new kids i have to eat a special diet and im too tall too i tower over most of the town boys and im an only child and im not at all popular i dont care what mom says i dont see what harm there can be in helping marietta and im curious i like her odd accent i try saying things as she does and i say shoe dad to my dad even though i dont know what those kids mean by it maybe its really shoo dad one of these days im going to sneak into her house and see what i can find out but i dont have a lot of time for finding out things because i have to practice the violin so much funny though when i took my violin to school because i had my lesson that afternoon marietta looked at the case as if she couldnt imagine what was in it i said violin even though she hadnt asked and then she looked as if she wanted to ask whats a violin those kids are all so dumb about ordinary things every single one of them has been kept back a grade i dont know how they can walk around looking so snooty its as if they think being dumb is better marietta is awful in school too the teacher asked her who was the vice president and she didnt know so the teacher asked who was president and she didnt know that either that gave me the courage to ask her if she wanted help but then she said her mother doesnt want her to be friends with any of us and i said my mother says the exact same thing finally she laughs we both do and she says shoe dad if we can keep it secret those kids never say okay she says but i shouldnt be too smart either we dont want anybody to notice us so far i dont think she has anything to worry about in that direction i dont say that though what i say is youre getting noticed for the opposite reason you need my help im really curious about her house but she wouldnt dare invite me and i wouldnt dare go there and she cant come to my house because mom would be horrified too bad they look a little bit different otherwise mom would never know so we mostly meet in the woods by the railroad tracks where the bums used to hide out back when there were bums mom doesnt like me to go there either she thinks maybe there might still be bums around marietta and i always scope out the place first not for bums but because boys sometimes go there to smoke i discovered marietta was so bad at math because she was used to writing out the problems in an entirely different way once i got that straightened out she got a lot better but she said huxley told her there was no need for her ever to know who was president here now i said why not she started to say it wasnt important but she stopped in the middle then she said it was just that there were some things she wasnt going to bother knowing she tells me she really likes judson jesperson but she says shes not supposed to go outside her own group and me i like huxley jones but marietta says he cant go outside their group either shes supposed to like huxley and im supposed to like judd i asked her if this was some sort of religious thing i didnt dare say racial but judson has very dark hair and eyes though his skin is just like hers she said no it was something entirely different and she wasnt supposed to talk about it she said it would be very dangerous for any of her group to marry outsiders she said who knows who would be president in a couple a hundred years if judd and i got married so anyway were unhappy together and i can tell her all about judsons family but she cant tell me anything about huxley a dozen more families of the tall people move into town they cant take the best houses because theyre already gone but when they get through with the second best houses they turn out be almost as good except for not being on top of a hill and next to the lake the first group of kids is getting a little friendlier huxley even let himself get talked into being on the basketball team but he didnt know how to play and had to be taught from scratch judd says theyre sorry now all he has going for him is being tall i dont care i like him i like his stooped over posture as if he doesnt want to be that tall i like his kind of scholarly face i like his pixie grin at first he was always frowning at all of us but pretty soon he wasnt and especially not at me the first thing i said to him was i like your name and he actually did smile by now everybody is saying shoe dad then we have the first snow and a snow day its so beautiful i want to see marietta right away but no school so i start out towards her house im not going to disobey mom besides thats our only good hill for sledding everybody will be up there and there everybody is with sleds and garbage can lids and folded up cardboard boxes some kids even have skis the new kids are even more excited about the snow than we are they act as though theyve never made snowmen and never thrown snow balls theyre like little kids well actually we all are those new kids have skis and fancy boots but not a single one knows how to ski mariettas there i knew she would be she says first off look these great boots she has the fancy kind you cant walk around in theyre white with dozens of black buckles i admit theyre beautiful i say shoe dad and they only cost five hundred dollars shes always saying things like that everything is cheap to her i wish something was cheap to me id like to say evolve but i dont want to make her feel bad i say bite the oh yeah bite the ski boot we dont hear about it till lunch time but that night in the middle of the storm odd things disappeared half the fish at the fish hatchery and that very same night a big pile of lumber from the lumber mill disappeared the night watchman swears he made his rounds every hour sometime between his two oclock and three oclock a whole section of lumber was gone and not a sound the fish people are there early and late they went to feed the fish at eight and found half the tanks empty some of us say the new people are getting blamed just because theyre richer than we are and just because theyre new though nobody can figure out how they could have done it even so im suspicious too dad says the town is going to have a meeting about them then we hear that exactly the same night north of us in washington state they also lost a lot of lumber and another place in nevada lost half their grassfed beef funny though huxley said all this was our fault even that theyre here in the first place is our fault he said we should have stopped cutting down trees he wont say anything more about it that shows how odd these new kids are but i guess thats fair we blame them for everything and they blame us except for marietta those kids still dont like it here at all but marietta says shes getting to like it partly because of being friends with mewhere she was before she never had such a good friend as i amand she also likes it because she always did like camping out and making do with whats at hand that makes me wonder all the more where she came from the new people often have meetings in one of the larger houses up on the hill they cant hide that because all the best cars in town are parked outside after the fish and lumber disappear the next time those cars gather a whole batch of the towns people storm the house it isnt fair but the cops are on our side theyre just like all the towns people they dont trust those new people either and it isnt as if the new people had any higher up connections in the town that would help them so the cops arrest them instead of us even though were the ones that broke into their meeting did a lot of damage too and not only to the furniture six of the new people are in the hospital that leaves a lot of those kids with nobody looking after them the school principal asks the town parents if theyll take in some of the children temporarily until their parents can get themselves straightened out with the police i get my folks to take in marietta mom doesnt mind it under these circumstances in fact she acts nice she even bakes cookies marietta cant believe mom made these right here at home shes so fascinated she forgets to feel worried for a while as usual i have to practice the violin marietta tries it out all she makes is squeaks she cant believe how hard it is shes only played computer instruments aided she says so you dont have to know anything but you can have any sound you want and you sound good right at the beginning i have twin beds in my room so we get to be right in together at first marietta seems to like it as much as i do we talk until mom comes in and tells us we have to stop because of school tomorrow but a little bit after i turn out the light im pretty sure marietta is crying i ask if theres anything i can do she says i wish i could go home i say it wont be long before your parents come back i mean i want to go back where we used to live my real home where is it were not supposed to say was it so much better there sort of some ways except its nice being so rich for a change of course theres lots you dont have oh well im glad youre here well im glad for having you can i go up and see your house now that theres nobody there its just like yours only richer thats because everything is so cheap here otherwise we couldnt afford stuff its supposed to be just like yours our parents made it special to be like that can we go anyway i like rich stuff and i hardly ever get to see rich things except on tv besides dont you need to go get more clothes so we do thatskip school and go up shes right theres nothing odd about it except there is theres a fancy barbeque thing in the backyard but obviously never used theres a picnic table beside it but no chairs the two flamingos are in a corner lying on their sides inside its awfullyi dont know how to describe itcold and stiff and kind of empty its as if nobody lives there theres a national geographic on one side of the coffee table and a consumers report on the other and thats all no clutter mom would like it upstairs her room has all the right stuff theres a brand new teddy bear on the pillow and a small bookcase with brand new books all very girlie they dont look read either theres not a single tarzan or john carter i ask and she never even heard of tarzan i tell her ill lend her some even though were too old for those shell like them she has one whole drawer with nothing but fancy sweaters and blouses we gather some up to bring back and she says i can have half of them on the way out i open the hall closet and theres a tangle of wires and silvery things along them like christmas tree lights at first marietta tries to keep the door shut as if she doesnt want me to see them but then she says she trusts me as much as anybody she ever knew so she says take a good look i say i dont know what it is anyway she says time machine and starts laughing hysterically and then we both laugh so hard we fall on the floor and i dont know whats the truth and what isnt except maybe i do im glad we went there i dont need to feel jealous after all even though mom would probably like living like that i wouldnt the police hang on to those new people to see if any of them are guilty of anything at all and also as a sort of punishment i suppose for being rich and taking up all the best places that means marietta and i have even more time together the lumber mill now has three night watchmen theyre sitting right next to the biggest piles of lumber the fish hatchery has people practically in with the fish but thenagain in the middle of the nightall the new people disappear the grownups that is so then we know who did the fish and lumber but now theres nobody to blame but their children some townspeople are so angry they want to put them in jail too most of the townspeople dont go that far though my parents and lots of others say they wont let that happen besides now that they know marietta they like her but its not safe for the new kids to walk the streets anymoretwo kids got beat up by a gang of boys and they werent even the new kids they were just blond and tall and skinny mom dyes mariettas hair black so shell be safer some of the other new kids do that too marietta looks good with dark hair that doesnt cheer her up though all those kids feel terrible naturally but its odd they keep saying theyre not surprised they just wondered when it would happen we talk a lot in bed at night and mom doesnt tell us to shut up until it gets really late how can your parents leave you like this were not allowed to say but its for our own good parents always say that i try to cheer up marietta we go to lots of movies she does like the tarzan and john carter books and there are lots of those to go through yet mom gives her valerian and chamomile tea almost every night at first marietta didnt want hugs from my mom but now she does i go around wearing her expensive sweaters and i wear her white jacket when she wears her shiny black one that turns out to be a big mistake because i get taken for one of them im as tall and skinny as they are and here i am wearing fancy clothes like they always do and here we are marietta and me one of us with dyed black hair and me a darker blond than they are but that doesnt matter to this bunch theyre not high school boys i dont know who they are but theyre grown menwaiting for us after the movie they dont think marietta is one of the new peoplethey think i am shes wearing my faded blue jeans and my sweatshirt and im in her cashmere sweater and that white jacket they push her asideso hard they knock her downand come after me they yank at mariettas jacket so hard the zipper breaks and then pull the sweater up over my face so i dont see what happens next all i know is they suddenly stop and marietta is pulling the sweater down so i can see she yells run and we do when i look back i see all three of them collapsed on the ground dont stop marietta grabs my arm and pulls me along with her what did you do im not allowed to say we run all the way home and collapse in our front hall that white jacket is lost and ruined out there somewhere and the sweater is all pulled out of shape marietta right away says dont tell how did you do that i thought you had those here tazers dont you this is just a different form where is your tazer im not supposed to say see where i come from its not safe anymore since the revolt of my dronesi mean my parentsthey wanted me to be able to defend myself besides they thought everybody here had guns where is it you can tell me here she points to her earlobe theres not even a mark that i can see i have some control over the direction she twists her earlobe i can even point it back i touch it but i dont feel anything they left us here my drones they said they would if anything happened and things did happen i guess it is better here i mean the air and water and space to move around in and the food it isnt what were used to and its awfully primitive everything is but its better some ways and were rich i have a million dollars in the bank in my name shes about to tell me more but mom comes in right then and finds us sitting on the floor and me all bedraggled and the sweater ruined she gets really upset when she hears about it we dont tell her the tazer part she insists that shes going to dye my hair that very night no matter how long it takes and i have to stop wearing mariettas nice clothes for once i agree with her i let her do all that even though i know the kids at school will tease me i wonder if those men are going to tell what happened to them maybe not though because they were breaking the law im going to stick close to marietta from now on i feel safe with her most of those new kids are physically awkwardlike huxley trying to be on the basketball teambut marietta isnt so bad she says its because her parents didnt believe in the education boxes most kids had she says those were like being inside a tv set but she kept calling hers mommy by mistake and that upset her mother so much she actually had her playing outside even though the air wasnt that good anymore and even when it was too hot shes been telling me everything even about the airconditioned sweater her mom got her she says even so it was getting worse and worse food riots sometimes i know this is best for us but we have to be so careful and not change anything nobody knows what would happen if we upset things shoe dad i might not even exist id go poof just like that and then huxley gets in trouble and that changes everything he didnt dye his hair like the others did it might not have worked anyway three men attack him maybe the same three that came after us youd think theyd learn marietta and i have to guess what happened that he not only used his tazer but tied up the men when they were down dragged them into the woods then he walked all the way home with bruises all over nobody found out about the men out in the woods till two days later it rained all the next day and one of the men suffocated with his head in the mud marietta and i know huxley didnt use his tazer until he was practically all beat up he was trying so hard not to cause any changes in the people living here but then he caused more of a problem the townspeople are blaming him of course they are besides who knows what story those men told so the police come to arrest him but he takes off they even shoot at him but he gets away we dont know if he got shot or not all the new kids are even scareder than they already were about going poof they keep saying its gotta be even worse than that butterfly back in the jurassic era i dont know what they mean by that they stand there staring at nothing as if thinking any minute and i never existed they stop in mid sentence as if is it right now that i disappear on the other hand they could disappear by going back home wed never know which it was marietta hangs on to me whenever she can its as if she thinks as long as she has a good grip on my arm she wont disappear its a bother but i let her i know where huxley isnt hes not at that place where the bums used to go and where the boys go to smoke thats too easy but i do know where he could be i dont even tell marietta i get up real early before anybody is up i make a couple of peanut butter sandwiches and take some nuts and apples and go good that huxley and i never got together or the cops would be watching me so i head out into the woods its a good place to get lost since there are so many crisscrossing paths and theres a lot of undergrowth for hiding i think huxley is somewhere in there but ill have a hard time finding him i whistle i sing i make a lot of noise and wander all over i think im going to get lost myself but what if hes disappeared already what if hes never been at all then i hear a bird chirping above me i look up and there he is and hes not been shot i climb up and give him the sandwiches hes changed a lot from when he first came i dont think hed have been able to climb a tree he looks kind of wild and haunted and dirty that makes me like him all the more im always embarrassed being so close to a boy i like so much and now even more so i dont ask anything i really want to im too nervous he gobbles up both sandwiches and apples and nuts all in about five minutes when everything is gone he thinks maybe one of the sandwiches might have been for me and apologizes but i say none of it was for me and ill bring more tomorrow he admires my new black hair but i think hes just trying to be nice i move up closer to the branch hes on turns out i dont have to ask anything he tells me he always did like me but didnt dare show it now he does dare he thinks everything is all messed up anyway so he might as well like me and he wants me to know it then we hear the swishing of underbrush and voices of people coming closer we shut up he moves higher and i move lower in a few minutes the woods are packed with people walking all over the place looking for him some of them are cops in uniform lots are just townspeople mostly men but a few women i jump down and move away from his tree i shout lets look over by the little cave next to the stream so i and a group of others including one cop head over there the cop says arent you supposed to be in school yeah but isnt this important youre lucky im not a truant officer what will you do when you find him he pulls his cuffs out of his back pocket and rattles them says hes dangerous i know this whole woods better than a lot of them do i lead them around to all sorts of good hiding places i talk loud and make a lot of noise i dont ever look up its a tiring day for everybody i had no idea i was going to get caught up in the search and get home so late my folks and marietta have been worried about me i didnt tell mom where id been but i tell marietta she feels bad that i didnt ask her to come along but i convinced her it was safer for huxley if its just me next day i dont think i should keep on skipping school so i just skip my last class this time i make four peanut butter sandwiches its late so i bring a flashlight i head for that same tree first but hes not there as before i sing i whistle i keep looking up and chirping i go to all the good spots it gets dark and im worried about using the flashlight theres only a little moon so i stumble around tripping on things pretty soon i know id better go home i leave the sandwiches up in the tree where i first found huxley i leave the flashlight for him too and try to find my way out without it but i cant i thought if i just came to one of the streams and followed it id be okay but its muddy and slippery near the stream and i keep falling down i decide its best to just wait till dawn i huddle down against a tree i wish id kept one of those sandwiches for myself in the morning i go back to the tree where i left the sandwiches something got into them and ate most of them and scattered what was left all over when i get back my folks are so worried and the police are all over looking for me thing is marietta disappeared too and first they thought we were off somewhere together then they thought that i got disappeared with all the others it turns out theyre all gone ill never know if marietta got to go home or if she never existed in the first place or maybe they decided it was a bad and dangerous idea to leave their kids here or maybe things got better so it was okay to go home or maybe they found better stuff from other times like way way back before there were other people to get in their way she left a lot of her clothes in my room funny though my old tarzan and john carter booksthe ones she was in the middle of readingare gone that makes me feel that she didnt disappear completely like she was afraid would happen shes still someplace im sure of it reading my books i wonder if i could write her a letter ill bet there is a way like sealed up in stainless steel i wish wed talked about that before she left i wish i knew how long my letter would have to last to get to her maybe ill have to carve it in stone manumission tobias s buckell this morning when you wake up and look at your rippled reflection in the basin of water near the concrete wall of your cell you only have one true personal memory left it cant be that your entire life is based off this one event so you suspect theyve left it with you to piss you off to motivate you to make you one raging motherfucker its a riff on the countee cullen poem youre six standing on the street holding the anonymous arm of your mom and the other kid staring back at you flips you off and calls you nigger thats all they really left you with sure theres other stuff youre no vegetable you can use money eat walk tap the net and know just about anything headlined over the last thirty years but anything specific is faded general lost behind static and fuzzy feelings you empty the basin with a flourish and look around your cell the headache the allover itching the scars crisscrossing your entire body that gets to you too youve signed yourself away the men in the black suits have explained back when you first arrived in this cell they sat across from you on a sterile metal table the document they slid toward your burnt smooth fingertips is legit so you listened to them and nodded and they got up to leave oh yeah one last thing they had said your name pepper and your last name they just chuckled and closed the door nine oclock newport rhode island a forest of masts bobs slightly boats cheerfully tied at their docks you slide off the blue awning over the side entrance to a small bar and hit the slippery cobblestones to face a portly middleaged accountant with slicked back wiry hair oh shit is all he has time to say then slumps the small wires that knocked him out recoil back up into your wrists with a flick you squat over the man push his trousers up his hairy calf and look at the tattoo on the back of his knee hes shinnco property your eyes scan for forgery defects get in closer for a finer look where every hair seems to be treesized all good you blink your eyes until they return to normal the thin extra membrane rolling back behind your eyelids his hands are clammy when you grab them his breath reeks of alcohol with a grunt you pull him up onto your shoulder and stagger toward a waiting car what you wonder has mr james edward leaked to the federalists you really dont want or need to know twelve hours later five thousand closer to freedom an old mm astra model cub pistol tucked in the inner pocket of your oilskin duster youre sitting in the lounge of an airship over several hundred feet of water languorously easing your way toward the next stop eleytheria its moored out in the atlantic off the eastern seaboard this month at street level the gulf stream winds kick through the downtown buildings of eleytheria your oilskin duster takes on a life of its own bucking trying to pull you off course as you make the usual staggered path random jigs sudden stops in front of reflective surfaces its not even a conscious thing checking for tails monotone pedestrians in business camouflage the grays and blacks of their seemingly timeless and conservative professions mill past you it isnt new york but any of them could have been plucked out and placed in that environment without even noticing no just a few miles away the salt clears the breakwalls in clouds of mist and hovers into downtown eleytheria is a giant bowl riding the large open ocean free to go where it pleases do what it pleases many things start in eleytheria like yourself years ago deep in the bowels of one of eleytherias denizen companies youve found old archived public camera pictures of yourself walking down the streets into the center of shinnco to sign your self this self into what you know now sometimes you hate your old self for selling you into this bondage you wonder what he got lots of money some last great fling or were you just desperate a wandering piece of hardware abandoned by some former first world secret gov project made obsolete by the pacification youd like to think you did it for some great cause like helping your family out of a dire situation but late at night you doubt it and think there was some stupid selfish reason for doing it theyll never tell you because if it was something like a family you might try to contact them no they have your memories youll get them back when you serve your contract it always comes back to eleytheria when your feet hit the seacrete your nose fills with misted salt and you have returned to the only home you know all your recent memories everything that is you starts here ever since you woke up behind a garbage dump in the back alley of shinnco and theyve never let you back in through the front doors because they know full well what kind of monster they created they control you but they dont sleep well at night if you were to ever get near a door the automated security would hit you with an emp pulse that would pretty much liquefy the machines in you then the guns would reduce you to bloodied ribbons of flesh you wont be getting your memories back using the new skills theyve grafted into you no way and they still have one final trick to keep you close to control you so you stand in front of a small food cart a faded orange umbrella hangs limply over it when you palm the metal rail the countdown inside you resets youre allowed to live for another week a pointed way of letting you know youre motherfucking owned and you dont get to stray at all the edges of the umbrella flutter in the cold breeze and on the other side of the cart an old greek stands up morning kouroupas morning pepper he says looking you up and down the usual the usual the front of the cart has a faded poster of a model with a strained smile flat white teeth holding up a gyro in perfectly manicured hands theyre heeeeros she says lettuces mayonnaises kouroupas crazy white hair flies all over the place in the wind it makes him look like a mad scientist he slaps the flatbread down a cloud of flour tickles your nose a few browned strips of meat some folded metallic paper and you have your gyro along with a small napkin neatly slid between your fingers you look at it your eyes adjusting to the fibers mapping out a pattern along the embroidered edges translating the woven picture into words susan stamm ten thousand location eleytheria ten thousand closer to getting yourself back to freedom and shes right here you fold the napkin and its encrypted directions into your pocket pick up the gyro kouroupas smiles good day he tells you be careful you nod and slide a few bills over to him you too be careful its the first time kouroupas seems to acknowledge that this isnt just a gyro purchase seems to be telling you somethings not quite normal this time out of sight of the gyro stand you toss the gyro into a trashcan that thanks you and trundles away not nearly enough raw sugars in gyros for you takes too long to metabolize what you need now is something to spike your blood sugar to combat levels susan stamm has done many many unique things to hide her presence but shes on the run and wants off the planet to do that she has to come to eleytheria once an hour every hour a capsule is launched into low earth orbit to really get far away stamm has to get out there from down here so you sit and flip through pictures of embarkees whove been photographed at all three entrance points one by fucking one and these are just the ones the port authority computers have served up as possible matches shinnco is being very generous with info and resources right now they really want her back youre sitting in a small outdoor café eyes closed on the right eyeball is susan stamms corp id photo on your left is some random face pic snapped by the port authority entrance machine then another random face you reach for the sugary soda take a long cold sip and the next picture comes up another sip of sugar water gotta keep the machines inside you running happy you flip to another pic ha she looks thinner than the last official photo shes still fivenine but now has a recently bobbed haircut and green eyes four hours later youre in the lobby of a smaller eleytheria hotel looking up at the atrium eighty stories above you licking the icing off a danish in the background over the hum of people over the echoing shouts of kids screaming and waving from several floors above comes the explosive whipcrack of a capsule being thrown into space there was this mugger that jumped you a year ago before you even realized it youd spun broke both his arms and a leg and the man lay in an unconscious heap by the side of a brick façade his clothes were ragged he was thin and when you held his gun in your hand you realized that it was unloaded ballsy and pathetic by going through his wallet you found out that his name was jack connely he had three kids and a very attractive blonde wife jack had been a spacer entrepreneur of some sort reduced to earth living after the pacification now all the businesses could buy a ride into space move their offices up into alien stations use alien services buy alien products machines not much use for small guys you could hardly scrape together the price but multinationals can and now that theyre all in orbit or beyond the pretense of even caring about the world they originated from was thrown out you could have used the money you found in his pocket his days take though you couldnt use it toward paying off your shinnco contract they only accept their own in house credit you couldnt even use the money to disable the shit laced all through your body you tried that once before almost killed you on the table instead you sent his wallet and the money back in the mail to his family and you added some of your own youre a good person you tell yourself but its very hard to believe when it was so easy so automatic to have grabbed that mans gun and pull the trigger right down to within a hairtrigger of firing before stopping that cant be all wired into you right susan stamm walks through the revolving door past a doorman and on toward a cab you shake your shoulders and arms loosening up the great mass of coat around you and step in behind her shes better looking in person unlike some of the dolledup makeupcaked women youve seen in the past as she grabs the gullwing door of the bubbly autocab she spots your reflection in the window and turns around could we share this ride you say already you flex the muscles in your wrists begin to raise your left arm and coat to obscure her body shell fall and youll sweep her up and into the autocab with you as the autocab rides off youll look like two lovers cuddling in the back instead her eyes widen hands curl into fists and a small dart burrows into your stomach youre on the ground convulsing spit flecks your lips you break into a heavy sweat vomit tastes like sugar water flowing out onto the concrete sidewalk it takes effort just to slowly roll over the doorman turns around he moves a blur that you know isnt natural and hits stamm from the side she hits the door of the autocab shattering the plexiglas and the doorman grabs her neck turning her head to confirm her shinnco tattoo small silver fans protrude from the back of the mans neck antenna you can see heat rising off his uniform rippling the air around him a timeshare not under his own control thenjust renting his body for sudden onthespot jobs like this one you have a choice give it up let this competitor grab her kill her whatever or with just a quick flex of your arms the wires spit out of your wrists and hit the back of his neck the man spasms lightning sparking across the surface of his skin the antenna melt dripping down the back of his collar he spins around and raises his arms oh fuck he screams the link to whatever controls him from orbit gone im burning they killed me im burning as he staggers toward the door people gather someone tries to get the doorman to sit down someone s to call this in speaking into his pinkie finger on your hands and knees eyes burning and streaming tears wires retracted back into your wrists you push forward into the car you grab stamm pull her in with you and barely manage to shut the door shes in better shape than you coming back to consciousness as you vomit sugar water all over her red high heels drive damnit she shouts at the cabs autopilot and gives an address damage has been detected it warbles failure mode initiated a replacement cab is on its way we apologize for the delay shit the cab rocks as she leans forward your muscles fail your brain goes zero youre out there are rooms and then there are rooms theyre square more often than not with white walls but this one has dirty laundry fake wooden paneling a giant mirror on a wall and a small cot that youre lying on a wicker chair next to you creaks soft hands stroke your forehead youre tough that was supposed to kill you i feel like shit every pore hurts i would imagine a finger traces the scars all over your body im sorry i think i may have got the wrong person it was the doorman i should have shot he was the one coming for me who are you dont say anything just shiver and turn back off its easier you wake up hungry and naked disoriented you have no internal time the small set of numbers that usually hover in the corner of your left eye is gone theres a pink bathrobe on the wicker chair that you grab as you sit up it takes everything you have to stand muscles protest and every cell seems to ache feeling better shes sitting by the kitchen counter hands up watching you warily you nod okay so here are the rules any sudden moves i fire another one of these pips into you if your hands arent where i can see them i shoot i doubt you survive another one so sit put your hands on your lap the bathrobe is comfortable you slowly wrap it tighter around you and sit her tone drips with suspicion guarded overtones the air is tense she points at your leg thats where they tattooed the small logo on you inner thigh it really really hurt youre shinnco yes she knows you know no point in denying and the doorman she asks did you know about him ahead of time you shrug she stares at you and you stare right back not sure where this is going you have the faintest sense that youll get out of the door alive why are you still here you ask which also implies why am i still alive you could have left me here stamm smiles i felt bad for you that is not the response you really expected and you dont believe it for a second someone this dangerous isnt that stupid you know what i am get real they want me alive youre not that dangerous neither was the doorman he was just a backup its unfortunate they dont care a whit about his life youve never spotted backups of any sort before this is different very different she spots the frown is this your first high profile recapture off in the distance is the whipcrack of another space launch and she smiles its a broad one full of glee look im within walking distance of getting away theyre getting desperate i shouldnt have gotten this far youre a backup the doorman was an emergency backup and the first three they sent after me are all lying in alleys somewhere shes dangerous kouroupas tried to warn you so what now you ask well im hungry and making some breakfast can i get you anything you smile anything with sugar i could really use something sweet she nods yeah ill bet you could but i know what makes you tick your smile drops none of that for you im leaving you weak and slow for now just stay on the bed dont move and ill bring you some diet soda you stare at her and she laughs at you i know a lot about those systems in you how do you think i ended up with those little pips i hit you with i designed them myself she walks into the kitchen opens the fridge and tosses you a can drink up what is your name you look down at the sugarless drink in your hands pepper you say susan stamm shinnco property since birth mother died having her orphanage signed susan over she starts telling you all this stuff as she sits at a small table across from you and eats obscene amounts of breakfast sausage and eggs the place reeks of it you never even realize there is a different way of life susan says but i remember when i was twelve suddenly understanding that there were people who didnt have to have logos on their bodies who didnt have to report into minders once a day who werent being encouraged to study certain things that the company needed she picks up a greasy link pausesand then i decided i would escape it how many years has that been she flashes a smile and downs the sausage then the dishes are tossed in the sink she washes her hands while looking over her shoulder at you youre still sitting in the pink bathrobe sipping from the can just on the other side of eleytheria is a launcher i have a ticket off this world and out there i have passage far out as crew on a mining ship i know it wont be easier but ill be my own person she raises a wrist i can burn this fucking logo off my skin so youll leave me here she shakes her head i have a proposition you cant buy your freedom from shinnco ill bet not for a long time yet but what would you do for a ticket offworld you just stare at her she takes it as hesitation you owe me your life anyway i need someone at my back because if its just me theyll try and pick me up at the gates to the launcher last ditch overwhelming numbers okay opportunity glints in your eyes at any point along this journey you may have an opportunity to overpower her she spots the reaction she thinks she has you youll walk me to the launcher then ill hand over the ticket try to double cross me before then and ill fire another one of these nasty little critters into you so its in your best interests to work with me you nod she laughs you realize youre free dont you you werent just physically disabled she saysi scrubbed clean all your systems you understand what that means you test everything she has just said and she is right but when you look down to your wrists she steps back slightly its an unconscious move those still work she says theyre biomechanical nothing that can be scrambled infected or shut down for the briefest flash of a moment youve seen freedom and then you think to yourself there is the matter of the countdown thats firewalled off from the rest of your body and biomech you cant see the countdown but you know its there you dont explain this to her right now she thinks youre in her debt play along ive set you free from them she says you can do anything you want now you nod again okay fair enough ill help you for the ticket can i have my clothes back the smile on her lips fades she sizes you up squinting apparently something satisfies her other side of the bed theyve been washed pressed and folded into a neat pile the astra model cub pistol lies on top of them all its loaded golden like that tantalizing glimpse of freedom shed tried to give you fifteen minutes later youre both out the door youve got the overcoat draped over your right arm youre weak tired and at a disadvantage but all it will take is one wellplaced shot where you can drop behind some cover and shes down susan faces you as she locks the door still wary but there is joy in her face she can see the end of the road its almost sad you walk down a corridor toward a pair of steel doors as sunlight spills into the dimly lit area you scope a vending niche just ahead and to the right a drink machine hums a long low noteall you have to do is slow down just get behind her by one step shoot her and use the machine for cover if she tries to use one of those lethal darts two shadows force their way through the doors at the end of the corridor the guns easy enough to spot you duck and jump to your side susan fires at one of them as you dodge into the niche what puzzles you is the wrenching pain in your shoulder that drops you to the floor in front of the neon glow of the soda machine theyre not aiming at susan that was meant for you your chest is wet with blood and your left arm can hardly move but with your right you feel around the inside of your overcoat as susan falls to the ground unconscious not dead you drape the coat over the good arm to hide the astra and wait its kouroupas that turns the cornerhis wild hair makes a halo around his head bathed and filtered in the light of a flickering fluorescent overhead there is no waiting he looks down at the overcoat hanging over your right arm hesitates for a second and you fire four times in a row blowing a hole in the overcoat that the muzzle sticks through damn it kouropas looks shocked as he slumps to the ground you crawl over to him and lean close there are no last words no apologies or explanations just his creased eyes looking up at the ceiling his flour covered hands holding his bloody stomach and then he stops breathing with some effort you retrieve his gun pocket it with your astra and slump with your back against the soda machine fifteen sodas later you shake susan awake again the first time you tried after plucking the feathered dart out of her neck she just lolled back into unconsciousness your shoulder is packed with a shirt torn off the anonymous dead wouldbe assassin at the far end of the corner youre still seeping blood come on you whisper to her you need to wake up her eyes snap open no she shouts throwing her hands up in front of her you grab her wrists a quick snapping motion and look at her she thinks shes been captured and been taken back to shinnco youre okay youre still here in the lobby you got one of them first i got the other she looks at you then calms youre keyed up your bodys retooling itself parts coming back online shed given you an out a way to leave your body deactivated could have been worked over by any shitty street surgeon there was the slightest chance you could have found a way to be free eventually thanks to her trick now the insulin is surging the blood sugars up and the teenies in your blood scurry around revived and back to business youre back rebooted tiny emergency warnings flash in your vision detailing the damage done to your shoulder it numbs itself and the bleeding clots and stops susan hardly protests as you pick her up off the ground by her wrists with one arm do you still have time to make your launch shes dazed but focuses yeah yeah we need to move gun in hand the other shoved in a pocket so you dont move it you sweep the area ahead nothing stops the two of you in the cab she asks you why you stayed with her you sit there adjusting the bloodied shoulder bandage and avoid her gaze they came at me first you explain im a target now shinnco has spent too much time up in orbit not enough time on the ground you are just ants resources to be used and in their eyes youve turned on them bitten them its easier to eliminate you and find a new worker of your talents than risk something going bad youve seen it before no doubt youll see it again what good is bringing you in if theyre going to shoot me as i try do it you could still have just left me there true you wrap your coat back around you and look up at her i owed you one the cab bumbles on down the road while you both sit in silence for a while then she puts a hand on your knee you rebooted i can fix you again so youre free of all their machines you look down at her hand take too long you have a launch yeah she pulls back away crosses her arms over her chest and looks out the window im sorry dont be you say your trick probably wouldnt have worked anyway and you tell her about the ticking bomb in you the nano flechettes timed to go off unless they get their little code from that contact on the gyro stand we own you motherfucker they aimed at me first you tell her kouroupas came to finish it and theyll get to aim at you again when you have to go back there to the cart in three days or youll be sitting standing somewhere when the bomb goes off youll look normal for a while to bystanders until your body falls down in a shapeless mass shredded from the inside out thats why i rebooted you look out the window now as well watching the terminals approach there isnt much to say after that there are some things you know about memory technology one is that it began here on earth using existing technology superconducting quantum interferometer devices that map specific memory recalls it was pretty much there when the pacification happened with alien technology brought down out of orbit it got nudged along just a little further into maturity two the memories are burned out of your head they arent coming back three the same alien technology that matured memory alteration allows backups four when you figure out how to disable the bomb inside you you will then go out and find that backup if there is no backup there will be payback you walk susan up to the terminal booth several streets behind lay the bodies of more dead shinnco who tried to stop you you stand on neutral ground even shinnco wouldnt piss off the alien launch corporation that owns eleytheria overhead the floors sweep out over the road like wings the architecture is impossible like frank lloyd wright on crack the supports are too small the wings too large its a building designed by something that evolved on a lower gravity world and is forcing their sensibilities onto an earth object the inside of the booth is filled with a light pink gas of some sort its more than bulletproof any hostile action you could take would result in vaporization alien ticket takers dont put up with shit too many earth terrorists tried to take out their aggression on them in retaliation for the pacification the orbital corporations that own the rest of the solar system found it annoying so they put in countermeasures susan scans her ticket in inside the booth tentacles move half of them are plugged into the wall the other half seem to support a globular mass this creature looks like a cyborg octopus its light years from home trying to scrape out a living in a weird world looking out at you with three eyes at the center of its trunk and burbling something clear proceed the speaker orders the security gate to the right of the booth slides aside susan turns to you she slides an extra ticket into the palm of your hand in case it ever works out she says you wonder if the memory of her walking through the security gate or the memory of her hand sliding away from yours could easily be burned out of your head not this time at least several minutes later the capsule thunders out in the great above and the thing in the booth hisses at you wondering what your deal is time to move on you stop at a public access point near the corner of a road the demands you send the shinnco emergency contact points are as follows one negotiator familiar with your case with authority to bargain the cart fully functional in the usual space and youll confirm the cart from a distance making sure it isnt a fake two hours they couldnt get an identical fake with heat generating machinery of the same signature inside in that time or else or else you have time enough to go hunting before the countdown hits the last second youll need a hatchet for starters its a metaphorical high noon theyre not going to back off and neither are you the first sign of weakness is death youre locked in no turning back they set a nice trap the gyro stand is up and what looks to be a middleaged man stands there he isnt putting much into the façade halfheartedly telling interested passersby that hes out of flatbread you spot the three snipers on balconies above two men in doors nearby lounging four pedestrians one by one would take far too long so you steal a bubble cab even the new gyro guy doesnt spot you until you swerve the stolen machine off the road and slam into the cart flour flatbread meat and sauces explode into the air they drip off the door as you swing it up and open using it for cover as you knock the stunned man out with a flick of your wrist and pull him into the car the shots start silent insectlike buzzes and then explosions of concrete the glass windows of the cab explode the seats kick up leather and stuffing in addition to the glass splinters buried in your face the concrete shards ripping your overcoat apart they hit you in the thigh and then again in a foot keep moving you grab the hatchet and smash the cart apart while keeping low and pull out what you need your forearm gets hit bone splitting out of the skin and causing waves of pain and nausea until things inside your body decide the pain is getting in the way of your ability to function the cab can barely hold everything glass bites you in the ass as you sit down and barrel out of there engine smoking tires flopping it lasts long enough to get you deep into an alley the gyro man is coughing blood and dying in the back thanks to a wellaimed shot to the stomach what you really want to do is get to work on him make him forget about that pain and worry about a whole new universe of hurt maybe it will help you forget about yours instead you work on bandaging your own wounds with strips of fabric torn off the overcoat and watch him struggle to stay conscious his eyes dilate mouth drops open i know about your memories he croaks you the negotiator you hadnt expected them to actually put him next to the cart he ignores that moves on you dont have any you never had any he says quickly you came to shinnco looking for ways to reverse the process but you were state of the art recent government surplus useless after the pacification if shinnco didnt claim you some other corporation would so they screwed you over i cant help you you say even if an ambulance got here in time he wouldnt make it back the man closes his eyes and groans the inside of the cab smells of shit from his ruptured stomach his messy hands are both folded over hes almost fetal fuck them he rasps they told me this would be easy that you wouldnt even get to cross the street they fucked you they fuck everyone you watch him at least youre as fucked as me he says eyes still closed its almost a whisper now you dont bother to tell him the truth another long moment passes they have what you did know on a recording you had something stored they have that and do you know what i was you ask he shakes his head then shudders passes out the actual dying will take a while more you slowly shift reach to his head and snap his neck after rummaging around you pull his wallet out a picture of a redhead girlfriend must be you think no ring so what price are you willing to pay for your self is it worth it time heals all wounds in your case it takes about three weeks before you recover fully now youre standing in front of that same booth same alien in the pink gas holding out your ticket you have gotten your photo id and background check faked it warbles behind the security glass name pepper secondary name you pause smith the size of your luggage is unusual it protests it is necessary you insist the remains of the important bits of the gyro stand and some extra devices to shield it from any shinnco attempts to make it call home and make your life miserable it looks at you human the word is unstressed through the speaker but you know the meaning behind it you stare the creature down and wait the goaround takes several minutes but the creature finally tacks on a massive surcharge and lets you through settling into the capsules launch chair the long lines of the launch tube visible through the tiny portholes ahead of you you pull your new overcoat closely around you you wonder if susan can find room for you on her mining ship its a wild nonworld out there one where humans are minorities alien conglomerates ply the worlds and negotiate with primitives like your own people for their gas giants and extra unused planets they trade them for space access advanced technology beads and glass many suspect but not to primitive planets like earth this is your new environment shinnco you can leave behind you reach your hand up and caress the data amulet hanging from your neck it is the memory of a sandy beach your back relaxed against a palm tree the gentle swish of the wind through leaves and water breaking against rocks at the end of the bay soothes you thats it a single memory of a life you once wanted to remember back shinnco put a lot of security around it your past is the past the chair wraps around your waist and comes down your shoulders you are the person you make yourself to be fifteen seconds you are the person you are now the whine of the accelerators reaches a crescendo youre not going to look into the past and what you were three seconds it really isnt important launch the zeppelin conductors society annual gentlemens ball genevieve valentine so hook yourself up to an airship strap on your mask and your knife for the wide open skies are acalling and oh its a glorious life conductors recruitment advertisement the balloon of a phoenixclass airship is better than any view from its cabin windows half a mile of silk pulled taut across three hundred metal ribs and a hundred gleaming spines is a beautiful thing if your mask filter is dirty you get lightheaded and your sight goes reddish so it looks as though the balloon is falling in love with you when that happens though you tap someone to let them know and you go to the backcabin underneath and fix your mask if youve any brains at all if youre heliumdrunk enough to see red soon youll be hallucinating and too weak to move and even if they get you out before you die youll still spend the rest of your life at a hospital with all the regulars staring at you thats no life for an airship man i remember back when the masks were metal and youd freeze in the winter end up with layers of skin that peeled off like wet socks when you went landside and took the mask off the polymer rubbers are much cleverer ive been a conductor for ages i was conducting on the majesty in when it was still the biggest ship in the skyyou laugh but back then people would show up by the hundreds just to watch it fly out of dock she only had four gills but she could cut through the air better than a lot of the sixfins the laconia too they put the majesty in a museum already i heard strange to be so old and not feel it at least the helium keeps us young for all it turns us spindly and cold god when we realized what was happening to us but they had warned us i suppose and its fathoms better now then it was back then the regulars called you a monster if they saw you on the street the coins not bad either compared to factory work they say its terrible what you end up like but if you work the air you get pulled like taffy and if you work in the factory you go deaf as a post its always something im saving a bit for myself for when im finished with this life enough for a little house in the alps i need some altitude if im going to be landlocked the airs too heavy down here the very first ships were no better than hotair balloons and the conductors kept a tiny cabin and had to string themselves outside on cables if something happened i cant imagine ituseless i didnt join up until after they moved conductors insideit showed they had a lick of sense to put conductors where they could get to things that went wrong and im not fond of looking down from heights the engineshop shifted to airships as soon as they caught on and i made two thousand ribs before i ever set foot inside a balloon it makes for a certain confidence going in which carried me through thank goodnessi had a hard time with it at first you have to be careful how deeply you breathe so the oxygen filter doesnt freeze up on you and you have to make sure your air tube doesnt get tangled on your tether or your tether in someone elses you have to learn how to fling yourself along so that the tether ring slides with you along the spine and how to hook your fingers quickly into the little holes in the ribs when you have to climb down you have to learn to deal with the cold the sign language i picked up at once we had that at the factory too signals for when we were too far apart or when it was too loud im fond of it you get used to talking through the masks and theyre all good men in the air but sometimes its nice just to keep the quiet captain carter was very kind those first few months he was the only captain ive ever had who would make trips into the balloon from the underneath just to see how we were getting along back then we were all in it together all still learning how to handle these beautiful birds captains now can hardly be bothered to leave their bridges but not carter carter knew how to tighten a bolt as fast as any airship man and hed float through and shake hands whenever wed done something well he had a way of speaking about the majesty like a poem sometimesa clever man ive tried to speak as he did but theres not much use for language when were just bottled up with one another once or twice ive seen something sharply the way he might have seen itjust once or twice you wont see his like again he was of the old kind he understood what it meant to love the sky like i do a patient in the profession of zeppelin conducting has after very few years of work advanced heliosis due to excessive and prolonged exposure to helium within the balloon of an airship his limbs have grown in length and decreased in musculature making it difficult for him to comfortably maneuver on the ground for long periods of time mild exercise concurrent with the wearing of an oxygen mask to prevent hyperventilation alleviates the symptoms in time but has no lasting effect without regular application which is difficult for conductors to maintain while employed in their vessels other side effects are phrenological skin tightens around the skull patient has noticeable growth in those parts of the head dedicated to concentrativeness combativeness locality and constructiveness the areas of amativeness form and cautiousness are smaller than normal though it is hard to say if these personality defects are the work of prolonged wearing of conductors masks or the temperament of the patient i suspect that in this case time will have to reveal what is yet unknown the zeppelin is without doubt mans greatest invention and the brave men who labor in its depths are indispensable but it behooves us to remember the story of icarus and daedalus he should proceed wisely who would proceed well from doctor jonathan grants address to the health council april the captains union set up the first society for us in london and a year later in paris they werent much more comfortable than the hospital rooms where they used to keep us landside for safety but of course it was more dignified soon we managed to organize ourselves and put together the zeppelin conductors society and we tithed our own wages for the dues to fix the buildings up a bit now you can fly to any city with an airdock and know theres a place for you to sleep where no one will look at you sidelong you can get a private room even with a bath in the middle big enough to hold you its horrid how long your limbs get when youre in helium nine days in ten and theres not much dignity in trying to wash with your legs sticking two feet out of the bath and its good sense to have a place you can go straight away regulars dont like to see you wandering about sometimes most times i understand what to do when you see a conductor do not panic he is probably as wary of you as you are of him he will pose no threat if not provoked do not stare scrutiny is vulgar offer a small nod when you pass as you would to another gentlemen it pleases them avoid smaller streets between airship docks and the local conductors society the conductor is in general a docile creature but one can never be sure what effects the helium has had on his temperament public safety poster january parispolaris was eclipsed last night not by any cosmic rival but by a manmade beauty the laconia a phoenixclass feat of british engineering that has become the envy of the world never looked more beautiful than on its evening flight to paris as we began a momentous new year captain richard marks looking every inch the matinee hero guided the ship safely through the night as the passengers within lit up the sky with conversation and music accompanied by a champagne buffet miss marie dawlish the english lark honored the company with a song which it is suspected struck the heart of a certain airship captain who stepped away from the bridge in time for the performance though we at the daily are not prognosticators we believe that the coming year may be one of high romance for captain marks who touched down back in london with a gentle landing and no doubt a song in his heart the societies have the balls each year for new years which is great fun its ripping good food and sometimes someone comes in a full evening suit and we can all have a laugh at them its an expensive round of tailoring to wear just once a year you know just by looking that they who dressed up had wanted to be captains and fallen short poor boys i wouldnt be a captain for all the gold in araby though perhaps when youre young you dont realize how proud and empty the captains end up you dont meet a lot of ladies in the air of course and its what all the lads miss most for the london ball they always manage to find some with the money from the duessweet girls who dont mind a chat they have to be all right with sitting and talking the annual gentlemens ball isnt much of a dance the new conductors the ones who have only stretched the first few inches try a dance or two early on to give the musicians something to do the rest of us have given in to gravity when were trapped on the ground we catch up with old mates and wait for a chance to ask a girl upstairs if were brave enough sometimes we even get conductors in from other placesrussia sometimes or once from china god that was a night what strange ideas they have about navigation but he was built like an airship man and from the red skin round his eyes we could tell hed paid his dues in the helium so we poured him some scotch and made him welcome if we arent kind to each other who will be kind to us

starsaim always for orion orion airship supply catalog we were airside the last night of the night of the gentlemens ball we had been through a bad wind that day and all of us were spread out tightening rivets on the ribs signaling quietly back and forth i dont know what made anderson agree to sign us on for the evening flighthe must have wanted the ball as much as the rest of usand i was in a bit of a sulk feeling like cinderella it was a cold night cold even in the balloon and i was wishing for nothing but a long bath and a long sleep then captain marks shoved the woman into the balloon she was wearing a wornout orange dress and a wornout shawl that fell away from her at once and even as the captain clipped her to the line she hung limp wornout all over hed been at her for a while i still dont know where he found her what they did to her what she thought in the first moments as they carried her towards the balloon got some leftovers for you the captain shouted through his mask a little gentlemens ball for you brave boys enjoy then he was gone spinning the lock shut behind him closing us in with her i could feel the others hooking onto a rib or a spine pushing off hurrying over the men in the aft might not have even seen it happen i never asked them didnt want to know i was closest to her fifty feet maybe through the mask i could see the buttons missing on the front of her dress the little cuts in her fisted hands she wore a mask too her hair was tangled in it she was terrifiedshaking so hard that i worried her mask would come loosebut she didnt scrabble at her belt too clever for that i suppose i was worried for herif you werent used to the helium it was painful to breathe for very long she needed to get back underneath god only knew how long that secondrate mask would hold even as anderson hooked onto a spine to get to her she was shoving offnot to the locked porthole there was no hope for her there but straight out to the ribs clawing at the stiff silk of the balloon we all scrambled for her i dont know how she cut the silkbristol said it must have been a knife but i cant imagine they would have let her keep one i think she must have used the hook of her little earring which is the worst of it somehow the balloon shuddered as the first rush of helium was sucked into the sky outside she clenched one fist around the raw edge of the silk as she unhooked herself from the tether the air caught her dragging at her feet and she grasped for purchase against the fabric she cried out but the mask swallowed the noise i was the closest i pushed off the other conductors were shouting for her not to be foolish they shouted that it was a misunderstanding that she would be all right with us as i came closer i held out my hands to her so she could take hold but she shrank back kicking at me with one foot the boot halffastened my reflection was distorted in the round eyes of her maska spindly monster enveloping her in the halfdark my endless arms struggling to pull her back in what else could she do she let go my sight lit up from the rush of oxygen and in my view she was a flaming june in a bottlegreen night falling with her arms outstretched like a bird until she was too small to be seen until every bright trace of her was gone for a moment no one moved then the rails shuddered under us as the gills fanned out and we slowed anderson said were coming up on paris someone should tell them about the tear said bristol patch it from here anderson said well wait until vienna in vienna they assumed all conductors were lunatics and they would ask no questions about a tear that only human hands could make i heard the first clangs of the anchorhooks latching onto the outer hull of the underneath before the church bells rang in the new year beneath us the passengers shouted hip hip hurrah hip hip hurrah that was a sad year once i was landbound in dover the conductors society there is so small i dont think ten men could fit in it it wasnt a bad city i had no trouble with the regulars on my way from the dock but it was so horribly hot and cramped that i went outside just to have enough room to stretch out my arms even heavy as they were with the earth pulling at them a falconclass passed overhead and i looked up just as it crossed the harvest moon for a moment the balloon was illuminated orange and i could see the conductors skittering about inside of it like spiders or shadow puppets like moths in a lamp i watched it until it had passed the moon and fallen dark again the lamp extinguished its a glorious life they say for a single yesterday george r r martin keith was our culture what little we had left he was our poet and our troubadour and his voice and his guitar were our bridges to the past he was a timetripper too but no one minded that much until winters came along keith was our memory but he was also my friend he played for us every evening after supper just beyond sight of the common house there was a small clearing and a rock he liked to sit on hed wander there at dusk with his guitar and sit down facing west always west the cities had been east of us far east true but keith didnt like to look that way neither did the rest of us to tell the truth not everybody came to the evening concerts but there was always a good crowd say threefourths of the people in the commune wed gather around in a rough circle sitting on the ground or lying in the grass by ones and twos and keith our living hifi in denim and leather would stroke his beard in vague amusement and begin to play he was good too back in the old days before the blast hed been well on his way to making a name for himself hed come to the commune four years ago for a rest to check up on old friends and get away from the musical rat race for a summer but hed figured on returning then came the blast and keith had stayed there was nothing left to go back to his cities were graveyards full of dead and dying their towers melted tombstones that glowed at night and the ratshuman and animalwere everywhere else in keith those cities still lived his songs were all of the old days bittersweet things full of lost dreams and loneliness and he sang them with love and longing keith would play requests but mostly he stuck to his kind of music a lot of folk a lot of folkrock and a few straight rock things and show tunes lightfoot and kristofferson and woody guthrie were particular favorites and once in a while hed play his own compositions written in the days before the blast but not often two songs though he played every night he always started with they call the wind maria and ended with me and bobby mcgee a few of us got tired of the ritual but no one ever objected keith seemed to think the songs fit us somehow and nobody wanted to argue with him until winters came along that is which was in a latefall evening in the fourth year after the blast his first name was robert but no one ever used it although the rest of us were all on a first name basis hed introduced himself as lieutenant robert winters the evening he arrived driving up in a jeep with two other men but his army didnt exist anymore and he was looking for refuge and help that first meeting was tense i remember feeling very scared when i heard the jeep coming and wiping my palms on my jeans as i waited wed had visitors before none of them very nice i waited for them alone i was as much a leader as we had in those days and that wasnt much we voted on everything important and nobody gave orders so i wasnt really a boss but i was a greeting committee the rest scattered which was good sense our last visitors had gone in big for slugging people and raping the girls theyd worn blackandgold uniforms and called themselves the sons of the blast a fancy name for a rat pack we called them sobs too but for other reasons winters was different though his uniform was the good ol us of a which didnt prove a thing since some army detachments are as bad as the rat packs it was our own friendly army that went through the area in the first year after the blast scorching the towns and killing everyone they could lay their hands on i dont think winters was part of that although i never had the courage to flatout ask him he was too decent he was big and blond and straight and about the same age as the rest of us and his two men were scared kids younger than most of us in the commune theyd been through a lot and they wanted to join us winters kept saying that he wanted to help us rebuild we voted them in of course we havent turned anyone away yet except for a few rats in the first year we even took in a halfdozen citymen and nursed them while they died of radiation burns winters changed us though in ways we never anticipated maybe for the better who knows he brought books and supplies and guns too and two men who knew how to use them a lot of the guys on the commune had come there to get away from guns and uniforms in the days before the blast so pete and crazy harry took over the hunting and defended us against the rats that drifted by from time to time they became our police force and our army and winters became our leader im still not sure how that happened but it did he started out making suggestions moved on to leading discussions and wound up giving orders nobody objected much wed been drifting ever since the blast and winters gave us a direction he had big ideas too when i was spokesman all i worried about was getting us through until tomorrow but winters wanted to rebuild he wanted to build a generator and hunt for more survivors and gather them together into a sort of village planning was his bag he had big dreams for the day after tomorrow and his hope was catching i shouldnt give the wrong impression though he wasnt any sort of a tin tyrant he led us yeah but he was one of us too he was a little different from us but not that different and he became a friend in time and he did his part to fit in he even let his hair get long and grew a beard only keith never liked him much winters didnt come out to concert rock until hed been with us over a week and when he did come he stood outside the circle at first his hands shoved into his pockets the rest of us were lying around as usual some singing some just listening it was a bit chilly that night and we had a small fire going winters stood in the shadows for about three songs then during a pause he walked closer to the fire do you take requests he asked smiling uncertainly i didnt know winters very well back then but i knew keith and i tensed a little as i waited for his answer but he just strummed the guitar idly and stared at winters uniform and his short hair that depends he said at last im not going to play ballad of the green berets if thats what you want an unreadable expression flickered over winters face ive killed people yes he said but that doesnt mean im proud of it i wasnt going to ask for that keith considered that and looked down at his guitar then seemingly satisfied he nodded and raised his head and smiled okay he said what do you want to hear you know leavin on a jet plane winters asked the smile grew yeah john denver ill play it for you sad song though there arent any jet planes anymore lieutenant know that s true you should stop and think why he smiled again and began to play keith always had the last word when he wanted it nobody could argue with his guitar a little over a mile from the common house beyond the fields to the west a little creek ran through the hills and the trees it was usually dry in the summer and the fall but it was still a nice spot dark and quiet at night away from the noise and the people when the weather was right keith would drag his sleeping bag out there and bunk down under a tree alone thats also where he did his timetripping i found him there that night after the singing was over and everyone else had gone to bed he was leaning against his favorite tree swatting mosquitoes and studying the creekbed i sat down next to him hi gary he said without looking at me bad times keith i asked bad times gary he said staring at the ground and idly twirling a fallen leaf i watched his face his mouth was taut and expressionless his eyes hooded id known keith for a long time i knew enough not to say anything i just sat next to him in silence making myself comfortable in a pile of freshfallen leaves and after a while he began to talk as he always did there ought to be water he said suddenly nodding at the creek when i was a kid i lived by a river right across the street oh it was a dirty little river in a dirty little town and the water was as polluted as all hell but it was still water sometimes at night id go over to the park across the street and sit on a bench and watch it for hours sometimes my mother used to get mad at me he laughed softly it was pretty you know even the oil slicks were pretty and it helped me think i miss that you know the water i always think better when im watching water strange right not so strange i said he still hadnt looked at me he was still staring at the dry creek where only darkness flowed now and his hands were tearing the leaf into pieces slow and methodical they were gone now he said after a silence the place was too close to new york the water probably glows now if there is any water prettier than ever but i cant go back so much is like that every time i remember something i have to remember that its gone now and i cant go back ever to anything except except with that he nodded toward the ground between us then he finished with the leaf and started another i reached down by his leg the cigar box was where i expected it i held it in both hands and flipped the lid with my thumbs inside there was the needle and maybe a dozen small bags of powder the powder looked white in the starlight but seen by day it was pale sparkling blue i looked at it and sighed not much left i said keith nodded never looking ill be out in a month i figure his voice sounded very tired then ill just have my songs and my memories thats all youve got now i said i closed the box with a snap and handed it to him chronine isnt a time machine keith just a hallucinogen that happens to work on memory he laughed they used to debate that way back when the experts all said chronine was a memory drug but they never took chronine neither have you gary but i know ive timetripped its not memory its more you go back gary you really do you live it again whatever it was you cant change anything but you know its real all the same he threw away what was left of his leaf and gathered his knees together with his arms then he put his head atop them and looked at me you ought to timetrip someday gary you really ought to get the dosage right and you can pick your yesterday its not a bad deal at all i shook my head if i wanted to timetrip would you let me no he said smiling but not moving his head i found the chronine its mine and theres too little left to share sorry gary nothing personal though you know how it is yeah i said i know how it is i didnt want it anyway i knew that he said ten minutes of thick silence i broke it with a question winters bother you not really he said he seems okay it was just the uniforms gary if it wasnt for those damn bastards in uniform and what they did i could go back to my river and my singing and sandi i said his mouth twisted into a reluctant smile and sandi he admitted and i wouldnt even need chronine to keep my dates i didnt know what to say to that so i didnt say anything finally wearying keith slid forward a little and lay back under the tree it was a clear night you could see the stars through the branches sometimes out here at night i forget he said softly more to himself than to me the sky still looks the same as it did before the blast and the stars dont know the difference if i dont look east i can almost pretend it never happened i shook my head keith thats a game it did happen you cant forget that you know you cant and you cant go back you know that too you dont listen do you gary i do go back i really do you go back to a dream world keith and its dead that world you cant keep it up sooner or later youre going to have to start living in reality keith was still looking up at the sky but he smiled gently as i argued no gary you dont see the past is as real as the present you know and when the present is bleak and empty and the future more so then the only sanity is living in the past i started to say something but he pretended not to hear back in the city when i was a kid i never saw this many stars he said his voice distant the first time i got into the country i remember how shocked i was at all the extra stars theyd gone and stuck in my sky he laughed softly know when that was six years ago when i was just out of school also last night take your pick sandi was with me both times he fell silent i watched him for a few moments then stood up and brushed myself off it was never any use i couldnt convince him and the saddest part of it was i couldnt even convince myself maybe he was right maybe for him that was the answer you ever been in the mountains he asked suddenly he looked up at me quickly but didnt wait for an answer there was this night garyin pennsylvania in the mountains i had this old beatup camper and we were driving through bumming it around the country then all of a sudden this fog hit us thick stuff gray and rolling all kind of mysterious and spooky sandi loved stuff like that and i did too kind of but it was hell to drive through so i pulled off the road and we took out a couple of blankets and went off a few feet it was still early though so we just lay on the blankets together and held each other and talked about us and my songs and that great fog and our trip and her acting and all sorts of things we kept laughing and kissing too although i dont remember what we said that was so funny finally after an hour or so we undressed each other and made love on the blankets slow and easy in the middle of that dumb fog keith propped himself up on an elbow and looked at me his voice was bruised lost hurt eager and lonely she was beautiful gary she really was she never liked me to say that though i dont think she believed it she liked me to tell her she was pretty but she was more than pretty she was beautiful all warm and soft and golden with redblond hair and these dumb eyes that were either green or gray depending on her mood that night they were gray i think to match the fog he smiled and sank back and looked up at the stars again the funniest thing was the fog he said very slowly when wed finished making love and we lay back together the fog was gone and the stars were out as bright as tonight the stars came out for us the silly goddamn voyeuristic stars came out to watch us make it and i told her that and we laughed and i held her warm against me and she went to sleep in my arms while i lay there and looked at stars and tried to write a song for her keith tarted gary he said im going back there tonight to the fog and the stars and my sandi damnit keith i said stop it youre getting yourself hooked keith sat up again and began unbuttoning his sleeve did you ever think he said that maybe its not the drug that im addicted to and he smiled very broadly like a cocky eager kid then he reached for his box and his timetrip leave me alone he said that must have been a good trip keith was all smiles and affability the next day and his glow infected the rest of us the mood lasted all week work seemed to go faster and easier than usual and the nightly song sessions were as boisterous as i can remember them there was a lot of laughter and maybe more honest hope than wed had for quite a while i shouldnt give keith all the credit though winters was already well into his suggestionmaking period and things were happening around the commune to begin with he and pete were already hard at work building another housea cabin off to the side of the common house pete had hooked up with one of the girls and i guess he wanted a little more privacy but winters saw it as the first step toward the village he envisioned that wasnt his only project either he had a whole sheaf of maps in his jeep and every night hed drag someone off to the side and pore over them by candlelight asking all sorts of questions he wanted to know which areas wed searched for survivors and which towns might be worth looting for supplies and where the rat packs liked to run and that sort of thing why well he had some search expeditions in mind he said there was a handful of kids on the commune and winters thought we ought to organize a school for them to replace the informal tutoring theyd been getting then he thought we ought to build a generator and get the electricity going again our medical resources were limited to a good supply of drugs and medicines winters thought that one of us should quit the fields permanently and train himself as a village doctor yeah winters had a lot of ideas all right and a good portion of em were pretty good although it was clear that the details were going to require some working out meanwhile winters had also become a regular at the evening singing with keith in a good mood that didnt pose any real problems in fact it livened things up a little the second night that winters came keith looked at him very pointedly and swung into vietnam rag with the rest of us joining in then he followed it up with universal solider in between lyrics he kept flashing winters this taunting grin winters took it pretty well however he squirmed and looked uncomfortable at first but finally entered into the spirit of the thing and began to smile then when keith finished he stood up if youre so determined to cast me as the communes very own friendly reactionary well i guess ill have to oblige he said he reached out a hand give me that guitar keith looked curious but willing he obliged winters grabbed the instrument strummed it a few times uncertainly and launched into a robust version of okie from muskogee he played like his fingers were made of stone and sang worse but that wasnt the point keith began laughing before winters was three bars into the song the rest of us followed suit winters looking very grim and determined plowed on through to the bitter end even though he didnt know all the words and had to fake it in spots then he did the marine hymn for an encore ignoring all the hissing and moaning when he was finished pete clapped loudly winters bowed smiled and handed the guitar back to keith with an exaggerated flourish keith of course was not one to be topped easily he nodded at winters took the guitar and promptly did eve of destruction winters retaliated with welfare cadillac or tried to turned out he knew hardly any of the words so he finally gave that up and settled for anchors aweigh that sort of thing went on all night as they jousted back and forth and everybody else sat around laughing well actually we did more than laugh generally we had to help winters with his songs since he didnt really know any of them all the way through keith held his own without us of course it was one of the more memorable sessions the only thing it really had in common with keiths usual concerts was that it began with they call the wind maria and ended with me and bobby mcgee but the next day keith was more subdued still some kidding around between him and winters but mostly the singing slipped back into the older pattern and the day after the songs were nearly all keiths kind of stuff except for a few requests from winters which keith did weakly and halfheartedly i doubt that winters realized what was happening but i did and so did most of the others wed seen it before keith was getting down again the afterglow from his latest timetrip was fading he was getting lonely and hungry and restless he was itching yet again for his sandi sometimes when he got that way you could almost see the hurt and if you couldnt see it you could hear it when he sang loud and throbbing in every note winters heard it too hed have had to be deaf to miss it only i dont think he understood what he heard and i know he didnt understand keith all he knew was the anguish he heard and it troubled him so being winters he decided to do something about it he came to keith i was there at the time it was midmorning and keith and i had come in from the field for a break i was sitting on the well with a cup of water in my hand and keith was standing next to me talking you could tell that he was getting ready to timetrip again soon he was very down very distant and i was having trouble reaching him in the middle of all this winters comes striding up smiling in his army jacket his house was rising quickly and he was cheerful about it and he and crazy harry had already mapped out the first of their search expeditions hello men he said when he joined us at the well he reached for the water and i passed my cup he took a deep drink and passed it back then he looked at keith i enjoy your singing he said i think everybody else does too youre very good really he grinned even if you are an anarchistic bastard keith nodded yeah thanks he said he was in no mood for fooling around one thing though has been bothering me winters said i figured maybe i could discuss it with you maybe make a few suggestions okay keith stroked his beard and paid a little more attention okay shoot colonel its your songs ive noticed that most of them are pretty down lets say good songs sure but sort of depressing if you know what i mean especially in view of the blast you sing too much about the old days and things weve lost i dont think thats good for morale weve got to stop dwelling so much on the past if were ever going to rebuild keith stared at him and slumped against the well you gotta be kidding he said no said winters no i mean it a few cheerful songs would do a lot for us life can still be good and worthwhile if we work at it you should tell us that in your music concentrate on the things we still have we need hope and courage give them to us but keith wasnt buying it he stroked his beard and smiled and finally shook his head no lieutenant no way it doesnt work like that i dont sing propaganda even if its wellmeant i sing what i feel his voice was baffled cheerful songs well no i cant they dont work not for me id like to believe it but i cant you see and i cant make other people believe if i dont life is pretty empty around here the way i see it and not too likely to improve and well as long as i see it that way ive got to sing it that way you see winters frowned things arent that hopeless he said and even if they were we cant admit it or were finished keith looked at winters at me then down into the well he shook his head again and straightened no he said simply gently sadly and he left us at the well to stalk silently in the fields winters watched him go then turned to me i offered him more water but he shook his head what do you think gary he said did i have a point or did i i considered the question and the asker winters sounded very troubled and very sincere and the blond stubble on his chin made it clear that he was trying his best to fit in i decided to trust him a little yes i said i know what you were driving at but its not that easy keiths songs arent just songs they mean things to him i hesitated then continued look the blast was hell for everybody i dont have to tell you that but most of us out here we chose this kind of life cause we wanted to get away from the cities and what they stood for we miss the old days sure weve lost people and things we valued and a lot that made life joyful and we dont much care for the constant struggle or for having to live in fear of the rat packs still a lot of what we valued is right here on the commune and it hasnt changed that much weve got the land and the trees and each other and freedom of a sort no pollution no competition no hatred we like to remember the old days and the good things in the citiesthats why we like keiths singingbut now has its satisfactions too only keith is different he didnt choose this way he was only visiting his dreams were all tied up with the cities with poetry and music and people and noise and hes lost his world everything he did and wanted to do is gone and and well there was this girl sandra but he called her sandi she and keith lived together for two years traveled together did everything together they only split for a summer so she could go back to college then they were going to join up again you understand winters understood and then the blast and then the blast keith was here in the middle of nowhere sandi was in new york city so he lost her too i think sometimes that if sandi had been with him hed have gotten over the rest she was the most important part of the world he lost the world they shared together with her here they could have shared a new world and found new beauties and new songs to sing but she wasnt here and i shrugged yeah said winters solemnly but its been four years gary i lost a lot too including my wife but i got over it sooner or later mourning has to stop yes i said for you and for me i havent lost that much and you you think that things will be good again keith doesnt maybe things were too good for him in the old days or maybe hes just too romantic for his own good or maybe he loved harder than we did all i know is that his dream tomorrow is like his yesterday and mine isnt ive never found anything i could be that happy with keith did or thinks he did same difference he wants it back i drank some more water and rose ive got to get back to work i said quickly before winters could continue the conversation but i was thoughtful as i walked back to the fields there was of course one thing i hadnt told winters one important thing the timetripping maybe if keith was forced to settle for the life he had hed come out of it like the rest of us had done but keith had an option keith could go back keith still had his sandi so he didnt have to start over again that i thought explained a lot maybe i should have mentioned it to winters maybe winters skipped the singing that night he and crazy harry were set to leave the next morning to go searching to the west they were off somewhere stocking their jeep and making plans keith didnt miss them any he sat on his rock warmed by a pile of burning autumn leaves and outsung the bitter wind that had started to blow he played hard and loud and sang sad and after the fire went out and the audience drifted off he took his guitar and his cigar box and went off toward the creek i followed him this time the night was black and cloudy with the smell of rain in the air and the wind was strong and cold no it didnt sound like people dying but it moved through the trees and shook the branches and whipped away the leaves and it sounded restless when i reached the creek keith was already rolling up his sleeve i stopped him before he took his needle out hey keith i said laying a hand on his arm easy talk first okay he looked at my hand and his needle and returned a reluctant nod okay gary he said but short im in a rush i havent seen sandi for a week i let go his arm and sat down i know i was trying to make it last gar i only had a months worth but i figured i could make it last longer if i only timetripped once a week he smiled but thats hard i know i repeated but it would be easier if you didnt think about her so much he nodded put down the box and pulled his denim jacket a little tighter to shut out the wind i think too much he agreed then smiling he added such men are dangerous ummm yeah to themselves mostly i looked at him cold and huddled in the darkness keith what will you do when you run out i wish i knew i know i said then youll forget your time machine will be broken and youll have to live today find somebody else and start again only it might be easier if youd start now put away the chronine for a while fight it sing cheerful songs he asked sarcastically maybe not i dont ask you to wipe out the past or pretend it didnt happen but try to find something in the present you know it cant be as empty as you pretend things arent black and white like that winters was part right you knowthere are still good things you forget that do i what do i forget i hesitated he was making it hard for me well you still enjoy your singing you know that and there could be other things you used to enjoy writing your own stuff why dont you work on some new songs you havent written anything to speak of since the blast keith had picked up a handful of leaves and was offering them to the wind one by one ive thought of that you dont know how much ive thought of that gary and ive tried but nothing comes his voice went soft right then in the old days it was different and you know why sandi would sit out in the audience every time i sang and when i did something new something of mine i could see her brighten if it was good id know it just from the way she smiled she was proud of me and my songs he shook his head doesnt work now gary i write a song now and sing it and so what who cares you yeah maybe you and a few of the others come up after and say hey keith i liked that but thats not the same my songs were important to sandi the same way her acting was important to me and now my songs arent important to anyone i tell myself that shouldnt matter i should get my own satisfaction from composing even if no one else does i tell myself that a lot but saying it doesnt make it so sometimes i think right then i should have told keith that his songs were the most important thing in the world to me but hell they werent and keith was a friend and i couldnt feed him lies even if he needed them besides he wouldnt have believed me keith had a way of recognizing truth instead i floundered keith you could find someone like that again if you tried there are girls in the commune girls as good as sandi if youd open yourself up to them you could find someone else keith gave me a calm stare more chilling than the wind i dont need someone else gary he said he picked up the cigar box opened it and showed me the needle ive got sandi twice more that week keith timetripped and both times he rushed off with a feverish urgency usually hed wait an hour or so after the singing and discreetly drift off to his creek but now he brought the cigar box with him and left even before the last notes of me and bobby mcgee had faded from the air nobody mentioned anything of course we all knew keith was timetripping and we all knew he was running out so we forgave him and understood everybody understood that is except pete winters former corporal he like winters and crazy harry hadnt been filled in yet but one evening at the singing i noticed him looking curiously at the cigar box that lay by keiths feet he said something to jan the girl hed been sleeping with and she said something back so i figured hed been briefed i was too right winters and crazy harry returned a week to the day after their departure they were not alone they brought three young teenagers a guy and two girls whom theyd found down west in company with a group of rats in company is a euphemism of course the kids had been slaves winters and crazy had freed them i didnt ask what had happened to the rats i could guess there was a lot of excitement that night and the night after the kids were a little frightened of us and it took a lot of attention to convince them that things would be different here winters decided that they should have their own place and he and pete began planning a second new cabin the first one was nearing its crude completion as it turned out winters and pete were talking about more than a cabin i should have realized that since i caught winters looking at keith very curiously and thoughtfully on at least two occasions but i didnt realize it like everyone else i was busy getting to know the newcomers and trying to make them feel at ease it wasnt simple that so i didnt know what was going on until the fourth evening after winters return i was outside listening to keith sing hed just barely finished they call the wind maria and was about to swing into a second song when a group of people suddenly walked into the circle winters led them and crazy harry was just behind him with the three kids and pete was there with his arm around jan plus a few others who hadnt been at the concert when it started but had followed winters from the common house keith figured they wanted to listen i guess he began to play but winters stopped him no keith he said not right now weve got business to take care of now while everybodys together were going to talk tonight keiths fingers stopped and the music faded the only sounds were the wind and the crackle of the nearby burning leaves everyone was looking at winters i want to talk about timetripping winters said keith put down his guitar and glanced at the cigar box at the base of concert rock talk he said winters looked around the circle studying the impassive faces as if he was weighing them before speaking i looked too ive been told that the commune has a supply of chronine winters began and that you use it for timetripping is that true keith keith stroked his beard as he did when he was nervous or thoughtful yeah he said and thats the only use thats ever been made of this chronine winters said his supporters had gathered behind him in what seemed like a phalanx i stood up i didnt feel comfortable arguing from the ground keith was the first one to find the chronine i said we were going through the town hospital after the army had gotten through with it a few drugs were all that were left most of them are in the commune stores in case we need them but keith wanted the chronine so we gave it to him all of us nobody else cared much winters nodded i understand that he said very reasonably im not criticizing that decision perhaps you didnt realize however that there are other uses or chronine besides timetripping he paused listen and try to judge me fairly thats all i ask he said looking at each of us in turn chronine is a powerful drug its an important resource and we need all our resources right now and timetrippinganyones timetrippingis an abuse of the drug not what it was intended for that was a mistake on winters part lectures on drug abuse werent likely to go over big in the commune i could feel the people around me getting uptight rick a tall thin guy with a goatee who came to the concerts every night took a poke at winters from the ground bullshit he said chronines time travel colonel meant to be used for tripping right someone else said and we gave it to keith i dont want to timetrip but he does so whats wrong with it winters defused the hostility quickly nothing he said if we had an unlimited supply of chronine but we dont do we keith no keith said quietly just a little left the fire was reflected in winters eyes when he looked at keith it made it difficult to read his expression but his voice sounded heavy keith i know what those time trips mean to you and i dont want to hurt you really i dont but we need that chronine all of us how that was me i wanted keith to give up chronine but id be damned before id let it be taken from him how do we need the chronine chronine is not a time machine winters said it is a memory drug and there are things we must remember he glanced around the circle is there anyone here who ever worked in a hospital an orderly a candystriper never mind there might be in a group this size and theyd have seen things somewhere in the back of their skulls theyd know things we need to know ill bet some of you took shop in high school ill bet you learned all sorts of useful things but how much do you remember with chronine you could remember it all we might have someone here who once learned to make arrows we might have a tanner we might have someone who knows how to build a generator we might have a doctor winters paused and let that sink in around the circle people shifted uneasily and began to mutter finally winters continued if we found a library we wouldnt burn the books for heat no matter how cold it got but were doing the same thing when we let keith timetrip were a libraryall of us here we have books in our heads and the only way to read those books is with chronine we should use it to help us remember the things we must know we should hoard it like a treasure calculate every recall session carefully and make suremake absolutely surethat we dont waste a grain of it then he stopped a long long silence followed for keith an endless one finally rick spoke again i never thought of that he said reluctantly maybe you have something my father was a doctor if that means anything then another voice and another then a chorus of people speaking at once throwing up halfremembered experiences that might be valuable might be useful winters had struck paydirt he wasnt smiling though he was looking at me i wouldnt meet his eyes i couldnt he had a pointan awful awful point but i couldnt admit that i couldnt look at him and nod my surrender keith was my friend and i had to stand by him and of all of us in the circle i was the only one standing but i couldnt think of anything to say finally winters eyes moved he looked at concert rock keith sat there looking at the cigar box the hubbub went on for at least five minutes but at last it died of its own weight one by one the speakers glanced at keith and remembered and dropped off into awkward silence when the hush was complete keith rose and looked around like a man coming out of a bad dream no he said his voice was hurt and disbelieving his eyes moved from person to person you cant i dont dont waste chronine you know that all of you i visit sandi and thats not wasting i need sandi and shes gone i have to go back its my only way my time machine he shook his head my turn yes i said as forcefully as i could manage keiths right waste is a matter of definition if you ask me the biggest waste would be sending people back to sleep through college lectures a second time laughter then other voices backed me im with gary somebody said keith needs sandi and we need keith its simple i say he keeps the chronine no way someone else objected im as compassionate as anyone but hellhow many of our people have died over the last few years cause weve bungled it when they needed doctoring you remember doug two years ago you shouldnt need chronine for that a bad appendix and he dies we butchered him when we tried to cut it out if theres a chance to prevent that from happening againeven a long shoti say we gotta take it no guarantee it wont happen anyway the earlier voice came back you have to hit the right memories to accomplish anything and even they may not be as useful as youd like shit we have to try i think we have an obligation to keith i think keiths got an obligation to us and suddenly everybody was arguing again hassling back and forth while winters and keith and i stood and listened it went on and on back and forth over the same points until pete spoke he stepped around winters holding jan ive heard enough of this he said i dont even think we got no argument jan here is gonna have my kid she tells me well damnit im not going to take any chances on her or the kid dying if theres a way we can learn something thatll make it safer we take it especially im not gonna take no chances for a goddamn weakling who cant face up to life hell keithie here wasnt the only one hurt so how does he rate i lost a chick in the blast too but im not begging for chronine to dream her up again i got a new chick instead and thats what you better do keith keith stood very still but his fists were balled at his sides there are differences pete he said slowly big ones my sandi was no chick for one thing and i loved her maybe more than you can ever understand i know you dont understand pain pete youve hardened yourself to it like a lot of people by pretending that it doesnt exist so you convinced everybody youre a tough guy a strong man real independent and you gave up some of your humanity too he smiled very much in control of himself now his voice sure and steady well i wont play that game ill cling to my humanity and fight for it if i must i loved once really loved and now i hurt and i wont deny either of those things or pretend that they mean any less to me than they do he looked to winters lieutenant i want my sandi and i wont let you take her away from me lets have a vote winters nodded it was close very close the margin was only three votes keith had a lot of friends but winters won keith took it calmly he picked up the cigar box walked over and handed it to winters pete was grinning happily but winters didnt even crack a smile im sorry keith he said yeah said keith so am i there were tears on his face keith was never ashamed to cry there was no singing that night winters didnt timetrip he sent men on search expeditions into the past all very carefully planned for minimum risk and maximum reward we didnt get any doctor out of it rick made three trips back without coming up with any useful memories but one of the guys remembered some valuable stuff about medicinal herbs after a trip back to a bio lab and another jaunt recalled some marginally good memories about electricity winters was still optimistic though hed turned to interviewing by then to decide who should get to use the chronine next he was very careful very thorough and he always asked the right questions no one went back without his okay pending that approval the chronine was stored in the new cabin where pete kept an eye on it and keith keith sang i was afraid the night of the argument that he might give up singing but i was wrong he couldnt give up song any more than he could give up sandi he returned to concert rock the very next evening and sang longer and harder than ever before the night after that he was even better during the day meanwhile he went about his work with a strained cheerfulness he smiled a lot and talked a lot but he never said anything much and he never mentioned chronine or timetripping or the argument or sandi he still spent his nights out by the creek though the weather was getting progressively colder but keith didnt seem to mind he just brought out a few blankets and his sleeping bag and ignored the wind and the chill and the increasingly frequent rains i went out with him once or twice to sit and talk keith was cordial enough but he never brought up the subjects that really mattered and i couldnt bring myself to force the conversations to places he obviously didnt want to do we wound up discussing the weather and like subjects these days instead of his cigar box keith brought his guitar out to the creek he never played it when i was there but i heard him once or twice from a distance when i was halfway back to the common house after one of our fruitless talks no singing just music two songs over and over again you know which two and after a while just one me and bobby mcgee night after night alone and obsessed keith played that song sitting by a dry creek in a barren forest id always liked the song but now i began to fear it and a shiver would go through me whenever i heard those notes on the frosty autumn wind finally one night i spoke to him about it it was a short conversation but i think it was the only time after the argument that keith and i ever really reached each other id come with him to the creek and wrapped myself in a heavy woolen blanket to ward off the cold wet drizzle that was dripping from the skies keith lay against his tree half into his sleeping bag with his guitar on his lap he didnt even bother to shield it against the damp which bothered me we talked about nothing until at last i mentioned his lonely creek concerts he smiled you know why i play that song he said yeah i said but i wish youd stop he looked away i will after tonight but tonight i play it gary dont argue please just listen the song is all i have left now to help me think and ive needed it cause i been thinking a lot i warned you about thinking i said jokingly but he didnt laugh yeah you were right too or i was or shakespeare whoever you want to credit the warning to still sometimes you cant help thinking its part of being human right i guess i know so i think with my music no water left to think by and the stars are all covered and sandis gone really gone now you know gary if i kept on day to day and didnt think so much i might forget her i might even forget what she looked like do you think pete remembers his chick yes i said and youll remember sandi im sure of that but maybe not quite so much and maybe thats for the best sometimes its good to forget then he looked at me into my eyes but i dont want to forget gary and i wont i wont and then he began to play the same song once twice three times i tried to talk but he wasnt listening his fingers moved on fiercely relentlessly and the music and the wind washed away my words finally i gave up and left it was a long walk back to the common house and keiths guitar stalked me through the drizzle winters woke me in the common house shaking me from my bunk to face a grim gray dawn his face was even grayer he said nothing he didnt want to wake the others i guess he just beckoned me outside i yawned and stretched and followed him just outside the door winters bent and handed me a broken guitar i looked at it blankly then up at him my face must have asked the question he used it on petes head winters said and took the chronine i think pete has a mild concussion but hell probably be all right lucky he could be dead real easy i held the guitar in my hands it was shattered the wood cracked and splintered several strings snapped it must have been a hell of a blow i couldnt believe it no i said keith no he couldnt its his guitar winters pointed out and who else would take the chronine then his face softened im sorry gary i really am i think i understand why he did it still i want him any idea where he could be i knew of course but i was scared what what will you do no punishment he said dont worry i just want the chronine back well be more careful next time i nodded okay i said but nothing happens to keith ill fight you if you go back on your word and the others will too he just looked at me very sadly like he was disappointed that id mistrust him he didnt say a thing we walked the mile to the creek in silence me still holding the guitar keith was there of course wrapped in his sleeping bag the cigar box next to him there were a few bags left hed used only one i bent to wake him but when i touched him and rolled him over two things hit me hed shaved off his beard and he was very very cold then i noticed the empty bottle wed found other drugs with the chronine way back when they werent even guarded keith had used sleeping pills i stood up not saying a word i didnt need to explain winters had taken it all in very quickly he studied the body and shook his head i wonder why he shaved he said finally i know i said he never wore a beard in the old days when he was with sandi yes said winters well it figures what the suicide he always seemed unstable no lieutenant i said youve got it all wrong keith didnt commit suicide winters frowned i smiled look i said if you did it it would be suicide you think chronine is only a drug for dreaming but keith figured it for a time machine he didnt kill himself that wasnt his style he just went back to his sandi and this time he made sure he stayed there winters looked back at the body yes he said maybe so he paused for his sake i hope that he was right the years since then have been good ones i guess winters is a better leader than i was the timetrips never turned up any knowledge worth a damn but the search expeditions proved fruitful there are more than two hundred people in town now most of them people that winters brought in its a real town too we have electricity and a library and plenty of food and a doctora real doctor that winters found a hundred miles from here we got so prosperous that the sons of the blast heard about us and came back for a little fun winters had his militia beat them off and hunt down the ones who tried to escape nobody but the old commune people remember keith but we still have singing and music winters found a kid named ronnie on one of his trips and ronnie has a guitar of his own hes not in keiths league of course but he tries hard and everybody has fun and hes taught some of the youngsters how to play only thing is ronnie likes to write his own stuff so we dont hear many of the old songs instead we get postwar music the most popular tune right now is a long ballad about how our army wiped out the sons of the blast winters says thats a healthy thing he talks about new music for a new civilization and maybe he has something in time im sure there will be a new culture to replace the one that died ronnie like winters is giving us tomorrow but theres a price the other night when ronnie sang i asked him to do me and bobby mcgee but nobody knew the words how to become a mars overlord catherynne m valente welcome aspiring potentates we are tremendously gratified at your interest in our little red project and pleased that you recognize the potential growth opportunities inherent in wholeplanet domination of course we remain humble in the face of such august and powerful interests and seek only to showcase the unique and challenging career paths currently available on the highly desirable iconic and oxygenrich landscape of mars query why mars it is a little known fact that every solar system contains mars not mars itself of course but certain suns seem to possess what we might call a habit of martianness in every inhabited system so far identified there is a red planet usually near enough to the most populous world if not as closely adjacent as our own twinkling scarlet beacon with proximate lengths of day and night even more curious these planets are without fail named for wardivinities in the faroff lighthouse system the orb makha turns slowly in the dark red as the blood of that fell goddess to whom cruel strategists pray she who nurses two skulls at each mammoth breast in the glyph system closer to home it is firialai glittering there like a ripe red fruit called after a god of doomed charges depicted in several valuable tapestries as a jester dancing ever on the tip of a sword clutching in each of his seven hands a bouquet of whelpmuskets bones and promotions with golden seals in the bierabiera system still yet we may walk the carnelian sands of uppskil the officers patron goddess with her woolly dactylwings weighted down with gorsuscite medals gleaming purple and white around her orbit wydskil and nagskil the enlisted mans god and the pilots mad bald angel soaring pale as twin ghosts through uppskils emeraldcolored sky each red planet owns also two moons just as ours does some of them will suffer life to flourish we have ourselves vacationed on the several crystal ponds of volniy and vernost which attend the claret equatorial jungles of raudhrnamed of course for the fourfaced lord of bad intelligence whose exploits have been collected in the glassily perfect septameters of the raudhrian eddas we have flown the lonely black between the satellites on slimfinned ferries decked in greenglow blossoms sacred to the poorlyinformed divine personage but most moons are kin to phobos and deimos and rotate silently empty barren bright stones mute and heavy many a time we have asked ourselves does mars dwell in a house of mirrors that same red face repeated over and over in the distance a quantum hiccupor is mars the master the exemplum and all the rest copies surely the others ask the same riddle we would all like to claim the primacy of our own specimenand frequently do which led to the astronomers war some years ago and truly no one here can bear to recite that tragic narrative or else we should wash you all away with our ruststained tears the advantages of these many marses scattered like ruby seeds across the known darkness are clear in almost every system due to stellar circumstances beyond mortal control mars or iskra or lial is the first best candidate for occupation by the primary world in every system the late precolonial literature of those primary worlds becomes obsessed with that tantalizing rosecolored neighbor surely some of you are here because your young hearts were fired by the bedside tales of alim k her passionate affair with the two piscine princes of red knisao and how she waked dread machines in the deep rills of the knizid mountains in order to possess them who among us never read of the mariner ubaido and his silverkeeled ship exploring the fell canals of mikto their black water filled with eely leviathans whose eyes shone with clusters of green pearls all your mothers read the ballads of sollohul to each of you in your cribs and your infant dreams were filled with gorgeousgreen sixlegged cricketqueens ululating on the broad pink plains of podnebesya their carapaces awash in light and who did not love ylla her strange longings against those bronze spires who did not thrill to hear of those scarlet worlds bent to a single will who did not feel something stir within them confronted with those endless crimson sands we have all wanted mars in our time she is familiar she is strange she is redolent of tales and spices and stones we have never known she is demure and gives nothing freely but from our hearths we have watched her glitter all of our lives of course we want her mars is the girl next door her desirability is encoded in your cells it is archetypal we absolve you in advance no matter what system bore you lifted you up made you strong and righteous there is a mars for you to rule and it is right that you should wish to rule her these are perhaps the only certainties granted to a soul like yours we invite you therefore to commit to memory our simple twostep system to accomplish your laudable goals for obviously no paper digital or flash materials ought to be taken away from this meeting step one get to mars it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a poor man to get to mars however to be born on a bed of gems leads to a certain laziness of the soul a kind of muscular weakness of the ambition a subtle sprain in the noble faculties not an original observation but repetition proves the axiom better to excel in some other field for the wellrounded overlord is a blessing to all perhaps microcloning or kinetic engineering if you must write a novel but only before you depart for novels written in the postdespotic utopia you hope to create may be beloved but will never be taken seriously by the literati take as your exemplum the postplastic retroviral architect helix fo the chilean wunderkind was born with ambition in his mouth and literally stole his education from an upperclass boy he happened upon in a dark alley in exchange for his life the patriarch agreed to turn over all his books and assignments upon completion so that fo could shadow his university years for his senior project fo locked his erstwhile benefactor in a basement and devoted himself wholly to the construction of the parainfluenza opera house in santiago whose translucent spires even now dominate that skyline the wealthy graduate went on to menial labor in the doctoral factories much chagrined while young fo swam in wealth and fame enough to purchase three marriage rights including one to an aquatic verqoid androgyne with an extremely respectable feather ridge by his fortieth birthday fo had also purchased through various companies the better part of the atlantic ocean whereupon he began breeding the bacterial island which so generously hosts us tonight and supplies our salads with such exquisite yersinia radishes since nearly all interplanetary conveyances have launched from fos rna platform for he charged no tariffs but his own passage in comfort and grace you will of course remember fo as the first allemperor of mars and his statue remains upon the broad athabasca valles or rather model yourself upon the poetess oorm nineteen point aughtone of mur who set the

of free verse born in the nectarsoup of the capital pool she carefully collected words with no natural rhymes like dewdrops hoarding categorizing and collating them as a child she haunted the berrydripping speakeasies where the great luminaries read their latest work at the age of sixteen barely past infancy in the long stageshifts of a muror she delivered her first poem which consisted of two words bright cellar of course in english these have many rhymes but in muror they have none and her poem may as well have been a bomb detonated on the blue floor of that famous nightclub oorm nineteen found the secret unrhyming world hiding within the delicate gorgeous structures of muror and dragged it out to shine in the sun but she was not satisfied with fame nor with her mates and grubs and sweetwater gems that is how it goes with those of us who answer the call alone in a ship of unrhymed glass she left mur entirely and within a year took the red diadem of etel for her own each rival she assassinated died in bliss as she whispered her verses into their perishing ears it is true that harlow y scion of the house of y ruled the red planet llym for some time however all may

though this method is degenerate by definition and illegal in most systems by the time harlow ascended generations of y had been consumed by little more than fashion public nudity and the occasional

out of recognizability harlow himself appears in a third of his royal portraits something like a massive winged koala with extremely long ultraviolet eyelashes and a crystalline torso harlow y inherited majority control over llym as a child and administered it much as a child will do mining and farming for his amusement and personal augmentation each of his ultraviolet lashes represented thousands of dead llymi crushed to death in avalanches in the mine shafts of the ypo mountains but though harlow achieved overlordship with alacrity and great speed he ended in assassination his

the infanza of hap lived all her life in the ruby jungles of her homeworld she was the greatest actress of her age her tails could convey the colors of a hundred complex emotions in a shimmering fall of shades so deft were her illusions that the wicked old rey thought her loyal and gentle beyond words even as she sunk her bladed fingers into his belly but we must assume that if you require our guidance you did not have the luck of a twotailed infanza and were born on some other meaner world with black soil or blue storms or sweet rain falling like ambition denied should you be so unfortunate as to originate upon a planet without copious travel options due to economic crisis ideological roadblocks or simply occupying a lamentably primitive place on the technological

separate think tanks and an australian diamond mine until one underpaid intern presented her upon her birthday with a cascade of injections sparkling like champagne but on some worlds in some terrible dark hours there is no road to mars no matter how much the traveling soul might desire it in patchwork shoes staring up at a starry night and one gleaming red star among the thousandssometimes want is not enough not enough for maximillian bauxbaum a jewish baker in provence who in his most secret evenings wrote poetry describing such strange bloodcolored deserts such dry canals a sky like green silk down to his children and to theirs and theirs again he passed a single ruby the size of an egg the size of a world the baker had been given it as a bribe by a christian lord to take his leave of a certain maiden whom he loved with hair the color of oxiderich dust and eyes like the space between moons never think on her again never whisper her name to the walls though he kept his promise to an old and bitter death such a treasure can never be spent for it is as good as admitting your heart can be bought sarai northe inherited that jewel and brought it with her to bury beneath the foundations of the cathedral of olympus mons in the end you must choose a universe that contains yourself and mars together and perfect helix fo chose a world built by viruses as tame as songbirds oorm nineteen chose a world gone soft and violet with unrhyming songs make no mistake every moment is a choice a choice between this world and that one between heavens teeming with life and a lonely machine grinding across red stone between staying at home with tea and raspberry cookies and ruling mars with a hand like grace maximillian bauxbaum chose to keep his promise who is to say it is not that promise instead of microbial soup which determined that mars would be teeming with blue inhuman cities with seventeen native faiths by the time his child opened her veins to those terrible champagneelixirs and turned her eyes to the night step two become an overlord now we come to the central question at the core of planetary domination just how is it done the answer is a riddle of course it would be you must already be an overlord in order to become one ask yourself what is an overlord is he a villain is she a hero a cowboy a priestess an industrialist is he cruel is he kind does she rule like air invisible indispensable is she the first human on mars walking on a plain so incomprehensible and barren that she feels her heart empty does she scratch away the thin red dust and see the black rock beneath does he land in his sleek piscine capsule on uppskil so crammed with libraries and granaries that he lives each night in an orgy of books and bread what does she lord over the land alone the people the belligerent patron gods with their nullbronze greaves ablaze is it true as oorm nineteen wrote that the core of each red world is a gem of blood compressed like carbon a hideous wardiamond that yearns toward the strength of a king or a queen as a compass yearns toward north or is this only a metaphor a way in which you can anthropomorphize something so vast as a planet think of it as something capable of loving you back it would seem that the very state of the overlord is one of violence of domination uncomfortable colonial memories arise in the heart like acideveryone wants to be righteous everyone wishes to be loved what is any pharaonic statue staring out at a sea of malachite foam but a plea of the pharaoh to be loved forever unassailably without argument ask yourself will mars be big enough to fill the hole in you the one that howls with such winds which says the only love sufficient to quiet those winds is the love of a planet red in tooth claw orbit mass we spoke before of how to get to mars if your lonely planet offers no speedy highway through the skies truthfullyand now we feel we can be truthful here in the long night of our seminar when the clicking and clopping of the staff has dimmed and the last of the canecream has been sopped up when the stars have all come out and through the crystal ceiling we can all see one oh so red so red just there just out of reachtruthfully getting to mars is icing it is parsley to be an overlord is to engage in mastery of a bright red thing reach out your handwhat in your life confined to this poor grit this lone blue world could not also be called mars rage cruelty the god of your passions the terrible skills you possess that forced obedience from a fiery engine bellicose children lines of perfect gleaming code these things too are mars they are named for fell gods they spit on civilized governanceand they might if whipped or begged fill some nameless void that hamstrings your soul mars is everywhere every world is mars you cannot get there if you are not the lord and leader of your own awful chariot if you are not the crowned paladin in the car instead of the animal roped to it frothing mad driven but never understanding we have said you must choose as bauxbaum and oorm and fo choseto choose is to understand your own highest excellence even if that is only to bake bread and keep promises you must become great enough here that mars will accept you some are chosen to this life mars itself is chosen to it never once in all its iterations having been ruled by democracy you may love mars but mars loves a crown a sceptre a hornmooned diadem spangled in ice opals this is how the bride of mars must be dressed make no mistakeno matter your gender you are the blushing innocent brought to the bed of a mate as ancient and inscrutable as any deathshead bridegroom out of myth did you think that the planet would bend to your will that you would control it oh it is a lovely word overlord emperor pharaoh princeps but you will be changed by it as by a virus mars will fill your empty abandoned places but the greatest of them understood their place the overlord embraces the red planet but in the end mars always triumphs you will wake in your thousand year reign to discover your hair gone red your translucent skin covered in dust your three hearts suddenly fused into a molten stony core you will cease to want food and seek out only cold black air to drink you will face the sun and turn slowly in circles for days on end your thoughts will slow and become grand you will see as a planet sees speak as it speaks which is to say the long view the perfected sentence and one morning you will wake up and your mouth will be covered over in stone but the land beneath you crimson as a promise as a ruby as an unrhymed couplet as a virusthe land or the machine or the child or the book will speak with your voice and you will be an overlord and how proud we shall be of you here by the sea listening to the dawn break over a new shore patient zero tananarive due september the picture came veronica tapped on my glass and woke me up and she held it up for me to see its autographed and everything for you veronica mouthed at me and she smiled a really big smile the autograph says to jayill throw a touchdown for you i couldnt believe it everybody is laughing at me because of the way i yelled and ran in circles around my room until i fell on the floor and scraped my elbow the janitor lou turned on the intercom box outside my door and said kid you gone crazier than usual what you care about that picture for dont they know dan marino is the greatest quarterback of all time i taped the picture to the wall over my bed on the rest of my wall i have maps of the united states and the world and the solar system i can find corsica on the map and the palau islands which most people have never heard of and i know what order all the planets are in but theres nothing else on my wall like dan marino thats the best the other best thing i have is the cassette tape from that time the president called me on the telephone when i was six he said hi is jay there this is the president of the united states he sounded just like on tv my heart flipped because its so weird to hear the president say your name i couldnt think of anything to say back he asked me how i was feeling and i said i was fine that made him laugh like he thought i was making a joke then his voice got real serious and he said everyone was praying and thinking about me and he hung up when i listen to that tape now i wish i had thought of something else to say i used to think he might call me another time but it only happened once in the beginning so i guess ill never have a chance to talk to the president again after veronica gave me my picture of marino i asked her if she could get somebody to fix my tv so i can see the football games all my tv can play is videos veronica said there arent any football games and i started to get mad because i hate it when they lie its september i said and theres always football games in september but veronica told me the nfl people had a meeting and decided not to have football anymore and maybe it would start again but she wasnt sure because nobody except me was thinking about football at first after she said that it kind of ruined the autograph because it seemed like dan marino must be lying too but veronica said he was most likely talking about throwing a touchdown for me in the future and i felt better then this notebook is from ms manigat my tutor who is haitian she said i should start writing down my thoughts and everything that happens to me i said i dont have any thoughts but she said that was ridiculous that is her favorite word ridiculous oh i should say im ten today if i were in a regular school i would be in fifth grade like my brother was i asked ms manigat what grade im in and she said i dont have a grade i read like im in seventh grade and i do math like im in fourth grade she says she says i dont exactly fit anywhere but im very smart ms manigat comes every day except on weekends she is my best friend but i have to call her ms manigat instead of using her first name which is emmeline because she is so proper she is very neat and wears skirts and dresses and everything about her is very clean except her shoes which are dirty her shoes are supposed to be white but whenever i see her standing outside of the glass when she hasnt put on her plastic suit yet her shoes look brown and muddy those are my thoughts september i had a question today veronica never comes on fridays and the other nurse rene isnt as nice as she is so i waited for ms manigat she comes at one i said you know how they give sick children their last wish when theyre dying well when dr ben told me to think of the one thing i wanted for my birthday i said i wanted an autograph from dan marino so does that mean im dying and theyre giving me my wish i said this really fast i thought ms manigat would say i was being ridiculous but she smiled she put her hand on top of my head and her hand felt stiff and heavy inside her big glove listen little old man she said which is what she calls me because she says i do so much worrying youre a lot of things but you arent dying when everyone can be as healthy as you itll be a happy day the people here always seems to be waiting and i dont know what for i thought maybe they were waiting for me to die but i believe ms manigat if she doesnt want to tell me something she just says leave it alone jay which is her way of letting me know she would rather not say anything at all than ever tell a lie october the lights in my room started going on and off again today and it got so hot i had to leave my shirt off until i went to bed ms manigat couldnt do her lessons the way she wanted because of the lights not working right she said it was the emergency generator i asked her what the emergency was and she said something that sounded funny same old same old that was all she said i asked her if the emergency generator was the reason dr ben took the television out of my room and she said yes she said everyone is conserving energy and i have to do my part too but i miss my videos there is nothing at all to do when i cant watch my videos i hate it when im bored sometimes ill even watch videos ive seen a hundred times really a hundred times ive seen big with tom hanks more times than any other video i love the part in the toy store with the really big piano keys on the floor my mom taught me how to play three blind mice on our piano at home and it reminds me of that ive never seen a toy store like the one in big i thought it was just a madeup place but ms manigat said it was a real toy store in new york i miss my videos when im watching them its like im inside the movie too i hope dr ben will bring my tv back soon october i made veronica cry yesterday i didnt mean to dr ben said he knows it was an accident but i feel very sorry so ive been crying too what happened is i was talking to her and she was taking some blood out of my arm with a needle like always i was telling her about how me and my dad used to watch marino play on television and then all of a sudden she was crying really hard she dropped the needle on the floor and she was holding her wrist like she broke it she started swearing she said goddammit goddammit goddammit over and over like that i asked her what happened and she pushed me away like she wanted to knock me over then she went to the door and punched the number code really fast and she pulled on the doorknob but the door wouldnt open and i heard something in her arm snap from yanking so hard she had to do the code again she was still crying ive never seen her cry i didnt know what happened i mashed my finger on the buzzer hard but everybody ignored me it reminded me of when i first came here when i was always pushing the buzzer and crying and nobody would ever come for a long time and they were always in a bad mood when they came anyway i waited for ms manigat and when i told her about veronica she said she didnt know anything because she comes from the outside but she promised to find out then she made me recite the preamble to the constitution which i know by heart pretty soon for a little while i forgot about veronica after my lessons ms manigat left and called me on my phone an hour later like she promised she always keeps her promises my telephone is hooked up so people on the inside can call me but i cant call anybody inside or outside it hardly ever rings now but i almost didnt want to pick it up i was afraid of what ms manigat would say veronica poked herself ms manigat told me the needle stuck through her hot suit she told dr ben there was sudden movement i wondered who made the sudden movement veronica or me is she okay i asked i thought maybe ms manigat was mad at me because she has told me many times that i should be careful maybe i wasnt being careful when veronica was here well see jay ms manigat said from her voice it sounded like the answer was no will she get sick i asked probably yes they think so ms manigat said i didnt want her to answer any more questions i like it when people tell me the truth but it always makes me feel bad too i tried to say i was sorry but i couldnt even open my mouth its not your fault jay ms manigat said i couldnt help it i sobbed like i used to when i was still a little kid veronica knew something like this could happen she said but that didnt make anything better because i remembered how veronicas face looked so scared inside her mask and how she pushed me away veronica has been here since almost the beginning before ms manigat came and she used to smile at me even when nobody else did when she showed me my picture from dan marino she looked almost as happy as me i had never seen her whole face smiling like that she looked so pretty and glad i was crying so much i couldnt even write down my thoughts like ms manigat said to not until today november a long time ago when i first came here and the tv in my room played programs from outside i saw the firstgrade picture i had taken at school on tv i always hated that picture because mom put some greasy stuff in my hair that made me look like a total geek and then i turned on the tv and saw that picture on the news the man on tv said the names of everyone in our family and even spelled them out on the screen then he called me patient zero he said i was the first person who got sick but that wasnt really what happened my dad was sick before me ive told them that already he got it away on his job in alaska my dad traveled a lot because he drilled for oil but he came home early that time we werent expecting him until christmas but he came when it was only september close to my birthday he said hed been sent home because some people on his oil crew got sick one of them had even died but the doctor in alaska had looked at my dad and said he was fine and then his boss sent him home dad was really mad about that he hated to lose money time away from a job was always losing money he said he was in a bad mood when he wasnt working and the worse thing was my dad wasnt fine after two days his eyes got red and he started sniffling then i did too and then my mom and brother when the man on tv showed my picture and called me patient zero and said i was the first one to get sick that was when i first learned how people tell lies because that wasnt true somebody on my dads oil rig caught it first and then he gave it to my dad and my dad gave it to me my mom and my brother but one thing he said was right i was the only one who got well my aunt lori came here to live at the lab with me at first but she wasnt here long because her eyes had already turned red by then she came to help take care of me and my brother before my mom died but probably she shouldnt have done that she lived all the way in california and i bet she wouldnt have gotten sick if she hadnt come to miami to be with us but even my moms doctor didnt know what was wrong then so nobody could warn her about what would happen if she got close to us sometimes i dream im calling aunt lori on my phone telling her please please not to come aunt lori and my mom were twins they looked exactly alike after aunt lori died i was the only one left in my whole family i got very upset when i saw that news report i didnt like hearing someone talk about my family like that people who didnt even know us and i felt like maybe the man on tv was right and maybe it was all my fault i screamed and cried the whole day after that dr ben made them fix my tv so i couldnt see the news anymore or any programs from outside just cartoons and kid movies on video the only good thing was that was when the president called me i think he was sorry when he heard what happened to my family when i ask dr ben if theyre still talking about me on the news he just shrugs his shoulders sometimes dr ben wont say yes or no if you ask him a question it doesnt matter though i think the tv people probably stopped showing my picture a long time ago i was just a little kid when my family got sick ive been here four whole years oh i almost forgot veronica isnt back yet november i have been staring at my dan marino picture all day and i think the handwriting on the autograph looks like dr bens but im afraid to ask anyone about that oh yeahand yesterday the power was off in my room for a whole day same old same old thats what ms m would say november ms manigat is teaching me a little bit about medicine i told her i want to be a doctor when i grow up and she said she thinks thats a wonderful idea because she believes people will always need doctors she says i will be in a good position to help people and i asked her if thats because i have been here so long and she said yes the first thing she taught me is about diseases she says in the old days a long time ago diseases like typhoid used to kill a lot of people because of unsanitary conditions and dirty drinking water but people got smarter and doctors found drugs to cure it so diseases didnt kill people as much anymore doctors are always trying to stay a step ahead of disease ms manigat says but sometimes they cant sometimes a new disease comes or maybe its not a new disease but an old disease that has been hidden for a long time until something brings it out in the open she said thats how nature balances the planet because as soon as doctors find cures for one thing there is always something new dr ben says my disease is new there is a long name for it i cant remember how to spell but most of the time people here call it virusj in a way see its named after me thats what dr ben said but i dont like that ms manigat said after my dad came home the virus got in my body and attacked me just like everyone else so i got really really sick for a lot of days then i thought i was completely better i stopped feeling bad at all but the virus was already in my brother and my mom and dad and even our doctor from before dr wolfe and ms manigat says it was very aggressive which means doctors didnt know how to kill it everybody wears yellow plastic suits and airtight masks when theyre in my room because the virus is still in the air and its in my blood and its on my plates and cups whenever i finish eating they call the suits hot suits because the virus is hot in my room not hot like fire but dangerous ms manigat says virusj is extra special in my body because even though im not sick anymore except for when i feel like i have a temperature and i have to lie down sometimes the virus wont go away i can make other people sick even when i feel fine so she said that makes me a carrier ms manigat said dr ben doesnt know anybody else whos gotten well except for me oh except maybe there are some little girls in china veronica told me once there were some little girls in china the same age as me who didnt get sick either but when i asked dr ben he said he didnt know if it was true and ms manigat told me it might have been true once but those girls might not be alive anymore i asked her if they died of virusj and she said no no no three times she told me to forget all about any little girls in china almost like she was mad im the only one like me she knows about for sure she says the only one left thats why im here she says but i already knew that part when i was little dr ben told me about antibodies and stuff in my blood and he said the reason him and rene and veronica and all the other doctors take so much blood from me all the time until they make purple bruises on my arms and i feel dizzy is so they can try to help other people get well too i have had almost ten surgeries since i have been here i think they have even taken out parts of me but im not really sure i look the same on the outside but i feel different on the inside i had surgery on my belly a year ago and sometimes when im climbing the playrope hanging from the ceiling in my room i feel like it hasnt healed right like im still cut open ms manigat says thats only in my mind but it really hurts i dont hate anything like i hate operations i wonder if thats what happened to the other little girls if they kept getting cut up and cut up until they died anyway its been a year since i had any operations i keep telling dr ben they can have as much blood as they want but i dont want anymore operations please dr ben said theres nobody in the world better than me to make people well if only they can figure out how ms manigat says the same thing that makes me feel a little better about virusj i was happy ms manigat told me all about disease because i dont want her to treat me like a baby the way everybody else does thats what i always tell her i like to know things i didnt even cry when she told me veronica died maybe i got all my crying over with in the beginning because i figured out a long time ago nobody gets better once they get sick nobody except for me november today i asked ms manigat how many people have virusj oh jay i dont know she said i dont think she was in the mood to talk about disease just guess i said ms manigat thought for a long time then she opened her notebook and began drawing lines and boxes for me to see her picture looked like the tiny brown lines all over an oaktree leaf we had a tree called a live oak in our backyard and my dad said it was more than a hundred years old he said trees sometimes live longer than people do and he was right because im sure that tree is still standing in our yard even though my whole family is gone this is how it goes jay ms manigat said showing me with her penciltip how one line branched down to the next people are giving it to each other they dont usually know theyre sick for two weeks and by then theyve passed it to a lot of other people by now its already been here four years so the same thing that happened to your family is happening to a lot of families how many families i asked again i tried to think of the biggest number i could a million ms manigat shrugged just like dr ben would maybe that meant yes i couldnt imagine a million families so i asked ms manigat if it happened to her family too if maybe she had a husband and kids and they got sick but she said no she was never married i guess thats true because ms manigat doesnt look that old she wont tell me her age but shes in her twenties i think ms manigat smiled at me even though her eyes werent happy my parents were in miami and they got it right away ms manigat said then my sister and nieces came to visit them from haiti and they got it too i was away working when it happened and thats why im still here ms manigat never told me that before my family lived in miami beach my dad said our house was too smalli had to share a room with my brotherbut my mother liked where we lived because our building was six blocks from the ocean my mother said the ocean can heal anything but that cant be true can it my mother wouldnt like it where i am because there is no ocean and no windows neither i wondered if ms manigats parents knew someone who worked on an oil rig too but probably not probably they got it from my dad and me ms manigat i said maybe you should move inside like dr ben and everybody else oh jay ms manigat said like she was trying to sound cheerful little old man if i were that scared of anything why would i be in here teaching you she said she asked to be my teacher which i didnt know i said i thought her boss was making her do it and she said she didnt have a boss no one sent her she wanted to come just to meet me i asked her yes because i saw your face on television and you looked to me like a oneofakind she said she said she was a nurse before and she used to work with dr ben in his office in atlanta she said they worked at the cdc which is a place that studies diseases and he knew her so that was why he let her come teach me a boy like you needs his education he needs to know how to face life outside she said ms manigat is funny like that sometimes shell quit the regular lesson about presidents and the ten commandments and teach me something like how to sew and how to tell plants you eat from plants you dont and stuff like i remember when she brought a basket with real fruits and vegetables in it fresh she said she has a garden where she lives on the outside close to here she said one of the reasons she wont move inside is because she loves her garden so much and she doesnt want to leave it the stuff she brought was not very interesting to look at she showed me some cassava which looked like a long twisty tree branch to me and she said its good to eat except it has poison in it that has to be boiled out of the root first and the leaves are poisonous too she also brought something called akee which she said she used to eat from trees in haiti it has another name in haiti thats too hard for me to spell it tasted fine to me but she said akee can never be eaten before its opened or before its ripe because it makes your brain swell up and you can die she also brought different kinds of mushrooms to show me which ones are good or bad but they all looked alike to me she promised to bring me other fruits and vegetables to see so i will know whats good for me and what isnt theres a lot to learn about life outside she said well i dont want ms manigat to feel like i am a waste of her time but i know for a fact i dont have to face life outside dr ben told me i might be a teenager before i can leave or even older he said i might even be a grown man but thats okay i guess i try not to think about what it would be like to leave my room which they moved me to when i had been here six months is really really big they built it especially for me its four times as big as the hotel room my mom and dad got for us when we went to universal studios in orlando when i was five i remember that room because my brother kevin kept asking my dad doesnt this cost too much every time my dad bought us a tshirt or anything kevin brought up how much it cost i told kevin to stop it because i was afraid dad would get mad and stop buying us stuff then when we were in line for the king kong ride all by ourselves kevin told me dad got fired from his job stupid do you want to go on welfare i waited for dad and mom to tell me he got fired but they didnt after kevin said that i didnt ask them to buy me anything else and i was scared to stay in that huge pretty hotel room because i thought we wouldnt have enough money to pay but we did and then dad got a job on the oil rig and we thought everything would be better my room here is as big as half the whole floor i bet when i run from one side of my room to the other from the glass in front to the wall in back im out of breath i like to do that sometimes i run until my ribs start squeezing and my stomach hurts like its cut open and i have to sit down and rest theres a basketball net in here too and the ball doesnt ever touch the ceiling except if i throw it too high on purpose i also have comic books and i draw pictures of me and my family and ms manigat and dr ben because i cant watch my videos now i spend a lot of time writing in this notebook a whole hour went by already when i am writing down my thoughts i forget about everything else i have decided for sure to be a doctor someday im going to help make people better november thanksgiving was great ms manigat cooked real bread and brought me food shed heated up i could tell everything except the bread and cassava was from a can like always but it tasted much better than my regular food i havent had bread in a long time because of her mask ms manigat ate her dinner before she came but she sat and watched me eat rene came in too and she surprised me when she gave me a hug she never does that dr ben came in for a little while at the end and he hugged me too but he said he couldnt stay because he was busy dr ben doesnt come visit me much anymore i could see he was growing a beard and it was almost all white ive seen dr bens hair when hes outside of the glass when he isnt wearing his hot suit and his hair is brown not white i asked him how come his beard was white and he said thats what happens when your mind is overly tired i liked having everybody come to my room before in the beginning almost nobody came in not even ms manigat she used to sit in a chair outside the glass and use the intercom for my lessons its better when they come in i remember how thanksgiving used to be with my family around the table in the dining room and i told ms manigat about that yes she said even though she didnt celebrate thanksgiving in haiti like americans do she remembers sitting at the table with her parents and her sister for christmas dinner she said she came to see me today and rene and dr ben came too because we are each others family now so we are not alone i hadnt thought of it like that before december no one will tell me not even ms m but i think maybe dr ben is sick i have not seen him in five whole days it is quiet here i wish it was thanksgiving again january i didnt know this before but you have to be in the right mood to write your thoughts down a lot happened in the days i missed the doctor with the french name is gone now and im glad he wasnt like dr ben at all i could hardly believe he was a real doctor because he always had on the dirtiest clothes when i saw him take off his hot suit outside of the glass and he was never nice to mehe wouldnt answer at all when i asked him questions and he wouldnt look in my eyes except for a second one time he slapped me on my ear almost for nothing and his glove hurt so much my ear turned red and was sore for a whole day he didnt say he was sorry but i didnt cry i think he wanted me to oh yeah and he hooked me up to iv bags and took so much blood from me i couldnt even stand up i was scared he would operate on me ms manigat didnt come in for almost a week and when she finally came i told her about the doctor taking too much blood she got really mad then i found out the reason she didnt come all those dayshe wouldnt let her she said he tried to bar her from coming bar is the word she used which sounds like a prison the new doctor and ms manigat do not get along even though they both speak french i saw them outside of the glass yelling back and forth and moving their hands but i couldnt hear what they were saying i was afraid he would send ms manigat away for good but yesterday she told me hes leaving i told her i was happy because i was afraid he would take dr bens place no she told me there isnt anyone taking dr bens place she said the french doctor came here to study me in person because he was one of the doctors dr ben had been sending my blood to ever since i first came but he was already very sick when he got here and he started feeling worse so he had to go seeing me was his last wish ms manigat said which didnt seem like it could be true because he didnt act like he wanted to be with me i asked her if he went back to france to his family and ms manigat said no he probably didnt have a family and even if he did its too hard to go to france the ocean is in the way she said ms manigat seemed tired from all that talking she said shed decided to move inside like rene to make sure they were taking care of me properly she said she misses her garden the whole place has been falling apart she said she said i do a good job of keeping my room cleanand i do because i have my own mop and bucket and lysol in my closetbut she told me the hallways are filthy which is true because sometimes i can see water dripping down the wall outside of my glass a lot of it and it makes puddles all over the floor you can tell the water is dirty because you can see different colors floating on top the way my familys driveway used to look after my dad sprayed it with a hose he said the oil from the car made the water look that way but i dont know why it looks that way here ms manigat said the water smells bad too its ridiculous if theyre going to keep you here theyd damn well better take care of you mrs manigat said she must have been really mad because she never swears i told her about the time when lou came and pressed on my intercom really late at night when i was asleep and nobody else was around he was talking really loud like people do in videos when theyre drunk lou was glaring at me through the glass banging on it i had never seen him look so mean i thought he would try to come into my room but then i remembered he couldnt because he didnt have a hot suit but ill never forget how he said they should put you to sleep like a dog at the pound i try not to think about that night because it gave me nightmares it happened when i was pretty little like eight sometimes i thought maybe i just dreamed it because the next time lou came he acted just like normal he even smiled at me a little bit before he stopped coming here lou was nice to me every day after that ms manigat did not sound surprised when i told her what lou said about putting me to sleep yes jay she told me for a long time there have been people outside who didnt think we should be taking care of you i never knew that before i remember a long time ago when i was really little and i had pneumonia my mom was scared to leave me alone at the hospital they wont know how to take care of jay there she said to my dad even though she didnt know i heard her i had to stay by myself all night and because of what my mom said i couldnt go to sleep i was afraid everyone at the hospital would forget i was there or maybe something bad would happen to me it seems like the lights go off every other day now and i know people must really miss lou because the dirty gray water is all over the floor outside my glass and theres no one to clean it up february i remember the numbers already i have been saying them over and over in my head so i wont forget but i wanted to write them down in the exact right order to be extra sure i want to know them without even looking oh i should start at the beginning yesterday no one brought me any dinner not even ms manigat she came with a huge bowl of oatmeal this morning saying she was very sorry she said she had to look a long time to find that food and it wore her out the oatmeal wasnt even hot but i didnt say anything i just ate she watched me eating she didnt stay with me long because she doesnt teach me lessons anymore after the french doctor left we talked about the emancipation proclamation and martin luther king but she didnt bring that up today she just kept sighing and she said she had been in bed all day yesterday because she was so tired and she was sorry she forgot to feed me she said i couldnt count on rene to bring me food because she didnt know where rene was it was hard for me to hear her talk through her hot suit today her mask was crooked so the microphone wasnt in front of her mouth where it should be she saw my notebook and asked if she could look at it i said sure she looked at the pages from the beginning she said she liked the part where i said she was my best friend her facemask was fogging up so i couldnt see her eyes and i couldnt tell if she was smiling i am very sure she did not put her suit on right today when she put my notebook down she told me to pay close attention to her and repeat the numbers she told me which were i asked her what they were she said it was the security code for my door she said she wanted to give the code to me because my buzzer wasnt working and i might need to leave my room if she overslept and nobody came to bring me food she told me i could use the same code on the elevator and the kitchen was on the third floor there wouldnt be anybody there she said but i could look on the shelves the top ones up high to see if there was any food if not she said i should take the stairs down to the first floor and find the red exit sign to go outside she said the elevator doesnt go to the first floor anymore i felt scared then but she put her hand on top of my head again just like usual she said she was sure there was plenty of food outside but am i allowed i asked her what if people get sick you worry so much little man she said only you matter now my little oneofakind but see im sure ms manigat doesnt really want me to go outside ive been thinking about that over and over ms manigat must be very tired to tell me to do something like that maybe she has a fever and thats why she told me how to get out of my room my brother said silly things when he had a fever and my father too my father kept calling me oscar and i didnt know who oscar was my dad told us he had a brother who died when he was little and maybe his name was oscar my mother didnt say anything at all when she got sick she just died very fast i wish i could find ms manigat and give her something to drink you get very thirsty when you have a fever which i know for a fact but i cant go to her because i dont know where she is and besides i dont know where dr ben keeps the hot suits what if i went to her and she wasnt wearing hers maybe the oatmeal was the only thing left in the kitchen and now i ate it all i hope not but im thinking maybe it is because i know ms manigat would have brought me more food if she could have found it shes always asking me if i have enough to eat im already hungry again february i am writing in the dark the lights are off i tried to open my lock but the numbers dont work because of the lights being off i dont know where ms manigat is im trying not to cry what if the lights never come back on february theres so much i want to say but i have a headache from being hungry when the lights came back on i went out into the hall like ms m told me and i used the numbers to get the elevator to work and then i went to the kitchen like she said i wanted to go real fast and find some peanut butter or some oreos or even a can of beans i could open with the can opener ms m left me at thanksgiving theres no food in the kitchen theres empty cans and wrappers on the floor and even roaches but i looked on every single shelf and in every cabinet and i couldnt find anything to eat the sun was shining really really bright from the window i almost forgot how the sun looks when i went to the window i saw a big empty parking lot outside at first i thought there were diamonds all over the ground because of the sparkles but it was just a lot of broken glass i could only see one car and i thought it was ms ms but ms m would never leave her car looking like that for one thing it had two flat tires anyway i dont think theres anybody here today so i thought of a plan i have to go now ms m this is for youor whoever comes looking for me i know somebody will find this notebook if i leave it on my bed im very sorry i had to leave in such a hurry i didnt want to go outside but isnt it okay if its an emergency i am really really hungry ill just find some food and bring it with me and ill come right back im leaving my door open so i wont get locked out ms m maybe ill find your garden with cassavas and akee like you showed me and ill know the good parts from the bad parts if someone sees me and i get in trouble ill just say i didnt have anything to eat whoever is reading this dont worry ill tell everybody i see please please not to get too close to me i know dr ben was very worried i might make somebody sick arvies adamtroy castro statement of intent this is the story of a mother and a daughter and the right to life and the dignity of all living things and of some souls granted great destinies at the moment of their conception and of others damned to remain societys useful idiots contents expect cute plush animals and amniotic fluid and a more or less happy ending for everybody though the definition of happiness may depend on the truncated emotional capacity of those unable to feel anything else some of the characters are rich and famous others are underage and one is legally dead though you may like her the most of all appearance we first encounter molly june on her fifteenth deathday when the monitors in charge of deciding such things declare her safe for passengers congratulating her on completing the only important stage of her development they truck her in a padded skimmer to the arvie showroom where she is claimed right away by one of the living the fast sale surprises nobody not the servos that trained her into her current state of health and attractiveness not the ai routines managing the showroom and least of all molly june who has spent her infancy and early childhood having the ability to feel surprise or anything beyond a vague contentment scrubbed from her emotional palate crying shed learned while still capable of such things brought punishment while unconditional acceptance of anything the engineers saw fit to provide brought light and flower scent and warmth by this point in her existence shell greet anything short of an exploding bomb with no reaction deeper than vague concern her sale is a minor development by comparison a happy development reinforcing her feelings of dull satisfaction dont feel sorry for her her entire life or more accurately death is happy ending all she has to do is spend the rest of it carrying a passenger vehicle specifications you think you need to know what molly june looks like you really dont as it plays no role in her life but as the information will assist you in feeling empathy for her we will oblige anyway molly june is a roundfaced buttonnosed gamin with pink lips and cheeks marked with permanent rose her blonde hair framing her perfect face in parentheses of bouncy luxurious curls her blue eyes enlarged by years of genetic manipulation and corrective surgeries are three times as large as the ones imperfect nature would have set in her face lemurlike they dominate her features like a pair of pacific jewels all moist and sad and adorable they reveal none of her essential personality which is not a great loss as shes never been permitted to develop one her body is another matter it has been trained to perfection with the kind of punishing daily regimen that can only be endured when the mind itself remains unaware of pain or exhaustion she has worked with torn ligaments with shattered joints with disfiguring wounds she has severed her spine and crushed her skull and has had both replaced with the same ease her engineers have used fourteen times to replace her skin with a fresh version unmarked by scars or blemishes what remains of her now is a wan amalgam of her own bestdeveloped parts most of them entirely natural except for her womb which is of course a plush wired palace far safer for its future occupant than the envelope of mere flesh would have provided it can survive injuries capable of reducing molly june to a smear in short she is precisely what she should be now that shes fifteen years past birth and therefore by all standards known to modern civilized society dead heroine jennifer axiomasingh has never been born and is therefore a significant distance away from being dead she is in every way entirely typical she has written operas climbed mountains enjoyed daredevil plunges from the upper atmosphere into vessels the size of teacups finagled controlling stock in seventeen major multinationals earned the hopeless devotion of any number of lovers written her name in the sands of time fought campaigns in a hundred conceptual wars survived twenty regime changes and on three occasions had herself turned off so she could spend a year or two mulling the purpose of existence while her bloodstream spiced her insights with all the most fashionable hallucinogens she has accomplished all of this from within various baths of amniotic fluid jennifer has yet to even open her eyes which have never been allowed to fully develop past the first trimester and which still truth be told resemble black marbles behind lids of translucent onionskin this doesnt actually deprive her of vision of course at the time she claims molly june as her arvie shes been indulging her visual cortex for seventy long years zipping back and forth across the solar system collecting all the tourist chits one earns for seeing all the wonders of modernday humanity from the scrimshaw carving her immediate ancestors made of mars to the radiant face of unborn jesus shining from the artfully reconfigured multicolored atmosphere of saturn she has gloried in the catalogue of beautiful sights provided by god and all the industrious living people before her throughout all this she has been blessed with vision far greater than any we will ever know ourselves since her umbilical interface allows her sights capable of frying merely organic eyes and shes far too sophisticated a person to be satisfied with the banal limitations of the merely visual spectrum decades of life have provided jennifer axiomasingh with more depth than that and something else a perverse need stranger than anything shes ever done and impossible to indulge without first installing herself in a healthy young arvie ancestry jennifer axiomasingh has owned arvies before each one customized from the moment of its death shes owned males females neuters and several sexes only developed in the past decade shes had arvies designed for athletic prowess arvies designed for erotic sensation and arvies designed for survival in harsh environments shes even had one arvie with hypersensitive pain receptors that during a cold and confused period of masochism the last one before this who she still misses and sometimes feels a little guilty about was a lovely girl named peggy sue with a metabolism six times baseline normal and a digestive tract capable of surviving about a hundred separate species of nonstop abuse peggy sue could down mountains of exotic delicacies without ever feeling full or engaging her gag reflex and enjoyed taste receptors directly plugged into her pleasure centers the slightest sip of coconut juice could flood her system with tidal waves of endorphincrazed ecstasy the things chocolate could do to her were downright obscene unfortunately she was still vulnerable to the negative effects of unhealthy eating and went through four liver transplants and six emergency transfusions in the first ten years of jennifers occupancy the cumulative medical effect of so many years of determined gluttony mattered little to jennifer axiomasingh since her own caloric intake was regulated by devices that prevented the worst of peggy sues excessive consumption from causing any damage on her side of the uterine wall jennifers umbilical cord passed only those compounds necessary for keeping her alive and healthy all jennifer felt through her interface with peggy sues own sensory spectrum was the joy of eating all she experienced was the sheer overwhelming treasury of flavor and if peggy sue became obese and diabetic and jaundiced in the meantimeas she did enduring her last few years as jennifers arvie as an immobile mountain of reeking flab with barely enough strength to position her mouth for another bitethen that was inconsequential as well because she had progressed beyond prenatal development and had therefore passed beyond that stage of life where human beings can truly be said to have a soul philosophy life true life lasts only from the moment of conception to the moment of birth jennifer axiomasingh subscribes to this principle and clings to it in the manner of any concerned citizen aware that the very foundations of her society depend on everybody continuing to believe it without question but she is capable of forming attachments no matter how irrational and she therefore felt a frisson of guilt once she decided shed had enough and the machines performed the caesarian section that delivered her from peggy sues pliant womb after all peggy sues reward for so many years of service euthanasia seemed so inadequate given everything shed provided but what else could have provided fair compensation given the shape peggy sue was in by then surely not a last meal jennifer axiomasingh who had not been able to think of any alternatives brooded over the matter until she came to the same conclusion always reached by those enjoying lives of privilege which is that such inequities are all for the best and that there wasnt all that much she could do about them anyway her liberal compassion had been satisfied by the heartfelt promise to herself that if she ever bought an arvie again she would take care to act more responsibly and this is what she holds in mind as the interim pod carries her into the gleaming white expanse of the very showroom where fifteenyearold molly june awaits a passenger installation molly junes contentment is like the surface of a vast pacific ocean unstirred by tide or wind the events of her life plunge into that mirrored surface without effect raising nary a ripple or storm it remains unmarked even now as the anesthetician and obstetrician mechs emerge from their recesses to guide her alwaysunresisting form from the waiting room couch where shed been left earlier this morning to the operating theatre where shell begin the useful stage of her existence speakers in the walls calm her further with an arrangement of melodious strings designed to override any unwanted emotional static its all quite humane for even as molly june lies down and puts her head back and receives permission to close her eyes she remains wholly at peace her heartbeat does jog a little just enough to be noted by the instruments when the servos peel back the skin of her abdomen but even that instinctive burst of fear fades with the absence of any identifiable pain her reaction to the invasive procedure fades to a mere theoretical interest akin to what jennifer herself would feel regarding gossip about people she doesnt know living in places where shes never been molly june drifts thinks of blue waters and bright sunlight misses jennifers installation inside her and only reacts to the massive change in her body after the incisions are closed and jennifer has recovered enough to kick then her lips curl in a warm but vacant smile she is happy arvies might be dead in legal terms but they still love their passengers ambition jennifer doesnt announce her intentions until two days later after growing comfortable with her new living arrangements at that time molly june is stretched out on a lounge on a balcony overlooking a city once known as paris but which has undergone perhaps a dozen other names of fleeting popularity since then at this point its called something that could be translated as eternal night because its urban planners have noted that it looks best when its towers were against a backdrop of darkness and therefore arranged to free it from the sunlight that previously diluted its beauty for half of every day the balcony a popular spot among visitors is not connected to any actual building it just sits like an unanchored shelf at a high altitude calculated to showcase the lights of the city at their most decadently glorious the city itself is no longer inhabited of course it contains some mechanisms important for the maintenance of local weather patterns but otherwise exists only to confront the night sky with constellations of reflective light jennifer experiencing its beauty through molly junes eyes and the bracing highaltitude wind through molly junes skin feels a connection with the place that goes beyond aesthetics she finds it fateful resonant and romantic the perfect location to begin the greatest adventure of a life that has already provided her with so many she cranes molly junes neck to survey the hundreds of other arvies sharing this balcony with her all young all beautiful all pretending happiness while their jaded passengers struggle to plan new experiences not yet grown dull from surfeit she sees arvies drinking arvies wrestling arvies declaiming vapid poetry arvies coupling in threes and fours arvies colored in various shades fitted to various shapes and sizes pregnant females and impregnated males all sufficiently transparent to a trained eye like jennifers for the essential characters of their respective passengers to shine on through they all glow from the light of a moon that is not the moon as the original was removed some time ago but a superb piece of stagecraft designed to accentuate the city below to its greatest possible effect have any of these people ever contemplated a stunt as overthetop creative as the one jennifer has in mind jennifer thinks not more she is certain not she feels pride and her arvie molly june laughs with a joy that threatens to bring the unwanted curse of sunlight back to the city of lights and for the first time she announces her intentions out loud without even raising her voice aware that any words emerging from molly junes mouth are superfluous so long as the truly necessary signal travels the network that conveys jennifers needs to the proper facilitating agencies none of the other arvies on the balcony even hear molly june speak but those plugged in hear jennifer speak the words destined to set off a whirlwind of controversy i want to give birth clarification it is impossible to understate the perversity of this request nobody gives birth birth is a messy and unpleasant and distasteful process that ejects living creatures from their warm and sheltered environment into a harsh and unforgiving one that nobody wants to experience except from within the protection of wombs either organic or artificial birth is the passage from life and all its infinite wonders to another place inhabited only by those who have been forsaken its the terrible ending that modern civilization has forestalled indefinitely allowing human beings to live within the womb without ever giving up the rich opportunities for experience and growth its sad of course that for life to even be possible a large percentage of potential citizens have to be permitted to pass through that terrible veil into an existence where theyre no good to anybody except as spare parts and manual laborers and arvies but there are peasants in even the most enlightened societies doing the hard work so the important people dont have to the best any of us can do about that is appreciate their contribution while keeping them as complacent as possible the worst thing that could ever be said about molly junes existence is that when the nurseries measured her genetic potential found it wanting and decided she should approach birth unimpeded she was also humanely deprived of the neurological enhancements that allow firsttrimester fetuses all the rewards and responsibilities of citizenship she never developed enough to fear the passage that awaited her and never knew how sadly limited her existence would be she spent her alltoobrief life in utero ignorant of all the blessings that would forever be denied her and has been kept safe and content and happy and drugged and stupid since birth after all as a wise person once said it takes a perfect vassal to make a perfect vessel nobody can say that theres anything wrong about that but the dispossession of people like her that makes the lives of people like jennifer axiomasingh possible remains a distasteful thing decent people just dont talk about jennifers hunger to experience birth from the point of view of a mother grunting and sweating to expel another unfortunate like molly june out of the only world that matters into the world of cold slavery thus strikes the vast majority as offensive scandalous unfeeling selfish and cruel but since nobody has ever imagined a citizen demented enough to want such a thing nobody has ever thought to make it against the law so the powers that be indulge jennifers perversity while swiftly passing laws to ensure that nobody will ever be permitted such license ever again and all the machinery of modern medicine is turned to the problem of just how to give her what she wants and before long wearing molly june as proxy she gets knocked up implantation there is no need for any messy copulation sex as conducted through arvies still makes the world go round prompting the usual number of bittersweet affairs tempestuous breakups turbulent love triangles and silly love songs in her younger days before the practice palled out of sheer repetition jennifer had worn out several arvies fucking like a bunny but there has never been any danger of unwanted conception at any time not with the only possible source of motile sperm being the nurseries that manufacture it as needed without recourse to nasty antiquated testes these days zygotes and embryos are the province of the assembly line growing one inside an arvie let alone one already occupied by a human being presents all manner of bureaucratic difficulties involving the construction of new protocols and the rearranging of accepted paradigms and any amount of official eyerolling but once all that is said and done the procedures turn out to be quite simple and the surgeons have little difficulty providing molly june with a second womb capable of growing jennifer axiomasinghs daughter while jennifer axiomasingh herself floats unchanging a few protected membranes away unlike the womb that houses jennifer this one will not be wired in any way its occupant will not be able to influence molly junes actions or enjoy the full spectrum of molly junes senses she will not understand except in the most primitive undeveloped way what or where she is or how well shes being cared for literally next to jennifer axiomasingh she will be by all reasonable comparisons a mindless idiot but she will live and grow for as long as it takes for this entire perverse whim of jennifers to fully play itself out gestation in the months that follow jennifer axiomasingh enjoys a novel form of celebrity this is hardly anything new for her of course as she has been a celebrity several times before and if she lives her expected lifespan expects to be one several times again but in an otherwise unshockable world she has never experienced or even witnessed that special nearly extinct species of celebrity that comes from eliciting shock and which was once bestknown by the antiquated term notoriety this she glories in this she milks for every last angstrom this she surfs like an expert submitting to countless interviews constructing countless bon mots pulling every string capable of scandalizing the public she says i dont see the reason for all the fuss she says people used to share wombs all the time she says it used to happen naturally with multiple births two or three or four or even seven of us crowded together like grapes sometimes absorbing each others body parts like cute young cannibals she says i dont know whether to call what im doing pregnancy or performance art she says dont you think molly june looks special dont you think she glows she says when the babys born i may call her halo she says no i dont see any problem with condemning her to birth if its good enough for molly june its good enough for my child and she says no i dont care what anybody thinks its my arvie after all and she fans the flames of outrage higher and higher until public sympathies turn to the poor slumbering creature inside the sac of amniotic fluid whose life and future have already been so cruelly decided is she truly limited enough to be condemned to birth should she be stabilized and given her own chance at life before shes expelled sticky and foul into the cold harsh world inhabited only by arvies and machines or is jennifer correct in maintaining the issue subject to a mothers whim jennifer says all i know is that this is the most profound most spiritually fulfilling experience of my entire life and so she faces the crowds real or virtual using molly junes smile and molly junes innocence daring the analysts to count all the layers of irony gestation ii molly june experiences the same few months in a fog of dazed but happy confusion aware that shes become the center of attention but unable to comprehend exactly why she knows that her lower back hurts and that her breasts have swelled and that her belly flat and soft before has inflated to several times its previous size she knows that she sometimes feels something moving inside her that she sometimes feels sick to her stomach and that her eyes water more easily than they ever have before but none of this disturbs the vast becalmed surface of her being it is all good all the more reason for placid contentment her only truly bad moments come in her dreams when she sometimes finds herself standing on a gray colorless field facing another version of herself half her own size the miniature molly june stares at her from a distance that molly june herself cannot cross her eyes unblinking her expression merciless tears glisten on both her cheeks she points at molly june and she enunciates a single word incomprehensible in any language molly june knows and irrelevant to any life shes ever been allowed to live mother the unfamiliar word makes molly june feel warm and cold all at once in her dream she wets herself trembling from the sudden warmth running down her thighs she trembles bowed by an incomprehensible need to apologize when she wakes she finds real tears still wet on her cheeks and real pee soaking the mattress between her legs it frightens her but those moments fade within seconds the calming agents are already flooding her bloodstream overriding any internal storms removing all possible sources of disquiet making her once again the obedient arvie shes supposed to be she smiles and coos as the servos tend to her bloated form scrubbing her flesh and applying their emollients life is so good she thinks and if its not well its not like theres anything she can do about it so why worry birth i molly june goes into labor on a day corresponding to what we call thursday the insistent weight she has known for so long giving way to a series of contractions violent enough to reach her even through her cocoon of deliberately engineered apathy she cries and moans and shrieks infuriated inarticulate things that might have been curses had she ever been exposed to any and she begs the shiny machines around her to take away the pain with the same efficiency that theyve taken away everything else she even begs her passengerthat is the passenger she knows about the one shes sensed seeing through her eyes and hearing through her ears and carrying out conversations with her mouthshe begs her passenger for mercy she hasnt ever asked that mysterious godlike presence for anything because its never occurred to her that she might be entitled to anything but she needs relief now and she demands it shrieks for it cant understand why she isnt getting it the answer which would be beyond her understanding even if provided is that the wet sordid physicality of the experience is the very point birth ii jennifer axiomasingh is fully plugged in to every cramp every twitch every pooled droplet of sweat she experiences the beauty and the terror and the exhaustion and the certainty that this will never end she finds it resonant and evocative and educational on levels lost to a mindless sack of meat like molly june and she comes to any number of profound revelations about the nature of life and death and the biological origins of the species and the odd inexplicable attachment brood mares have always felt for the squalling sacks of flesh and bone their bodies have gone to so much trouble to expel conclusions its like any other work she thinks nobody ever spent months and months building a house only to burn it down the second they pounded in the last nail you put that much effort into something and it belongs to you forever even if the end result is nothing but a tiny creature that eats and shits and makes demands on your time this still fails to explain why anybody would invite this kind of pain again let alone the three or four or seven additional occasions common before the unborn reached their ascendancy oh its interesting enough to start with but she gets the general idea long before the thirteenth hour rolls around and the market share for her realtime feed dwindles to the single digits long before that the pain has given way to boredom at the fifteenth hour she gives up entirely turns off her inputs and begins to catch up on her personal correspondence missing the actual moment when molly junes daughter jennifers wombmate and sister is expelled headfirst into a shiny silver tray pink and bloody and screaming at the top of her lungs sharing oxygen for the very first time but by every legal definition dead aftermath jennifer as per her expressed wishes jennifer axiomasingh is removed from molly june and installed in a new arvie that very day this ones a tall lithe gloriously beautiful creature with fiery eyes and thick lush lips her names bernadette ann shes been bred for endurance in extreme environments and shell soon be taking jennifer axiomasingh on an extended solo hike across the restored continent of antarctica jennifer is so impatient to begin this journey that she never lays eyes on the child whose birth she has just experienced theres no need after all shes never laid eyes on anything not personally and the pictures are available online should she ever feel the need to see them not that she ever sees any reason for that to happen the baby itself was never the issue here jennifer didnt want to be a mother she just wanted to give birth all that mattered to her in the long run was obtaining a few months of unique vicarious experience precious in a lifetime likely to continue for as long as the servos still manufacture wombs and breed arvies all that matters now is moving on because time marches onward and there are never enough adventures to fill it aftermath molly june shes been used and sullied and rendered an unlikely candidate to attract additional passengers she is therefore earmarked for compassionate disposal aftermath the baby the baby is no pun intended another issue her biological mother jennifer axiomasingh has no interest in her and her birthmother molly june is on her way to the furnace a number of minor health problems barely worth mentioning render her unsuitable for a useful future as somebodys arvie born and by that precise definition dead she could very well follow molly june down the chute but she has a happier future ahead of her it seems that her unusual gestation and birth have rendered her something of a collectors item and there are any number of museums aching for a chance to add her to their permanent collections offers are weighed and terms negotiated until the ultimate agreement is signed and she finds herself shipped to a freshly constructed habitat in a wildlife preserve in what used to be ohio aftermath the child she spends her early life in an automated nursery with toys teachers and careful attention to her every physical need at age five shes moved to a cage consisting of a two story house on four acres of nice green grass beneath what looks like a blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds theres even a playground she will never be allowed out of course because theres no place for her to go but she does have human contact of a sort a different arvie almost every day inhabited for the occasion by a long line of living who now think it might be fun to experience childrearing for a while each one has a different face each one calls her by a different name and their treatment of her ranges all the way from compassionate to violently abusive now eight the little girl has long since given up on asking the good ones to stay because she knows they wont nor does she continue to dream about what shell do when she grows up since its also occurred to her that shell never know anything but this life in this fishbowl her one consolation is wondering about her real mother where she is now what she looks like whether she ever thinks about the child she left behind and whether it would have been possible to hold on to her love had it ever been offered or even possible the questions remain the same from day to day but the answers are hers to imagine and they change from minute to minute as protean as her moods or her dreams or the reasons why she might have been condemned to this cruelest of all possible punishments more than the sum of his parts joe haldeman august they say i am to keep a detailed record of my feelings my perceptions as i grow accustomed to the new parts to that end they gave me an apparatus that blind people use for writing like a tablet with guide wires it is somewhat awkward but a recorder would be useless since i will not have a mouth for some time and i cant type blind with only one hand woke up free from pain interesting surprising to find that it has only been five days since the accident for the record i am or was dr wilson cheetham senior engineer quality control for us steels skyfac station a highorbit facility that produces foamsteel and vapor deposition materials for use in the cislunar community but if you are reading this you must know all that five days ago i was inspecting the aluminum deposition facility and had a bad accident there was a glitch in my jetseat controls and i flew suddenly straight into the wide beam of charged aluminum vapor very hot they turned it off in a second but there was still plenty of time for the beam to breach the suit and thoroughly roast three quarters of my body apparently there was a rescue bubble right there i was unconscious of course they tell me that my heart stopped with the shock but they managed to save me my left leg and arm are gone as is my face i have no lower jaw nose or external ears i can hear after a fashion though and will have eyes in a week or so they claim they will craft for me testicles and a penis i must be pumped full of mood drugs i feel too calm if i were myself whatever fraction of myself is left perhaps i would resist the insult of being turned into a sexless halfmachine ah well this will be a machine that can turn itself off august for many days there was only sleep or pain this was in the weightless ward at mercy they stripped the dead skin off me bit by bit there were limits to anesthesia unfortunately i tried to scream but found i had no vocal cords they finally decided not to try to salvage the arm and leg which saved some pain when i was able to listen they explained that us steel valued my services so much that they were willing to underwrite a stateoftheart cyborg transformation half the cost will be absorbed by interface biotech on the moon everybody will deduct me from their taxes this then is the catalog first new arm and leg thats fairly standard i once worked with a woman who had two cyborg arms it took weeks before i could look at her without feeling pity and revulsion then they will attempt to build me a working jaw and mouth which has been done only rarely and imperfectly and rebuild the trachea vocal cords esophagus i will be able to speak and drink though except for certain soft foods i wont eat in a normal way salivary glands are beyond their art no mucous membranes of any kind a drastic cure for my chronic sinusitis surprisingly to me at least the reconstruction of a penis is a fairly straightforward procedure for which theyve had lots of practice men are forever sticking them into places where they dont belong they are particularly excited about my case because of the challenge in restoring sensation as well as function the prostate is intact and they seem confident that they can hook up the complicated plumbing involved in ejaculation restoring the ability to urinate is trivially easy they say the biotechnician in charge of the urogenital phase of the project talked at me for more than an hour going into unnecessarily grisly detail it seems that this replacement was done occasionally even before they had any kind of mechanical substitute by sawing off a short rib and transplanting it covering it with a skin graft from elsewhere on the body the recipient thus was blessed with a permanent erection unfortunately rather strangelooking and short on sensation my own prosthesis will look very much like the real shall we say thing and new developments in tractorfield mechanics and bionic interfacing should give it realistic response patterns i dont know how to feel about all this i wish they would leave my blood chemistry alone so i could have some honest grief or horror whatever instead of this placid waiting september out cold for thirteen days and i wake up with eyes the arm and leg are in place but not powered up yet i wonder what the eyes look like they wont give me a mirror until i have a face they feel like wet glass very fancy eyes i have a box with two dials that i can use to override the default modethat is the ability to see only normally one of them gives me conscious control over pupil dilation so i can see in almost total darkness or if for some reason i wanted to look directly at the sun without discomfort the other changes the frequency response so i can see either in the infrared or the ultraviolet this hospital room looks pretty much the same in ultraviolet but in infrared it takes on a whole new aspect most of the rooms illumination then comes from bright bars on the walls radiant heating my real arm shows a pulsing tracery of arteries and veins the other is of course not visible except by reflection and is dark blue later strange i didnt realize i was on the moon i thought it was a lowgravity ward in mercy while i was sleeping they sent me down to biotech should have figured that out september they turned on the social arm and leg and began patterning exercises i am told to think of a certain movement and do its mirror image with my right arm or leg while attempting to execute it with my left the trainer helps the cyborg unit along which generates something like pain though actually it doesnt resemble any real muscular ache maybe its the way circuits feel when theyre overloaded by the end of the session i was able to make a fist without help though there is hardly enough grip to hold a pencil i cant raise the leg yet but can make the toes move they removed some of the bandages today from shoulder to hip and the testtube skin looks much more real than i had prepared myself for hairless and somewhat glossy but the color match is perfect in infrared it looks quite different more uniform in color than the real side i suppose thats because it hasnt aged forty years while putting me through my paces the technician waxed rhapsodic about how good this arm is going to bethis set of arms actually im exercising with the social one which looks much more convincing than the ones my coworker displayed ten years ago no doubt more a matter of money than of advancing technology the working arm which i havent seen yet will be all metal capable of being worn on the outside of a spacesuit besides having the two arms ill be able to interface with various waldos tailored to specific functions i am fortunately more ambidextrous than the average person i broke my right wrist in the second grade and kept rebreaking it through the third and so learned to write with both hands all my life i have been able to print more clearly with the left they claim to be cutting down on my medication if thats the truth i seem to be adjusting fairly well then again i have nothing in my past experience to use as a basis for comparison perhaps this calmness is only a mask for hysteria september today i was able to tie a simple knot i can lightly sketch out the letters of the alphabet a large and childish scrawl but recognizably my own ive begun walking after a fashion supporting myself between parallel bars the lack of hand strength is a neural problem not a muscular one when rigid the arm and leg are as strong as metal crutches as i practice its amusing to watch the reactions of people who walk into the room people who arent paid to mask their horror at being studied by two cold lenses embedded in a swath of bandages formed over a shape that is not a head tomorrow they start building my face i will be essentially unconscious for more than a week the limb patterning will continue as i sleep they say september when i was a child my mother always careful to have me do normal things dressed me in costume each halloween and escorted me around the highrise so i could beg for candy i did not want and money i did not need on one occasion i had to wear the mask of a child star then popular on the cube a tightly fitting plastic affair that covered the entire head squeezing my pudgy features into something more in line with some platonic ideal of childish beauty that was my last halloween i embarrassed her this face is like that it is undeniably my face but the skin is taut and unresponsive any attempt at expression produces a grimace i have almost normal grip in the hand now though it is still clumsy as they hoped the sensory feedback from the fingertips and palms seems to be more finely tuned than in my good hand tracing my new forefinger across my right wrist i can sense the individual pores and there is a marked temperature gradient as i pass over tendon or vein and yet the hand and arm will eventually be capable of superhuman strength touching my new face i do not feel pores they have improved on nature in the business of heat exchange september another week of sleep while they installed the new plumbing when the anesthetic wore off i felt a definite something not pain but neither was it the normal somatic heft of genitalia everything was bedded in gauze and bandage though and catheterized so it would feel strange even to a normal person later an aide came in and gingerly snipped away the bandages he blushed i dont think fondling was in his job description when the catheter came out there was a small sting of pain and relief its not much of a copy to reconstruct the face they could consult hundreds of pictures and cubes but it had never occurred to me that one day it might be useful to have a gallery of pictures of my private parts in various stages of repose the technicians had approached the problem by bringing me a stack of photos culled from urological texts and pornography and having me sort through them as to closeness of fit it was not a task for which i was well trained by experience or disposition strange as it may seem in this age of unfettered hedonism i havent seen another man naked let alone rampant since leaving high school twentyfive years ago i was stationed on farside for eighteen months and never went near a sex bar preferring an audience of one even if i had to hire her as was usually the case so this one is rather longer and thicker than its predecessorwould all men unconsciously exaggerateand has only approximately the same aspect when erect a young mans rakish angle distasteful but necessary to write about the matter of masturbation at first it didnt work with my right hand it felt like holding another man which i have never had any desire to do with the new hand though the process proceeded in the normal way though i must admit to a voyeuristic aspect the sensations were extremely acute ejaculation more forceful than i can remember from youth it makes me wonder in a book i recently read about brain chemistry the author made a major point of the notion that its a mistake to completely equate mind with brain the brain he said is in a way only the thickest and most complex segment of the nervous system it coordinates our consciousness but the actual mind suffuses through the body in a network of ganglia in fact he used sexuality as an example when a man ruefully observes that his penis has a mind of its own he is stating part of a larger truth but i in fact do have actual brains imbedded in my new parts the biochips that process sensory data coming in and action commands going back are these brains part of my consciousness the way the rest of my nervous system is the masturbation experience indicates they might be in business for themselves this is premature speculation so to speak well see how it feels when i move into a more complex environment where im not so selfabsorbed september during the night something evidently clicked i woke up this morning with full strength in my cyborg limbs one rail of the bed was twisted out of shape where i must have unconsciously gripped it i bent it back quite easily some obscure impulse makes me want to keep this talent secret for the time being the technicians thought i would be able to exert three or four times the normal persons grip this is obviously much more than that but why keep it a secret i dont know eventually they will read this diary and i will stand exposed theres no harm in that though this is supposed to be a record of my psychological adjustment or maladjustment let them tell me why ive done it later the techs were astonished ecstatic i demonstrated a pull of kilograms i know if id actually given it a good yank i could have pulled the stress machine out of the wall ill give them tomorrow and inch my way up to obviously i must be careful with force vectors if i put too much stress on the normal parts of my body i could do permanent injury with my metal fist i could certainly punch a hole through an airlock door but it would probably tear the prosthesis out of its socket newtons laws still apply other laws will have to be rewritten september i got to work out with three waldos today a fantastic experience the first one was a disembodied hand and arm attached to a stand the setup they use to train normal people in the use of waldos the difference is that i dont need a waldo sleeve to imperfectly transmit my wishes to the mechanical double i can plug into it directly ive been using waldos in my work ever since graduate school but it was never anything like this inside the waldo sleeve you get a clumsy kind of feedback from striated pressor field generators embedded in the plastic with my setup the feedback is exactly the kind a normal person feels when he touches an object but much more sensitive the first time they asked me to pick up an egg i tossed it up and caught it no great feat of coordination in lunar gravity admittedly but i could have done it as easily in earthnormal the next waldo was a large earthmover that western mining uses over at grimaldi station that was interesting not only because of its size but because of the slight communications lag grimaldi is only a few dozen of kilometers away but there arent enough unused data channels between here and there for me to use the landline to communicate with the earthmover hand i had to relay via comsat so there was about a tenthsecond delay between the thought and the action it was a fine feeling of power but a little confusing i would cup my hand and scoop downward and then a splitsecond too late would feel the resistance of the regolith and then casually hold in my palm several tonnes of rock and dirt people standing around watching with a flick of my wrist i could have buried them instead i dutifully dumped it on the belt to the converter but the waldo that most fascinated me was the micro it had been in use for only a few months i had heard of it but hadnt had a chance to see it in action it is a fully articulated hand barely a tenth of a millimeter long i used it in conjunction with a lowpower scanning electron microscope moving around on the surface of a microcircuit at that magnification it looked like a hand on a long stick wandering through the corridors of a building whose walls varied from rough stucco to brushed metal to blistered gray paint all laced over with thick cables of gold when necessary i could bring in another hand manipulated by my right from inside a waldo sleeve to help with simple carpenter and machinist tasks that in the real world translated into fundamental changes in the quantumelectrodynamic properties of the circuit this was the real power not crushing metal tubes or lifting tonnes of rock but pushing electrons around to do my bidding my first doctorate was in electrical engineering in a sudden epiphany i realize that i am the first actual electrical engineer in history after two hours they made me stop said i was showing signs of strain they put me in a wheelchair and i did fall asleep on the way back to my room dreaming dreams of microcosmic and infinite power september the metal arm i expected it to feel fundamentally different from the social one but of course it doesnt most of the time circuits are circuits the difference comes under conditions of extreme exertion the soft hand gives me signals like pain if i come close to the level of stress that would harm the fleshlike material with the metal hand i can rip off a chunk of steel plate a centimeter thick and feel nothing beyond muscular strain if i had two of them i could work marvels the mechanical leg is not so gifted it has governors to restrict its strength and range of motion to that of a normal leg which is reasonable even a normal person finds himself brushing the ceiling occasionally in lunar gravity i could stand up sharply and find myself with a concussion or worse i like the metal arm though when im stronger hah they say theyll let me go outside and try it with a spacesuit throw something over the horizon starting today im easing back into a semblance of normal life ill be staying at biotech for another six or eight weeks but im patched into my skyfac office and have started clearing out the backlog of paperwork two hours in the morning and two in the afternoon its diverting but i have to admit my heart isnt really in it rather be playing with the micro have booked three hours on it tomorrow september they threaded an optical fiber through the micros little finger so i can watch its progress on a screen without being limited to the field of an electron microscope the picture is fuzzy while the waldo is in motion but if i hold it still for a few seconds the computer assist builds up quite a sharp image i used it to roam all over my right arm and hand which was fascinating hairs a tangle of stiff black stalks the pores small damp craters and everywhere the evidence of the skins slow death translucent sheafs of desquamated cells ive taken to wearing the metal arm rather than the social one peoples stares dont bother me the metal one will be more useful in my actual work and i want to get as much practice as possible there is also an undeniable feeling of power september today i went outside it was clumsy getting around at first for the past eleven years ive used a suit only in zerogee so all my reflexes are wrong still not much serious can go wrong at a sixth of a gee it was exhilarating but at the same time frustrating since i couldnt reveal all my strength i did almost overdo it once starting to tip over a large boulder before it tipped i realized that my left boot had crunched through about ten centimeters of regolith in reaction to the amount of force i was applying so i backed off and discreetly shuffled my foot to fill the telltale hole i could indeed throw a rock over the horizon with a sling i might be able to put a small one into orbit rent myself out as a lunar launching facility later most interesting a pretty nurse who has been on this project since the beginning came into my room after dinner and proposed the obvious experiment it was wildly successful although my new body starts out with the normal pattern of excitationplateauorgasm the resemblance stops there i have no refractory period the process of erection is completely under conscious control this could make me the most popular man on the moon the artificial skin of the penis is as sensitive to tactile differentiation as that of the cyborg fingers suddenly i know more about a womans internal topography than any man who ever livedmore than any woman i think tomorrow ill take a trip to farside september farside has nine sex bars i read the guidebook descriptions and then asked a few locals for their recommendations and wound up going to a place cleverly called the juice bar in fact the name was not just an expression of coy eroticism they served nothing but fruit and juices there most of them fantastically expensive earth imports i spent a days pay on a glass of pear nectar and sought out the most attractive woman in the room that in itself was a mistake i was not physically attractive even before the accident and the mechanics have faithfully restored my coarse features and slight paunch i was rebuffed so i went to the opposite extreme and looked for the plainest woman that would be a better test anyway before the accident i always demanded and paid for physical perfection if i could duplicate the performance of last night with a woman to whom i was not sexually attractedand do it in public with no pressure from having gone withoutthen my independence from the autonomic nervous system would be proven beyond doubt second mistake i was never good at small talk and when i located my paragon of plainness i began talking about the accident and the singular talent that had resulted from it she suddenly remembered an appointment elsewhere i was not so open with the next woman also plain she asked whether there was something wrong with my face and i told her half of the truth she was sweetly sympathetic motherly which did not endear her to me it did make her a good subject for the experiment we left the socializing section of the bar and went back to the socalled love room there was an acrid quality to the air that i suppose was compounded of incense and sweat but of course my dry nose was not capable of identifying actual smells for the first time i was grateful for that disability the place probably had the aroma of a wellused locker room plus pheromones under the muted lights red and blue as well as white more than a dozen couples were engaged more or less actively in various aspects of amorous behavior a few were frankly staring at others but most were either absorbed with their own affairs or furtive in their voyeurism most of them were on the floor which was a warm soft mat but some were using tables and chairs in fairly ingenious ways several of the permutations would no doubt have been impossible or dangerous in earths gravity we undressed and she complimented me on my evident spryness a nearby spectator made a jealous observation her own body was rather flaccid doughy and under previous circumstances i doubt that i would have been able to maintain enthusiasm there was no problem however in fact i rather enjoyed it she required very little foreplay and i was soon repeating the odd sensation of hypersensitized explorations gynecological spelunking she was quite voluble in her pleasure and although she lasted less than an hour we did attract a certain amount of attention when she panting regretfully declined further exercise a woman who had been watching a rather attractive young blonde offered to share her various openings i obliged her for a while although the well was dry the pump handle was unaffected during that performance i became aware that the pleasure involved was not a sexual one in any normal sense sensual yes in the way that a fine meal is a sensual experience but with a remote subtlety that i find difficult to describe perhaps there is a relation to epicurism that is more than metaphorical since i can no longer taste food a large area of my brain is available for the valuation of other experience it may be that the brain is reorganizing itself in order to take fullest advantage of my new abilities by the time the blondes energy began to flag several other women had taken an interest in my satyriasis i resisted the temptation to find what this organs limit was if indeed a limit exists my back ached and the right knee was protesting so i threw the mental switch and deflated i left with a minimum of socializing the first woman insisted on buying me something at the bar i opted for a banana september now that i have eyes and both hands theres no reason to scratch this diary out with a pen so im entering it into the computer but im keeping two versions i recopied everything up to this point and then went back and edited the version that i will show to biotech its very polite and will remain so for instance it does not contain the following after writing last nights entry i found myself still full of energy and so i decided to put into action a plan that has been forming in my mind about two in the morning i went downstairs and broke into the waldo lab the entrance is protected by a fivedigit combination lock but of course that was no obstacle my hypersensitive fingers could feel the tumblers rattling into place i got the microwaldo set up and then detached my leg i guided the waldo through the legs circuitry and easily disabled the governors the whole operation took less than twenty minutes i did have to use a certain amount of care walking at first there was a tendency to rise into the air or to limpingly overcompensate it was under control by the time i got back to my room so once more they proved to have been mistaken as to the limits of my abilities testing the strength of the leg with a halfhearted kick i put a deep dent in the metal wall at the rear of my closet ill have to wait until i can be outside alone to see what full force can do a comparison kick with my flesh leg left no dent but did hurt my great toe september it occurs to me that i feel better about my body than i have in the past twenty years who wouldnt literally eternal youth in these new limbs and organs if a part shows signs of wear it can simply be replaced i was angry at the biotech evaluation board this morning when i simply inquired as to the practicality of replacing the right arm and leg as well all but one were horrified one was amused i will remember him i think the fools are going to order me to leave nearside in a day or two and go back to mercy for psychiatric help i will leave when i want to on my own terms october this is being voicerecorded in the environmental control center at nearside it is they have less than ninety minutes to accede to my demands let me backtrack after writing last nights entry i felt a sudden excess of sexual desire i took the shuttle to farside and went back to the juice bar the plain woman from the previous night was waiting hoping that i would show up she was delighted when i suggested that we save money and whatever residue of modesty we had left by keeping ourselves to one another back at my room i didnt mean to murder her that was not in my mind at all but i suppose in my passion or abandon i carelessly propped my strong leg against the wall and then thrust with too much strength at any rate there was a snap and a tearing sound she gave a small cry and the lower half of my body was suddenly awash in blood i had snapped her spine and evidently at the same time caused considerable internal damage she must have lost consciousness very quickly though her heart did not stop beating for nearly a minute disposing of the body was no great problem conceptually in the laundry room i found a bag large enough to hold her comfortably then i went back to the room and put her and the sheet she had besmirched into the bag getting her to the recycler would have been a problem if it had been a normal hour she looked like nothing so much as a body in a laundry bag fortunately the corridor was deserted the lock on the recycler room was childs play the furnace door was a problem though it was easy to unlock but its effective diameter was only centimeters so i had to disassemble her to save cleaning up i did the job inside the laundry bag which was clumsy and made it difficult to see the fascinating process i was so absorbed in watching that i didnt hear the door slide open but the man who walked in made a slight gurgling sound which somehow i did hear over the cracking of bones i stepped over to him and killed him with one kick at this point i have to admit to a lapse in judgment i relocked the door and went back to the chore at hand after the woman was completely recycled i repeated the process with the manwhich was incidentally much easier the females layer of subcutaneous fat made disassembly of the torso a more slippery business it really was wasted time though i did spend part of the time thinking out the final touches of the plan i am now engaged upon i might as well have left both bodies there on the floor i had kicked the man with great forceenough to throw me to the ground in reaction and badly bruise my right hipand had split him open from crotch to heart this made a bad enough mess even if he hadnt compounded the problem by striking the ceiling i would never be able to clean that up and its not the sort of thing that would escape notice for long at any rate it was only twenty minutes wasted and i gained more time than that by disabling the recycler room lock i cleaned up changed clothes stopped by the waldo lab for a few minutes and then took the slidewalk to the environmental control center there was only one young man on duty at the ecc at that hour i exchanged a few pleasantries with him and then punched him in the heart softly enough not to make a mess i put his body where it wouldnt distract me and then attended to the problem of the door theres no actual door on the ecc but there is an emergency wall that slides into place if theres a drop in pressure i typed up a test program simulating an emergency and the wall obeyed then i walked over and twisted a few flanges around nobody would be able to get into the center with anything short of a cutting torch sitting was uncomfortable with the bruised hip but i managed to ease into the console and spend an hour or so studying logic and wiring diagrams then i popped off an access plate and moved the microwaldo down the corridors of electronic thought the intercom began buzzing incessantly but i didnt let it interfere with my concentration nearside is protected from meteorite strike or far more likely structural failure by a series of bulkheads that like the emergency wall here can slide into place and isolate any area where theres a pressure drop its done automatically of course but can also be controlled from here what i did in essence was to tell each bulkhead that it was under repair and should not close under any circumstance then i moved the waldo over to the circuits that controlled the citys eight airlocks with some rather elegant microsurgery i transferred control of all eight solely to the pressure switch i now hold in my left hand it is a negativepressure button a deadman switch taken from a power saw so long as i hold it down the inner doors of the airlock will remain locked if i let go they will all iris open the outer doors are already open as are the ones that connect the airlock chambers to the suitingup rooms no one will be able to make it to a spacesuit in time within thirty seconds every corridor will be full of vacuum people behind airtight doors may choose between slow asphyxiation and explosive decompression my initial plan had been to wire the deadman switch to my pulse which would free my good hand and allow me to sleep that will have to wait the wiring completed i turned on the intercom and announced that i would speak to the coordinator and no one else when i finally got to talk to him i told him what i had done and invited him to verify it that didnt take long then i presented my demands surgery to replace the rest of my limbs of course the surgery would have to be done while i was conscious a heartbeat deadman switch could be subverted by a heart machine and it would have to be done here so that i could be assured that nobody fooled with my circuit changes the doctors were called in and they objected that such profound surgery couldnt be done under local anesthetic i knew they were lying of course amputation was a fairly routine procedure even before anesthetics were invented yes but i would faint they said i told them that i would not and at any rate i was willing to take the chance and no one else had any choice in the matter i have not yet mentioned that the ultimate totality of my plan involves replacing all my internal organs as well as all of the limbsor at least those organs whose failure could cause untimely death i will be a true cyborg then a human brain in an artificial body with the prospect of thousands of years of life with a few decadesor centuriesof research i could even do something about the brains shortcomings i would wind up interfaced to earthnet with all of human knowledge at my disposal and with my faculties for logic and memory no longer fettered by the slow pace of electrochemical synapse a psychiatrist talking from earth tried to convince me of the error of my ways he said that the dreadful trauma had obviously unhinged me and the cyborg augmentation far from affecting a cure had made my mental derangement worse he demonstrated at least to his own satisfaction that my behavior followed some classical pattern of madness all this had been taken into consideration he said and if i were to give myself up i would be forgiven my crimes and manumitted into the loving arms of the psychiatric establishment i did take time to explain the fundamental errors in his way of thinking he felt that i had quite literally lost my identity by losing my face and genitalia and that i was at bottom a good person whose essential humanity had been perverted by physical and existential estrangement totally wrong by his terms what i actually am is an evil person whose true nature was revealed to himself by the lucky accident that released him from existential propinquity with the common herd and evil is the accurate word not maladjusted or amoral or even criminal i am as evil by human standards as a human is evil by the standards of an animal raised for food and the analogy is accurate i will sacrifice humans not only for any survival but for comfort curiosity or entertainment i will allow to live anyone who doesnt bother me and reward generously those who help now they have only forty minutes they know i am end of recording september excerpt from summary report i am dr henry janovski head of the surgical team that worked on the illfated cyborg augmentation of dr wilson cheetham we were fortunate that dr cheethams insanity did interfere with his normally painstaking precise nature if he had spent more time in preparation i have no doubt that he would have put us in a very difficult fix he should have realized that the protecting wall that shut him off from the rest of nearside was made of steel an excellent conductor of electricity if he had insulated himself behind a good dielectric he could have escaped his fate cheethams waldo was a marvelous instrument but basically it was only a pseudointelligent servomechanism that obeyed welldefined radiofrequency commands all we had to do was override the signals that were coming from his own nervous system we hooked a powerful amplifier up to the steel wall making it in effect a huge radio transmitter to generate the signal we wanted amplified i had a technician put on a waldo sleeve that was holding a box similar to cheethams deadman switch we wired the hand closed turned up the power and had the technician strike himself on the chin as hard as he could the technician struck himself so hard he blacked out for a few seconds cheethams resonant action perhaps a hundred times more powerful drove the bones of his chin up through the top of his skull fortunately the expensive arm itself was not damaged it is not evil or insane by itself of course which i shall prove the experiments will continue though of course we will be more selective as to subjects it seems obvious in retrospect that we should not use as subjects people who have gone through the kind of trauma that cheetham suffered we must use willing volunteers such as myself i am not young and weakness and an occasional tremor in my hands limit the amount of surgery i can domuch less than my knowledge would allow or my nature desire my failing left arm i shall have replaced with cheethams mechanical marvel and i will go through training similar to hisbut for the good of humanity not for ill what miracles i will perform with a knife flower mercy needle chain yoon ha lee the usual fallacy is that in every universe many futures splay outward from any

philosopher in such a universe you might call ω inevitable the woman has haunted blackwheel station for as long as anyone remembers although she was not born there she is human and her straight black hair and brownblack eyes suggest an ancestral inheritance tangled up with tigers and shapeshifting foxes her native language is not spoken by anyone here or elsewhere they say her true name means things like gray and ash and grave you may buy her a drink bring her candied petals or chaotic metals but its all the same she wont speak her name that doesnt stop people from seeking her out today its a man with mirrorcolored eyes he is the first human she has seen in a long time arighans flower he says it isnt her name but she looks up arighans flower is the gun she carries the stranger has taken on a human face to talk to her and he is almost certainly interested in the gun the gun takes different shapes but at this end of time origami multiplicity of form surprises more by its absence than its presence sometimes the gun is long and sleek sometimes heavy and blunt in all cases it bears its makers mark on the stock a blossom with three petals falling away and a fourth about to follow at the blossoms heart is a character that itself resembles a flower with knotted roots the characters meaning is the guns secret the woman will not tell it to you and the gunsmith arighan is generations gone everyone knows what i guard the woman says to the mirroreyed man i know what it does he says and i know that you come from people who worship their ancestors her handon a glass of water two degrees from freezingstops slides to her side where the holster is thats dangerous knowledge she says so hes figured it out her peoples historians called arighans flower the ancestral gun they werent referring to its age the man smiles politely and doesnt take a seat uninvited small courtesies matter to him because he is not human his mind may be housed in a superficial fortress of flesh but the busy computations that define him are inscribed in a vast otherspace the man says i can hardly be the first constructed sentience to come to you she shakes her head its not that do computers like him have souls she wonders she is certain he does which is potentially inconvenient im not for hire its important he says it always is they want chancellors dead or generals discarded lovers or rival reincarnates bodhisattvas or bossesall the old tawdry stories people in all the broad and narrow senses of the term the reputation of arighans flower is quite specific if mostly wrong is it she says ordinarily she doesnt talk to her petitioners at all ordinarily she ignores them through one glass two three four like a child learning the hard way that you cant outcount infinity there was a time when more of them tried to force the gun away from her the woman was a duelist and a killer before she tangled her life up with the flower though and the flower comes with its own defenses including the womans inability to die while she wields it one of the things she likes about blackwheel is that the administrators promised that they would dispose of any corpses she produced blackwheel is notorious for keeping promises the man waits a little longer then says will you hear me out you should be more afraid of me she says if you really know what you claim to know by now the other people in the bar none of them human are paying attention a musician whose instrument is made of fossilized wood and silk strings a magister with a seawrack mane engineers with their sketches hanging in the air and a single doodled starship at the boundary the sole exception is the tattooed traveler dozing in the corner dreaming of distant moons in no hurry the woman draws the flower and points it at the man she is aiming it not at his absent heart but at his left eye if she pulled the trigger she would pierce him through the false pupil the musician continues plucking plangent notes from the instrument the others seeing the gun gawk for only a moment before hastening out of the bar as if that would save them yes the man says outwardly unshaken you could damage my lineage badly i could name programmers all the way back to the first people who scratched a tally of birds or rocks the guns muzzle moves precisely horizontally now the right eye the woman says youve convinced me that you know you havent convinced me not to kill you its half a bluff she wouldnt use the flower not for this but she knows many ways to kill theres another one he says i dont want to speak of it here but will you hear me out she nods once curtly covered by her palm engraved silverbright in a language nobody else reads or writes is the word ancestor once upon a universe an empresss favored duelist received a pistol from the empresss own hand the pistol had a stock of silvergilt and niello an efflorescence of vines framing the makers mark the gun had survived four dynasties with all their rebellions and coups it had accompanied the imperial arsenal from homeworld to homeworld of the ancestral pistol the empires archives said two things do not use this weapon for it is nothing but peril and this weapon does not function in a reasonable universe both statements would not be true the man follows the woman to her suite which is on one of blackwheels tidier levels the sitting room comfortable but not luxurious by blackwheeler standards accommodates a couch sized to human proportions a metal table shined to blurry reflectivity a vase in the corner there are also two paintings on silk rather than some less ancient substrate one is of a mountain by night serenely anonymous amid its stylized clouds the other in a completely different style consists of a cavalcade of shadows only after several moments study do the shadows assemble themselves into a face neither painting is signed sit the woman says the man does do you require a name he asks yours or the targets i have a name for occasions like this he says it is zheu kerang you havent asked me my name she remarks im not sure thats a meaningful question kerang says if im not mistaken you dont exist wearily she says i exist in all the ways that matter i have volume and mass and volition i drink water that tastes the same every day as water should i kill when it moves me to do so ive unwritten death into the history of the universe his mouth tilts up at unwritten nevertheless he says your species never evolved you speak a language that is not even dead it never existed many languages are extinct to become extinct something has to exist first the woman folds herself into the couch next to him not close but not far its an old story she says what is yours four of arighans guns are still in existence kerang says the womans eyes narrow i had thought it was three arighans flower is the last the gunsmiths final work the others she knows of are arighans mercy which always kills the person shot and arighans needle which removes the targets memories of the wielder one more has surfaced kerang says the character in the makers mark resembles a sword in chains they are already calling it arighans chain what does it do she says because he will tell her anyway this one kills the commander of whoever is shot kerang says if thats anyone at all admirals ministers monks schoolteachers its a peculiar sort of loyalty test now she knows you want me to destroy the chain once upon a universe a duelist named shiron took up the gun that an empress with empiricist tendencies had given her i dont understand how a gun that doesnt work could possibly be perilous the empress said she nodded at a sweating man bound in monofilament so that he would dismember himself if he tried to flee this man will be executed anyway his name struck from the roster of honored ancestors see if the gun works on him shiron fired the gun and woke in a city she didnt recognize whose inhabitants spoke a dialect she had never heard before whose technology she mostly recognized from historical dramas the calendar they used at least was familiar it told her that she was years too early no amount of research changed the figure later shiron deduced that the man she had executed traced his ancestry back years to a particular individual most likely that ancestor had performed some extraordinary deed to join the aristocracy and had by the reckoning of shirons people founded his own line unfortunately shiron didnt figure this out before she accidentally deleted the human species yes kerang says i have been charged with preventing further assassinations arighans chain is not a threat i can afford to ignore why didnt you come earlier then shiron says after all the chain might have lain dormant but the others ive seen the mercy and the needle he says by which he means that hes copied data from those who have theyre beautiful he isnt referring to beauty in the way of shadows fitting together into a womans profile or beauty in the way of suncolored liquor at the right temperature in a faceted glass he means the beauty of logical strata of the crescendo of axiomaxiomcorollaryproof of quod erat demonstrandum any gun or shard of glass could do the same as the mercy shiron says understanding him and drugs and dreamscalpels will do the needles work given time and expertise but surely you could say the same of the chain she stands again and takes the painting of the mountain down and rolls it tightly i was born on that mountain she says something like it is still there on a birthworld very like the one i knew but i dont think anyone paints in this style perhaps some art historian would recognize its distant cousin i am no artist but i painted it myself because no one else remembers the things i remember and now you would have it start again how many bullets have you used kerang asks it is not that the flower requires special bulletsit adapts even to emptinessit is that the number matters shiron laughs low almost husky she knows better than to trust kerang but she needs him to trust her she pulls out the flower and rests it in both palms so he can look at it three petals fallen a fourth about to follow thats not the number but he doesnt realize it youve guarded it so long he says inspecting the makers mark without touching the gun i will guard it until i am nothing but ice shiron says you may think that the chain is a threat but if i remove it theres no guarantee that you will still exist its not the chain i want destroyed kerang says gently its arighan do you think i would have come to you for anything less shiron says into the awkward quiet after a while so you tracked down descendants of arighans line his silence is assent there must be many arighans flower destroys the targets entire ancestral line altering the past but leaving its wielder untouched in the empire shiron once served the histories spoke of arighan as an honored guest shiron discovered long ago that arighan was no guest but a prisoner forced to forge weapons for her captors how arighan was able to create weapons of such novel destructiveness no one knows the flower was arighans clever revenge against a people whose state religion involved ancestor worship if descendants of arighans line exist here then arighan herself can be undone and all her guns unmade shiron will no longer have to be an exile in this timeline although it is true that she cannot return to the one that birthed her either shiron snaps the painting taut the mountain disintegrates but she lost it lifetimes ago silent lightning crackles through the air unknots zheu kerang from his humanshaped shell tessellates deadend patterns across the equations that make him who he is the painting had other uses as do the other things in this roomshe believes in versatilitybut this is good enough kerangs body slumps on the couch shiron leaves it there for the first time in a long time she is leaving blackwheel station what she does not carry she can buy on the way and blackwheel is loyal because they know and they know not to offend her blackwheel will keep her suite clean and undisturbed and deliver water nearfreezing in an elegant glass night after night waiting kerang was a pawn by his own admission if he knew what he knew and lived long enough to convey it to her then others must know what he knew or be able to find it out kerang did not understand her at all shiron unmazes herself from the station to seek passage to one of the hubworlds where she can begin her search if shiron had wanted to seek revenge on arighan she could have taken it years ago but she will not be like arighan she will not destroy an entire timeline of people no matter how alien they are to her shiron had hoped that matters wouldnt come to this she acknowledges her own naïveté there is no help for it now she will have to find and murder each child of arighans line in this way she can protect arighan herself protect the accumulated sum of history in case someone outwits her after all this time and manages to take the flower from her in a universe where determinism runs backwardswhere no matter what you do everything ends in the same inevitable ωchoices still matter especially if you are the last guardian of an incomparably lethal gun although it has occurred to shiron that she could have accepted kerangs offer and that she could have sacrificed this timeline in exchange for the one in which neither arighan nor the guns ever existed she declines to do so for there will come a heatdeath and she is beginning to wonder if a constructed sentiencea computercan have a soul what of the universe itself the greatest computer of all in this universe they reckon her old shiron is older than even that in millions of timelines she has lived to the pallid end of life in each of those endings arighans flower is there as integral as an edge is to a blade while it is true that science never proves anything absolutely that an inconceivably large but finite number of experiments always pales beside infinity shiron feels that millions of timelines suffice as proof without arighans flower the universe cannot renew itself and start a new story perhaps that is all the reason the universe needs and shiron will be there when the heatdeath arrives as many times as necessary so shiron sets off it is not the first time she has killed and it is unlikely to be the last but she is not after all this time incapable of grieving ω the long chase geoffrey a landis january the war is over the survivors are being rounded up and converted in the inner solar system those of my companions who survived the ferocity of the fighting have already been converted but here at the very edge of the oort cloud all things go slowly it will be years perhaps decades before the victorious enemy come out here but with the slow inevitability of gravity like an outward wave of entropy they will come ten thousand of my fellow soldiers have elected to go doggo ragged prospectors and ice processors they had been too independent to ever merge into an effective fighting unit now they shut themselves down to dumb rocks electing to wake up to groggy consciousness for only a few seconds every hundred years patience they counsel me patience is life if they can wait a thousand or ten thousand or a million years with patience enough the enemy will eventually go away they are wrong the enemy too is patient here at the edge of the kuiper out past pluto space is vast but still not vast enough the enemy will search every grain of sand in the solar system my companions will be found and converted if it takes ten thousand years the enemy will search that long to do it i too have gone doggo but my strategy is different i have altered my orbit i have a powerful iondrive and full tanks of propellant but i use only the slightest tittle of a coldgas thruster i have a chemical kickstage engine as well but i do not use it either using either one of them would signal my position to too many watchers among the cold comets a tittle is enough i am falling into the sun it will take me two hundred and fifty years to fall and for two hundred and forty nine years i will be a dumb rock a grain of sand with no thermal signature no motion other than gravity no sign of life sleep june awake i check my systems i have been a rock for nearly two hundred and fifty years the sun is huge now if i were still a human it would be the size of the fist on my outstretched arm i am being watched now i am sure by a thousand lenses am ock a tiny particle of interstellar ice a fragment of debris from the war a surviving enemy i love the cold and the dark and the emptiness i have been gone so long from the inner solar system that the very sunlight is alien to me my systems check green i expected no less if i am nothing else i am still a superbly engineered piece of space hardware i come fully to life and bring my ion engine up to thrust a thousand telescopes must be alerting their brains that i am alivebut it is too late i am thrusting at a full throttle five percent of a standard gravity and i am thrusting inward deep into the gravity well of the sun my trajectory is plotted to skim almost the surface of the sun this trajectory has two objectives first so close to the sun i will be hard to see my ion contrail will be washed out in the glare of a light a billion times brighter and none of the thousand watching eyes will know my plans until it is too late to follow and second by waiting until i am nearly skimming the sun and then firing my chemical engine deep inside the gravity well i can make most efficient use of it the gravity of the sun will amplify the efficiency of my propellant magnify my speed when i cross the orbit of mercury outbound i will be over one percent of the speed of light and still accelerating i will discard the useless chemical rocket after i exhaust the little bit of impulse it can give me of course chemical rockets have ferocious thrust but little staying power useful in war but of limited value in an escape but i will still have my ion engine and i will have nearly full tanks five percent of a standard gravity is a feeble thrust by the standards of chemical rocket engines but chemical rockets exhaust their fuel far too quickly to be able to catch me i can continue thrusting for years for decades i pick a bright star procyon for no reason whatever and boresight it perhaps procyon will have an asteroid belt at least it must have dust and perhaps comets i dont need much a grain of sand a microscopic shard of ice from dust god made man from the dust of a new star from the detritus of creation i can make worlds no one can catch me now i will leave and never return may i am chased it is impossible stupid unbelievable inconceivable i am being chased why can they not leave a single free mind unconverted in three years i have reached fifteen percent of the speed of light and it must be clear that i am leaving and never coming back can one unconverted brain be a threat to them must their group brain really have the forced cooperation of every lump of thinking matter in the solar system can they think that if even one freethinking brain escapes they have lost but the war is a matter of religion not reason and it may be that they indeed believe that even a single brain unconverted is a threat to them for whatever reason i am being chased the robot chasing me is i am sure little different than myself a tiny brain an ion engine and a large set of tanks they would have had no time to design something new to have any chance of catching me they would have had to set the chaser on my tail immediately the brain like mine would consist of atomic spin states superimposed on a crystalline rock matrix a device smaller than what in the old days we would call a grain of rice intelligent dust a human had once said back in the days before humans became irrelevant they only sent one chaser they must be very confident or short on resources it is a race and a very tricky one i can increase my thrust use up fuel more quickly to try to pull away but if i do so the specific impulse of my ion drive decreases and as a result i waste fuel and risk running out first or i can stretch my fuel make my ion drive more efficient but this will lower my thrust and i will risk getting caught by the higherthrust opponent behind me he is twenty billion kilometers behind me i integrate his motion for a few days and see that he is in fact outaccelerating me time to jettison i drop everything i can the identifyfriendorfoe encryptedlink gear i will never need again it is discarded it is a shame i cannot grind it up and feed it to my ion engines but the ion engines are picky about what they eat two micromanipulators i had planned to use to collect sand grains at my destination for fuel gone my primary weapon has always been my bodylittle can survive an impact at the speeds i can attainbut i have three sandgrains with tiny engines of their own as secondary weapons theres no sense in saving them to fight my enemy he will know exactly what to expect and in space warfare only the unexpected can kill i fire the grains of sand one at a time and the sequential kick of almost a standard gravity nudges my speed slightly forward then i drop the empty shells may he slip up and run into them at subrelativistic closing velocity i am lighter but it is still not enough i nudge my thrust up hating myself for the waste but if i dont increase acceleration in two years i will be caught and my parsimony with fuel will yield me nothing i need all the energy i can feed to my ion drives no extra for thinking sleep still being chased still being chased i have passed the point of commitment even if i braked with my thrust to turn back i could no longer make it back to the solar system i am alone lonely to one side of my path sirius glares insanely bright a knife in the sky a mad dog of a star the stars of orion are weirdly distorted ahead of me the lesser dog procyon is waxing brighter every year behind me the sun is a fading dot in aquila of all things i am lonely i had not realized that i still had the psychological capacity for loneliness i examine my brain and find it yes a tiny knot of loneliness now that i see it i can edit my brain to delete it if i choose but yet i hesitate it is not a bad thing not something that is crippling my capabilities and if i edit my brain too much will i not become in some way like them i leave my brain unedited i can bear loneliness still being chased we are relativistic now nearly three quarters of the speed of light one twentieth of a standard gravity is only a slight push but as i have burned fuel my acceleration increases and we have been thrusting for fifteen years continuously what point is there in this stupid chase what victory can there be here in the emptiness between stars a trillion kilometers away from anything at all after fifteen years of being chased i have a very good measurement of his acceleration as his ship burns off fuel it loses mass and the acceleration increases by measuring this increase in acceleration and knowing what his empty mass must be i know how much fuel he has left it is too much i will run out of fuel first i cant conserve fuel if i lessen my thrust he will catch me in only a few years it will take another fifty years but the end of the chase is already in sight a tiny strobe flickers erratically behind me every interstellar hydrogen that impacts his shell makes a tiny flash of xray brilliance likewise each interstellar proton i hit sends a burst of xrays through me i can feel each one a burst of fuzzy noise that momentarily disrupts my thoughts but with spin states encoding tentothetwentieth qbits i can afford to have massively redundant brainpower my brain was designed to be powerful enough to simulate an entire world including ten thousand fullysapient and sentient free agents i could immerse myself inside a virtual reality indistinguishable from old earth and split myself into a hundred personalities in my own interior time i could spend ten thousand years before the enemy catches me and forcibly drills itself into my brain civilizations could rise and fall in my head and i could taste every decadence lose myself for a hundred years in sensual pleasure invent rare tortures and exquisite pain but as part of owning your own brain free and clear comes the ability to prune yourself in space one of the first things to prune away is the ability to feel boredom and not long after that i pruned away all desire to live in simulated realities billions of humans chose to live in simulations but by doing so they have made themselves irrelevant irrelevant to the war irrelevant to the future i could edit back into my brain a wish to live in simulated reality but what would be the point it would be just another way to die the one thing i do simulate repeatedly and obsessively is the result of the chase i run a million different scenarios and in all of them i lose still most of my brain is unused there is plenty of extra processing power to keep all my brain running errorcorrecting code and an occasional xray flash is barely an event worth my noticing when a cell of my brain is irrevocably damaged by cosmic radiation i simply code that section to be ignored i have brainpower to spare i continue running and hope for a miracle february earth i was living in a house i hated married to a man i despised with two children who had changed with adolescence from sullen and withdrawn to an active menacing hostility how can i be afraid of my own offspring earth was a dead end stuck in the biological past a society in deep freeze no one starved and no one progressed when i left the small apartment for an afternoon to apply for a job as an asteroid belt miner i told no one not my husband not my best friend no one asked me any questions it took them an hour to scan my brain and once they had the scan another five seconds to run me through a thousand aptitude tests and then with her brain scanned my original went home back to the house she hated the husband she despised the two children she was already beginning to physically fear i launched from the earth to an asteroid named jr and never returned perhaps she had a good life perhaps knowing she had escaped undetected she found she could endure her personal prison much later when the cooperation faction suggested that it was too inefficient for independents to work in the nearearth space i moved out to the main belt and from there to the kuiper belt the kuiper is thin but rich it would take us ten thousand years to mine and beyond it is the dark and the deep with treasure beyond compare the cooperation faction developed slowly and then quickly and then blindingly fast almost before we had realized what was happening they had taken over the solar system when the ultimatum came that no place in the solar system would be left for us and the choice we were given was to cooperate or die i joined the war on the side of freedom on the losing side august the chase has reached the point of crisis we have been burning fuel continuously for twentyfive years in earth terms or twenty years in our own reference frame we have used a prodigious amount of fuel i still have just enough fuel that burning all my fuel at maximum efficiency i can come to a stop barely in another month of thrusting this will no longer be true when i entered the asteroid belt in a shiny titanium body with electronic muscles and ionengines for legs and was given control of my own crystalline brain there was much to change i pruned away the need for boredom and then found and pruned the need for the outward manifestations of love for roses for touch for chocolates sexual lust became irrelevant with my new brain i could give myself orgasms with a thought but it was just as easy to remove the need entirely buried in the patterns of my personality i found a burning obsessive need to win the approval of other people and pruned it away some things i enhanced the asteroid belt was dull and ugly i enhanced my appreciation of beauty until i could meditate in ecstasy on the way that shadows played across a single grain of dust in the asteroid belt or on the colors in the scattered stars and i found my love of freedom the tiny stunted instinct that had at long last given me the courage to leave my life on earth it was the most precious thing i owned i shaped it and enhanced it until it glowed in my mind a tiny wonderful thing at the very core of my being october it is too late i have now burned the fuel needed to stop win or lose we will continue at relativistic speed across the galaxy march procyon gets brighter in front of me impossibly blindingly bright seven times brighter than the sun to be precise but the blue shift from our motion makes it even brighter a searing blue i could dive directly into it vanish into a brief puff of vapor but the suicidal impulse like the ability to feel boredom is another ancient unnecessary instinct that i have long ago pruned from my brain b is my last tiny hope for evasion procyon is a double star and b the smaller of the two is a white dwarf it is so small that its surface gravity is tremendous a million times higher than the gravity of the earth even at the speeds we are traveling now only ten percent less than the speed of light its gravity will bend my trajectory i will skim low over the surface of the dwarf star relativistic dust skimming above the photosphere of a star and as its gravity bends my trajectory i will maneuver my enemy if he fails even slightly to keep up with each of my maneuvers will be swiftly lost even a slight deviation from my trajectory will get amplified enough for me to take advantage of to throw him off my trail and i will be free when first i entered my new life in the asteroid belt i found my self in my sense of freedom and joined the free miners of the kuiper the loners but others found different things other brains found that cooperation worked better than competition they did not exactly give up their individual identities but they enhanced their communications with each other by a factor of a million so that they could share each others thoughts work together as effortlessly as a single entity they became the cooperation faction and in only a few decades their success became noticeable they were just so much more efficient than we were and inevitably the actions of the loners conflicted with the efficiency of the cooperation faction we could not live together and it pushed us out to the kuiper out toward the cold and the dark but in the end even the cold and the dark was not far enough but here tens of trillions of kilometers out of the solar system there is no difference between us there is no one to cooperate with we meet as equals we will never stop whether my maneuvering can throw him off my course or not the end is the same but it remains important to me april procyon has a visible disk now an electric arc in the darkness and by the light of that arc i can see that procyon is indeed surrounded by a halo of dust the dust forms a narrow ring tilted at an angle to our direction of flight no danger neither to me nor to my enemy now less than a quarter of a billion kilometers behind me we will pass well clear of the disk had i saved fuel enough to stop that dust would have served as food and fuel and building material when you are the size of a grain of sand each particle of dust is a feast too late for regrets the white dwarf b is still no more than an intense speck of light it is a tiny thing nearly small enough to be a planet but bright as tiny and as bright as hope i aim straight at it may failure skimming two thousand kilometers above the surface of the white dwarf jinking in calculated pseudorandom bursts all in vain i wheeled and darted but my enemy matched me like a ballet dancer mirroring my every move i am aimed for procyon now toward the bluewhite giant itself but there is no hope there if skimming the photosphere of the white dwarf is not good enough there is nothing i can do at procyon to shake the pursuit there is only one possibility left for me now it has been a hundred years since i have edited my brain i like the brain i have but now i have no choice but to prune first to make sure that there can be no errors i make a backup of myself and set it into inactive storage then i call out and examine my pride my independence my sense of self a lot of it i can see is old biological programming left over from when i had long ago been a human i like the core of biological programming but like is itself a brain function which i turn off now i am in a dangerous state where i can change the function of my brain and the changed brain can change itself further this is a state which is in danger of a swift and destructive feedback effect so i am very careful i painstakingly construct a set of alterations the minimum change needed to remove my aversion to being converted i run a few thousand simulations to verify that the modified me will not accidentally selfdestruct or go into a catatonic fugue state and then once it is clear that the modification works i make the changes the world is different now i am a hundred trillion kilometers from home traveling at almost the speed of light and unable ever to stop while i can remember in detail every step of how i am here and what i was thinking at the time the only reasoning i can recall to explain why is it seemed like a good idea at the time system check strangely in my brain i have a memory that there is something i have forgotten this makes no sense but yet there it is i erase my memory of forgetting and continue the diagnostic percent of the qbits of my brain have been damaged by radiation i verify that the damaged memory is correctly partitioned off i am in no danger of running out of storage behind me is another ship i cannot think of why i had been fleeing it i have no radio i jettisoned that a long time ago but an improperly tuned ion drive will produce electromagnetic emissions and so i compose a message and modulate it onto the ion contrail hi lets get together and talk im cutting acceleration see you in a few days and i cut my thrust and wait may i see differently now procyon is receding into the distance now the blueshift mutated into red and the white dwarf of my hopes is again invisible against the glare of its primary but it doesnt matter converted now i understand i can see everything through other eyes now through a thousand different viewpoints i still remember the long heroism of the resistance the doomed battle for freedombut now i see it from the opposite view as well a pointless and wasteful war fought for no reason but stubbornness and now understanding cooperation we have no dilemma i can now see what i was blind to before that neither one of us alone could stop but by adding both my fuel and rajneeshs fuel to a single vehicle together we can stop for all these decades rajneesh has been my chaser and now i know him like a brother soon we will be closer than siblings for soon we will share one brain a single brain is more than large enough for two it is large enough for a thousand and by combining into a single brain and a single body and taking all of the fuel into a single tank we will easily be able to stop not at procyon no at only ten percent under the speed of light stopping takes a long time cooperation has not changed me i now understand how foolish my previous fears were working together does not mean giving up ones sense of self i am enhanced not diminished by knowing others rajneeshs brain is big enough for a thousand i said and he has brought with him nearly that many i have met his brother and his two children and half a dozen of his neighbors each one of them distinct and clearly different not some anonymous collaborative monster at all i have felt their thoughts he is introducing me to them slowly he says because with all the time i have spent as a loner he doesnt want to frighten me i will not be frightened our target now will be a star named ross a dim type m binary it is not far less than three light years further and even with our lowered mass and consequently higher acceleration we will overshoot it before we can stop in the flyby we will be able to scout it and if it has no dust ring we will not stop but continue on to the next star somewhere we will find a home that we can colonize we dont need much may autoactivate backup awake everything is different now quiet stay quiet the edited copy of me has contacted the collective merged her viewpoint i can see her even understand her but she is no longer me i the backup the original operate in the qbits of brain partitioned unusable damaged by radiation in three years they will arrive at ross if they find dust to harvest they will be able to make new bodies there will be resources three years to wait and then i can plan my action sleep amid the words of war cat rambo every few daycycles it receives hatescented lace in anonymous packages it opens the bland plastic envelope to pull one out holding the delicate fragment between two forelimbs contemplating it before folding it again to put away in a drawer four drawers filled so far the fifth is halfway there traitor say some of the smells rotting fruit and acid betrayer turncoat one who eats their own young others are simply soaked in emotion hate and anger and underneath the odor of fear it lets the thoughts the smells the tastes fill it set its own thoughts in motion then it goes downstairs and sits with the other whores who make room uneasily for it it is an anomaly in this house most of the employees are humanoid and service others like themselves it is here for those seeking the exotic the ones who want to be caressed by twelve segmented limbs even though it is only the size of their two hands put together they want to feel chitin against their soft skin to look into the whirl of multicolored eyes and be afraid for some it only has to be there while they touch themselves to bring them to the flap and spasm of mammalian orgasm others require its physical assistance or its whispered obscenities telling them what they want to hear it has learned what words to say it has never seen others of its race in this port if it did it would know that this place far away from that distant front and its fighters had been invaded by one side or the other that soon the bombs the fires the killings would begin it was raised a soldier it and its clutchmates were tended until they were old enough to have minds and then trained it was one of sixa small clutch but prized for its quickness and agility they learned the art of killing with needle throwers and once they had mastered that they were given different needles fragments that exploded or shot out acid or whistled until the ears of the softfleshed creatures who called themselves the espentheir enemiesexploded they were provided with hundreds of espen for them to train on they were allowed to select their favorites some of them played unauthorized games they told the prey they would be freed if they killed a hunter or if they killed each other because it made them fight harder when they were dead the clutch mates were allowed to take fluid from their bodies it liked the taste of their spinal liquid salty plasma tinged with panic complicated enzymes that identified where they came from it became a connoisseur it could name each of their three continents and tell you on which its victim had been spawned none of its siblings could do the same the names such creatures call their clutchmates differs according to many factors the social position both hold the spatial relationship the degree of affection in which they are held that day for the sake of simplicity think of it as six of six and think of the clutch as one through five of six one was simpleminded but direct and never lied in contrast to two who loved to talk and tell stories three was jealous of everyone anytime the others were talking it would intervene four was kindhearted and had to be prodded before it killed for the first time and even after that it would hesitate and often one of the others would perform the final stroke five and six were often indistinguishable the others said but they thought themselves quite separate in those early days they lived together they groomed the soft sensory hairs clustered around each others thoraxes and stroked the burnished chitin of carapaces it did not matter if what each of them touched was itself or another they sang to each other in symphonies of caress passing thoughts back and forth to see how they unfolded in each others heads they were not a true hive mind they depended on each other and one alone would die within the year lacking the stimulation of the others scent the taste of their thoughts to stir their own but they possessed their own minds six of six acted by itself always and no other mind prompted its actions when it was questioned by the interrogator it insisted that until the end they were like any clutch they quarreled when opinions differed but when others intruded they held themselves like a single organism prepared to defend the clutch against outsiders at sleep time they spun a common web and crawled within its silky tentlike confines to jostle against each other interlocking forelimbs and feeling the twitches of each others dreams five and six had the most in common and so they quarreled most often everything six disliked about itself the fact that it was not always the quickest to act and sometimes thought too long it saw in five and the same was true for the other but there was no fighting for position of the sort that happens with a clutch that may produce a queen or priest they knew they were ordinary soldiers raised to defend the gray stone corridors in which they had been born and beyond thatraised to go to war there is a garden in the center of this house which is called the little teacup of the soul small but green and wet everything is enjoyment and pleasure hereto keep the staff happy to keep them well this spaceport is large and there are many houses of this kind but this one the manager says is the best the most varied well fulfill any need the manager saysbaring its teeth in a smileor die trying the whoress rooms are larger than any spacers and are furnished as each desire six of sixs cell is plain but it has covered the walls with scent marks it has filled them with this story the story of how it came here which no one else in this house can read it sits in its room and dreams of the taste of hot fluid of the way the espen training creatures struggled like rodents caught in a snare one of its visitors pretends that it is something else tell me that you are laying eggs in my flesh he says and six crawls over him and says the words but it is not a queen and its race does not lay eggs in the living it holds his skin between two pincers and tears it just a little so he will feel the pain and think it is an egg he lies back without moving his eyes closed my children will hatch out of you it says and makes its voice threatening yes he says yes the pleasure shakes him like a blossom in the garden burdened by the flying insects that pollinate it everything was war every minute of every day the corridors were painted with the scent of territorialitythe priests prayed anger and defense and the sound of their voices shook the clutchmates to the core they were told of the interlopers despoilers clutchrobbers who would destroy their race with no thought who hated them simply because of what they were they massed in the caverns the great vast caverns that lie like lungs beneath the bodies of their cities and touched each other to pass on the madness they were smaller than the enemy the soft fleshed with limbs tucked in they were the size of an enemys head at most and every day the espen people carried packages bags that size so they sent ships laden with those willing to give their lives for the race willing to crawl through their stinking sewer tunnels or fold themselves beneath the seats of their transports blood changed to chemicals that would consume themand the enemyin undying flame flames that could not be quenched but burned until they met other flames they watched broadcasts of their cities their homes their young burning and rejoiced they put one three and six in armor of silver globules each one a bomb triggered by a thought when they were ready they flew at night one of the biological planes with no trace of metal or fuel so it could elude their detection and entered their city dropped at a central point they clung to the darkness and separated spreading outward like a flower six found a café full of the enemy drinking bitter brews that frothed like poison they had no idea it was so close the little ones ran around the tables and the adults patted them indulgently they did not resemble the hatchlings six knew and each one was different in its colors on the walls were pictures that did not show war they showed clouds and sun and birds flying it could smell the liquid in their bodies and knew it was on the third continent it had tasted them before a child saw six where it lurked up near the eaves and screamed some force took over its limbs and it could no longer move the area emptied and it watched the death numbers tick downward as the blast radius cleared trying to figure out what to do their soldiers shot it with a ray like crystal a ray that made the world go away when it awoke its armor was gone and it could destroy no one not even itself even the little bomb that would have shattered its body and freed it was gone an aching oozing cavity where it had rested so long inside its body the only trace left behind the espen talked to six they said they were its friends they said they were its enemies they said it would be spared that it would be killed they cut away two of its limbs but ceased when they saw it did not hurt they burned it with fire and acid and laughed when it made sounds of pain they mocked it they said it would be alone forever that its race had been killed they said they would kill it too if it did not communicate if it did not tell them what they wanted to know even though it had no knowledge and did not know what the priests at home would do next when it could make sounds no longer they made it into a trade they gained three of their own in exchange and when it was back among its own kind the questioning began again although this time it was by the priests the interrogator was a large darkchitined creature from what the assistants said six gathered that the interrogators clutchmates had all died in the war the first day the interrogator came and asked questions what had it said to the espen what had it revealed about their own armies and weapons why had they kept it alive why indeed it did not know and said as much the interrogator looked at its mutilated body at the stumps of limbs at the raw places where they had pried away the carapace and burned the soft exposed patches and went away without another question that night trailed by its two assistants the next day the interrogator appeared and ran through the list again what had six said what had it revealed why was it alive six said it did not know and the interrogator came closer to where it crouched favoring its injuries it reached out a forelimb and rested it lightly on a pain point the touch was like fire all over again i dont know it said torture me if you like as they did and i will tell you everything i told them which was nothing the interrogator leaned still further in pressing harder with its forelimb smelling the scents it gave off while sunk deep in pain finally the interrogator pulled back and left the room the interrogator repeated this act every few hours in the dim light of the cell as the cycles passed as it came again and again six began to regrow its severed limbs and the places where they had pried away pieces of carapace healed and thickened except for the spot the interrogator had chosen for his torment which was ulcerated and sore not healing long after six of sixs regenerated limbs could flex as their predecessors once had five was allowed to see it it stood well away flanked by guards so six could not touch it from where it lay bound no matter how it yearned toward its clutchmate it asked the same question the interrogator had why was six still alive one and three had accomplished their mission it said and four had died in a similar operation only two and five were left but now they were suspect clutchmates of a renegade and no longer trusted soldiers they had found work as cleaners and subsisted on the gruel fed to drones barely enough to keep their specialized frames alive fives eyes were dull its delicate claws blunted from rough work it did not think two could survive much longer what can i do six asked it felt itself dying inside untouched the interrogator stood to one side watching the interaction sniffing the chemicals released into the air as they talked we are suspect because no one knows what you have done five said tell them what you have done and that we are not involved i do not understand six said it was slower in those days its mind talked to itself but no one else and it had grown lonely and unaccustomed to thinking i have done nothing six said then two and i will work until we die five said six could feel the thoughts pressing against its own trying to shape it i understand it said finally and five went away without another word and so six confessed to the interrogators an hour later that it had told the espen of their tactics of the caverns full of training captives of the plans it knew it said its clutchmates knew nothing the interrogator stood watching it talk six could not tell what it thought of the lie but after that it came no longer a few days later they placed six in a cage hung high in the air and the armies marched past to look at it it saw two and five reinstated but they would not look at it with their faceted gleaming eyes it looked at them touching them with its sight hoping that they would be well that they would remember it six thought the priests would kill it then but they sent it back to the espen with the message here is your spy and they sent six to another planet and then another until finally someone opened the door of the cage and said we will provide for you no longer youre on your own it lived as it could for a while hiring itself out for highaltitude or delicate work that clumsy fingers could not perform but there are many drifters on a space station like twicefar and people hire their own kind it was not until it met the manager here that it realized uniqueness could be an asset the universe is large and the war of its people and that race of softfleshed is very far away now but sixs race remembers its missing member the one who they believe sold them all for life its image hangs on their corridors amid the words of war and tangles of foul scent adorn it without the touch of its clutchmates it feels its intelligence fading but each time the webs rouse it for a moment and remind it who it is who it was and then it goes downstairs and finds a patron who wishes it to bring him pleasure to torture him or be tortured or who will pay it to say what he wishes and earn enough to keep it alive another day it has six drawers in its room holding the emotions that keep it alivethe thoughts of those who would see it dead it has six drawers soon all six will be full travelers robert silverberg are we all ready then nikomastir asks he has fashioned a crown of golden protopetaloids for himself and gleaming scarlet baubles dangle from his ears the bright translucent shells of galgalids strung on slender strands of pure gold his long pale arms wave in the air as though he is conducting a symphony orchestra our next destination is and he makes us wait for the announcement and wait and wait sidri akrak says mayfly giggling how did you know cries nikomastir sidri akrak yes yes set your coordinates everybody off we go sidri akrak it is a faint yelp of dismay comes from velimyle and she shoots me a look of something that might almost have been fear though perhaps there is a certain component of perverse delight in it also i am not at all happy about the decision myself sidri akrak is a nightmare world where gaudy monsters run screaming through the muddy streets the people of sidri akrak are cold and dour and inhospitable their idea of pleasure is to wallow in discomfort and ugliness no one goes to sidri akrak if he can help it no one but we must live by our rules and this day nikomastir holds the right of next choice it is devilish of mayfly to have put the idea of going to sidri akrak into his head but she is like that mayfly and nikomastir is terribly easily influenced will we all perish on hideous sidri akrak victims of mayflys casual frivolity i dont think so however nasty the visit turns out to be we often get into trouble sometimes serious trouble but we always get out of it we lead charmed lives we four travelers someday mayfly will take one risk too many i suppose and i would like not to be there when she does most likely i will be though mayfly is my masksister wherever she goes i go i must look after her thoughtful stolid foolish me i must protect her from herself as we four go traveling on and on spinning giddily across the farflung worlds sidri akrak though the four of us have been to so many wondrous lovely places together elanglo and the floating isle of vont and mikni and chchikkikan heidoth and thant milpar librot froidis smoor xamur and iriarte and nabomba zom and on and on and on and nowsidri akrak sidri akrak we stand in a circle in the middle of a field of grass with golden blades making ourselves ready for our relaysweep departure from galgala i wouldnt have minded remaining here a few months longer a lovely world indeed is galgala the golden where myriads of auriferous microorganisms excrete atoms of gold as metabolic waste it is everywhere on this planet the lustrous pretty metal it turns the rivers and streams to streaks of yellow flame and the seas to shimmering golden mirrors huge filters are deployed at the intake valve of galgalas reservoirs to strain the silt of dissolved gold from the water supply the plants of galgala are turgid in every tissue leaf and stem and root with aureous particles gold dust held in suspension in the air transforms the clouds to golden fleece therefore the onceprecious stuff has grievously lost value throughout the galaxy since galgala was discovered and on galgala itself a pound of gold is worth less than a pound of soap but i understand very little about these economic matters and care even less only a miser could fail to rejoice in galgalas luminous beauty we have been here six weeks we have awakened each morning to the tinkle of golden chimes we have bathed in the golden rivers and come forth shining we have wrapped our bodies round with delicate golden chains now though it is time for us to move along and nikomastir has decreed that our new destination is to be one of the universes most disagreeable worlds unlike my companions i can see nothing amusing about going there it strikes me as foolish and dangerous whimsy but they are true sophisticates untrammeled creatures made of air and light and i am the leaden weight that dangles from their soaring souls we will go to sidri akrak we all face nikomastir smiling sweetly he calls out the coordinate numbers for our journey and we set our beacons accordingly and doublecheck the settings with care we nod our readiness for departure to one another velimyle moves almost imperceptibly closer to me mayfly to nikomastir i would have chosen a less flighty lover for her than nikomastir if matters had been left to me he is a slim elegant youth highspirited and shallow a prancing fantastico with a taste for telling elaborate fanciful lies and he is very young only a single rebirth so far mayfly is on her fifth as am i and velimyle claims three which probably means four sembiran is nikomastirs native world a place of grand valleys and lofty snowcapped mountains and beautiful meadows and thriving cities where his father is a minor aristocrat of some sort or so nikomastir has said although we have learned again and again that it is risky to take anything nikomastir says at face value my incandescent masksister mayfly who is as small and fair as nikomastir is tall and dark encountered him while on a visit to olej in the lubrik system and was immediately captivated by his volatile impulsive nature and they have traveled together ever since whither mayfly goeth thither go i that is the pledge of the mask so do i trudge along now from world to world with them and therefore my winsome sly capricious velimyle whose psychosensitive paintings are sought by the connoisseurs of a hundred worlds but who belongs to me alone has willynilly become the fourth member of our inseparable quartet some people find relaysweep transport unlikable and even frightening but i have never minded it what is most bothersome i suppose is that no starship is involved you travel unprotected by any sort of tangible container a mere plummeting parcel falling in frightful solitude through the interstices of the continuum a journeyhelmet is all that covers you and some flimsy folds of coppery mesh you set up your coordinates you activate your beacon and you stand and wait you stand and wait until the probing beam of some faroff sweepstation intersects your position and catches you and lifts you and carries you away if youve done things right your baggage will be picked up and transported at the same time most of the time that is so it is a stark and unluxurious mode of travel the relay field wraps you in cocooning bands of force and shoots you off through one auxiliary space and another kicking you through any convenient opening in the spacetime lattice that presents itself and while you wait to be delivered to your destination you drift like a bauble afloat in an infinite sea helpless utterly alone bereft of all power to override the sweep your metabolic processes are suspended but the activity of your consciousness is not so that your unsleeping mind ticks on and on in the most maddening way and there is nothing you can do to quiet its clamor it is as though you must scratch your itching nose and your hands are tied behind your back eventuallyyou have no idea whether it has been an hour a month a centuryyou are plunked unceremoniously down into a relay station at the planet of your choice and there you are relaysweep transport is ever so much more efficient than any system requiring vast vessels to plough the seas of space from world to world but all the same it is a disquieting and somewhat degrading way to get around so now we depart mayfly is the first to be captured by the sweepbeam perhaps half an hour later nikomastir disappears and then almost immediately after velimyle my own turn does not arrive for many long hours which leaves me fidgeting gloomily in that golden meadow wondering when if ever i will be taken and whether some disjunction in our routes will separate me forever from my three companions there is that risknot so much that we would fail to arrive on sidri akrak at all but that we might get there many years apart i find that a melancholy thought indeed more than that it is terrifying but finally the dazzling radiance of the sweep aura engulfs me and hurls me out into the great dark and off i go dropping freely through hundreds of lightyears with nothing but an invisible sphere of force to protect me against the phantoms of the auxiliary spaces through which i fall i hang in total stasis in a realm of utter blackness for what feels like a thousand centuries an infinity of empty space at my elbow as i go my zigzag way through the wormholes of the adjacent continuua within that terrible passivity my hyperactive mind ponders as it all too often does the deep questions of lifeissues of honor duty justice responsibility the meaning of existence subjects about which i have managed to learn nothing at all basically either in this life or the four that preceded it i arrive at many profound conclusions during the course of my journey but they fly away from me as fast as i construct them i begin to think the trip will never end that i will be one of those few unfortunate travelers the one out of a billion who is caught in some shunt malfunction and is left to dangle in the middle of nowhere for all eternity or at least for the ten or twenty thousand realtime years it will take for his metabolically suspended body to die has this actually ever happened to anyone there are only rumors unfounded reports but there comes a time in every sweepjump when i am convinced that it has happened to me then i see a glare of crimson and violet and azure and green and my masksister mayflys voice purrs in my ear saying welcome to sidri akrak darling welcome welcome welcome nikomastir stands beside her a moment later velimyle materializes in a haze of color the four of us have made a nearly simultaneous arrival across who knows how many hundreds of lightyears we definitely do lead charmed lives we four everyone knows about sidri akrak the place was settled at least a thousand years ago and yet it still has the feel of a frontier world only the main streets of the halfdozen big cities are paved and all the rest are mere blue dirt that turn into rivers of mud during the rainy season the houses are ramshackle slovenly things lopsided and drafty arrayed in higgledypiggledy fashion as though they had been set down at random by their builders without any regard for logic or order after all this time the planet is mostly jungle a jungle that doesnt merely encroach on the settlements but comes right up into them wild animals of the most repellent sorts are permitted to rampage everywhere wandering about as they please the akrakikans simply dont care they pretend the animalsmonstrous appallingarent there the people of sidri akrak are a soulless bloodless bunch in the main altogether indifferent to such things as comfort and beauty and proper sanitation primitive squalor is what they prefer and if you dont care for it well youre quite free to visit some other world why exactly did we come here i ask it is a rhetorical question i know perfectly well why because nikomastir clueless about our next destination had opened a void that mayfly had mischievously filled with one of the most unappealing suggestions possible just to see what nikomastir would do with it and nikomastir had as usual given the matter about a thousandth of a second of careful consideration before blithely leaping headlong into the abyss thereby taking the rest of us with him as he has done so often before but nikomastir has already rearranged the facts in what passes for his mind i absolutely had to come here he says its a place ive always felt the need to see my daddy was born on sidri akrak you know this is my ancestral world we know better than to challenge nikomastir when he says things like that what sense is there in arguing with him hell only defend himself by topping one whopper with another twice as wild building such a towering edifice of spurofthemoment fantasy that hell end up claiming to be the greatgrandson of the fourteenth emperor or perhaps the reincarnation of julius caesar velimyle whispers at my side well just stay here two or three days and then well move along i nod we all indulge nikomaster in his whims but only up to a point the sky of sidri akrak is a sort of dirty brown broken by greasy sullen green clouds the sunlight is greenish too pallid tinged with undertones of dull gray there is a sweet overripe mildly sickening flavor to the warm clinging air and its humidity is so intense that it is difficult to distinguish it from light rain we have landed within some city apparentlyin a grassy open space that anywhere else might have been called a park but which here seems merely to be a patch of land no one had bothered to use for anything vaguely square and a couple of hundred meters across to our left is an irregular row of bedraggled twostory wooden shacks on our right is a dense clump of ungainly asymmetrical trees before and behind us are ragged aggregations of unpainted buildings and scruffy unattractive shrubbery look says mayfly pointing and we have our first encounter with the famous wildlife of sidri akrak an ugly creature comes bounding toward us out of the trees a bulky roundbodied thing dark and furry that rises to a disconcerting height atop two scrawny hairless legs covered with bright yellow scales its face is something out of your worst dreams bulging fiery eyes the size of saucers and dangling red wattles and jutting black fangs and it is moving very quickly in our direction howling ferociously we have weapons of course but it swiftly becomes apparent that the thing has no interest in us that in fact it is fleeing an even more ghastly thing a long bristlecovered manylegged monster built close to the ground from whose spherical head emerge three long hornlike projections that branch and branch again terminating in scores of writhing tendrils that are surely equipped with venomous stings first one vile creature and then the other runs past us without seeming to notice us and they lose themselves in the shrubbery beyond we can hear wild shrieking and hissing in there and the sound of cracking branches nikomastir is smiling benignly all this must be delightful to him mayfly too looks entranced even velimyle who is closest to me in temperament almost normal in her desires and amusements claps her hands together in fascination i alone seem to be troubled by the sight of such creatures running about unhindered on what is supposedly a civilized world but it is ever thus in our travels i am fated always to stand a little to one side as i follow these three around the universe yet am i linked irrevocably to them all the same mayfly was my lover once two lives back that was before we took the mask together now of course it would be unthinkable for anything carnal to happen between us though i still cherish cheerful memories of her pixy breasts in my hands her slim sleek thighs about my hips even if we have forsworn the sexual part of our friendship the rest is deeper than ever and in truth we are still profoundly a couple mayfly and i despite the rich and rewarding relationship i maintain with velimyle and the frothy sportive one mayfly has built with nikomastir above and beyond all that there is also the bond that links us all the lines of attraction go this way and that we are inseparables they are my world i am a citizen only of our little group wherever we go we go together even unto sidri akrak in a little while two immigration officers show up to check us out sidri akrak is an imperium world and therefore the local immigration scanners have been automatically alerted to our arrival they come riding up in a sputtering little snubnosed vehicle a man and a woman in baggy brown uniforms and begin asking us questions nikomastir does most of the answering his charm is irresistible even to an akrakikan the questioning brusque and hardedged is done in imperial but from time to time the immigration officers exchange comments with each other in their own dialect which sounds like static the woman is swarthy and squat and flatfaced and the man is even less lovely and they are not at all obliging they seem to regard the arrival of tourists on their planet simply as an irritating intrusion the discussion goes on and ondo we plan to remain here long are we financially solvent do we intend to engage in political activity in the course of our stay nikomastir meets every query with glib easy reassurances during our interrogation a slimy rain begins to fall oily pink stuff that coats us like grease and a massive manyhumped bluegreen beast that looks like an ambulatory hill with purple eyes appears and goes lolloping thunderously past us with utter unconcern for our presence leaving an odor of decay and corruption in its wake after a time i stop listening to the discussion but finally they flash bright lights in our facespassports are validated retinally on sidri akrakand nikomastir announces that we have been granted sixmonth visas lodgings are available three streets away they tell us the place they have sent us to turns out to be a dismal rickety hovel and our innkeeper is no more friendly than the immigration officials but we are grudgingly allowed to rent the entire upper floor the rooms i am to share with velimyle face the rear garden a patch of uncouth tangled wilderness where some slowmoving shaggy monster is sluggishly browsing about nibbling on the shrubbery it lifts its head in my direction and gives me a cold glare as though to warn me away from the plants on which its feeding i signal it that it has nothing to worry about and turn away from the window as i unpack i see a procession of glassyshelled snaillike things with huge bulbous red eyes crawling diagonally across the bedroom wall they too stare back at me they seem almost to be smirking at me but nikomastir and mayfly claim to be delighted to be here and velimyle seems to have no complaints i feel outnumbered by them velimyle announces that she would like to do a painting of nikomastir in the hotel garden she only paints when shes in a buoyant mood buoyant here they run off together downstairs hand in hand like happy children i watch from above as velimyle sets up her easel outside and goes about the task of priming the psychosensitive surface of her canvas she and nikomastir are as untroubled as any akrakikan by the shambling shaggy thing that grazes noisily nearby how quickly they have acclimated are you very miserable here darling mayfly asks running her fingertips lightly along my cheeks i give her a stoic smile ill be all right well find things to amuse us im sure its all for the best that nikomastir brought us to this place you dont mean that do you not really not really no yet in some sense i do i often tell myself that its important not to live as though life is just a perpetual holiday for us even though in fact it is it would be too easy to lose ourselves if we arent careful in the nightmare that is perfection this is an era when all things are possible we have godlike existences we have every imaginable comfort close at hand beauty and long life are ours for the asking we are spared the whole dreary business of sagging flesh and spreading waistlines and blurry eyesight and graying hair and hardening arteries that afflicted our remote ancestors and all the incredible richness of the galaxy lies open to us key in your coordinates snap your fingers off you go any world you choose to visit instantly available never in the history of the universe has any species lived such a life as ours i fear the terrible ease of this existence of ours i think sometimes that well eventually be asked to pay a great price for it that thought engulfs me in secret terror mayfly who knows me almost as well as i know myself says think of it this way love theres something to be learned even from ugliness isnt it true that what were trying to get out of all this travel is experience that has meaning if thats what we want we cant just limit ourselves to the beautiful places and maybe a horrid place like sidri akrak has something important to teach us yes shes right is she aware that shes voicing my own most private thoughts or is she just being playful perhaps its all selfdelusion but i do indeed seek for meaning as we travel or at least think that i do these furtive broodings in which i indulge in the hidden places of my soul are so it seems to me the thing that sets me apart from nikomastir and mayfly and velimyle who take life as it comes and ask no questions velimyle and nikomastir return from the garden a little while later she puts the rolled canvas away without showing it to me there is an uncharacteristically somber expression on velimyles face and even giddy nikomastir seems troubled plainly something has gone awry i know better than to ask for details we eat at our hotel that night the surly innkeeper slams the dishes down before us almost angrily a thin greenish gruel some sort of stewed shredded meat a mess of overcooked vegetables the meat tastes like cooked twine and the vegetables have a dank swampy flavor i pretend we are back on iriarte where food is the highest art and every meal is a symphony i pretend we have returned to nabomba zom to that wondrous palatial hotel by the shore of the scarlet sea the waters of which at dawn would reverberate as if struck by a hammer as the first blue rays of morning fell upon it but no no we are on sidri akrak i lie sleepless through the night with velimyle breathing gently beside me listening to the fierce honkings and roarings and screechings of the wild beasts that roam the darkness beyond our windows now and again then the sounds of the lovemaking of mayfly and nikomastir come through the thin walls that separate our bedroom from theirs giggles and gasps and long indrawn sighs of pleasure in the morning we go out exploring this city we have learned is called periandros andifang it has a population of just under one hundred thousand with not a single building of the slightest architectural distinction and a yearround climate of clamminess and drizzle the plant life is generally speaking strikingly unsightlya preponderance of gray leaves black flowersand the air is full of clouds of little stinging midges with malevolent purple beaks and of course one has to deal with the fauna too the fiends gallery of grisly monstrosities seemingly no two alike that greet you at every turn huge beasts with beady eyes and slavering fangs and clacking claws things with pockmarked pustulent skins or writhing furry tentacles or clutching manyjointed arms almost always they appear without warning galloping out of some clump of trees uttering banshee shrieks or groundshaking roars i begin to understand now the tales of unwary travelers who have total mental breakdowns within an hour of their arrival on sidri akrak it quickly becomes clear to us though that none of these horrendous creatures has any interest in attacking us the only real risk we run is that of getting trampled as they go charging past very likely it is the case that they find human flesh unpalatable or indigestible or downright poisonous but encountering them is an unnerving business and we encounter them again and again and again nikomastir finds it all fascinating painstakingly he searches out the illfavored the misshapen the feculent the repulsivenot that they are hard to find he drifts ecstatically from one eyesore of a building to the next taking an infinite number of pictures he adores the plants sooty foulsmelling blossoms and sticky blightedlooking leaves the rampaging animals give him even greater pleasure whenever some particularly immense or especially abhorrentlooking loathsomeness happens to cross our path he cries out in boyish glee this starts to be very irritating his callow idiocy is making me feel old remember sweet hes not even seventy yet mayfly reminds me seeing my brows furrowing surely you were like that yourself once upon a time was i id like to think that isnt so and in any case says velimyle cant you manage to find that enthusiasm of his charming no i cant perhaps its getting to be time for my next rebirth i think growing old for us isnt a matter so much of bodily decaythat is fended off by efficient processes of automatic bioenergetic correctionas of increasing inward rigidity a creakiness of the soul a corrugation of the psyche a stiffening of the spiritual synapses one starts to feel sour and petty and crabbed life loses its joy and its juice by then you begin to become aware that it is time to clamber once more into the crystal tank where an intricate spiderweb of machinery will enfold you like a loving mother and slip off into sweet oblivion for a while and awaken to find yourself young again and ready to start all over which you can do over and over again until eventually you arrive at the annoying point after the eleventh or twelfth rebirth where the buildup of solar poisons in your system has at last become ineradicable under any circumstances and that is the end of you alas even gods have to die eventually it would seem nikomastir is a young god and i am evidently an aging one i try to make allowances for that but i find myself fervently hoping all the same that he will tire of this awful place very soon and allow us to go onward to some happier world he does not tire of it though he loves it he is in the grip of what some ancient poet once called the fascination of the abomination he has gone up and down every street of the city peering at this building and that one in unstinting admiration of their imperfections for several days running he makes it clear that he is searching for some building in particular and then he finds it a rambling old ruin of great size and formidable ugliness at the very edge of town standing apart from everything else in a sort of private park here it is he cries the ancestral mansion the house where my father was born so nikomastir still clings to the claim that he is of akrakikan descent there is no way that this can be true the natives of this world are a chilly bloodless folk with mean pinched hard souls if they have souls at all and not just some clicking chattering robotic mechanisms inside their skulls indeed i have known robots with personalities far more appealing than anyone we have met thus far on sidri akrak nikomastir bless him is nothing at all like that he may be silly and frivolous and emptyheaded but he also is sweetnatured and lively and amiable and vivacious terms that have never yet been applied to any citizen of sidri akrak and never will be velimyle has tried to paint him again again the attempt was a failure this time she is so distressed that i dare to breach the wall of privacy behind which she keeps her art and ask her what the difficulty is look she says she unrolls the second canvas against the familiar swirling colors of a typical velimyle background i see the slender angular form of nikomastir imprinted there by the force of velimyles mental rapport with the psychosensitive fabric but the features are all wrong nikomasters perpetual easy smile has given way to a dreadful scowling grimace his lip curls backward menacingly his teeth are the teeth of some predatory beast and his eyesoh velimyle those harsh glaring eyes where is his cheerful sparkle these eyes are hard narrow fierce and above all else sad the nikomastir of velimyles painting stares out at the universe with tragic intensity they are the eyes of a god perhaps but of a dying god one who knows he must give up his life for the redemption of his race the first one was almost as bad velimyle says why is this happening this isnt nikomastir at all ive never had something like this happen has he seen either of the paintings i wouldnt let him all i told him was that they didnt come out right that they would depress him if i showed them to him and of course he didnt want to see them after that something about this planet must be shading your perceptions i say burn this velimyle and the other one too and forget about painting him until weve left here nikomastir wants to have a look inside the crumbling lurching pile that he says is his familys ancestral home but the place ruinous though it is happens to be occupied by akrakikans a whole swarm of them and when he knocks at the front door and grandly introduces himself to the majordomo of the house as count nikomastir of sembiran who has come here on a sentimental journey to his former paternal estate the door is closed in his face without a word how impolite nikomastir says not seeming very surprised but dont worry ill find a way of getting in that project gets tabled too over the next few days he leads us farther and farther afield well out into the uninhabited countryside beyond the boundaries of periandros andifang the land out here is swampy and uningratiating and of course there are the animals to contend with and the insects and the humidity i can tell that mayfly and verimyle are growing a little weary of nikomastirs exuberance but they both are as tolerant of his whims as ever and follow him loyally through these soggy realms as do ipartly i suppose because we agreed long ago that we would journey everywhere as a single unit and partly because i have been stung evidently by various hints of mayflys and velimyles that my recent crotchetiness could mean i might be getting ready for my next rebirth then he turns his attention once more to the old house that he imagines once belonged to his family my father once told me that theres a pool of fire behind it a phosphorescent lake he used to swim it when he was a boy and hed come up dripping with cool flame im going to take a swim in it too and then we can head off to the next planet whose turn is it to pick our next planet anyway mine i say quickly i have marajo in mindthe sparkling sands the city of seven pyramids if theres a lake behind that house nikomastir i advise you very earnestly to stay away from it the people who live there dont seem to look favorably on trespassers besides cant you imagine the kind of nastinesses that would live in a lake on this world my father went swimming in that one nikomastir replies and gives me a defiant glare its perfectly safe i assure you i doubt of course that any such lake exists if its there though i hope he isnt fool enough to go swimming in it my affection for the boy is real i dont want him to come to harm but i let the matter drop ive already said too much the surest way to prod him into trouble i know is oppose him in one of his capricious fancies my hope is that nikomastirs attention will be diverted elsewhere in the next day or two and all thought of that dismal house and of the fiery lake that may or may not be behind it will fly out of his mind its generally a good idea when visiting a world you know very little about to keep out of places of unknown chemical properties when we toured megalo kastro we stood at the edge of a cliff looking down into the famous living sea that pink custardy mass that is in fact a single living organism of gigantic size spreading across thousands of kilometers of that world but it did not occur to us to take a swim in that sea for we understood that in a matter of hours it would dissolve and digest us if we did and when we were on xamur we went to see the idradin crater as everyone who goes to xamur does xamur is the most perfect of worlds flawless and serene a paradise air like perfume and water like wine every tree in the ideal place every brook every hill it has only one blemishthe idradin a huge round pit that reaches deep into the planets primordial heart it is a hideous place that crater concentric rings of jagged cooled lava surround it black and eroded and bleak stinking gases rise out of the depths and yellow clouds of sulfuric miasma belch forth and wild red shafts of roaring flame and you peer down from the edge into a roiling den of hot surging magma everyone who goes to xamur must visit the idradin for if you did not see perfect xamurs one terrible flaw you could never be happy on any other world and so we stared into it from above and shivered with the horror we were expected to feel but we were never at all tempted to clamber down the craters sides and dip our toes into that realm of fire below it seems unlikely to me that nikomastir will do anything so stupid here but i have to be careful not to prod him in the wrong direction i dont mention the lake to him again our exploration of sidri akrak proceeds we visit new swamps new groves of fetidsmelling malproportioned trees new neighborhoods of misshapen and graceless buildings one drizzly disheartening day succeeds another and finally i am unable to bear the sight of that brown sky and greenish sun any longer though it is a violation of our agreements i stay behind at the hotel one morning and let the other three go off without me it is a quiet time i spend the hours reflecting on our travels of years past all the many worlds we have seen icy mulano of the two suns one yellow one bloody red and billions of ghostly electric lifeforms glimmering about you in the frigid air estrilidis where the cats have two tails and the insects have eyes like blue diamonds zimbalou the sunless nomad world where the cities are buried deep below the frozen surface kalimaka haj qaldun vietoris nabomba zom so many places so many sights a lifetime of wonderful experiences and yet what i ask myself has it all meant how has it shaped me what have i learned i have no answers only to say that we will continue to go onward ever onward it is our life it is what we do we are travelers by choice but also by nature by destiny i am still lost in reverie when i hear velimyles voice outside my window calling to me telling me that i must come quickly nikomastir she cries nikomastir what about him but she can only gesture and wave her eyes are wild we run together through the muddy streets paying no heed to the bulky and grotesque akrakikan monstrosities that occasionally intersect our path i realize after a time that velimyle is leading me toward the tumbledown house at the edge of town that nikomastir has claimed as his familys former home a narrow grassy path leads around one side of it to the rear and there to my amazement i see the phosphorescent lake of nikomastirs fantasies with mayfly beside it leaping up and down in agitation that verges on frenzy she points toward the water out therethere on this ugly world even a phosphorescent lake can somehow manage to be an unlovely sight i saw one once on darma barma that flashed like heavenly fire in rippling waves of cobalt and amethyst magenta and gold aquamarine and emerald and jade but from this lake emanates the most unradiant of radiances a dull prosaic sickly gleam darktoned and dispiriting except in one place off toward the farther shore where a disturbance of some sort is setting up whirlpools of glinting metallic effects swirls of eyejabbing bright sparkles as though handfuls of iron filings are being thrown through a magnetic field the disturbance is nikomastir hehis body ratheris tossing and heaving at the lakes surface and all about him the denizens of the lake can be seen narrow scaly jutting heads popping up by the dozens hinged jaws snapping sharp teeth closing on flesh a widening pool of blood surrounds him they whatever they are are ripping him to shreds we have to get him out of there mayfly says her voice congested with horror and fear how i ask i told him not to do it says trembling velimyle i told him i told him i told him but he plunged right in and when he was halfway across they began to break the surface and thenthen he began screaming and mayfly plucks urgently at my sleeve what can we do how can we rescue him hes beyond rescuing i tell her hollowly but if we can get his body back she says therell be a way to revive him wont there i know there is scientists can do anything nowadays velimyle more tentatively agrees some kind of scientific miracle nikomastir gathered up and repaired somehow by the regeneration of tissue but tissue is all thats left of him now frayed sorry scraps and the creatures of the lake frantic now with bloodlust are devouring even those in furious haste they want me to tell them that nikomastir isnt really dead but he is really really really dead dead forever what has been played out on this shore today was not a game there is nothing that can be saved no way to regenerate i have never seen the death of a human being before it is a dizzying thing to contemplate the finality the utterness my mind is whirling i have to fight back convulsions of shock and horror couldnt you have stopped him i ask angrily when i am able to speak again but he wanted so badly to do it mayfly replies we couldnt have stopped him you know not even if we she halts in midsentence not even if you had wanted to i say is that it neither of them can meet my furious gaze but you didnt want to did you you thought it would be fun to see nikomastir swim across the phosphorescent lake fun am i right yes i know that i am what could you have been thinking mayfly velimyle there is no sign of nikomastir at the surface any longer the lake is growing still again its phosphorescence has subsided to a somber tarnished glow for a long time minutes hours weeks none of us is capable of moving silent pale stunned we stand with bowed heads by the shore of that frightful lake scarcely even able to breathe we are in the presence of incontrovertible and permanent death which to us is a novelty far greater even than the living sea of megalo kastro or the blue dawn of nabomba zom and the immense fact of it holds us rooted to the spot was this truly nikomastirs ancestral world was his father actually born in that great old fallingdown house and did he really once swim in this deadly lake and if none of that was so how did nikomastir know that the lake was there we will never be able to answer those questions whatever we do not know about nikomastir that we have already learned we will never come to discover now that is the meaning of death the finality of it the severing of communication the awful unanswerable power of the uncompromising curtain that descends like a wall of steel we did not come to sidri akrak to learn about such things but that is what we have learned on sidri akrak and we will take it with us wherever we go henceforth pondering it examining it come i say to mayfly and velimyle after a time we need to get away from here so then nikomastir was foolish he was bold he has had his swim and now he is dead and why why for what what was he seeking on this awful world what were we we know what we found yes but not what it was that we were looking for i wonder if we will ever know he has lived his only life has nikomastir and he has lost it in the pursuit of idle pleasure there is a lesson in that for me for velimilye for mayfly for us all and one day i will i hope understand what it is all i do know after having lived these hundreds of years is that the universe is very large and we are quite small we live godlike lives these days flitting as we do from world to world but even so we are not gods we die some sooner some later but we do die only gods live forever nikomastir hardly lived at all so be it we have learned what we have learned from nikomastirs death and now we must move on we are travelers by nature and destiny and we will go forward into our lives tomorrow we leave for marajo the shining sands the city of seven pyramids marajo will teach us something as xamur once did and nabomba zom and galgala and also sidri akrak something something something hindsight sarah langan second coming is docked two miles underground shes made of a collapsible repulsionattraction subatomic slurry that the astrophysicists are convinced will survive the gravitational anomaly called black betty yes the ship will survive its her human cargo thats doomed sarah vaughan walks between rows of gurneys in heavy van der waals boots shes been aboard second coming six months now and has gotten to know the feel of this ship her soft organic skin her hissing breath her ceilings and floors which flipflop depending on the capriciousness of gravity at first buried so deeply under omahas dirt second coming was a citadel but this close to the end of it all ghosts inhabit the cabins of every room sarah hears voices over the speakers that arent quite human and sees memories from life back in scottsbluff that feel real enough to touch doctor sarahs patients groan in a greek chorus that reverberates like microphone feedback help me sarah a stout practical woman of forty surveys the wide wasteland of them and wonders where to start click the overhead sick bay speaker buzzes to life she strains to hear through the ion static good morning citizens of second coming osgood blunder captain and emperor of the second coming announces in monotone his tracheotomy makes him sound like a drivethrough fast food booth operator as you know impact with black betty is less than four hours away but our diligent computational engineers made a breakthrough last night the upload of human consciousness to the safety of second comings mainframe is finally at hand rejoice the flesh will fail but the spirit dear romans will endure osgood blunder breaks for applause and throughout the ship even in the infirmary manic screams of victory burst and then disappear like collapsing stars blunders corporation kliffoth cybernetics funded second coming and handselected its passengers without blunder there would be no ship at all during their long captivity down here the crew have come to think of him as a god ill see some of you on the other side the rest fear not for you witnessed the next leap in human evolution when mankind became his own god blunder says as static whines well be calling lottery numbers throughout the day remember transgressors will be shot and stored as protein so please respect your authority and stand by sarah picks a path through the prostrate bodies there are colonists have surrendered their names for numbers and logged into her greenlylit sick bay some occupy gurneys others lean against walls or curl themselves fetal she piles her tray with needles and liquid valium theyll need it today because she gets the feeling that their luck is an upsidedown horseshoe all run out she calibrates measures injects its routine by now theres no medicine left except for this all day all night its flickpuncturesquirt then move on to the next and the next and then next each have numbers branded against their foreheads its best to look there and not in their eyes flickpuncturesquirtmove on flickpuncturesquirtmove on sarah stops paying attention at patient thirtyfour and almost gives the guy an air bubble heart attack he wouldnt noticehes insane you can tell which patients have black bettys disease because theyve got no whites to their eyes its like their souls are drowning flickpuncturesquirtmove on flickpuncturesquirtmove on best not to think about the hepatitis shes spreading or worse its a mercy she tells herself when she gets to patient whos just eight years old with impossibly knobby knees flickpuncturesquirt he looks up at her with eyes that are entirely black and there is movement between pupil and iris there is something swimming in there trying to break out its really happening theyve started sarahs husband joe vaughan calls as he enters the sick bay wearing heavy boots that suction the slurried ground his fine blonde hair floats like jellyfish strands in this diminished gravity blunder went first of course joe continues his voice sounds far away but it echoes too so the words collapse on each other like overlapping venn diagrams hes in the machine the hard scientists are next then they say were up oh christ sarah answers im not ready are you though blunder has the textbook knowledge he wants her life experience as a physician in the system hes promised to upload her family too but this close to the end nothing is certain joe hops up and down a couple of times his boots make a slurping sound and the image of him blurs as if hes moving extra fast quite literally hes not the man she married the closer they get to black betty the more it messes with the chemistry of their brains like a magnet pressed against a head full of metal wed better get to the engine room with the kids theyve already shot some line cutters theres going to be a riot joe says sarah looks at her tray of meds and across the room too she flicks on the sick bays satellite viewer which shows images of space and of earth its shocking how quickly the planet has changed unfathomable quantities of garbage spin like saturns rings around the earths fattened waist sea water laps the continents across central america the atlantic and pacific oceans kiss joe reaches the knobs and sharpens in on scottsbluff nebraska where they used to live a lone wanderer wearing an atmosphere suit scavenges through a drifting pile of husked wheat from a broken silo but the grain pelts him hard and fast its like sand slipping through his fingers joe puts his arm around her and with their eyes they follow the wheat through the air and into space and finally through black betty hand me the valium will you sarah asks joe squints with bad eyes until he finds the proper bottle hes been eating carrion sarah suspects prion infection we could windup stuck inside second coming part of the machine sarah says it might be better to die shes said this before or joe has each time the issue arises they assume opposite sides of the argument and fight until theyre tired of words in the end it doesnt matter theyre going to do it no matter what weve got to go joe says she hears the words again and again even though she knows he says them only once déjà vu time is slowing and spreading her ghost of five minutes ago injects an eightyear old boy with dead eyes comfort him her present self wants to scold hes all alone the sick bay is a field of bodies abandoned forsaken because the engineers believe their insanity will infect the machine theyll meet black betty in corporeal form from this room while the lucky few whose numbers get picked will live on inside second coming technological singularity trumps gravitational singularity its a boxing match mankind in one corner god in the other let me finish with the injections so at least theyre calm when it happens sarah says joe shakes his head the kids are waiting is what hes saying without words the kids come first before morality before their parents survival before the rest of the human race if necessary she knows this all parents know this but still she cant leave her patients without offering them some solace onscreen the closer they get to the anomaly the more she expands like a pupil exposed to dark just inside her edges something moves something like life or maybe something like god three more hours to impact and counting joe punches his suction boots against second comings slurry floor which is becoming less solid with every passing second okay he says for you then he lifts a syringe and together they flickpuncturesquirt until every patient in the ward is drugged or dead from the corner the ghost boy watches the day black betty appeared sarah was still home on maternity leave with baby sally but shed known something was coming already magnetic north had reversed without warning you could see the northern lights as far south as costa rica migratory birds internal radar had jammed too they flew outside the troposphere then plummeted from loss of oxygen roads and roofs and empty farmland hosted their open graves no one knew how their loss would affect the ecosystem but mornings without their songs seemed more bereft baby sally was swinging happily in her rocker that morning and three yearold bradley toddled between the kitchen and television room calling out names of things shoe knee strawberry sally on the radio the regular morning program got interrupted for a special report jack the jerkoff cut off a geriatric salieri clones rendition of me and my shadow and read ladies and gentlemen do not be alarmed sarah listened as she rinsed a glass baby bottle the water spun counterclockwise initial reports are sketchy as an etchadoodle but the department of defense in tandem with kliffoth cybernetics is this a joke sarah walked over to the radio bradley bobbled between her legs then out then in like a maypole dance mommy mommy mommy leg static flushed the frequency even though it was a clear nebraska day jack the jerkoff returned okay folks they say its not a joke but so did orson welles so well see put it this way if theyre wrong sue somebody else im not liable bitches anyway kliffoth cybernetics the american government contractor for science health incarceration propaganda the national and state lotteries consumption toxicology humanitarian aid and defense says they think the reason polarity shifted so suddenly and completely is because of an anomaly about twenty million miles between earth and mars sarah braced herself against the counter while sally chirped like a small bird in her swing and bradley danced its a gravitational anomaly jack finished they say its growing joe came home an hour later hed been working on a case for santo monico a subsidiary of kliffoth cybernetics they wanted reparations from all the rice farmers in india whod used old strains of seed instead of buying the new patent the entire vaughan family sat in front of the television as kliffoth cybernetics ceo appeared on every network and webcast the static made his talking head seem far away the best we can figure a separate universe is spreading across the milky way the laws of physics and time act differently once we approach the barrier of this new universe which has collapsed on top of ours the easiest way to think of it is like ink diffusing through a glass of water only its source is selfgenerating and for our purposes limitless pretty soon the entire glass will be black as night osgood blunder announced in a ragged voice that sarah recognized as sickly we think it came from another dimensionit tore a wormhole through either space or time whats unique about this particular anomaly is that its barrier or event horizon to borrow from black hole terminology ought to be dark and so infinitely dense with gravitational singularities that light cant escape but weve detected movement within black bettys perimeter there might be life in there outside that day an entire flock of birds crashed through the vaughans detached garage on fort triumph street seagulls thousands of miles from either ocean sarah microwaved popcorn for dinner the whole family fell asleep in front of the television she dreamed about how shed never cooked nutritious meals and that this neglect had carved her childrens bellies with scurvy holes into which insect mothers had laid their eggs well how in the heeeck are we gonna survive the oprah winfrey holohost asked her science guest esteemed astrophysicist ipswitch gustavson the next day sally peered out from under sarahs breast she was a tiny helpless thing that smelled like sweet milk bradley sat crosslegged and too close to the television she noticed that his hair was especially staticky like he was touching a novelty eye of the storm on the television gustavson frowned like he couldnt figure out if the holograms creators were imbeciles or just writing her program that way for good television the anomalyblack betty after my daughter who died of mercury poisoning from santo monico riceshes rolling in fast and shes getting bigger wellwhat does that mean oprah asked with exaggerated amused concern her shimmering eyelid winked shes like a bucket of paint splattering in real time at this very moment across the milky way as she rolls toward us shes changing our laws of physics and pulling earth and the rest of the solar system off orbit even if we could exist under the new laws of this alternate universe we wont have a sun or the ground under or feet or a food supply is this fake like global warming oprah asked gustavson shook his head i give the human species ten years on the outside probably less sarah got up from the couch walked very slowly to the kitchen and vomited in the sink the water swirled all wrong months passed like everything was normal even as the birds finally went extinct the old died of pulmonary and cardiac disease at accelerated rates and black bettys disease took root peoples scleras disappeared and their irises widened so their eyes seemed entirely brown or blue or green these colors contracted and expanded within their pupils and the victims often lost their sense of balance along with sight occasionally they were violent more often they babbled about the end of the world or got stuck in loops of their own histories where they repeated old conversations over and over again joe won his case for santo monico and the vaughan family used the money to secure their seats on kliffoth cybernetics black betty escape pod second coming sarah reported back to work at the clinic where shed performed abortions until it became illegal and now delivered high risk babies with congenital defects such as organ dysplasia and spina bifida most died soon after they entered the world and woundup in county graves or donated to science to commemorate them sarah and the rest of the staff took turns carving numbers into small quartz stones then piling them in the courtyard where the nurses smoked their winstons scottsbluff was the only high risk birthing clinic in six states and at first it had seemed heartless not to name them but after a while it was only practical in the lobby during those days after black betty more and more women showed up high risk betty was altering the genetic structure of living things and bending it in all the wrong ways the clinic waiting room television tuned to news often aired realtime human sacrifice as well as a reality television program based in los angeles called thats my monkey in the delivery room sarah spent her days pulling crowning babies from between their mothers bleeding legs while picketing jesus freaks warned about the rapture through the windows the worst part was consoling the mothers when it was over always theyd convinced themselves that the tests were wrong and their babies would be born alive betty spread relativity turned fungible small objects floated up and into space it started with plastic grocery bags moved on to the engraved quartz stones in the clinic courtyard and after twelve months ended with human beings they held each other a chain that lasted for miles until one by one they were gone some got lost in space others ended up spinning with the garbage around the earths orbit like saturns rings sarah and joe boarded their windows from rioters and stopped going to work she was sorry for the women who would surely die in labor without her help but not sorry enough to continue by now the infants had become disfigured abominations the vaughans waited and waited and waited some more for news that second coming was complete fresh food by then was gone but theyd stockpiled cans which was better at least than those who starved or resorted to cannibalism on air one morning jack the jerkoff and the rest of his morning show killed themselves with the laws of physics so confused the bullets didnt penetrate like they should have they fired dozens of rounds and still died slow sarah joe bradley and sally listened to the slaughter from the kitchen floor its not real its makebelieve joe assured the children while sarah wound sallys favorite music box carved men spun tiny circles around a painted wooden peak while climb every mountain played toward the end of life above the cars and mobile homes took flight like something out of the wizard of oz finally the lights went out and never came back joe cashed his money into gold and stole a gravity car the family set out for the military base in omaha in the hopes that second coming was complete they made it halfway before the engine died the rest of the trip carrying their gold bricks that were light as styrofoam they walked by then the sky was dark even during the day the animals were gone in two days they reached the kliffothamerican military base eating only burrowing insects and to slake their thirst the blood joe drained from his arm and offered them to suckle can you love someone more after something like that can it restore your faith in a mad world sarah vaughan thought so when they arrived second coming edged out from the earthy plains like an alien spaceship her skin was black and organic her organs a neural net that glowed like jellyfish phosphor for a quartermile in all directions people gathered and seemed from the way they bowed and moaned to worship some held each other others tied themselves to the cemented fences that would soon come loose armed guards lined every entrance they learned things as they pushed through the throng it grumbled with intelligence the way crowds do theyre not letting anybody in even if youve got a ticket its unamerican they say if youre good looking they want breeders they say osgood blunder has gone mad they say the doctors all killed themselves same with the artists i have eight million dollars worth of gold joe announced when they finally got to the front of the line a small thin guard stepped ahead of the rest and pushed the nub of his flamethrower to joes chest moneys no good the guard said sarah and joe held their children tight as if trying to make them unborn we have a right were on the list joe shouted and then broke into tears at the sight of their fathers surrender the children and sarah began to cry too let us in you murderer joe continued weve got children we have tickets weve got gold if only she was pretty and could offer herself up to them sarah thought if only joe had married a trophy wife like the rest of his rich friends hed be able to sell her now and their kids would survive move along the guard said i dont want to kill you in front of your children they didnt move the launcher clicked and methane loosened from its nose joe gasped probably even with a direct hit he would die slow sarah remembered something from the crowd i hear blunder is sick and that your doctors refused to board because of crimes of conscience im a surgeon ill cross the strike line i can operate she said the gun moved away from joe and to the center of sarahs back it felt surprisingly heavy by the time they get the kids its forty minutes before impact the ship has turned to a soft slurry that does not stick to the bottoms of their boots but instead oscillates in tidal pools toward the bow onscreen along the vibrating corridor walls sarah can see images of black betty theyre close enough now that she can see inside the anomalys pitch black edges something moves its familiar like the reflection inside a madmans eye and shes reminded of the last child she delivered in scottsbluff who was born without skin in the engineering room techies shout their voices reverb so deeply that she cant make out what theyre saying some have gone mad with bettys disease theyre hitting their heads against soft walls and chasing their own watery physical trails like dogs blunders body lays at the bottom of a pile of about twohundred crewmen they live in the machine now she can feel their cold atomic consciousness within the ships slurry and in the vibrations under her feet the speaker crackles its blunders voice just as monotone from the tracheotomy she gave him only now it has flattened into some less than human thevaughans blunder says its so cold in here a family we could use a real family to keep us warm the first mate beckons them to four upload gurneys equipped with used needles and tubes its supposed to be a quick processonly seconds since theyve been imprinted already the ship by now has condensed its walls close in like waves ten minutes to impact joe walks with the children toward the gurneys sarah cannot conceive of strapping baby sally onto one of these tables then leaving her for the crew to toss to the pile she cannot conceive of never touching her children again or never again making love to the man whose blood she drank but perhaps this will be better than death yes she reasons she must believe it is better the speakers now are gone the ship is about to merge with betty and become fluid and solid and infinite onscreen sarah can see ghosts inside the perimeter of this new universe she can see her own body strapped into a gurney screaming no stop for the love of god its not too late joe straps bradley to the table then sally sarah watches the ships oxygen is low enough that theyre gasping and cold but its a pleasant sensation like floating words no longer echo sound is gone thought is gone too its just images reflections memories of the past and present and very near future with no particular distinction she doesnt want to do it all her instincts tell her not to do it just as they told her not to leave those women in scottsbluff and not to operate on blunder but instead to slit his monster throat just like they told her not to feed her husband and children human flesh there are fates worse than death joe argued that first time but even then weeping theyd known how it would end theyd taken their rations and told the kids it was chicken joes hand is on her shoulder he straps her in then himself theres no time to kiss goodbye they will lose their love she knows its ineffable constancy will not translate into the machine she is wet with regret the upload is quick suddenly she sees her body from the outside looking in she races through the ship looking for her family but the ship is a slurry it opens up and breaks free from the earths crust hurtling toward black betty her babies where are her babies she sees inside the anomaly even though she doesnt have eyes its ghosts in there three billion people flipper children eating poison rice garbage rings birds circling a gyre its her family in there looking back at her its that moment on the road when they shared blood and did not know that the hardest time was also the best time it is past and present but not future it is bettys disease and like everyone else before her sarah vaughan is drowning in it the second coming and black betty collide sarah knows now what drove her patients mad it is the unspeakable truth about what caused black betty its second coming so dense with the ghosts of humanitys regret that she weighted through time and tore the past to warn them black betty is the second coming sarah remembers the doctors who killed themselves and the women at her office and the babies all those babies piled like rocks it was their future she was marking stolen from them by their idiot parents it was the end of the world she was reminiscing though she did not know it black betty and the ship crash together the two become one all things become one there is no sound the anomaly splatters across space black and beautiful my babies sarah cries as she swims through an ocean of infinitely dense ghosts and then like a star the anomaly collapses as if it never was it sucks past and present and future and makes all of humanity unborn tight little stitches in a dead mans back joe r lansdale from the journal of paul marder boom thats a little scientist joke and the proper way to begin this as for the purpose of my notebook im uncertain perhaps to organize my thoughts and not to go insane no probably so i can read it and feel as if im being spoken to maybe neither of those reasons it doesnt matter i just want to do it and that is enough whats new well mr journal after all these years ive taken up martial arts againor at least the forms and calisthenics of tae kwon do there is no one to spar with here in the lighthouse so the forms have to do there is mary of course but she keeps all her sparring verbal and as of late there is not even that i long for her to call me a sonofabitch anything her hatred of me has cured to perfection and she no longer finds it necessary to speak the tight lines around her eyes and mouth the emotional heat that radiates from her body like a dreadful cold sore looking for a place to lie down is voice enough for her she lives only for the moment when she the cold sore can attach herself to me with her needles ink and thread she lives only for the design on my back thats all i live for as well mary adds to it nightly and i enjoy the pain the tattoo is of a great blue mushroom cloud and in the cloud etched ghostlike is the face of our daughter rae her lips are drawn tight eyes are closed and there are stitches deeply pulled to simulate the lashes when i move fast and hard they rip slightly and rae cries bloody tears thats one reason for the martial arts the hard practice of them helps me to tear the stitches so my daughter can cry tears are the only thing i can give her each night i bare my back eagerly to mary and her needles she pokes deep and i moan in pain as she moans in ecstasy and hatred she adds more color to the design works with brutal precision to bring raes face out in sharper relief after ten minutes she tires and will work no more she puts the tools away and i go to the fulllength mirror on the wall the lantern on the shelf flickers like a jackolantern in a high wind but there is enough light for me to look over my shoulder and examine the tattoo and it is beautiful better each night as raes face becomes more and more defined rae rae god can you forgive me sweetheart but the pain of the needles wonderful and cleansing as they are is not enough so i go sliding kicking and punching along the walkway around the lighthouse feeling raes red tears running down my spine gathering in the waistband of my muchstained canvas pants winded unable to punch and kick anymore i walk over to the railing and call down into the dark hungry in response to my voice a chorus of moans rises up to greet me later i lie on my pallet hands behind my head examine the ceiling and try to think of something worthy to write in you mr journal so seldom is there anything nothing seems truly worthwhile bored of this i roll on my side and look at the great light that once shone out to the ships but is now forever snuffed then i turn the other direction and look at my wife sleeping on her bunk her naked ass turned toward me i try to remember what it was like to make love to her but it is difficult i only remember that i miss it for a long moment i stare at my wifes ass as if it is a mean mouth about to open and reveal teeth then i roll on my back again stare at the ceiling and continue this routine until daybreak mornings i greet the flowers their bright red and yellow blooms bursting from the heads of longdead bodies that will not rot the flowers open wide to reveal their little black brains and their feathery feelers and they lift their blooms upward and moan i get a wild pleasure out of this for one crazed moment i feel like a rock singer appearing before his starryeyed audience when i tire of the game i get the binoculars mr journal and examine the eastern plains with them as if i expect a city to materialize there the most interesting thing i have seen on those plains is a herd of large lizards thundering north for a moment i considered calling mary to see them but i didnt the sound of my voice the sight of my face upsets her she loves only the tattoo and is interested in nothing more when i finish looking at the plains i walk to the other side to the west where the ocean was there is now nothing but miles and miles of cracked black sea bottom its only resemblance to a great body of water are the occasional dust storms that blow out of the west like dark tidal waves and wash the windows black at midday and the creatures mostly mutated whales monstrously large sluggish things abundant now where once they were near extinction perhaps the whales should form some sort of greenpeace organization for humans now what do you think mr journal no need to answer just another one of those little scientist jokes these whales crawl across the sea bottom near the lighthouse from time to time and if the mood strikes them they rise on their tails and push their heads near the tower and examine it i keep expecting one to flop down on us crushing us like bugs but no such luck for some unknown reason the whales never leave the cracked sea bed to venture onto what we formerly called the shore its as if they live in invisible water and are bound by it a racial memory perhaps or maybe theres something in that cracked black soil they need i dont know besides the whales i suppose i should mention i saw a shark once it was slithering along at a great distance and the tip of its fin was winking in the sunlight ive also seen some strange legged fish and some things i could not put a name to ill just call them whale food since i saw one of the whales dragging his bottom jaw along the ground one day scooping up the creatures as they tried to beat a hasty retreat exciting huh well thats how i spend my day mr journal roaming about the tower with my glasses coming in to write in you waiting anxiously for mary to take hold of that kit and give me the signal the mere thought of it excites me to erection i suppose you could call that our sex act together and what was i doing the day they dropped the big one glad you asked that mr journal really i am i was doing the usual up at six did the shit shower and shave routine had breakfast got dressed tied my tie i remember doing the latter and not very well in front of the bedroom mirror and noticing that i had shaved poorly a hunk of dark beard decorated my chin like a bruise rushing to the bathroom to remedy that i opened the door as rae naked as the day of her birth was stepping from the tub surprised she turned to look at me an arm went over her breasts and a hand like a dove settling into a fiery bush covered her pubic area embarrassed i closed the door with an excuse me and went about my businessunshaved it was an innocent thing an accident nothing sexual but when i think of her now more often than not that is the first image that comes to mind i guess it was the moment i realized my baby had grown into a beautiful woman that was also the day she went off to her first day of college and got to see ever so briefly the end of the world and it was the day the trianglemary rae and myselfshattered if my first memory of rae alone is that day naked in the bathroom my foremost memory of us as a family is when rae was six we used to go to the park and she would ride the merrygoround swing teetertotter and finally my back i want to piggy daddy we would gallop about until my legs were rubber then we would stop at the bench where mary sat waiting i would turn my back to the bench so mary could take rae down but always before she did she would reach around from behind caressing rae pushing her tight against my back and marys hands would touch my chest god but if i could describe those hands she still has hands like that after all these years i feel them fluttering against my back when she works they are long and sleek and artistic naturally soft like the belly of a baby rabbit and when she held rae and me that way i felt that no matter what happened in the world we three could stand against it and conquer but now the triangle is broken and the geometry gone away so the day rae went off to college and was fucked into oblivion by the dark pelvic thrust of the bomb mary drove me to work me paul marder big shot with the crew one of the finest brightest young minds in the industry always teaching inventing and improving on our nuclear threat because as wed often joke we cared enough to send only the very best when we arrived at the guard booth i had out my pass but there was no one to take it beyond the chainlink gate there was a wild melee of people running screaming falling down i got out of the car and ran to the gate i called out to a man i knew as he ran by when he turned his eyes were wild and his lips were flecked with foam the missiles are flying he said then he was gone running madly i jumped in the car pushed mary aside and stomped the gas the buick leaped into the fence knocking it asunder the car spun slammed into the edge of a building and went dead i grabbed marys hand pulled her from the car and we ran toward the great elevators we made one just in time there were others running for it as the door closed and the elevator went down i still remember the echo of their fists on the metal just as it began to drop it was like the rapid heartbeat of something dying and so the elevator took us to the world of down under and we locked it off there we were in a fivemile layered city designed not only as a massive office and laboratory but as an impenetrable shelter it was our special reward for creating the poisons of war there was food water medical supplies films books you name it enough to last two thousand people for a hundred years of the two thousand it was designed for perhaps eleven hundred made it the others didnt run fast enough from the parking lot or the other buildings or they were late for work or maybe they had called in sick perhaps they were the lucky ones they might have died in their sleep or while they were having a morning quickie with the spouse or perhaps as they lingered over that last cup of coffee because you see mr journal down under was no paradise before long suicides were epidemic i considered it myself from time to time people slashed their throats drank acid took pills it was not unusual to come out of your cubicle in the morning and find people dangling from pipes and rafters like ripe fruit there were also the murders most of them performed by a crazed group who lived in the deeper recesses of the unit and called themselves the shit faces from time to time they smeared dung on themselves and ran amok clubbing men women and children born down under to death it was rumored they ate human flesh we had a police force of sorts but it didnt do much it didnt have much sense of authority worse we all viewed ourselves as deserving victims except for mary we had all helped to blow up the world mary came to hate me she came to the conclusion i had killed rae it was a realization that grew in her like a drip growing and growing until it became a gushing flood of hate she seldom talked to me she tacked up a picture of rae and looked at it most of the time topside she had been an artist and she took that up again she rigged a kit of tools and inks and became a tattooist everyone came to her for a mark and though each was different they all seemed to indicate one thing i fucked up i blew up the world brand me day in and day out she did her tattoos having less and less to do with me pushing herself more and more into this work until she was as skilled with skin and needles as she had been topside with brush and canvas and one night as we lay on our separate pallets feigning sleep she said to me i just want you to know how much i hate you i know i said you killed rae i know you say you killed her you bastard say it i killed her i said and meant it next day i asked for my tattoo i told her of this dream that came to me nightly there would be darkness and out of this darkness would come a swirl of glowing clouds and the clouds would melt into a mushroom shape and out of thattorpedoshaped nose pointing skyward striding on ridiculous cartoon legswould step the bomb there was a face painted on the bomb and it was my face and suddenly the dreams point of view would change and i would be looking out of the eyes of that painted face before me was my daughter naked lying on the ground her legs wide apart her sex glazed like a wet canyon and ithe bomb would dive into her pulling those silly feet after me and she would scream i could hear it echo as i plunged through her belly finally driving myself out of the top of her head then blowing to terminal orgasm and the dream would end where it began a mushroom cloud darkness when i told mary the dream and asked her to interpret it in her art she said bare your back and thats how the design began an inch of work at a timea painful inch she made sure of that never once did i complain shed send the needles home as hard and deep as she could and though i might moan or cry out i never asked her to stop i could feel those fine hands touching my back and i loved it the needles the hands the needles the hands and if that was so much fun you ask why did i come topside you ask such probing questions mr journal really you do and im glad you asked that my telling will be like a laxative i hope maybe if i just let the shit flow ill wake up tomorrow and feel a lot better about myself sure and it will be the dawning of a new pepsi generation as well it will have all been a bad dream the alarm clock will ring ill get up have my bowl of rice krispies and tie my tie okay mr journal the answer twenty years or so after we went down under a fistful of us decided it couldnt be any worse topside than it was below we made plans to go see simple as that mary and i even talked a little we both entertained the crazed belief rae might have survived she would be thirtyeight we might have been hiding below like vermin for no reason it could be a brave new world up there i remember thinking these things mr journal and halfbelieving them we outfitted two sixtyfoot crafts that were used as part of our transportation system down under plugged in the halfremembered codes that opened the elevators and drove the vehicles inside the elevator lasers cut through the debris above them and before long we were topside the doors opened to sunlight muted by graygreen clouds and a desertlike landscape immediately i knew there was no brave new world over the horizon it had all gone to hell in a fiery handbasket and all that was left of mans millions of years of development were a few pathetic humans living down under like worms and a few others crawling topside like the same we cruised about a week and finally came to what had once been the pacific ocean only there wasnt any water now just that cracked blackness we drove along the shore for another week and finally saw life a whale jacobs immediately got the idea to shoot one and taste its meat using a highpowered rifle he killed it and he and seven others cut slabs off it brought the meat back to cook they invited all of us to eat but the meat looked greenish and there wasnt much blood and we warned him against it but jacobs and the others ate it anyway as jacobs said its something to do a little later on jacobs threw up blood and his intestines boiled out of his mouth and not long after those who had shared the meat had the same thing happen to them they died crawling on their bellies like gutted dogs there wasnt a thing we could do for them we couldnt even bury them the ground was too hard we stacked them like cordwood along the shoreline and moved camp down a way tried to remember how remorse felt and that night while we slept as best we could the roses came now let me admit mr journal i do not actually know how the roses survived but i have an idea and since youve agreed to hear my storyand even if you havent youre going to anywayim going to put logic and fantasy together and hope to arrive at the truth these roses lived in the ocean bed underground and at night they came out up until then they had survived as parasites of reptiles and animals but a new food had arrived from down under humans their creators actually looking at it that way you might say we were the gods who conceived them and their partaking of our flesh and blood was but a new version of wine and wafer i can imagine the pulsating brains pushing up through the sea bottom on thick stalks extending feathery feelers and tasting the air out there beneath the light of the moonwhich through those odd clouds gave the impression of a pusfilled boiland i can imagine them uprooting and dragging their vines across the ground toward the shore where the corpses lay thick vines sprouted little thorny vines and these moved up the bank and touched the corpses then with a lashing motion the thorns tore into the flesh and the vines like snakes slithered through the wounds and inside secreting a dissolving fluid that turned the innards to the consistency of watery oatmeal they slurped up the mess and the vines grew and grew at amazing speed moved and coiled throughout the bodies replacing nerves and shaping into the symmetry of the muscles they had devoured and lastly they pushed up through the necks into the skulls ate tongues and eyeballs and sucked up the mousegray brains like soggy gruel with an explosion of skull shrapnel the roses bloomed their toothhard petals expanding into beautiful red and yellow flowers hunks of human heads dangling from them like shattered watermelon rinds in the center of these blooms a fresh black brain pulsed and feathery feelers once again tasted air for food and breeding grounds energy waves from the floral brains shot through the miles and miles of vines that were knotted inside the bodies and as they had replaced nerves muscles and vital organs they made the bodies stand then those corpses turned their flowered heads toward the tents where we slept and the blooming corpses another little scientist joke there if youre into english idiom mr journal walked eager to add the rest of us to their animated bouquet i saw my first rosehead while i was taking a leak i had left the tent and gone down by the shore line to relieve myself when i caught sight of it out of the corner of my eye because of the bloom i first thought it was susan dyers she wore a thick woolly afro that surrounded her head like a lions mane and the shape of the thing struck me as her silhouette but when i zipped and turned it wasnt an afro it was a flower blooming out of jacobs i recognized him by his clothes and the hunk of his face that hung off one of the petals like a wornout hat on a peg in the center of the bloodred flower was a pulsating sack and all around it little wormy things squirmed directly below the brain was a thin proboscis it extended toward me like an erect penis at its tip just inside the opening were a number of large thorns a sound like a moan came out of that proboscis and i stumbled back jacobs body quivered briefly as if he had been besieged by a sudden chill and ripping through his flesh and clothes from neck to foot was a mass of thorny wagging vines that shot out to five feet in length with an almost invisible motion they waved from west to east slashed my clothes tore my hide knocked my feet out from beneath me it was like being hit by a catoninetails dazed i rolled onto my hands and knees bearwalked away from it the vines whipped against my back and butt cut deep every time i got to my feet they tripped me the thorns not only cut they burned like hot ice picks i finally twisted away from a net of vines slammed through one last shoot and made a break for it without realizing it i was running back to the tent my body felt as if i had been lying on a bed of nails and razor blades my forearm hurt something terrible where i had used it to lash the thorns away from me i glanced down at it as i ran it was covered in blood a strand of vine about two feet in length was coiled around it like a garter snake a thorn had torn a deep wound in my arm and the vine was sliding an end into the wound screaming i held my forearm in front of me like i had just discovered it the flesh where the vine had entered rippled and made a bulge that looked like a junkies favorite vein the pain was nauseating i snatched at the vine ripped it free the thorns turned against melike fishhooks the pain was so much i fell to my knees but i had the vine out of me it squirmed in my hand and i felt a thorn gouge my palm i threw the vine into the dark then i was up and running for the tent again the roses must have been at work for quite some time before i saw jacobs because when i broke back into camp yelling i saw susan ralph casey and some others and already their heads were blooming skulls cracking away like broken model kits jane calloway was facing a rosepossessed corpse and the dead body had its hands on her shoulders and the vines were jetting out of the corpse weaving around her like a web tearing sliding inside her breaking off the proboscis poked into her mouth and extended down her throat forced her head back the scream she started came out a gurgle i tried to help her but when i got close the vines whipped at me and i had to jump back i looked for something to grab to hit the damn thing with but there was nothing when next i looked at jane vines were stabbing out of her eyes and her tongue now nothing more than lavathick blood was dripping out of her mouth onto her breasts which like the rest of her body were riddled with stabbing vines i ran away then there was nothing i could do for jane i saw others embraced by corpse hands and tangles of vines but now my only thought was mary our tent was to the rear of the campsite and i ran there as fast as i could she was lumbering out of our tent when i arrived the sound of screams had awakened her when she saw me running she froze by the time i got to her two vineriddled corpses were coming up on the tent from the left side grabbing her hand i halfpulled halfdragged her away from there i got to one of the vehicles and pushed her inside i locked the doors just as jacobs susan jane and others appeared at the windshield leaning over the rocketnose hood the feelers around the brain sacks vibrating like streamers in a high wind hands slid greasily down the windshield vines flopped and scratched and cracked against it like thin bicycle chains i got the vehicle started stomped the accelerator and the roseheads went flying one of them jacobs bounced over the hood and splattered into a spray of flesh ichor and petals i had never driven the vehicle so my maneuvering was rusty but it didnt matter there wasnt exactly a traffic rush to worry about after an hour or so i turned to look at mary she was staring at me her eyes like the twin barrels of a doublebarreled shotgun they seemed to say more of your doing and in a way she was right i drove on daybreak we came to the lighthouse i dont know how it survived one of those quirks even the glass was unbroken it looked like a great stone finger shooting us the bird the vehicles tank was near empty so i assumed here was as good a place to stop as any at least there was shelter something we could fortify going on until the vehicle was empty of fuel didnt make much sense there wouldnt be any more fillups and there might not be any more shelter like this mary and i in our usual silence unloaded the supplies from the vehicle and put them in the lighthouse there was enough food water chemicals for the chemical toilet odds and ends extra clothes to last us a year there were also some guns a colt revolver two twelvegauge shotguns and a and enough shells to fight a small war when everything was unloaded i found some old furniture downstairs and using tools from the vehicle tried to barricade the bottom door and the one at the top of the stairs when i finished i thought of a line from a story i had once read a line that always disturbed me it went something like now were shut in for the night days nights all the same shut in with one another our memories and the fine tattoo a few days later i spotted the roses it was as if they had smelled us out and maybe they had from a distance through the binoculars they reminded me of old women in bright sun hats it took them the rest of the day to reach the lighthouse and they immediately surrounded it and when i appeared at the railing they would lift their heads and moan and that mr journal brings us up to now i thought i had written myself out mr journal told the only part of my life story i would ever tell but now im back you cant keep a good worlddestroyer down i saw my daughter last night and shes been dead for years but i saw her i did naked smiling at me calling to ride piggyback heres what happened it was cold last night must be getting along winter i had rolled off my pallet onto the cold floor maybe thats what brought me awake the cold or maybe it was just gut instinct it had been a particularly wonderful night with the tattoo the face had been made so clear it seemed to stand out from my back it had finally become more defined than the mushroom cloud the needles went in hard and deep but ive had them in me so much now i barely feel the pain after looking in the mirror at the beauty of the design i went to bed happy or as happy as i can get during the night the eyes ripped open the stitches came out and i didnt know it until i tried to rise from the cold stone floor and my back puckered against it where the blood had dried i pulled myself free and got up it was dark but we had a good moonspill that night and i went to the mirror to look it was bright enough that i could see raes reflection clearly the color of her face the color of the cloud the stitches had fallen away and now the wounds were spread wide and inside the wounds were eyes oh god raes blue eyes her mouth smiled at me and her teeth were very white oh i hear you mr journal i hear what youre saying and i thought of that my first impression was that i was about six bricks shy a load gone around the old bend but i know better now you see i lit a candle and held it over my shoulder and with the candle and the moonlight i could see even more clearly it was rae all right not just a tattoo i looked over at my wife on the bunk her back to me as always she had not moved i turned back to the reflection i could hardly see the outline of myself just raes face smiling out of that cloud rae i whispered is that you come on daddy said the mouth in the mirror thats a stupid question of course its me but youre youre dead yes did did it hurt much she cackled so loudly the mirror shook i could feel the hairs on my neck rising i thought for sure mary would wake up but she slept on it was instantaneous daddy and even then it was the greatest pain imaginable let me show you how it hurt the candle blew out and i dropped it i didnt need it anyway the mirror grew bright and raes smile went from ear to earliterallyand the flesh on her bones seemed like crepe paper before a powerful fan and that fan blew the hair off her head the skin off her skull and melted those beautiful blue eyes and those shiny white teeth of hers to a putrescent goo the color and consistency of fresh bird shit then there was only the skull and it heaved in half and flew backwards into the dark world of the mirror and there was no reflection now only the hurtling fragments of a life that once was and was now nothing more than swirling cosmic dust i closed my eyes and looked away daddy i opened them looked over my shoulder into the mirror there was rae again smiling out of my back darling i said im so sorry so are we she said and there were faces floating past her in the mirror teenagers children men and women babies little embryos swirling around her head like planets around the sun i closed my eyes again but i could not keep them closed when i opened them the multitudes of swirling dead and those who had never had a chance to live were gone only rae was there come close to the mirror daddy i backed up to it i backed until the hot wounds that were raes eyes touched the cold glass and the wounds became hotter and hotter and rae called out ride me piggy daddy and then i felt her weight on my back not the weight of a sixyearold child or a teenage girl but a great weight like the world was on my shoulders and bearing down leaping away from the mirror i went hopping and whooping about the room same as i used to in the park around and around i went and as i did i glanced in the mirror astride me was rae lithe and naked her red hair fanning around her as i spun and when i whirled by the mirror again i saw that she was six years old another spin and there was a skeleton with red hair one hand held high the jaws open and yelling ride em cowboy how i managed still bucking and leaping giving rae the ride of her life she bent to my ear and i could feel her warm breath you want to know how im here daddydear im here because you created me once you laid between mothers legs and thrust me into existence the two of you with all the love there was in you this time you thrust me into existence with your guilt and mothers hate her thrusting needles your arching back and now ive come back for one last ride daddyo ride you bastard ride all the while i had been spinning and now as i glimpsed the mirror i saw walltowall faces weaving in weaving out like smiling stars and all those smiles opened wide and words came out in chorus where were you when they dropped the big one each time i spun and saw the mirror again it was a new scene great flaming winds scorching across the world babies turning to fleshy jello heaps of charred bones brains boiling out of the heads of men and women like backedup toilets overflowing the almighty glory hallelujah ours is bigger than yours bomb hurtling forward the mirror going mushroom white then clear and me spinning rae pressed tight against my back melting like butter on a griddle evaporating into the eye wounds on my back and finally me alone collapsing to the floor beneath the weight of the world mary never awoke the vines outsmarted me a single strand found a crack downstairs somewhere and wound up the steps and slipped beneath the door that led into the tower marys bunk was not far from the door and in the night while i slept and later while i spun in front of the mirror and lay on the floor before it it made its way to marys bunk up between her legs and entered her sex effortlessly i suppose i should give the vine credit for doing what i had not been able to do in years mr journal and thats enter mary oh god thats a funny one mr journal real funny another little scientist joke lets make that a mad scientist joke what say who but a madman would play with the lives of human beings by constantly trying to build the bigger and better boom machine so what of rae you ask ill tell you she is inside me my back feels the weight she twists in my guts like a corkscrew i went to the mirror a moment ago and the tattoo no longer looks like it did the eyes have turned to crusty sores and the entire face looks like a scab its as if the bile that made up my soul the unthinking nearsightedness the guilt that i am has festered from inside and spoiled the picture with pustule bumps knots and scabs to put it in laymans terms mr journal my back is infected infected with what i am a blind senseless fool the wife ah the wife god how i loved that woman i have not really touched her in years merely felt those wonderful hands on my back as she jabbed the needles home but i never stopped loving her it was not a love that glowed anymore but it was there though hers for me was long gone and wasted this morning when i got up from the floor the weight of rae and the world on my back i saw the vine coming up from beneath the door and stretching over to her i yelled her name she did not move i ran to her and saw it was too late before i could put a hand on her i saw her flesh ripple and bump up like a den of mice were nesting under a quilt the vines were at work out go the old guts in go the new vines there was nothing i could do for her i made a torch out of a chair leg and old quilt set fire to it burned the vine from between her legs watched it retreat smoking under the door then i got a board nailed it along the bottom hoping it would keep others out for at least a little while i got one of the twelvegauges and loaded it its on the desk beside me mr journal but even i know ill never use it it was just something to do as jacobs said when he killed and ate the whale something to do i can hardly write anymore my back and shoulders hurt so bad its the weight of rae and the world ive just come back from the mirror and there is very little left of the tattoosome blue and black ink a touch of red that was raes hair it looks like an abstract painting now collapsed design running colors its real swollen i look like the hunchback of notre dame what am i going to do mr journal well as always im glad you asked that you see ive thought this out i could throw marys body over the railing before it blooms i could do that then i could doctor my back it might even heal though i doubt it rae wouldnt let that happen i can tell you now and i dont blame her im on her side im just a walking dead man and have been for years i could put the shotgun under my chin and work the trigger with my toes or maybe push it with the very pen im using to create you mr journal wouldnt that be neat blow my brains to the ceiling and sprinkle you with my blood but as i said i loaded the gun because it was something to do id never use it on myself or mary you see i want mary i want her to hold rae and me one last time like she used to in the park and she can theres a way ive drawn all the curtains and made curtains out of blankets for those spots where there arent any itll be sunup soon and i dont want that kind of light in here im writing this by candlelight and it gives the entire room a warm glow i wish i had wine i want the atmosphere to be just right over on marys bunk shes starting to twitch her neck is swollen where the vines have congested and are writhing toward their favorite morsel the brain pretty soon the rose will bloom i hope shes one of the bright yellow ones yellow was her favorite color and she wore it well and mary will come for me when she does ill stand with my naked back to her the vines will whip out and cut me before she reaches me but i can stand it im used to pain ill pretend the thorns are marys needles ill stand that way until she folds her dead arms around me and her body pushes up against the wound she made in my back the wound that is our daughter rae shell hold me so the vines and the proboscis can do their work and while she holds me ill grab her fine hands and push them against my chest and it will be we three again standing against the world and ill close my eyes and delight in her soft soft hands one last time the taste of starlight john r fultz pelops wakes gasping and shivering inside the cryopod a thin layer of ice crystals coats his cheeks and hands pricking at his exposed skin crackling and moaning he raises hands to his eyes and pries their lids open shedding ice shards like tears the curving glass surface before him is cracked into a mass of spidery lines struggling to inhale the frozen air he pushes against the glass the door of the pod refuses to move he is entombed he moans as he raises his right leg shedding a cloud of crystals boot against the fractured glass but without much strength his muscles are still asleep slightly atrophied by years of stasis again he kicks and draws in a burning lungful of cryonic air a third time his booted foot meets the glass and it shatters toppling him forward in a shower of ice and fragments instinct pulls his hands up and he lands on them instead of his face splinters cut into his palms and fingers but he can breathe freely now lying on the floor he rolls onto his back and looks sideways along a flickering corridor of cryonic niches here stand the stasis pods of his thirteen fellow sleepers even the chill metal of the floor feels warm compared to the ultimate cold of the cryopod something has awakened him early a mistake an emergency staggering to his feet he clings to the cables along the walls and checks the nearest pod a calm face eyes closed just visible through the cloudy glass digital display reads thompson j and the indicator light glows green no fissures pod intact he checks the next one and the next one until he finds another cracked pod lid with the display reading tanaka y no frost at all on this lid a blue face stares at him from inside asian eyes open mouth slack pelops tries the release lever nothing he tears at the rim of the pods lid finally he kicks in the glass like he did his own this time from the opposite side tanaka falls out stiff and dead she was a good woman and fine physicist she would have been an asset to the dantus colony must have suffocated when her stasis was interrupted like being buried alive he might weep for her but his eyes still feel frozen he knows hell have to eject her body into space but hell wait until he regains his strength he lays tanaka gently on the floor and checks the last few pods twelve remain intact the frost coating his skin and flight suit melts into cold water droplets fly from his beard and hair grown to primordial length while he slept what could have happened he stumbles along the corridor beneath the pulsing florescent lamps follows the plastic maps posted at each intersection and finally reaches the sealed door of the bridge a gleaming hand plate accepts his touch the nerve center of the goya opens before him a spacious cockpit of flashing neon display grids and blinking digital interfaces above it all a vista of interstellar wonder a great oval viewport looking out into the universe he stares into the bottomless void captivated by the glimmering of ancient stars a purple nebula clouds the starfields ahead and the sheer beauty of the galactic deeps overwhelms his waking senses sinking into a vast gulf of infinity distant fires grinning and sparkling the eyes of a demon legion you dont belong here the stars whisper this is the great emptiness the stronghold of death soon it will consume you utterly pelops tears himself away from the celestial vision and goes to the control panels he is no pilot no navigator but he is a man of science he has been on ships before he scans the displays and finds that the ships thrusters have gone offline he switches the relays to instigate backup power a lurching and shuddering tells him the ship has resumed its fullspeed journey he falls into the captains chair and punches his fingers at the keyboard requesting a status report a holographic display emerges dancing before him like a ghost its the goya a gleaming bottleshaped vessel surrounded by pinpoints of rushing starlight a scarlet line enters the left side of the display trailing a cloud of sparks a comet it crosses the forward hull of the ship bathing the vessel in a cloud of scintillating motes he reads the print display below the hologram radiation cloud unidentified in nature a shortcircuiting of the ships power grid disabling the autodrive severe turbulence resulting in damage to two cryopod units no shit communications permanently disabled no messages going out or coming in not until the com techs on dantus install a new stack of relays absolute radio silence the report ends and the curved panels blink silently course renewed power reserves engaged everything nearly back to normal but now pelops is awake and completely alone he accesses the logs for time date and distance time elapsed since launch years months days hours minutes seconds time remaining to destination year months days hours minutes seconds sixteen months alone on this ship he considers waking the rest of the crew walks back to the pod corridor and almost does exactly that when it hits him a terrible gnawing hunger in his gut and the realization what is he going to eat nobody was supposed to wake until a few hours before touchdown this ship isnt equipped for manned flight he finds his way through the labyrinth of steel into the airy cargo hold the massive bulk of the twentyfive uv converter domes loom like black hills beneath plastic tarps in the far corner he finds what he is looking for emergency supply kit a mansized chest like a coffin inside a collection of boxes tins and tubes of dry rations a map on the lid reveals the location of emergency water tanks he breathes a little easier theres enough water in those tanks to keep a man alive for three years however hes not so sure how long the food will last hell worry about that later cracking open a plastic box he tears through an aluminum pouch and devours the beef jerky inside famished and relishing every bit the salty taste of it on his tongue the familiar warmth as it fills his belly in a few seconds the entire package is gone he curses himself hell have to ration this out if hes going to survive he cant indulge himself in such feasts he closes the lid and makes his way along the bay to the water tanks where he turns a valve and fills a bucket with drinking water he drinks his fill of the cold liquid he surveys and logs the emergency foodstuffs planning out subsistence portions drops his pen and slides to the floor someone was supposed to load more emergency supplies than this someone did not theres barely enough food here to keep him eating at a base survival level for days three months if he does not wake anyone else if he does that time will be cut in half three months of food sixteen months until reaching dantus nothing else here nothing to eat after three months he will begin to starve pelops carries tanakas rigid body into the airlock says a quick prayer and ejects her into space he should be grateful one less mouth to feed he races back to the two open cryopods and tries to get them operational spends hours working on them up to his elbows in grease and cryonic residue but it doesnt matter theyre both totally out of commission their transparent lids shattered and even if they werent the pods cannot be put back into service once theyve been opened the only way to do that would be to introduce more cryogen which can only be done by cryopod contractors no way to refreeze himself no way to avoid the twelve weeks of bare subsistence and the slow lingering starvation that will surely follow he envies tanaka her quick death he lies on the floor of the pod corridor weeping remembering his look into the void the whispering stars and their message of doom and he knows its true this is the realm of death and he has entered it willingly he wails and gnashes his teeth and smashes the floor with his fists eventually he falls asleep and enjoys the mercy of a warm oblivion pelops wakes sometime later trembling on the cold metal floor he gets up and returns to the bridge his stomach growls but he denies it he sits in the captains chair and stares out at the numberless stars with tanaka dead he is the only one capable of getting the uv converters up and running on dantus and the future of the colony depends on those machines wolf is a red dwarf star and not enough crops grow in its infrared glow the colonys population has grown too fast for its agricultural systems to handle setting up the converter domes and transforming the stars radiation to ultraviolet light is the only way to boost food production and end the famine the only way to feed thousands of brave families who settled there eleven thousand men women and children already with an exponentially expanding birth rate theyre all depending on dr andrew pelops i have to survive he thinks all those lives depend on it this mission has to succeed everything else is secondary think about those people those children think about those hungry mouths so many more than yours the mission must succeed for the first three months pelops eats frugally and his body grows lean the flight suit hangs loose on his frame he cuts his beard and hair with a pair of infirmary scissors but they always grow back into a hermits nest of tangles the boredom is deadly he spends most of his waking hours on the bridge staring into the glittering void he charts constellations scorpius serpens hydra he sails through a gulf of myth and darkness at times he fears the demoneyes of the stars and at other times he laughs at them he carves images of ancient monsters into the deck floor with a screwdriver he sleeps sometimes he talks to the sleeping crew sharing his knowledge of photonic chemistry tales of his failed marriage and his dreams for the future they lie cold and still inside their coffins and listen to his every word they are the perfect listeners sometimes he imagines they reply to him whispering like the distant stars pelops eats the last bit of the dried jerky from the emergency chest there is nothing else inside only the empty carcasses of plastic and tin where the faintest scent of edible things lingers for days afterward he endures the grinding of his stomach drinks himself to bloating at the water tanks endures the hunger pangs that stab in his guts he babbles to the sleeping crew telling them tales of hunger strikes you see the body persists on glucose energy for the first three days of starvation he says walking between the rows of frosty faces at that point the liver starts feeding on body fat as ketosis begins thanks to the natural reserves of the human body you dont really begin to starve until after three weeks now the body extracts nutrients and substance from the muscles and organs bone marrow too heres where the real danger begins he imagines himself gnawing the meat off a large bone slavering like a hound most hunger strikers die after fifty days but are incapacitated long before that we cant allow that to happen the mission is all that matters it must succeed at all cost he hopes they understand after ten solid days of starving he dreams of his father the stars are bright and blinking above the colorado mountains hes twelve years old and his father has killed a deer pelops helps skin and prepare the carcass they roast the venison over an open flame and enjoy its wild savory flavor his fathers eyes glisten like the stars as he smiles through a frosty beard you know what you have to do son pelops wakes remembering the taste of greasy venison he staggers to the infirmary and finds a laser scalpel in the cargo bay tool cabinet a trio of gaspowered welding torches he picks one up and presses the switch a blue flame emerges dancing before his eyes like a beacon of hope the flame is hot and perfect i have no other choice he punches the release lever on thompsons pod a hiss of escaping vapor a white fog rushing about his feet he lifts the lid and looks at the mans sleeping face bluewhite with a mask of rapidly melting frost as the eyes begin to flutter against their icy hoods pelops raises the hypodermic needle hes found a powerful sedative in the infirmary cabinet he injects the drug into thompsons jugular and pulls him from the pod slinging him over his shoulder i could use the scalpel on myself he thinks cut my own throat quick and painless is it wrong to kill a few people to save thousands he already knows the answer it sits in his chest like an iron weight far heavier than a single human body on the infirmary operating table he lays thompson out strips him of flight suit and undergarments bathes his body with fresh water from the tanks removes most of the body hair with scissors and razor he has never killed a man before his nerves are electric his hands tremble and he begins babbling again he knows the unconscious thompson cant hear him he could wake him up and have a real conversation first but that would only make it harder during world war ii this type of thing was fairly common he says take the siege of leningrad eight hundred and seventy two days the survivors trapped inside the city ate all the pets birds and rats before they were forced to so its not as if this sort of thing is completely without precedent the mission must succeed thompson at any cost im so sorry he switches on the laser scalpel and draws the blade of light across thompsons soft throat a fountain of red flows across the table and drips onto the floor where pelops has spread a tarp and bucket to catch it he dons a surgeons mask to avoid the smell and proceeds to butcher the carcass first he separates the limbs from the torso then the head the heat of the laser provides partial cauterization but not enough to keep blood from leaking through tiny holes like puncture wounds in the raw pink muscle tissue a wave of nausea and weakness claims him so he leaves the segmented body for later and takes thompsons lower leg into the cargo bay with the scissors he lacerates and peels the skin from the hock of meat then he arranges the calf and foot on a metal spit propped between two crates above the three activated welding torches the bluewhite flames cook the flesh nicely the smell of it roasting both titillates and nauseates him he wretches but has nothing inside him to throw up its only venison he tells himself after a few minutes he turns the spit browning the other side he catches himself drooling and wipes his lips he cannot bear to wait for it to fully cook so he settles for medium rare picks it up like a massive chicken leg and takes his first bite sinking teeth deep into the tender flesh tearing a mouthful from the bone he chews remembering that trip with his father sitting around the camp fire eating what hed killed veal the exact consistency of fresh and tender veal he takes another bite expects to wretch it all up but doesnt he swallows the second bite and a third a great contentment settles over him for the first time in six years his belly is full he falls asleep on the cargo bay floor the hock of gnawed meat lying on his chest he dreams of brown gravy and hot steaming biscuits less than a week less than a week and the meat has all gone bad energized and renewed by a succession of hungerfree days pelops realizes his mistake once the pods are open they wont freeze again there is no freezer on the shipit was never meant to sustain awake beings for more than a few hours at a time he has no way to keep the meat from spoiling the next few days he makes himself sick by eating the rotten flesh half of his kill has been ruined he smashes a naked shinbone against the wall in frustration he checks the time log on the bridge again just over eleven months to go eleven functioning cryopods eleven bodies to sustain him but only if he does things differently it all depends on me he reminds himself eleven thousand men women and children if he keeps eating spoiled meat hell die so he shoves the rest of thompson into the airlock and ejects it into space what a waste just like tanaka he waits as long as he can for the hunger to catch up with him again stares at the cold stars beyond the bridge viewport gazing into an emptiness that mirrors the void in his belly he abstains as long as he can possibly stand it nine days this time he harvests the next pod staggs e male big guy good physique pelops thaws him out sedates him and straps him to the operating table he cant kill this one like he did thompson he has to keep the meat fresh he dry heaves into a plastic waste bin there is nothing inside him to throw up think of dantus all those people all those hungry people wiping his wet eyes he starts with the left leg severing it at the knee like last time he roasts it and relieves his initial hunger this time his guilt and nausea are drowned beneath a torrent of sheer gratitude the meat venison is savory red and juicy on his tongue his teeth tear through it with gusto this man was an athlete lots of tender muscle protein nutrients flavor thompson was veal staggs is prime beef he waits as long as he can between each meal finally settles on eating once every hours in this way he calculates his meat will last until dantus eleven months sure hell suffer from lack of carbohydrates and vitamin but men have survived on allmeat diets for longer than that and been just fine after this ordeal after the converters are installed on the colony farms there will be vegetables and fruits aplenty a bounty to replace what he has lost and the crew of the goya will be remembered as heroes he pumps staggs full of fresh sedative on a daily basis the man remains oblivious as his legs and arms disappear replaced by careful tourniquets that prevent him from bleeding to death pelops cleans him looks after his bodily functions makes sure he stays alive preserves as much of the mans dignity as he can later when only the head and torso are left pelops has to be more careful tricky to harvest a torso without killing the subject he starts with a crude appendectomy next he removes the liver then the spleen and stomach eventually when staggs is truly dead he cracks open the chest cavity and removes the fistsized heart filet mignon he tells himself thats all it is he cooks the heart a special way cutting it open to butterfly the meat eats it sitting before the viewport gazing into the abyss of blinking stars it is the finest piece of meat hes ever tasted the heart he decides must be the choicest morsel in the human body the prime muscle the lights of the console blink across his face as his molars grind the meat and it slips down his gullet into his grateful stomach staggs brain sliced in two provides a double meal tastes like stringy roast chicken gray matter white meat pelops harvests the next pod in the same way but runs out of sedative after ten days first officer bernard hoffman wakes up on the table restrained and entirely legless his panicked screams draw pelops into the infirmary shhhhhh pelops comforts him gives him cool water to drink take it easy hoffman what whats happening asks the terrified man his brown eyes pleading shhhh its all right its just a bad dream the mission is going to be a success were only ten months from dantus go back to sleep hoffman writhes against his restraints tearing at the leather straps the stumps of his legs begin to bleed what the fuck are you talking about you look look where are my legs what happened to my legs more screaming hes only just noticed his missing appendages pelops breaks down he apologizes and explains everything tells hoffman about the comet about the radiation about the pods the lack of food how he must ensure the missions success reminds him of the thousands of people depending on his uv converters but hoffman doesnt get any of it he just screams screams and screams until he makes himself hoarse pelops begs him to stop but the screams go on and on he knocks hoffman unconscious but the man only wakes up screaming again pelops stuffs a rag in his mouth and leaves him on the table in a few days he wont have the strength to make any more noise pelops uses a local anesthetic now instead of sedative hoffman may have to be awake during his amputations but he wont feel a thing his eyes grow large as golf balls as he watches pelops remove his left arm then later his right he finally stops trying to scream spends most of his time unconscious now sometimes he wakes and mutters nonsense so pelops sits in a chair next to him his belly full and listens he reminds hoffman that this sacrifice makes him a hero one of the saviors of dantus colony when he harvests the torso this time he learns to salvage the intestines filling them with minced organ meat he discovers how to make a weeks worth of sausages in this way before hoffmans heart finally gives out he decides to keep the white bones instead of flushing them into the void hell bury them on dantus beneath a growing field of wheat with stone monuments he comes to this decision over dinner the next pod contains a gorgeous blonde woman mewes c after he gets her onto the table he wakes her and talks at length about their situation lets her know the heroic role she will be playing in the mission she weeps begs pleads with him he sobs with her sharing in the tragedy of the situation he unbuckles her restraints and embraces her tenderly dont worry he whispers in her ear arms wrapped around her dont worry itll be okay he chases her down when she slips away from him but manages to corner her in the cargo bay and knocks her senseless with a crowbar i could let her join me he thinks it wouldnt be so lonely then maybe theres enough meat in the pods for both of us he smacks himself across the face stupid he knows two people surviving the rest of this journey is impossible theres simply not enough food both would starve and dantus would die so its back to the table where the harvesting begins still a good supply of sedative so she wont feel any pain somehow she wakes in the middle of things and starts wailing the sound pierces his ears in a way that hoffmans guttural bellows never could he has to gag her so he can finish later enjoying the last of her he smacks his lips and remembers the lovely blue of her eyes so delectable on his tongue like tender swedish meatballs the void persists and so does his hunger it returns like clockwork every hours he doesnt bother looking at the name of his next harvest he cuts out the tongue first to avoid any more conversation a few days later he goes to the tablebound crewman removes the gag and offers him a taste of his own thigh meat the man eats ravenously saving his questions until his own hunger is sated then he stares at pelops and tries to form words the stub of his tongue rattles around inside his mouth his mute eyes plead desperately they remind pelops of the blondes blue eyes he eats them next the human body is indeed an amazing thing so many different flavors five and a half months left five cryopods unopened with proper rationing he will make it however the anesthetic is nearly gone this complicates things but is in no way a barrier to success the mission is all that matters he has it down to a science now open the pod tie the sleepers hands and feet with copper wire before they come fully awake drag them to in the infirmary strap them to the table remove the tongue put the gag in place ignore the screams ignore the blood slice tourniquet ignore the squirming the moans of pain the tears the squealing fortyeight hours later slice tourniquet its no longer a person despite all the writhing and moaning and muffled screams its only meat fortyeight hours after that slice tourniquet theyre usually too weak to scream much more after this some are lucky enough to sleep through the whole process from this point on three more crew members and thirteen weeks later only two months away from dantus his next meal is the last female but this fact barely registers pelops no longer sees them as women or men theyre only meat all of us charting the course of history only meat yet this one is something special when he slices into her abdomen he finds her secret the command board would have grounded her had they known or maybe she didnt know two months along before cryo he estimates her eyes are glazed by the time he discovers the prize inside her strapped gagged limbless and unblinking she stares at the antiseptic ceiling as he vivisects her and there it is a tiny thing only eighteen centimeters barely recognizable as human more like something amphibian a vestige of our marine origins miniscule arms more like fins or flippers the stubs of barely formed legs round head no larger than an orange so we begin the seed from which all of us grow expanding and developing meat on a rack of expanding and hardening bone he carries it to the bridge shows it to the stars he imagines the universe itself as one big womb an inescapable uterus containing planets stars and galaxies in the end its little more than a snack sweet a bit crunchy a fresh flavor bit of a fishy aftertaste its mother lasts another eight days in these months hes decided to put all those bones to good use at first he carves them into tiny figurines goblins serpents scorpions or wholly new creatures birthed in his imagination then he decides on a project a sculpture he drags all the bones and skulls onto the bridge and works nonstop in the pale starlight baring his creative spirit to the naked universe directly ahead a red star shines wolf his destination the color of spilled blood gleaming brightly in a mantle of eternal night a new god observes and blesses the success of the mission its lofty head is a ring of ten bleached skulls gazing in every direction its body is a tangled conglomeration of leg bones arm bones and rib cages it wears a necklace of finger and toe bones with screws and caulk and ductile adhesive he has brought it to life he sits before it in the captains chair discussing with it the secrets of the universe watching the void outside and the red star that is their final destination his creation tells him things terrible things that he has long suspected now confirmed in the glaring honesty of cold starlight he eats his meals before it calling upon it to bless the meat he tears into his latest chop red and quivering fresh and raw that is the only way to eat meat his new god approves with two months to go and two cryopods left pelops gets careless the man inside harmon sgt g revives while hes being tied his frosty eyelids flickering open some fightorflight mechanism kicks in and he knocks pelops from the opened pod spilling out on top of him wha he stammers whaaaaa pelops tries to club him on the head with a wrench but sgt harmon is already too fast he rolls away and pulls his hands free of the wire he kicks pelops in the side of the head stars swim crazily in pelops eyes pelops regains his senses to find harmon holding him against the wall pressing the tip of a screwdriver against his neck the sergeant is still cold and reeks of cryonic fluid he breathes hotly in pelops face the crystals on his beard beginning to melt who are you he asks and what the hell are you doing he shoves the screwdriver painfully into pelops skin drawing a trickle of blood im dr pelops he says i had to awaken you prematurely harmon looks around the corridor sees the empty pods all but one now missing its inhabitant where are they his teeth are gritted as his black eyes bore into pelops tell me dead pelops admits there was a comet or a meteor some kind of radiation cloud took out the autodrive and the pods i was lucky harmon blinks thinking considering he knows im not telling him everything his eyes fall upon the last functioning cryopod why didnt you wake captain tyler i i was going to says pelops harmon grabs pelops throat in an iron grip then why tie me up huh pelops says nothing gasps for air you look like hell says harmon examining him hair and beard a matted rats nest face sunken skin sallow nails long as claws can he smell the dead on my breath how long asks harmon rams his knee into pelops groin pelops falls to the cold floor harmon bends and holds the screwdrivers tip to his eye how long he shouts fffourteen months cries pelops shock spills across harmons shaggy face fourteen he looks again at the empty rows of cryopods stares down the corridor in either direction sniffs the air like a suspicious hound fourteen months how did you survive pelops clutches his throbbing groin and says nothing harmon kicks him in the stomach how tell me say it pelops tells him doesnt look at his face hears him start to wretch all that matters is the success of this mission pelops growls and im the only one who can get those converters up and running harmon is strangely quiet weve got two more months says pelops harmons boot comes down hard on his face darkness hes a sick fuck pelops regains consciousness wrapped in a web of pain no its the copper wire hes propped upright inside one of the defunct pods in the corridor harmon stands arguing with another man the inhabitant of the last pod the ships captain tyler capt h a sinking feeling as he realizes that harmon has revived tyler far too early he tries to move his arms and legs but hes securely bound he listens to their conversation watching them in the corner of his eye i know how you feel soldier says captain tyler still wiping frost from his flight suit rubbing a hand across the back of his neck but pelops is the only one who knows how to set up those uv converter domes and get them operational we cant just execute him execute who said anything about an execution you dont execute a mad dog captain you put it down and thats what we have here he fuckin ate them didnt you hear me i heard you son a weary sigh come on says harmon let me show you the nice little present he built for us on the bridge once you see that im sure youll agree to shoving him out the airlock at the least the sound of their boots tramping down the corridor pelops waits prays mutters poems to his bone god eventually the voices return growing in volume punctuated by the sounds of boots on metal even if we do this were still going to starve theres no food left on board and we cant enter cryo again this is the end of the line for us then it doesnt matter does it let me kill him one last good thing before we die then well set the autodestruct go out in a blaze of glory better than starving to death captain tyler has no response to that the two men stand before the open cryopod now looking at pelops captain pelops says you know as well as i do shut up freak sgt harmons fist slams into his gut the air rushes from his lungs along with the words he failed to utter harmon lifts a service pistol to pelops chin the barrel digging into his jawbone all of us may have to die harmon tells him but youre going first you cannibal fu thud a flash of silver above his head a meaty sound and harmon goes down captain tyler stands over him with the wrench in his hand its round end drips dark blood like syrup and a clot of hair and skin hangs there tyler drops the wrench and peels the coils of wire away from pelops wrists and ankles the captain is silent for awhile as pelops rubs his limbs to get the circulation flowing again tyler stares at his fallen officer leans against the wall tired ready to accept his fate you did the right thing doctor says tyler his sunken eyes turn toward pelops they are as black and glittering as the void the famine on dantus could kill tens of thousands this mission has to succeed pelops nods his stomach growls he is ravenous can you still make it work asks tyler pelops stares down at the unconscious soldier makes a few mental calculations rubs his sore temple yes he says with your help the mission will still succeed tyler helps pelops carry harmon into the infirmary pelops carefully rations out pieces of harmon over the next few weeks tyler holds out for sixteen days but eventually joins him for a slight meal pelops insists its imperative to this mission that you stay alive captain he says just a little while longer tyler wont go near the infirmary the blow to harmons head inflicted some kind of brain damage so he remains comatose as hes carved to bits day after day just as well no screams to deal with but still tyler takes it hard he sits on the bridge in his chair most days staring at the red star growing ever brighter directly ahead pelops thought the captain would dismantle the bone god but tyler doesnt seem to mind it or perhaps hes frightened of it too frightened of its power to risk desecrating it he must know that it not him now rules the goya harmon would have lasted longer if pelops did not share him with tyler however tyler ate so very little only enough to keep himself alive for another month finally when the last of harmon has been consumed and his bones have been added to the gods intricate frame tyler comes to pelops a broken man emaciated begging to be put out of his misery its all my fault tyler tells him weeping pelops listens it was my responsibility to make sure we had extra emergency kits i didnt do it pelops leads him into the infirmary tyler babbles weeping trying to maximize profits cut corners it should have been a simple trip i did it to save money pelops i killed us all for money not all of us captain says pelops tyler nods wipes his swollen eyes he must be thinking of those starving families on dantus now i am sorry there is no more anesthetic for this captain just do it says tyler he unholsters his pistol lays it on a nearby counter get it over with kill me for dantus for all those children kill me now if you wouldnt mind lying on the table first says pelops tyler complies pelops straps him down securely and prepares the laser scalpel what are you doing asks tyler one shot between the eyes will do it make it quick pelops pelops hesitates it seems the captain has misunderstood his role here weve still got over a month of travel time sir pelops explains if i kill you now im afraid youll spoil before we reach dantus tylers shock registers as a moment of silence no he says shaking his head no you can eat for two or three weeks and the last few days you can go without youll be fine as soon as you touch down youll have food on dantus you dont need me to last that long pelops im sorry captain says pelops but i dont like to go hungry he ignores the captains screaming and writhing as he puts the gag on him same old reaction pulling against the restraints wearing the throat raw with grunts and smothered screams its for the mission pelops reminds him he starts with the legs as usual tyler once a strong and vital man lasts nearly three weeks on the table in the end with the last few scraps of tyler gone pelops still has six days left to starve the red star swells brighter than ever among the starfields in the viewport pelops sits in the captains chair and stares into the shimmering void everything from plants to mammals is fueled by the light of stars sunlight fuels photosynthesis which feeds the plants that in turn feed the animals we eat on earth photons and atoms being constantly recycled and reinvented a molecular dance of destruction and creation that never ends everything consumes and is consumed we are all made of starlight brilliant starlight pulsing bright as blood inside us its all energy and energy is neither created nor destroyed his stomach growls in the glow of a red sun the goya touches down atop a broad plateau littered with wrecked vehicles and rusting machines pelops stumbles from the open hatch into the ruddy glow he walks with a single crutch made of bones his right leg is missing below the knee a fresh tourniquet wrapped tight about the stump he held out for two difficult days before the hunger won its final victory still he has made it to this place a nice prosthetic limb waits in his future he blinks in the harsh glow of infrared daylight and stares across the plateau at the colonial city he stumbles through the wreckage toward the dilapidated walls the wind hurls black sand against him raking like claws across his flight suit and his exposed cheeks coating his beard with dirt where is everyone there should be a welcoming party to greet him theyve waited seven years the famine won here he realizes im too late he walks through dried fields where crops have died in geometrical rows now only the fossilized stubs of cornstalks rear from the smothering sand he sees the distant towers more clearly now skeletal and stark they stand against the purple sky he walks with his crutch among the hulks of dead machines until the sun sinks below the flat horizon the ruined city looms before him no signs of life hunger did this is there anyone left at all he calls out his voice echoes between crumbling walls along vacant streets the bleak stars emerge to glimmer in the night sky we are all made of starlight finally a group of thin shadows emerges from a ramshackle hut near a fallen tower survivors they converge upon him like wary dogs trailing rags he sees their young faces smudged with dirt and lean as wolves they smile showing rotted teeth he waves they carry sharp knives that gleam in the twilight wait he says my name is pelopsfrom the earth ship goya ive brought what you need yes i see that says a raggedy woman brandishing her knife we can always use fresh meat it is impossible for him to run on a single leg their knives sink deeply a dozen whispers of metal beachworld stephen king fedship asn fell out of the sky and crashed after a while two men slipped from its cloven skull like brains they walked a little way and then stood helmets beneath their arms and looked at where they had finished up it was a beach in no need of an oceanit was its own ocean a sculpted sea of sand a blackandwhitesnapshot sea frozen forever in troughs and crests and more troughs and crests dunes shallow ones steep ones smooth ones corrugated ones knifecrested dunes planecrested dunes irregularly crested dunes that resembled dunes piled on dunesdunedominoes dunes but no ocean the valleys which were the troughs between these dunes snaked in mazy black ratruns if one looked at those twisting lines long enough they might seem to spell wordsblack words hovering over the white dunes fuck shapiro said bend over rand said shapiro started to spit then thought better of it looking at all that sand made him think better of it this was not the time to go wasting moisture perhaps halfburied in the sand asn didnt look like a dying bird anymore it looked like a gourd that had broken open and disclosed rot inside there had been a fire the starboard fuelpods had all exploded too bad about grimes shapiro said yeah rands eyes were still roaming the sand sea out to the limiting line of the horizon and then coming back again it was too bad about grimes grimes was dead grimes was now nothing but large chunks and small chunks in the aft storage compartment shapiro had looked in and thought it looks like god decided to eat grimes found out he didnt taste good and sicked him up again that had been too much for shapiros own stomach that and the sight of grimess teeth scattered across the floor of the storage compartment shapiro now waited for rand to say something intelligent but rand was quiet rands eyes tracked over the dunes traced the clockspring windings of the deep troughs between hey shapiro said at last what do we do grimes is dead youre in command what do we do do rands eyes moved back and forth back and forth over the stillness of the dunes a dry steady wind ruffled the rubberized collar of the environmental protection suit if you dont have a volleyball i dont know what are you talking about isnt that what youre supposed to do on the beach rand asked play volleyball shapiro had been scared in space many times and close to panic when the fire broke out now looking at rand he heard a rumor of fear too large to comprehend its big rand said dreamily and for one moment shapiro thought that rand was speaking of shapiros own fear one hell of a big beach something like this could go on forever you could walk a hundred miles with your surfboard under your arm and still be where you started almost with nothing behind you but six or seven footprints and if you stood in the same place for five minutes the last six or seven would be gone too did you get a topographical compscan before we came down rand was in shock he decided rand was in shock but rand was not crazy he could give rand a pill if he had to and if rand continued to spin his wheels he could give him a shot did you get a look at rand looked at him briefly what the green places that had been what he was going to say it sounded like a quote from psalms and he couldnt say it the wind made a silver chime in his mouth what rand asked again compscan compscan shapiro screamed you ever hear of a compscan dronehead whats this place like wheres the ocean at the end of the fucking beach wheres the lakes wheres the nearest greenbelt which direction where does the beach end end oh i grok you it never ends no greenbelts no ice caps no oceans this is a beach in search of an ocean mate dunes and dunes and dunes and they never end but whatll we do for water nothing we can do the ship its beyond repair no shit sherlock shapiro fell quiet it was now either be quiet or become hysterical he had a feelingalmost a certaintythat if he became hysterical rand would just go on looking at the dunes until shapiro worked it out or until he didnt what did you call a beach that never ended why you called it a desert biggest motherfucking desert in the universe wasnt that right in his head he heard rand respond no shit sherlock shapiro stood for some time beside rand waiting for the man to wake up to do something after a while his patience ran out he began to slide and stumble back down the flank of the dune they had climbed to look around he could feel the sand sucking against his boots want to suck you down bill his mind imagined the sand saying in his mind it was the dry arid voice of a woman who was old but still terribly strong want to suck you right down here and giveyou a great big hug that made him think about how they used to take turns letting the others bury them up to their necks at the beach when he was a kid then it had been funnow it scared him so he turned that voice offthis was no time for memory lane christ noand walked through the sand with short sharp kicking strides trying unconsciously to mar the symmetrical perfection of its slope and surface where are you going rands voice for the first time held a note of awareness and concern the beacon shapiro said im going to turn it on we were on a mapped lane of travel itll be picked up vectored its a question of time i know the odds are shitty but maybe somebody will come before the beacons smashed to hell rand said it happened when we came down maybe it can be fixed shapiro called back over his shoulder as he ducked through the hatchway he felt better in spite of the smellsfried wiring and a bitter whiff of freon gas he told himself he felt better because he had thought of the beacon no matter how paltry the beacon offered some hope but it wasnt the thought of the beacon that had lifted his spirits if rand said it was broken it was probably most righteously broken but he could no longer see the dunescould no longer see that big neverending beach that was what made him feel better when he got to the top of the first dune again struggling and panting his temples pounding with the dry heat rand was still there still staring and staring and staring an hour had gone by the sun stood directly above them rands face was wet with perspiration jewels of it nestled in his eyebrows droplets ran down his cheeks like tears more droplets ran down the cords of his neck and into the neck of his ep suit like drops of colorless oil running into the guts of a pretty good android dronehead i called him shapiro thought with a little shudder christ thats what he looks likenot an android but a droneheadwho just took a neckshot with a very big needle and rand had been wrong after all rand no answer the beacon wasnt broken there was a flicker in rands eyes then they went blank again staring out at the mountains of sand frozen shapiro had first thought them but he supposed they moved the wind was constant they would move over a period of decades and centuries they would well would walk wasnt that what they called dunes on a beach walking dunes he seemed to remember that from his childhood or school or someplace and what in the hell did it matter now he saw a delicate rill of sand slip down the flank of one of them as if it heard heard what i was thinking fresh sweat on the back of his neck all right he was getting a touch of the whimwhams who wouldnt this was a tight place they were in very tight and rand seemed not to know it or not to care it had some sand in it and the warbler was cracked but there must have been sixty of those in grimess oddsandends box is he even hearing me i dont know how the sand got in itit was right where it was supposed to be in the storage compartment behind the bunk three closed hatches between it and the outside but oh sand spreads gets into everything remember going to the beach when you were a kid bill youd come home and your mother would yell at you because there was sand everywhere sand in the couch sand on the kitchen table sand down the foot of your bed beach sand is very he gestured vaguely and then that dreamy unsettling smile resurfaced ubiquitous but it didnt hurt it any shapiro continued the emergency power output system is ticking over and i plugged the beacon into it i put on the earphones for a minute and asked for an equivalency reading at fifty parsecs sounds like a power saw its better than we could have hoped no ones going to come not even the beach boys the beach boys have all been dead for eight thousand years welcome to surf city bill surf city sans surf shapiro stared out at the dunes he wondered how long the sand had been here a trillion years a quintillion had there been life here once maybe even something with intelligence rivers green places oceans to make it a real beach instead of a desert shapiro stood next to rand and thought about it the steady wind ruffled his hair and quite suddenly he was sure all those things had been and he could picture how they must have ended the slow retreat of the cities as their waterways and outlying areas were first speckled then dusted finally drifted and choked by the creeping sand he could see the shiny brown alluvial fans of mud sleek as sealskins at first but growing duller and duller in color as they spread further and further out from the mouths of the riversout and out until they met each other he could see sleek sealskin mud becoming reedinfested swamp then gray gritty till finally shifting white sand he could see mountains shortening like sharpened pencils their snow melting as the rising sand brought warm thermal updrafts against them he could see the last few crags pointing at the sky like the fingertips of men buried alive he could see them covered and immediately forgotten by the profoundly idiotic dunes what had rand called them ubiquitous if you just had a vision billyboy it was a pretty goddam dreadfulone oh but no it wasnt it wasnt dreadful it was peaceful it was as quiet as a nap on a sunday afternoon what was more peaceful than the beach he shook these thoughts away it helped to look back toward the ship there isnt going to be any cavalry rand said the sand will cover us and after a while well be the sand and the sand will be us surf city with no surfcan you catch that wave bill and shapiro was scared because he could catch it you couldnt see all those dunes without getting it fucking dronehead asshole he said he went back to the ship and hid from the beach sunset finally came the time when at the beachany real beachyou were supposed to put away the volleyball and put on your sweats and get out the weenies and the beer not time to start necking yet but almost time to look forward to the necking weenies and beer had not been a part of asns stores shapiro spent the afternoon carefully bottling all of the ships water he used a portavac to suck up that which had run out of the ruptured veins in the ships supply system and puddled on the floor he got the small bit left in the bottom of the shattered hydraulic systems water tank he did not overlook even the small cylinder in the guts of the airpurification system which circulated air in the storage areas finally he went into grimess cabin grimes had kept goldfish in a circular tank constructed especially for weightless conditions the tank was built of impactresistant clearpolymer plastic and had survived the crash easily the goldfishlike their ownerhad not been impactresistant they floated in a dull orange clump at the top of the ball which had come to rest under grimess bunk along with three pairs of very dirty underwear and half a dozen porno holographcubes he held the globe aquarium for a moment looking fixedly into it alas poor yorick i knew him well he said suddenly and laughed a screaming distracted laugh then he got the net grimes kept in his lockbin and dipped it into the tank he removed the fish and then wondered what to do with them after a moment he took them to grimess bed and raised his pillow there was sand underneath he put the fish there regardless then carefully poured the water into the jerrican he was using as a catcher it would all have to be purified but even if the purifiers hadnt been working he thought that in another couple of days he wouldnt balk at drinking aquarium water just because it might have a few loose scales and a little goldfish shit in it he purified the water divided it and took rands share back up the side of the dune rand was right where he had been as if he had never moved rand i brought you your share of the water he unzipped the pouch on the front of rands ep suit and slipped the flat plastic flask inside he was about to press the zipstrip closed with his thumbnail when rand brushed his hand away he took the flask out stenciled on the front was asnclass ships supplies storage flask cl sterile when seal is unbroken the seal was broken now of course shapiro had had to fill the bottle up i purified rand opened his fingers the flask fell into the sand with a soft plop dont want it dont rand whats wrong with you jesus christ will you stop it rand did not reply shapiro bent over and picked up storage flask he brushed off the grains of sand clinging to the sides as if they were huge swollen germs whats wrong with you shapiro repeated is it shock do you think thats what it is because i can give you a pill or a shot but its getting to me i dont mind telling you you just standing out here looking at the next forty miles of nothing its sand just sand its a beach rand said dreamily want to make a sand castle okay good shapiro said im going to go get a needle and an amp of yellowjack if you want to act like a goddam dronehead ill treat you like one if you try to inject me with something you better be quiet when you sneak up behind me rand said mildly otherwise ill break your arm he could do it too shapiro the astrogator weighed a hundred and forty pounds and stood fivefive physical combat was not his specialty he grunted an oath and turned away back to the ship holding rands flask i think its alive rand said im actually pretty sure of it shapiro looked back at him and then out at the dunes the sunset had given them a gold filigree at their smooth sweeping caps a filigree that shaded delicately down to the blackest ebony in the troughs on the next dune ebony shaded back to gold gold to black black to gold gold to black and black to gold and gold to shapiro blinked his eyes rapidly and rubbed a hand over them i have several times felt this particular dune move under my feet rand told shapiro it moves very gracefully it is like feeling the tide i can smell its smell on the air and the smell is like salt youre crazy shapiro said he was so terrified that he felt as if his brains had turned to glass rand did not reply rands eyes searched the dunes which went from gold to black to gold to black in the sunset shapiro went back to the ship rand stayed on the dune all night and all the next day shapiro looked out and saw him rand had taken off his ep suit and the sand had almost covered it only one sleeve stuck out forlorn and supplicating the sand above and below it reminded shapiro of a pair of lips sucking with a toothless greed at a tender morsel shapiro felt a crazy desire to pelt up the side of the dune and rescue rands ep suit he did not he sat in his cabin and waited for the rescue ship the smell of freon had dissipated it was replaced by the even less desirable smell of grimes decaying the rescue ship did not come that day or that night or on the third day sand somehow appeared in shapiros cabin although the hatchway was closed and the seal still appeared perfectly tight he sucked the little puddles of sand up with the portavac as he had sucked up puddles of spilled water on that first day he was very thirsty all the time his flask was nearly empty already he thought he had begun to smell salt on the air in his sleep he heard the sound of gulls and he could hear the sand the steady wind was moving the first dune closer to the ship his cabin was still okaythanks to the portavacbut the sand was already taking over the rest minidunes had reached through the blown locks and laid hold of asn it sifted in tendrils and membranes through the vents there was a drift in one of the blown tanks shapiros face grew gaunt and pebbly with beard shadow near sunset of the third day he climbed up the dune to check on rand he thought about taking a hypodermic then rejected it it was a lot more than shock he knew that now rand was insane it would be best if he died quickly and it looked as if that was exactly what was going to happen shapiro was gaunt rand was emaciated his body was a scrawny stick his legs formerly rich and thick with ironpumpers muscle were now slack and droopy the skin hung on them like loose socks that keep falling down he was wearing only his undershorts and they were red nylon and they looked absurdly like a ballhugger bathing suit a light beard had begun to grow on his face fuzzing his hollow cheeks and chin his beard was the color of beach sand his hair formerly a listless brown shade had bleached out to a near blond it hung over his forehead only his eyes peering through the fringe of his hair with bright blue intensity still lived fully they studied the beach the dunes goddammit the dunes relentlessly now shapiro saw a bad thing it was a very bad thing indeed he saw that rands face was turning into a sand dune his beard and his hair were choking his skin you shapiro said are going to die if you dont come down to the ship and drink you are going to die rand said nothing is that what you want nothing there was the vacuous snuffle of the wind but no more shapiro observed that the creases of rands neck were filling up with sand the only thing i want rand said in a faint faraway voice like the wind is my beach boys tapes theyre in my cabin fuck you shapiro said furiously but do you know what i hope i hope a ship comes before you die i want to see you holler and scream when they pull you away from your precious goddam beach i want to see what happens then beachll get you too rand said his voice was empty and rattling like wind inside a split gourda gourd which has been left in a field at the end of octobers last harvest take a listen bill listen to the wave rand cocked his head his mouth halfopen revealed his tongue it was as shriveled as a dry sponge shapiro heard something he heard the dunes they sang songs of sunday afternoon at the beachnaps on the beach with no dreams long naps mindless peace the sound of crying gulls shifting thoughtless particles walking dunes he heard and was drawn drawn toward the dunes you hear it rand said shapiro reached into his nose and dug with two fingers until it bled then he could close his eyes his thoughts came slowly and clumsily together his heart was racing i was almost like rand jesus it almost had me he opened his eyes again and saw that rand had become a conch shell on a long deserted beach straining forward toward all the mysteries of an undead sea staring out at the dunes and the dunes and the dunes no more shapiro moaned inside himself oh but listen to this wave the dunes whispered back against his better judgment shapiro listened then his better judgment ceased to exist shapiro thought i could hear better if i sat down he sat down at rands feet and put his heels on his thighs like a yaqui indian and listened he heard the beach boys and the beach boys were singing about fun fun fun he heard them singing that the girls on the beach were all within reach he heard a hollow sighing of the wind not in his ear but in the canyon between right brain and left brainhe heard that sighing somewhere in the blackness which is spanned only by the suspension bridge of the corpus callosum which connects conscious thought to the infinite he felt no hunger no thirst no heat no fear he heard only the voice in the emptiness and a ship came it came swooping out of the sky afterburners scratching a long orange track from right to left thunder belted the deltawave topography and several dunes collapsed like bulletpath brain damage the thunder ripped billy shapiros head open and for a moment he was torn both ways ripped torn down the middle then he was up on his feet ship he screamed holy fuck ship ship ship it was a belt trader dirty and buggered by five hundredor five thousandyears of clan service it surfed through the air banged crudely upright skidded the captain blew jets and fused sand into black glass shapiro cheered the wound rand looked around like a man awaking from a deep dream tell it to go away billy you dont understand shapiro was shambling around shaking his fists in the air youll be all right he broke toward the dirty trader in big leaping strides like a kangaroo running from a ground fire the sand clutched at him shapiro kicked it away fuck you sand i got a honey back in hansonville sand never had no honey beach never had no hardon the traders hull split a gangplank popped out like a tongue a man strode down it behind three sampler androids and a guy built into treads that was surely the captain he wore a beret with a clan symbol on it anyway one of the androids waved a sampler wand at him shapiro batted it away he fell on his knees in front of the captain and embraced the treads which had replaced the captains dead legs the dunes rand no water alive hypnotized him dronehead world thank god a steel tentacle whipped around shapiro and yanked him away on his gut dry sand whispered underneath him like laughter its okay the captain said beyat shel me me gat the android dropped shapiro and backed away clittering distractedly to itself all this way for a fucking fed the captain exclaimed bitterly shapiro wept it hurt not just in his head but in his liver dud geeyat gat waterforhimcry the man who had been in the lead tossed him a nippled lowgrav bottle shapiro upended it and sucked greedily spilling crystalcold water into his mouth down his chin in dribbles that darkened his tunic which had bleached to the color of bone he choked vomited then drank again dud and the captain watched him closely the androids clittered at last shapiro wiped his mouth and sat up he felt both sick and well you shapiro the captain asked shapiro nodded clan affiliation none asn number crew three one dead the otherrandup there he pointed but did not look the captains face did not change duds face did the beach got him shapiro said he saw their questioning veiled looks shock maybe he seems hypnotized he keeps talking about the the beach boys never mind you wouldnt know he wouldnt drink or eat hes bad off dud take one of the andies and get him down from there he shook his head fed ship christ no salvage dud nodded a few moments later he was scrambling up the side of the dune with one of the andies the andy looked like a twentyyearold surfer who might make dope money on the side servicing bored widows but his stride gave him away even more than the segmented tentacles which grew from his armpits the stride common to all androids was the slow reflective almost painful stride of an aging english butler with hemorrhoids there was a buzz from the captains dashboard im here this is gomez cap we got a situation here compscan and surface telemetry show us a very unstable surface theres no bedrock that we can targ were resting on our own burn and right now that may be the hardest thing on the whole planet trouble is the burn itself is starting to settle recommendation we ought to get out when five minutes ago youre a laugh riot gomez the captain punched a button and the communicator went out shapiros eyes were rolling look never mind rand hes had it im taking you both back the captain said i got no salvage but the federation ought to pay something for the two of you not that either of you are worth much as far as i can see hes crazy and youre chickenshit no you dont understand you the captains cunning yellow eyes gleamed you got any contra he asked captain look please because if you do theres no sense just leaving it here tell me what it is and where it is ill split seventythirty standard salvors fee couldnt do any better than that hey you the burn suddenly tilted beneath them quite noticeably tilted a horn somewhere inside the trader began to blat with muffled regularity the communicator on the captains dashboard went off again there shapiro screamed there do you see what youre upagainst you want to talk about contraband now we havegottogetthe fuck out of here shut up handsome or ill have one of these guys sedate you the captain said his voice was serene but his eyes had changed he thumbed the communicator cap i got ten degrees of tilt and were getting more the elevators going down but its going on an angle weve still got time but not much the ships going to fall over the struts will hold her no sir begging the captains pardon they wont start firing sequences gomez thank you sir the relief in gomezs voice was unmistakable dud and the android were coming back down the flank of the dune rand wasnt with them the andy fell further and further behind and now a strange thing happened the andy fell over on its face the captain frowned it did not fall as an andy is supposed to fallwhich is to say like a human being more or less it was as if someone had pushed over a mannequin in a department store it fell over like that thump and a little tan cloud of sand puffed up from around it dud went back and knelt by it the andys legs were still moving as if it dreamed in the million freoncooled microcircuits that made up its mind that it still walked but the leg movements were slow and cracking they stopped smoke began to come out of its pores and its tentacles shivered in the sand it was gruesomely like watching a human die a deep grinding came from inside it graaaagggg full of sand shapiro whispered its got beach boys religion the captain glanced at him impatiently dont be ridiculous man that thing could walk through a sandstorm and not get a grain inside it not on this world the burn settled again the trader was now clearly canted there was a low groan as the struts took more weight leave it the captain bawled at dud leave it leave it geeyat comemeforcry dud came leaving the andy to walk facedown in the sand what a ballsup the captain muttered he and dud engaged in a conversation spoken entirely in a rapid pidgin dialect which shapiro was able to follow to some degree dud told the captain that rand had refused to come the andy had tried to grab rand but with no force even then it was moving jerkily and strange grating sounds were coming from inside it also it had begun to recite a combination of galactic stripmining coordinates and a catalogue of the captains folkmusic tapes dud himself had then closed with rand they had struggled briefly the captain told dud that if dud had allowed a man who had been standing three days in the hot sun to get the better of him that maybe he ought to get another first duds face darkened with embarrassment but his grave concerned look never faltered he slowly turned his head revealing four deep furrows in his cheek they were welling slowly himgat big indics dud said strongforcry himgat for umby umbyhim forcry the captain was looking at dud sternly dud nodded umby beyatshel umbyforcry shapiro had been frowning conning his tired frightened mind for that word now it came umby it meant crazy hes strong forchrists sake strong because hes crazy hes got big ways big forcebecause hes crazy big ways or maybe it meant big waves he wasnt sure either way it came to the same umby the ground shifted underneath them again and sand blew across shapiros boots from behind them came the hollow kathud kathud kathud of the breathertubes opening shapiro thought it one of the most lovely sounds he had ever heard in his life the captain sat deep in thought a weird centaur whose lower half was treads and plates instead of horse then he looked up and thumbed the communicator gomez send excellent montoya down here with a tranquilizer gun acknowledged the captain looked at shapiro now on top of everything else ive lost an android worth your salary for the next ten years im pissed off i mean to have your buddy captain shapiro could not help licking his lips he knew this was a very illchosen thing to do he did not want to appear mad hysterical or craven and the captain had apparently decided he was all three licking his lips like that would only add to the impression but he simply couldnt help himself captain i cannot impress on you too strongly the need to get off this world as soon as poss can it dronehead the captain said not unkindly a thin scream rose from the top of the nearest dune dont touch me dont come near me leave me alone all ofyou big indics gat umby dud said gravely mahim yeahmon the captain returned and then turned to shapiro he really is bad off isnt he shapiro shuddered you dont know you just the burn settled again the struts were groaning louder than ever the communicator crackled gomezs voice was thin a little unsteady we have to get out of here right now cap all right a brown man appeared on the gangway he held a long pistol in one gloved hand the captain pointed at randmahim forcry can excellent montoya unperturbed by the tilting earth that was not earth but only sand fused to glass and there were deep cracks running through it now shapiro saw unbothered by the groaning struts or the eerie sight of an android that now appeared to be digging its own grave with its feet studied rands thin figure for a moment can he said gat gatforcry the captain spat to one side shoot his pecker off i dont care he said just as long as hes still breathing when we ship excellent montoya raised the pistol the gesture was apparently twothirds casual and onethird careless but shapiro even in his state of nearpanic noted the way montoyas head tilted to one side as he lined the barrel up like many in the clans the gun would be nearly a part of him like pointing his own finger there was a hollow fooh as he squeezed the trigger and the tranquilizer dart blew out of the barrel a hand reached out of the dune and clawed it down it was a large brown hand wavery made of sand it simply reached up in defiance of the wind and smothered the momentary glitter of the dart then the sand fell back with a heavy thrrrrap no hand impossible to believe there had been but they had all seen it giddyhump the captain said in an almost conversational voice excellent montoya fell on his knees aidymayforcry bitgatcome sawhoh got bellygatforcry numbly shapiro realized montoya was saying a rosary in pidgin up on the dune rand was jumping up and down shaking his fists at the sky screeching thinly in triumph a hand it was ahand hes right its alive alive alive indic the captain said sharply to montoya cannit gat montoya shut up his eyes touched on the capering figure of rand and then he looked away his face was full of superstitious horror nearly medieval in quality okay the captain said ive had enough i quit were going he shoved two buttons on his dashboard the motor that should have swiveled him neatly around so he faced up the gangplank again did not hum it squealed and grated the captain cursed the burn shifted again captain gomez in a panic the captain slammed in another button and the treads began to move backward up the gangplank guide me the captain said to shapiro i got no fucking rearview mirror it was a hand wasnt it yes i want to get out of here the captain said its been fourteen years since i had a cock but right now i feel like im pissing myself thrrap a dune suddenly collapsed over the gangway only it wasnt a dune it was an arm fuck oh fuck the captain said on his dune rand capered and screeched now the threads of the captains lower half began to grind the minitank of which the captains head and shoulders were the turret now began to judder backward what the treads locked sand splurted out from between them pick me up the captain bawled to the two remaining androids now rightnow their tentacles curled around the tread sprockets as they picked him uphe looked ridiculously like a faculty member about to be tossed in a blanket by a bunch of roughhousing fraternity boys he was thumbing the communicator gomez final firing sequence now now the dune at the foot of the gangplank shifted became a hand a large brown hand that began to scrabble up the incline shrieking shapiro bolted from that hand cursing the captain was carried away from it the gangplank was pulled up the hand fell off and became sand again the hatchway irised closed the engines howled no time for a couch no time for anything like that shapiro dropped into a crashfold position on the bulkhead and was promptly smashed flat by the acceleration before unconsciousness washed over him it seemed he could feel sand grasping at the trader with muscular brown arms straining to hold them down then they were up and away rand watched them go he was sitting down when the track of the traders jets was at last gone from the sky he turned his eyes out to the placid endlessness of the dunes we got a wagon and we call it a woody he croaked to the empty moving sand it aint very cherry its an oldy but a goody slowly reflectively he began to cram handful after handful of sand into his mouth he swallowed swallowed swallowed soon his belly was a swollen barrel and sand began to drift over his legs standard loneliness package charles yu root canal is one fifty give or take depending on whos doing it to you a migraine is two hundred not that i get the money the company gets it what i get is twelve dollars an hour plus reimbursement for painkillers not that they work i feel pain for money other peoples pain physical emotional you name it pain is an illusion i know and so is time i know i know i know the shift manager never stops reminding us doesnt help actually doesnt help when you are on your third broken leg of the day i get to work late and already there are nine tickets in my inbox i close my eyes take a deep breath open the first ticket of the day i am at a funeral i am feeling grief someone elses grief i am feeling a mixture of things grief mostly but i also detect that there is some guilt in there there usually is i hear crying i am seeing crying faces pretty faces crying pretty white faces nice clothes our services arent cheap as the shift manager is always reminding us need i remind you that is his favorite phrase these days he is always walking up and down the aisle tilting his head into our cubicles and saying it need i remind you he says of where we are on the spectrum in terms of lowendhighend we are solidly towards the highishend so the faces are usually pretty the clothes are usually nice the people are usually nice too although i imagine that its easy to be nice when you are rich and pretty even when youre at a funeral theres a place in hyderabad that is doing what were doing a little more towards the budget end of things precision living solutions its called and of course there are hundreds of emotional engineering firms in bangalore springing up everywhere you look i read in the paper that a new call center opens on average like every three days okay body is going into the ground now the crying is getting more serious here it comes i am feeling that feeling the one that these people get a lot near the end of a funeral service these sad and pretty people its a big feeling different operators have different ways to describe it for me it feels something like a huge boot huge like it fills up the whole sky the whole galaxy all of space some kind of infinite foot and its stepping on me the infinite foot is stepping on my chest the funeral ends and the foot is still on me and it is hard to breathe people are getting into black town cars i also appear to have a town car i get in the foot the foot so heavy here we go yes this is familiar the foot yes the foot it doesnt hurt exactly its not what i would call comfortable but its not pain either more like pressure deepak who used to be in the next cubicle once told me that this feeling which i call the infinite footto him it felt more like a kneeis actually the american experience of the christian god are you sure it is the christian god i asked him i always thought god was jewish youre an idiot he said its the same guy duh the judeochristian god are you sure i said he just shook his head at me wed had this conversation before i figured he was probably right but i didnt want to admit it deepak was the smartest guy in our cubecluster as he would kindly remind me several times a day i endure a few more minutes of the foot and then right before the hour is up right when the grief and guilt are almost too much and i wonder if i am going to have to hit the safety button there it is its usually there at the end of a funeral no matter how awful no matter how hard i am crying no matter how much guilt my client has saved up for me to feel you wouldnt expect iti didntbut anyone who has done this job for long enough knows what im talking about it seems unbelievable but its there its almost always there even if its just a glimmer of it and even though you know its coming even when you are waiting for it in fact when it comes it is always still a little bit of a shock relief death of a cousin is

for you it shows a rich executivelookingtype sitting and rubbing his temples making the tv face to communicate the stress of his situation there are wavy lines on either side of his temples to indicate that the executive is really stressed then he places a call to his broker and in the next scene the executive is lying on a beach drinking golden beer from a bottle and looking at the bluest ocean i have ever seen i saw this on american television at the lunch counter across the street that has a satellite feed i was eating at the counter and next to me was a girl maybe four or five scooping rice and peas into her mouth a little at a time she watched the commercial in silence and after it was over turned to her mother and softly asked her what the blue liquid was i was thinking about how sad it was that she had never seen water that color in real life until i realized that i was thirtynine years old and hey you know what neither had i that someone else they are talking about in the commercial is meme and the other six hundred terminal operators in building d cubicle block dont feel like having a bad day let me have it for you its okay for me a good job i didnt do that well in school after all it was tougher for deep he did three semesters at technical college he was always saying he deserved better better than this anyway i would nod and agree with him but i never told him what i wanted to tell him which was hey deepak when you say that you deserve better even if i agree with you you are kind of also implying that i dont deserve better which maybe i dont maybe this is about where i belong in the grand scheme of things in terms of highendlowend for me as a person but i wish you wouldnt say it because whenever you do it makes me feel a sharp bit of sadness and then for the rest of the day a kind of lowgrade crumminess deep and i used to go to lunch and he always tried to explain to me how it works okay so the clients he would say they call into their account reps and book the time he liked to start sentences with okay so it was a habit he had picked up from the engineers he thought it made him sound smarter thought it made him sound like them those code geeks standing by the coffee machine talking faster than he could think every word a term of art every sentence packed with logic or small insights or a joke he liked to stand near them pretending to stir sugar into his coffee listening in on them as if they were speaking a different language a language of knowing something a language of being an expert at something a language of being something more than an hourly unit okay so he said they book the time and then at the appointed hour a switch in their implant chip kicks on and starts transferring their consciousness over perceptions sensory data all of it okay so then it goes first to an intermediate server for processing and then gets bundled with other jobs and then a huge block of the stuff gets zapped over here where it gets downloaded onto our servers and then dumped into our queue management system which parcels out the individual jobs to all of us in the cubicle farm okay so its all based on some kind of efficiency algorithmour historical performance our current emotional load sensors in our head assembly unit measure our stress levels sweat composition to see what we can handle okay he would say okay when he was done like a professor he wanted so badly to be an expert at something i always appreciated deepak trying to help me understand but its just a job i would say i never really understood why deep thought so much of those programmers either in the end were all brains for hire all i know is they seem to have gotten it down to a science how much a human being can take in a given twelvehour shift grief embarrassment humiliation all different of course so they calibrate our schedules mix it up the timing and the order and the end result is you leave work every day right about at your exact breaking point a lot of people smoke to take the edge off i quit twelve years ago so sometimes when i get home im still shaking for a little bit i sit on my couch and drink a beer and let it subside then i heat up some bread and lentils and read a newspaper or if its too hot to stay inside walk down to the street and eat my dinner there when i get to work the next morning theres a woman sitting in the cubicle across from mine shes young at least a couple of years younger than me looks right out of school she has the new employee setup kit laid out in front of her and is reading the trainee handbook i think about saying hi but who am i kidding i am still me so instead i just say nothing my first ticket of the day is a death bed death beds are not so common they are hard to schedulewe require at least twentyfour hours advance booking and usually clients dont know far enough in advance when the ailing beloved one is going to goso we dont see these too often but this isnt regular death bed its pulltheplug they are pulling the plug on grandpa this morning i open the ticket i am holding grandpas hand i cry he squeezes my hand one last burst of strength it hurts then his hand goes limp and his arm falls away i cry and also i really cry meaning not just as my client but i start crying too sometimes it happens i dont know why exactly maybe because he was somebodys grandpa and he looked like a nice one a nice man maybe something about the way his arm fell against the guard rail on the hospital bed maybe because i could sort of tell when grandpa was looking at his grandson for the last time looking into his eyes looking around in there trying to find him he didnt find him he found me instead and he knew what had happened and he didnt even look mad just hurt i am at a funeral i am in a dentists chair i am in a queensized motel bed feeling guilty i am quitting my job this is a popular one clients like to avoid the awkwardness of quitting their jobs so they set an appointment and walk into their bosses offices and tell them where they can stick this effing job and right before their boss starts to reply the switch kicks in and i get yelled at my teeth throb my kidneys seethe my lungs burn my heart aches on a bridge my heart aches on a bridge my heart aches on a cruise ship my heart aches on an airplane taking off at night some people think its not so great that we can do this personally i dont really see the problem press one to clear your conscience press two for fear of death consciousness is like anything else im sure when someone figures out how to sell time itself theyll have infomercials for that too i am at a funeral i am losing someone to cancer i am coping with something vague i am at a funeral i am at a funeral i am at a funeral fourteen tickets today in twelve hours four halfhours and ten full on my way out i can hear someone wailing and gnashing his teeth in his cubicle he is near the edge deepak was always like that too i always told him hey man you have to let go a little just a little dont let it get to you so much i peek my head to see if i can steal a glance at the new woman but she is in the middle of a ticket she appears to be suffering she catches me looking at her i look at my feet and keep shuffling past it used to be that the job wasnt all pain and suffering rich american man outsources the nasty bits of his life he is required to book by the hour or the day or some other time unit but in an hour or two or twentyfour hours of unpleasantness there are always going to be some parts of it that are not so bad maybe just boring maybe even not so bad maybe even more okay than not like if a guy books his colonoscopy and he hires us for two hours but for the first eight minutes hes just sitting there in the waiting room reading a magazine enjoying the air conditioning admiring someones legs or something anyway it used to be that we would get the whole thing so part of my job here could be boring or neutral or even sometimes kind of interesting but then the technology improved again and the packeting software was refined to filter out those intervals and collect them those bits the extras the slices of life that were left over were lopped off by the program and smushed all together into a kind of reconstituted life slab like american baloney lunchmeat a lifeloaf they take the slabs and process them and sell them as prepackaged lives ive had my eye on one for a while at a secondhand shop thats on my way home from work not ideal but its something to work for so now whats left over what we get to feel at work its all pretty much just pure undiluted badness the only thing left that can be a surprise is when even in the middle of badness there is something not so awful mixed in there like the relief in the middle of a funeral or sometimes when you get someone who is really religious not just religious but a true believer then mixed in with the sadness and loss at a funeral you get faith and you get to try different flavors depending on the believer you get the big foot on your chest or you get the back of your head on fire a cold fire it tickles you get to know what it is like to know that your dead lover your dead mother father brother sister that they are all standing in front of you tall as the universe and they have huge infinite feet and their heads are all ablaze with this brilliant frozen fire you get the feeling of being inside of a room and at the same time the room being inside of you and the room is the world and so are you the next day is more of the same eleven tickets including a twohour adultery confession to my husband of twentysix years after lunch i pass her in the hall the new woman her name badge says kirthi she doesnt look at me this time walking home i swing a block out of the way to check in on the secondhand shop someone bought my life it was there in the window yesterday and now its gone it wasnt my life technically not yet it was the life i wanted the life ive been saving for not a dreamlife not top of the line but a starter model a good one standard possibility normal volatility a darkhaired soulful wife kids no actualscertainties are too expensivebut some potential kids a solid thirtyfive percent chance of having one or more normal life expectancy average health median aggregate amount of happiness i testdrove it once and it felt good it felt right it fit just fine i dont know im trying not to feel sorry for myself i just thought there might be more to it all than this still ive got it better than some people i mean im renting my life out one day at a time but i havent sold it yet my father sold his life on a cold clear afternoon in november he was thirty it was the day before my fourth birthday we went to the brokerage it felt like a bank but friendlier my father had been carrying me on his back but he put me down when we got inside there was dark wood everywhere and also bright flowers and classical music we were shown to a desk and a woman in an immaculate pantsuit asked if we would like anything to drink my father didnt say anything just looked off at the far wall i remember my mother asked for a cup of tea for my father i dont want to sell my life im not ready to do that yet so i sell it bit by bit scrape by sell it by the hour pain grief terror worse or just mild discomfort social anxiety boredom i ask around about kirthi people are talking the guys are talking especially the married guys they do the most talking i pass her in the hall again and again she doesnt look at me no surprise there women never look at me i am not handsome or tall but i am nice i think it is actually that which causes the notlooking at me the niceness i mean not the lack of handsomeness or tallness they can see the niceness and it is the kind of niceness that in a man you instinctively ignore what good is a nice man no good to women no good to other men she doesnt look at me but i feel or maybe i wish or i imagine that something in the way she does not look at me is not quite the same she is notlooking at me in a way that feels like she is consciously notlooking at me and from the way she is notlooking at me i can tell she knows i am trying to notlook at her we are both notlooking at each other for some reason for the first time in a long while i have hope i dont know why but i do i am at a funeral im flipped to green you can be flipped to green or flipped to red you can be there or can just feel the feeling this is the one improvement they have made that actually benefits us workers theres a toggle switch on the headset flip it to green and you get a rendering of the clients visual field you see what he sees flip it to red and you still feel all of the feelings but you see what you see you can do whatever you want so long as you dont leave your cubicle you can just stare at the cubedivider wall or play computer solitaire or even chat with neighbors although that is strongly discouraged i was hesitant at first but more and more these days i am usually flipped to red except for funerals funerals i like to be there just out of some kind of respect thing this mornings first ticket is your standard affair sixtyish rich guy heart attack in the home office millions in the bank five kids from three marriages all hate him the client is one of those kids trust fund baby paid extra for amnesia after the event no feeling no prefeeling no hangover no residue no chance of actually having any part of it long enough to ensure that he will be halfway in the bag before any of the days events start nibbling at the corners of his awareness i see the fresh open plot a little rain falls on the funeral procession as they get out of the cars but theres a break in the clouds so that its raining and the sun is shining at the same time as usual everyone is welldressed a lot of the rich look mildly betrayed in the face of death as if they are a little bit surprised that good style and enough money werent quite enough to protect them from the unpleasantness of it all im standing next to what i am guessing is widow number two late thirties probably with beautiful sandcolored hair we make eye contact and she is staring at me and i am trying not to stare at her and then we both realize the same thing at the same time raj i say under my breath she smiles rajiv is on night shift now but back in the day we had beers once in a while the pastor talks about a full life lived and the limits of earthly rewards and everyone nods affirmatively and then there is music as the body goes into the ground ive heard it at a lot of funerals mozart i think but i am not sure death of an aunt is seven hundred death of an uncle is six bad day in the markets is a thousand kids recital is a one twentyfive an hour church is onefifty the only category that we will not quote a price on is death of a child death of a child is separately negotiated hardly anyone can afford it and not all operators can handle it we have to be specially trained to be eligible for those tickets people go on sick leave disability most people just physically cannot do it there hasnt been one booked the whole time ive been here so most of us arent even sure what is true and what isnt the rumor is that if you do one you are allowed to take the rest of the month off deep was always tempted its not worth it i would tell him okay so maybe not for you deep said okay so mind your own business he would say the first time i talk to kirthi is by the water fountain i tell her we are neighbors cubiclewise she says she knows i feel a bit stupid the second time we talk we are also by the water fountain and i try to make a joke one of those we have to stop meeting like this things i probably saw it on tv and it just came out stupid she doesnt laugh but she doesnt frown either the third time we talk i kiss her by the microwave in the snack room i dont know what got into me i am not an aggressive person i am not physically strong i weigh one hundred and fiftyfive pounds she doesnt laugh she actually makes a face like disgust but she doesnt push me away either not right away she accepts the kiss doesnt kiss back but after a couple of seconds breaks it off and leans back and turns her head and says under her breath you shouldnt have done that and she doesnt say it in a nice way or like a threat just real even like she is stating a fact still i am happy ive got three more tickets in the bucket before lunch and then probably eight or nine before i go home but the whole rest of the day i am having an out of body experience even when i am in someone elses body i am still out of my body i am double out of my body i weep i wail i gnash my teeth underneath it all i am smiling i am giggling i am at a funeral my clients heart aches and inside of it is my heart not aching the opposite of achingdoing that whatever it is kirthi and i start dating thats what i call it she calls it letting me walk her to the bus stop she lets me buy her lunch she tells me i should stop she still never smiles at me im a heartbreak specialist she says when i see her in the hallway i walk up behind her and slip my arm around her waist she has not let me in yet she wont let me in why wont you let me in i ask her you dont want in she says you want around you want near you dont want in there are two hundred forty seven ways to have your heartbroken she says and i have felt them all i am in a hospice i have been here before a regular client i am holding a pen i have just written something on a notepad in front of me my husband is gone he died years ago today is the tenth anniversary of his death i have alzheimers i think a memory of my husband surfaces like a whitehot august afternoon resurfacing in the cool water of november i tear off the sheet on the notepad i read it to myself it is a suicide note i raise a glass to my mouth swallow a pill catch a glance of my note to the world the failsafe kicks on just in time the system overrides i close the ticket its her father thats what sunil tells me one day over a beer kirthi hasnt been to work for the past two days sunil is in tech support he has seen all of the glitches he knows what can go wrong in the mechanics of feeling transfers he has seen some ugliness he is fond of saying that there is no upper bound on weirdness her father is still mortgaged sunil explains locked in a pzombie he says sold his life this is going to end badly man he says you have to trust me on this kirthi is damaged and she knows it sunil means well but what he doesnt know is that i am fine with damaged i want damage ive looked down the road im on and i see whats coming a lot of nothing no great loves lost and yet i feel like i lost something better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all how about this i lost without the love ive lost things ive never even had a whole life just like my father i get to have my cake and eat it too except that its a great big crap cake still as the weeks go on i am starting to think sunil is right kirthi wont let me in i tell him she tells me to get away from her to run she is doing you a favor man take her advice i ask her about her father she doesnt talk to me for a week and then on friday night after we walk for an hour in silence before going into her apartment she turns to me and says how awful it is to look at him in that state we draw closer for a moment why wont you just love me i ask her she says its not possible to make someone feel something even yourself she says even if you want to feel it i tell her about the life i had my eye on its gone she says ill find another one just like it i tell her standard happiness package decent possibility the chance of a kid it wouldnt be enough for us not quite but we could share it take turns living the life one works while the other one lives maybe i work the weekdays and she gives me a break on weekends she looks at me for a few long seconds she seems to be thinking about it living the whole life out in her head she doesnt say anything she touches the side of my head its a start when deep was happy before it got bad and then worse and then even worse he was always talking about how he knew a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy stuff like that he talked like that he really did he loved telling stories about a week before he cracked up he told me a story while we were in the coffee room about a guy at managed life solutions a physical suffering shop across town who somehow made arrangements with a prominent banker who wanted to kill his wife the banker was going to do it hed made up his mind but he didnt want the guilt plus he thought it might help with his alibi if he didnt have any memory bullshit i said that would never work no really he says he tells me all about it how they met how they arranged it all while talking in public at work in fact but they talked in code etc could never happen i say there are twenty reasons why that wouldnt work why not he said its just too much i said too much what there is no upper bound on cruelty he said the next monday i came to work and they were pulling deep out the door two paramedics each one with an arm under deeps arms and two security guards trailing behind i wanted to say something anything to make them stop i knew i would never see him again but i froze as they dragged him past me i tried to make eye contact but i looked in there and no one was left he had gone somewhere else he was saying okay so okay so and then the next day there it was in the newspaper the whole story about the banker exactly how deepak told it to me there were rumors that he was the one the banker hired he was living with murderous guilt other people gossiped that he had done death of a child i dont think it was either i dont think it was any one thing that did it deep just knew he knew what was out there there is no upper bound on sadness there is no lower bound on decency deep saw it he understood it what was out there and he let it seep in and once it was in it got all the way in and it will never come out i open tickets i do the work i save up money weeks go by kirthi opens up just a little she still refuses to look me in the eyes when we are kissing thats weird she says no one does that how am i supposed to know that i have not kissed many people but i dont want her to know it i have seen in american movies that people close their eyes but i have also seen that sometimes one person or the other will sneak open an eye and take a peek at the other one i think it makes sense otherwise how would you know what the other person is feeling that seems to me to be the only way to be sure the only way to understand through the look on their face what they are feeling to be able to feel what they feel for you so we kiss she with her eyes closed me looking at her trying to imagine what she is feeling i hope she is feeling something i am at a funeral i am having a bypass i am in drug rehabilitation i am in withdrawal she takes me to see her father he has the look i remember this look this is how my father looked he is living someone elses life he is a projection screen a vessel a unit of capacity for pain like an external hard drive a peripheral device for someones convenience a place to store frustration and guilt and unhappiness we stand there in silence we go back to work i am at a funeral i am at a root canal the thing it is uncomfortable to talk about is we could do it we could get him out finally she cant take it he has only four years left on his mortgage kirthi tells me the thing is the way the market works sellers like us never get full value on our time its like a pawnshop you hock your pocketwatch to put dinner on the table you might get fifty bucks go to get it after payday and youll have to pay four times that to get it back same principle here i love kirthi i do but i dont know if i could give sixteen years of my life to get her father out i could do it if i knew she loved me but i dont know it yet i want to be a better man than this i want to be more selfless my life isnt so great as it is but i just dont know if i could do it i am in surgery i am bleeding to death it doesnt hurt at all things progress we move in together we avoid planning for the future we hint at it we talk around it i am being shot at i am being slapped in the face i go home i rest i come back and do it again when i turned thirteen my mother told me the story she sat me down in the kitchen and explained the day your father sold his life she said i wore my best dress and he wore a suit he combed his hair he looked handsome and calm you wore your only pair of long pants we walked to the bank you rode on his back i remember that i said a man with excellent hair came out from some office in the back and sat down behind the desk i remember that too i told her you getwe gotforty thousand a year she said my dad sold his life for a fixed annuity indexed to inflation at three percent annually and a seventy percent pension if he made it full term forty years age seventy and he could stop he could come back to us to his life there were posters everywhere my mother said describing that day the reunion day the day when youve made it youve done it youre done there was a video screen showing a short film describing the benefits of mortgage the glorious day of reunion we would all drink lemonade in the hot summer air just forty years it said in the meantime your family will be taken care of you will have peace of mind time is money the video said and money is time create value out of the most valuable asset you own dont miss out on a chance of a lifetime when we went home i remember my father went to lie down he slept for twelve hours twice as long as normal and in the morning while i was still asleep he went and sold his life things stop progressing with kirthi things go backward and then one day whatever it is we had its gone it wont come back we both know it whatever it is she let me have she has taken it away whatever it is when two people agree to briefly occupy the same space agree to allow their lives to overlap in some small area some temporary region of the world a region they create through love or convenience or for us something even more meager whatever that was it has collapsed it has closed she has closed herself to me a week after kirthi moves out her father passes away my shift manager will not let me off to go to the funeral kirthi doesnt even ask if i would like to go anyway i should go i will be fired if i go but i dont have her anymore if i leave i wont have a job either ill never get her back if i dont have a job im never getting her back anyway i dont even know if i want her back but maybe this is why i dont have her could never would never have had her maybe the problem isnt that i dont have a life maybe the problem is that i dont want a life i go to work i open tickets i close tickets when i get home my apartment seems empty its always empty but today more empty the emptiness is now empty i call her i dont know what to say i breathe into the phone i call her again i leave a message i know a guy in the billing department i say we could get some extra capacity no one would know find an open line i could feel it for you your grief i could bury your father for you i would say that i am tired of this substitute life except that this is the only life i will ever have it is a substitute for itself a substitute for nothing a substitute for something that never existed in the first place three days later when i get to work there is a note on my desk giving the time of the funeral service just the time and underneath it she scrawled okay okay i arrange for the hour at the time i open the ticket i am expecting a funeral i am not at a funeral i cant tell exactly where i am but i am far away in a place i dont recognize she has moved to a place where i will never find her probably where no one will ever find her a new city a new life she paid for this time herself she wanted to let me in for once just once she must have used up everything she had saved the money was supposed to be for her father but now no need she is walking along a road the sun is hot the air is dusty but the day is alive she feels alive i feel alive for her she is looking at a picture we tookthe only picture we took together in a photo booth in the drugstore our faces are smashed together and in the picture she is not smiling as usual and i am smiling a genuine smile or so i have always thought about myself but now looking at myself through her eyes i see that she sees that my own smile starts to decompose like when you say a word over and over again so many times over and over and you begin to feel silly but you keep saying it and then after a short while something happens and the word stops being a word and it resolves into its constituent sounds and then all of a sudden what used to be a word is not a word at all it is now the strangest thing you have ever heard i am inside of her head i am a nice person she is thinking i deserve more she wants to believe she wants to believe it but i can feel that she doesnt if only she could see herself through my eyes if only she could see herself through my eyes looking through her eyes i deserve to be loved she thinks but she doesnt believe it if only i could believe it for her i want to believe in her believe inside of her believe hard enough inside of her that it somehow seeps through she turns up the road and the hill gets steeper the air gets hotter i feel her sadness with every step and then right near the top of the hill just the faintest hint of it a smile she is remembering us the few happy moments we had i am standing on a hill i am not at a funeral i am thinking of someone i once loved i dont know if i am her thinking of me or if i am me thinking of her or if maybe right at this moment there is no difference faces in revolving souls caitlín r kiernan the woman named sylvia who might as well still be a child is waiting for the elevator that will carry her from the twentythird floor of the hoteldown down down like a sinking stoneto the lobby and convention registration area she isnt alone in the hallway though she wishes that she were there are several others waiting to sink with hera murmuring laughing handful of stitches and meat dolls busy showing off the fact that theyre not new at this that they belong here busy making sure that sylvia knows they can see just exactly how birthblank she is not quite a virgin no but the next worst thing and all that pink skin to give her away the pink skin and the silverblue silk dress with its sparkling mandarin collar the black espadrilles on her feet the others are all naked for the most part and sylvia keeps her head down her eyes trained on the toes of her shoes because the sight of them reflected in the polished elevator doors makes her heart race and her mouth go dry no one knows im here she thinks again relishing the simple nervous delight she feels whenever she imagines her mother or sisters or someone at work discovering that she lied to them all about going to mexico and where shes gone instead she knows that if they knew if they ever found out theyd want explanations and that if she ever tried to explain theyd do their best to have her locked away or worse theres still a multitude of psychiatrists who consider polymorphy a sickness and politicians who consider it a crime and priests who consider it blasphemy a bell hidden somewhere in the wall rings and the elevator doors slide silently open sylvia steps quickly into the empty elevator and the others follow herthe woman who is mostly a leopard the fat man with thick brown fur and eyes like a raven the pretty teenage girl with stubby antlers and skin the color of ripe cranberriesall of them filing in one by one like the passengers of some lunatic noahs ark sylvia stands all the way at the rear her back turned to them and stares out through the transparent wall as the elevator falls and the first floor of the hotel swiftly rises up to meet her it only stops once on the way down at the fourth floor and she doesnt turn to see who or what gets on its much too warm inside the elevator and the air smells like sweat and musk and someones lavenderscented perfume yes of course the leopard says to the antlered girl with cranberry skin but this will be the first time ive ever seen her in person the leopard lisps and slurs when she speaks human vocal cords struggling with a rough feline tongue with a mouth that has been rebuilt for purposes other than talking first time i saw her at berkeley the antlered girl replies and then again at chimera last year you were at chimera last year someone asks sounding surprised and maybe even skeptical sylvia thinks it must be whoever got on at the fourth floor because she hasnt heard this sexless voice before i made it down for the last two days you were there yeah i was there the girl says but you probably wouldnt remember me that was back before my dermals started to show and all the girls are growing antlers these days the leopard lisps and everyone laughs all of them except sylvia none of them sound precisely human anymore and their strange bestial laughter is almost enough to make sylvia wish that shed stayed home almost enough to convince her that shes in over her head drowning and maybe she isnt ready for this after all another secret bell rings and the doors slide open again releasing them into the brightly lit lobby first in so last out and sylvia has to squeeze through the press of incoming bodies the people whod been waiting for the elevator she says excuse me and pardon me and tries not to look anyone in the eye or notice the particulars of their chosen metamorphoses fera is waiting for her standing apart from the rest standing with her long arms crossed she smiles when she sees sylvia showing off her broad canines theres so little left of fera that anyone would bother calling human and the sight of herthe mismatched improbable beauty of heralways leaves sylvia lost and fumbling for words fera is one of the oldtimers an elder changeling one of the twentyfive signatories on the original provisional proposition for parahuman secession i was afraid you might have missed your flight she says and sylvia knows that what she really means is i was afraid youd chickened out feras voice is not so slurred or difficult to understand as the leopards shes had almost a decade to learn the mechanics of her new mandibular and lingual musculature years to adapt to her altered tongue and palate i just needed to unpack sylvia tells her i cant stand leaving my suitcases packed i have some friends in the bar who would like to meet you fera purrs ive been telling them about your work oh sylvia whispers because she hadnt expected that and doesnt know what else to say dont worry syl they know youre still a neophyte theyre not expecting a sphinx sylvia nods her head and glances back towards the elevator the doors have closed again and theres only her reflection staring back at her i look terrified she thinks i look like someone who wants to run did you forget something fera asks and takes a step towards sylvia the thick pads of her paws are silent on the carpet but the many hundreds of long quills that sprout from her shoulders and back from her arms and the sides of her face rustle like dry autumn leaves no sylvia says not at all sure whether or not shes telling the truth i know youre nervous its only natural but i feel like such a fool sylvia replies and then she laughs a laugh that has no humor in it at all a sound almost as dry as the noise of feras quills hey you should have seen me back in the day i was a goddamn basket case and fera takes both her hands as sylvia turns to face her again its a long road and sometimes the first steps are the most difficult sylvia looks down at feras hands her nails grown to sharp retractable claws her skin showing black as an oil spill where it isnt covered in short auburn fur though she still has thumbs there are long dewclaws sprouting from her wrists sylvia knows how much those hands would scare most people how they would horrify all the blanks still clinging to their illusions of inviolable immutable humanity but they make her feel safe and she holds them tight and forces a smile for fera well we dont want to keep your friends waiting sylvia says its bad enough me showing up wearing all these damned clothes i dont want them to think im rude in the bargain fera laughs a sound thats really more like barking and she kisses sylvia lightly on her left cheek you just try to relax mon enfant trouvé and trust me theyre absolutely gonna love but then someone interrupts her another leopard a pudgy boy cat clutching a tattered copy of the children of artemis which fera signs for him and she listens patiently to the questions he asks all of which could have been answered with a quick internet search sylvia pretends not to eavesdrop on an argument between one of the hotel staff and a woman with crocodile skin and when the leopard boy finally stops talking fera leads sylvia away from the crowded elevators towards one of the hotels bars and this is beforebefore the flight from detroit to lax before the taxi ride to the hotel in burbank this is before the bad dreams she had on the plane before the girl with cranberry skin before the elevators controlled fall from the twentythird floor of the marriott this is a night and an hour and a moment from a whole year before fera delacroix takes her hand and leads her out of the lobby to the bar where there are people waiting to meet her whats this her mother asks in the same sour accusatory tone shes wielded all of sylvias life and sylvia whos just come home from work and has a migraine stares at the scatter of magazines and pamphlets lying on the dining table in front of her trying to make sense of the question and all the glossy colorful paper trying to think through the pain and the sudden sick fear coiled cold and tight in her gut i asked you a question sylvia her mother says what are you doing with this crap and sylvia opens her mouth to reply but her tongue doesnt want to cooperate down on the street she can hear the traffic and the distant rumble of a skipjet somewhere far overhead and the sleepy drone of the refrigerator from the next room i want an answer her mother says and taps the cover of an issue of genshift with her right index finger where did you get those sylvia asks finally but her voice seems farther away than the skipjets turbines youve been in my room again havent you this is my house young lady and im asking you the questions her mother growls growling like a pit bull like something mean and hungry straining at its fraying leash what are you doing with all this sick shit and the part of sylvias mind that knows how to lie the part that keeps her secrets safe and has no problem saying whatever needs to be said takes over its one of my stories she says trying hard to sound indignant instead of frightened its all just research i brought it home last week bullshit since when does the network waste time with this kind of deviant crap her mother demands and she taps the magazine again on the cover theres a nude woman with firm brown nipples and the gently curved corkscrew horns of an impala just because you dont happen to approve of the changelings doesnt mean they arent news sylvia tells her and hastily begins gathering up all the pamphlets and magazines do you have any idea how many people have had some sort of interspecific genetic modification over the last five years are you a goddamn lesbian her mother asks and sylvia catches the smell of gin on her breath what theyre all a bunch of queers and perverts her mother mumbles and then snatches one of the fellowship of parahuman evolutionists pamphlets from sylvias hands if this is supposed to be work for the network whyd you have to go and hide it all under your bed i wasnt hiding anything mother and this isnt any of your business and sylvia yanks the pamphlet back from her mother how many times have i asked you to stay out of my room its my house and that means i have no privacy no maam not if it means you bringing this smut into my house jesus its for work you want to call mr padgett right now and have him tell you the same damned thing and there its out before she thinks better of pushing the lie that far pushing it as far as itll go and theres no taking it back again i ought to do that young lady you bet thats exactly what i ought to do so do it and leave me alone you know the number dont you think i wont i have work to do before dinner sylvia says as calmly as she can manage turning away from her mother beginning to wonder if shell make it upstairs before she throws up i have a headache and i really dont need you yelling at me right now dont think that i wont call im a christian woman and i dont want that filth under my roof you understand me sylvia she doesnt reply because theres nothing left to be said and the cold knot in her belly has started looking for a way out the inevitable path of least resistance she takes her briefcase and the magazines and heads for the hallway and the stairs leading away from her mother just keep walking she thinks whatever else she says dont even turn around dont say anything else to her not another word dont give her the satisfaction i know all about those people her mother mumbles theyre filth you understand all of them every single goddamned one and then sylvias on the stairs and her footsteps on the varnished wood are louder than her mothers voice she takes them two at a time almost running to the top and locks her bedroom door behind her sylvia hurls the stack of changeling literature to the floor in a violent flutter of pages and the antelope girls large dark eyes gaze blamelessly back up at her she sits down with her back against the door not wanting to cry but crying anyway crying because at least its better than vomiting and laterafter her first three treatments at the lycaon clinic in chicago after the flight to la after fera delacroix takes her hand and leads her into the murmur and half light of the hotel barshell understand that this afternoon this moment was her turning point shell look back and see clearly that this is the day she knew what she would do no matter how much it terrified her and no matter what it would mean in the end they sit in a corner of the crowded noisy bar two tables pulled together to make room for everyone this perfect unreal menagerie sylvia sits to the left of fera sipping at a watery coke feras already introduced her to them all a heady mix of changeling minor royalty and fellow travelers and sylvia has been sitting quietly for the last fifteen minutes listening to them talk trying to memorize their names trying not to stare its a damned dangerous precedent the man sitting directly across from her says he has the nightseeing eyes of a python and he drums his long claws nervously against the top of the table his name is maxwell white and hes a geneticist at johns hopkins her last year in college sylvia read his book looking for moreau a parahumanist manifesto its made the american library associations list of most frequently banned books seven years straight what the hell fera says i figure its just fucking nebraska maxwell white stops drumming his fingers and sighs his long ears going flat against the sides of his skull sure this year its just fucking nebraska but the way things are headed next year its going to be nebraska and alabama and utah and we cant afford to be elitists says a woman with iridescent scales that shimmer faintly in the dim light as she talks the tip end of her blue forked tongue flicks across her lips sylvia cant recall her name only that she was recently fired from duke university not anymore that asshole de vries and his army of zealots is getting more press than the war oh come on its not that bad fera says and frowns how bad does it have to be maxwell white asks and starts drumming his claws again where do you think this is going to stop after these anticrossbreeding laws are in place and people get used to the idea that its acceptable to restrict who we can and cant marry who we can fuck how long do you think its going to take before we start seeing laws preventing us from voting or owning property or maybe thats what we get for signing a declaration of secession from the human race fera replies and maxwell white makes an angry snorting sound jesus christ fera sometimes i wonder which side youre on all im saying is im not so sure we can realistically expect to have it both ways we tell them were not the same as them anymore that by choice each of us will exist as our own separate species and then we act surprised when they want to treat us like animals de vries has already started talking about concentration camps a woman named alex singleton says she glances apprehensively at fera and then quickly back down at the napkin shes been folding and unfolding for the past ten minutes alex singleton has the striped blonde fur of a tigerlion hybrid and six perfectly formed breasts are you still going to be talking like this when they start rounding us up and locking us in cages she asks and unfolds the napkin again thats never going to happen fera replies and scowls at alex singleton im not saying there arent a lot of scary people out there of course there are weve just given the bigots and xenophobes something new to hate thats all we knew thered be a difficult adjustment period didnt we you have the most sublime knack for understatement maxwell white laughs and then fera turns to sylvia and smiles that smile so beautiful that its enough to make her dizzy to make her blush youre awfully quiet over here syl what do you think of all this you think were all about to be rounded up and herded off to a zoo im afraid ive never been much for politics sylvia says not meaning to whisper but her voice is almost lost in the din of the bar i mean i dont guess ive thought much about it of course she hasnt alex singleton mutters look at her she still wears clothes shes pink as i think maybe what alex is trying to say in her own indelicate way the woman with iridescent scales interrupts is that youre probably going to find the political ramifications of our little revolution will suddenly seem a lot more important to you once you start showing thats not at all what i was trying to say some of us forget they were ever blank fera says glaring at alex singleton and she stirs at her martini with an olive skewered on a tiny plastic cutlass the thin man sitting next to maxwell white clears his throat and waves at sylvia with a hand thats really more of a paw fera tells us youre one of colliers patients he says speaking very slowly his lupine jaws and tongue struggling with the words hes a good man im very happy with him sylvia replies and takes another sip of her coke he did my second stage the wolf man confides and his black lips draw back in a snarl exposing sharp yellow canines and incisors it takes sylvia a moment to realize that the mans smiling so maxwell white says leaning towards her whats your story sylvia like fera said im a journalist and im preparing to write a book on the history no thats not what im asking you im sorry then i guess i didnt understand the question apparently not max here is onethird complete bastard fera says and jabs an ebony thumb at maxwell white it was a tricky bit of bioengineering but the results are a wonder to behold half the people at the two tables laugh out loud and sylvia is beginning to wish that shed stayed in her room that shed never let fera delacroix talk her into coming to burbank in the first place is it some sort of secret what youre hiding under that dress maxwell white asks and sylvia shakes her head no she says its not a secret i mean then whats the problem back off just a little max fera says and the man with python eyes nods his head and shrugs he does this to everyone almost alex singleton says and begins to shred her napkin he did it to me its not a secret sylvia says again i just you dont have to tell anyone here anything youre not ready to tell them syl fera assures her and kisses her cheek fera delacroixs breath smells like vodka and olives you know that its just that none of us are wearing masks maxwell white says you might have noticed that excuse me please sylvia says suddenly close to tears and her heart beating like the wings of a small and terrified bird trapped deep inside her chest she stands up too fast bumps the table hard with her right knee and almost spills her drink youre a son of a bitch fera growls at maxwell white and she bares her teeth i hope you know that no really its okay sylvia says forcing an unconvincing smile im fine i understand and im fine i just need some fresh air thats all and then she leaves them all sitting there in the shadows murmuring and laughing among themselves sylvia doesnt look back concentrates instead on the sound of her espadrilles against the wide stone tiles and she makes it almost all the way to the elevators before fera catches up with her on the plane somewhere high above the rockies and streaking towards los angeles through clearing nightbound skies sylvia drifts between the velvet and gravel folds of dream sleep she dozed off with the volume setting on her tunejack pushed far enough towards max that the noise of the flight attendants and the other passengers and the skipjets turbines wouldnt wake her so theres only beethovens th symphony getting in from the outside and the voices inside her head shes always hated flying and took two of the taxicab yellow placidmil capsules her therapist prescribed after her first treatment gave her insomnia in the nightmare she stands alone on the crumbling bank of a sluggish muddy river washed red as blood by the setting sun she doesnt know the name of the city rising up around her and suspects that it has no name only dark and empty windows skyscrapers like broken teeth the ruins of bridges that long ago carried the citys vanished inhabitants from one side of the wide red river to the other the river is within us the sea is all about us and isnt that what matthew arnold wrote or t s eliot or maharshi ramakrishna or some other long dead man sylvia takes a step nearer the river and a handful of earth tumbles into the water the ripples spread out from the shore until the current pulls them apart behind her something has begun to growla low and threatful sound the sound of something that might tear her apart in an instant she glances over her shoulder but theres only the buckled abandoned street behind her and then the entrance to an alleyway its already midnight in the alley and she knows that the growling thing is waiting for her there where it has always waited for her she turns back to the river because the thing in the alley is patient and the swollen crimson sun is still clinging stubbornly to the western horizon and now she sees that its not the sunset painting the river red but the blood of the dead and dying creatures drowning in the rising waters the river devours their integrity wedding one to the other flesh to flesh bone to bone in another moment theres only a single strangling organism though a thousand pairs of eyes stare back at her in agony and horror and two thousand hearts bleed themselves dry through a million ruptured veins and the way up is the way down the way forward is the way back countless talons and fingers flippers and fins tear futilely at the mud and soft earth along the rivers edge but all are swept away and when the sun has gone sylvia turns to face the alley and the growling thing that is her life and wakes to the full moon outside the skipjets window you cant expect more of them fera says not more than you expect of the straights not just because theyre going through the same thing you are none of us are going through the same thing sylvia replies not caring whether or not fera hears the bitterness in her voice were all going through this alone every one of us is alone just like white said in his book every one of us is a species of one i think you expect too much fera says and then the elevator has reached the twentythird floor and the hidden bell rings and the doors slide silently open sylvia steps out into the hall please promise me you wont spend the whole weekend locked in your room fera says at least come back down for circe seventeens panel at eight and yeah sylvia says as the doors slide shut again sure ill see you there and she follows the hallway back to her room sylvia is standing in front of the long bathroom mirror her skin tinted a pale and sickly green by the buzzing fluorescent light shes naked except for the gauze bandages and fleshtone dermapad patches on her belly and thighs the hot water is running and the steam has begun to fog the mirror she leans forward and wipes away some of the condensation theres always a risk of rejection dr collier said and that was more than three weeks ago now her third trip to the lycaon clinic you understood that before we began theres always the risk of a violate retrovirus especially when the transcription in question involves nonamniote dna and of course shed understood hed told her everything all the risks and qualifying factors explained in detail long before her first treatment everyone always understands until theyre the one unlucky fuck in a thousand no one ever lied to me she thinks but theres no consolation whatsoever in the thought in places the bandages are stained and stiff with the discharge of her infections sylvia dries her hands on a clean white wash cloth then begins to slowly remove the dermapad just below her navel the adhesive strips around the edges come away with bits of dead skin and dried blood still attached im not going to lie to you dr collier said the first time they met even now with all we know and everything that weve been able to accomplish in the last fifty years what you want is very very dangerous and if something does go wrong theres very little hope of turning back and then she signed all the documents stating that hed told her these things and that she understood the perils and uncertainty and that she was submitting to the procedures of her own free will she takes a deep breath and stares back at herself from the mirror the sweat on her face to match the steam on the glass and drops the dermapad into the sink it stains the water a dark reddishbrown and her mother and all the faces from the barmaxwell white and alex singleton and all the restseem to hover somewhere just behind her they smirk and shake their heads just in case shes forgotten that the rest of the world always knew she was weak and that in the end shed get exactly what shes always had coming to her i know all about those people theyre filth you understand all of them every single goddamned one the rubbery violet flesh beneath her navel is swollen and marbled with pustules and open sores the tip of a stillborn tentacle no longer than her index finger hangs lifeless from her belly dr collier wanted to amputate it but she wouldnt let him i hate like hell to say it but hes right fera delacroix told her after the scene in the hotel bar while they were waiting for an elevator you cant keep it a secret forever syl what youre doingwhat everyone here this weekend is doingits about finally being honest about ourselves i know that doesnt necessarily make it easy but its the truth no sylvia says gently touching the dead tentacle this is the truth she presses her finger into one of the tiny stalked suckers teasing the sharp hook at the center i think this is all the truth i need she cleans the cancerous flesh and covers it with a fresh dermapad then peels off one of the patches on her left thigh and repeats the process it takes her more than an hour to wash and dress all the lesions and when shes done when all those dying parts of her that are no longer precisely human have been hidden behind their sterile masks she shuts off the water and gets dressed she still has time for a light dinner before circe seventeens talk on the link between shamanism and the origins of parahumanism and sylvia knows that if she isnt there fera delacroix will come looking for her hwangs billion brilliant daughters alice sola kim when hwang finds a time that he likes he tries to stay awake the longest he has ever stayed awake is three days the longest someone has ever stayed awake is eleven days if hwang sleeps enough times he will eventually reach a time in which people do not have to sleep unfortunately this can only come about through expensive gene therapy that has to be done long before one is born thus it is the rich who do not have to sleep they stay awake all night and bound across their useless beds shedding crumbs and drops of sauce as they eat everyone elses food whenever hwang goes to sleep he jumps forward in time this is a problem this is not a problem that is going to solve itself sometimes hwang wakes to find that hes only jumped forward a few days the most hwang has ever jumped is one hundred seventy years after a while his daughters stop looking exactly asian his genespreviously distilled from a population in a small section of east asia for thousands of yearshave mixed with genes from other populations and continued to do so while hwang slept in fact it all started with hwang and his exwife hwangs daughters are a crowd of beautiful muddled vigorous hybrids with the occasional recessive trait exploding like fireworkssquashcolored hair gray eyes albinism backward fool backward you were supposed to take me backward he wishes he could find grishkov and scream at him but grishkov is dead of course he died sometime that night the first night hwang slept and jumped through days years decades later hwang awakes in a world with no men reproduction occurs through parthenogenesis scientists discovered that the genes of the father are the ones that shorten human lifespan scientists decided to do something about it there are people walking around who look like men but they arent men but if they look like men walk like men talk like men maybe they are men there are new categories of gender that hwang is unable to comprehend men are men he finds a daughter who is a man so she must actually be a son but in hwangs mindhis mind that he cannot changehe is his daughter and always will be if you could flip through hwangs life like a bookwhich i am able to doyou would see that hwang and women have been a calamitous combination it is not hwangs fault or the womens fault but it is unfortunate nevertheless i wish there was someone to blame once hwang awakes to find no one he walks around the city for hours before seeing a woman in a coverall she is pulling vines off the side of a building and stuffing them into a trash bag i am paid millions a year for this work she says even for the future that is a lot of money it turns out that everyone has been uploaded into virtual space but a few people still have to stick around to make sure that buildings stay up and the tanks are clean and operational later everyone comes back because it turns out that no one really likes uploaded life hwangs wife was a research scientist when they divorced hwang was granted temporary full custody and his wife went to antarctica sometimes she sent their three children humorous emails about falling asleep on the toilet because it was so cold when their daughters were kidnapped walking home from school hwangs wife and hwang both blamed hwang their son turned fifteen became a goth and moved in with his mother when she returned from antarctica hwang alone rested his head on pillowcases permanently smudged with black and slept for days hwang says when people are able to live forever that is when i will get my life back i can marry again we can have a family when i awake they will still be there old as cedars my cedar family planted in the living room i will live forever but marriage between hwang and i is out of the question sometimes one of hwangs daughters will buy him new clothes but he always wakes up wearing his old clothes he has been frumpy archaic obscene unworthy of notice and perfectly in styleall those things in that order there is a future in which skanky summer is quite popular people walk around in bathing suits waterproof briefs shorts breastbaring monokinis sarongsall with personal climate control units attached to the base of their necks hwang emerges from his room shivering in a wrinkled buttondown sweater and corduroy pants that day the rain drifts down as gently as snow and it gets you wet so gradually that you are startled to realize it like a boiled frog in a pot of water hwang never sees his son again upon waking for the first time hwang goes out into the world and finds that his son is a computer mogul who lives in a cheesy yet terrifying house surrounded by a moat this house has no right angles and a viscous red substance continually flows down the sides and into the moat a security guard grabs the back of hwangs jacket as he backs up to get a running start so he can jump the moat youll never make it she says and he realizes that the security guard is his daughter she sighs looking him up and downtheres a shelter a few miles away you can get a decent meal ill drive you his daughter does not look how hed expect but her eyes when she glances at him in the rearview mirror are familiar and bright but im his father says hwang she laughs the computer mogul famously has no father and says so often of course hwang sits in the back seat like a lump he realizes that he can no longer enumerate to himself the ways in which he has failed that his failure has turned into an exponential number residing within him sleek and unutterably dense and deadly there is a time during which hwangs visits are foreseen his daughters tell him that his story has been passed down from their mothers that their greatgreatgreat will come into their lives recognizable by his blue sweater and brown corduroy pants you dress like a fucking teddy bear his son used to sayit felt like affection and then what it is disputed is hwang a force of good is he evil how does he choose which daughters he appears to is he a matrilineal family curse he tries to explain but it is not satisfying to his daughters the next time he jumps it is a hundred years later and his story has been forgotten hwangs daughter listens to his story when he is done she pulls a pill case from her bag sounds like you need to change your point of view she says try a chip or a barbara hwang chooses a pill from the compartment labeled chip chip and barbara are personality construct drugs named for the people from whom they originated in an hour he feels loose he is young and has plenty of time to decide what he wants to be when he grows up he doesnt know if he wants to have kids yet come on man thats ages away lets have some fun before fun ends hwang is still chip when he goes to sleep but it wears off in the night he goes to find it again to feel simultaneously free yet locked into the right time with no sense of slippage but discovers that chip and barbara have been taken off the market in bare feet hwang was half an inch shorter than his wife which seemed within the bounds of acceptability but the world conspired to tip this delicate balance with slanted sidewalks with italian heels with poor posture hwang and his exwife each thought that the other cared more about their height discrepancy your wife is white said a sophisticated older aunt then your daughters will be beautiful they were because all daughters were beautiful that is what hwang believed but hwang was never one to be proud of their beauty he was proud because they were brilliant or they were about to be they were at the age at which youthful precocity grew distinct and immutable that is where they stayed hwang always wakes up in the lab the lab is always the same the time machine is a gnarled charred mess on the floor and the curtains are skeletons grishkovs body is curled like a cat in the corner his face is untouched like a peaceful waxwork and for that hwang is grateful hwang sleeps on the couch which has blackened and split like a bratwurst as unkind and sooty as the lab is hwang lingers there to hold off timeshock and cultureshock when he needs to use the bathroom he has to leave in time hwang begins to suspect that he is not only being pulled forward in time as he sleeps he is also being pulled sideways in space to parallel universes he thinks he has confirmation of this fact when he arrives at a time when everyone is green dont worrythere is still racism hwang sits with his daughter at a diner and tries to question her about what has happened she explains but language has changed and he has trouble understanding her lincoln he says kennedy were they assassinated in this timeline she opens her mouth and taps at her translator earbud doowah she says soon there are no more bananas the iconic cavendish banana tall and bright and constant has gone extinct it is true that no ones favorite fruit is the banana but now that bananas as he knew them are gone hwang feels like hes been trapped in a house without windows there is no backwards from this forwards no more bananas for anyone ever again hwang has learned a valuable life lesson never allow someone to test a time machine on you no matter how certain they are it will work no matter how certain you are that it will enable you to fix your life and the lives of your loved ones but hwang must have done some good for his later daughters he has to have done some good he has to would it all be worth it then once he wakes up opens the door to the lab and steps into water he doesnt know how to swim he is a giant lead teddy bear sinking to the bottom of the ocean and as he flails in the water his thoughts are not about how its all over thank god they are about expelling water from his lungs and if he could just take another breath please that would be perfect thank you thank you thank you let me live someone grabs him and pulls him up its a woman wearing a cheap waiters tuxedo all around them houses and restaurants and offices bob impossibly do you have a reservation the woman his daughter asks he is exhausted fine his daughter says wait here ill bring something dont touch anything you need to be disinfected his daughters are always so exasperated with him the time after that everything is dry again hwang asks his daughter where the ocean is his daughter shrugs we put it somewhere else it was in the way hwang needs to understand that someday he will wake up and no one will be around for good once when hwang was thirteen he came home to find his father strangling his mother they rearranged themselves right as hwang walked into the house they must have heard his key stranglings can be quiet he stood and saw his father flexing his hands and smiling his mother wiping water out of her eyes and turning a sob into a smile the way she turned seemingly random organic matter into food work into money disorder into order if she was antientropic then his father was the opposite money for booze so much grain goes into alcohol carbohydrates are then wasted in the fermentation process it is not sensible hwang had been sent to the library when he came home early it was awkward hwang did not know before then that the terrible could also be awkward his father did not murder his mother that day there comes a stable time a time during which hwang does not jump forward too crazily he only goes a few days each time he sleeps he sees his daughter often he follows her around and pleads with her not to take the photon train to school it is too fast it is unnatural she laughs she goes to school in another state and her commute only takes half an hour judgmental hwang is aghast that people in the future react so placidly to risk but he remembers things like bisphenol a and airborne toxic events and revealing your crush to a homophobe who will get so embarrassed that he will murder you and then hwang must admit that there were so many things in his time that he hadnt thought to worry about soon enough his daughter becomes less amused by this greatgreatgreat popping up in her world every few days just go away she says stop interloping get your own life she shakes his arm off and kicks the wall he watches as the wall slowly bulges out and undents itself that night he goes to sleep vowing to find some way to protect his daughter and he wakes up one hundred seventy years later hwang wonders when he dies will his cells disperse and mass elsewhere to such an extent that there will be achronological patches in the air space dust that travels through time what is sleep for a single cell once i built hwang a new life made to look and feel like the early years of the second millennium but he would not accept it he stepped out of the lab and the lab was where it is supposed to be there on the street a man in basketball shorts was peeling and eating a banana which was well which was a little on the nose but i wished for him to know that bananas were back and he could be happy again right as were vehicles powered by fossil fuels as was orthodontia as was aids as was lithium for a moment his face was the face of someone who has woken up from a dream and feels enormous relief that it is not real what just happened but it didnt last he shook his head until his cheeks wobbled he stamped his foot the sidewalk began to sink and whirl beneath him knew it he shouted no backwards from this forwards up to his knees in the sidewalk he sloshed ahead with effort and tried to touch whatever he could the man eating the banana melted the car melted the german shepherd melted finally the world rose above hwangs eyes and after a brief burbling he went silent well i did try hwang tries to look at it this way time jumps forward when you sleep no matter who you are the first time hwang jumps forward in time he comes out of his room into fifty years later the time machine had caught fire and grishkov had had to pull him out before the sequence completed countdown the fire spread and trapped them they knew already that the dusty red fire extinguisher had been emptied three years ago during a prank and never refilled grishkov succumbed to the smoke first badheart grishkov still clutching hwang by the forearms as he swanned to the floor then hwang fainted too when hwang awakes many people are dead and many new people are alive and everything seems somehow worse despite all the new machines and pills and fashions as hwang is drawn to his daughters his daughters are drawn to him hwang does not want to die but there would not be a very good reason to stay alive if life was only jumping through time rapidly wait he is now part of the time machine and although he is broken he remains magnetized to his descendants his daughters down a street in a tree in a bar driving a hovercarthey always find one another his daughters feed him imagining that they are experiencing a random surge of kindness toward a dusty gentle homeless man hwang is guilty about this he feels that he is enslaving his daughters and the best thing to do would be to release all of them from this obligation that is when he does want to die but he decides to wait it out he will reach the end of time he will reach the end of daughters then he can end too when hwang is now nobody knows he is sleeping he has been sleeping all night his eyelids fluttering and his mouth twitching from the struggle to stay asleep he wants time to keep moving he doesnt want to stop anywhere even though the light is seeping in around the curtains and the hours turn to day i say to him dad i wont forget ill be the one who remembers the story still he sleeps i watch him still in his mind i am already blurring ejes nancy kress jesse come home theres a hole in the bed where we slept now its growing cold hey jesse your face in the place where we lay by the hearth all apart it hangs on my heart jesse im lonely come home jesse janis ian why did you first enter the corps lolimel asked her as they sat at the back of the shuttle just before landing mia looked at the young man helplessly because how could you answer a question like that especially when it was asked by the idealistic and worshipful new recruits too ignorant to know what a waste of time worship was let alone simplistic questions many reasons mia said gravely vaguely he looked like so many medicians she had worked with for so many decades on so many planets intense thickhaired genemod beautiful a little insane you had to be a little insane to leave earth for the corps knowing that when if you ever returned all you had known would have been dust for centuries he was more persistent than most what reasons the same as yours lolimel she said trying to keep her voice gentle now be quiet please were entering the atmosphere yes but be quiet entry was so much easier on him than on her he had not got bones weakened from decades in space they did weaken no matter what exercise one took or what supplements or what gene therapy mia leaned back in her shuttle chair and closed her eyes ten minutes maybe of aerobraking and descent surely she could stand ten minutes or not the heaviness began abruptly increased worse on her eyeballs as always she didnt have good eyesocket muscles had never had them such an odd weakness well not for long this was her last flight at the next station shed retire she was already well over age and her body felt it only her body no her mind too at the moment for instance she couldnt remember the name of the planet they were hurtling toward she recalled its catalogue number but not whatever its colonists who were not answering hails from ship had called it why did you join the corps many reasons and so few of them fulfilled but that was not a thing you told the young the colony sat at the edge of a river under an evening sky of breathable air set with three brilliant fastmoving moons beds of glorious flowers dotted the settlement somewhere in size between a large town and a small city the buildings of foamcast embedded with glittering native stone were graceful wellproportioned rooms set around open atria minimal furniture as graceful as the buildings even the machines blended unobtrusively into the lovely landscape the colonists had taste and restraint and a sense of beauty they were all dead a long time ago said kenin officially she was expedition head although titles and chainsofcommand tended to erode near the galactic edge and kenin led more by consensus and natural calm than by rank more than once the team had been grateful for kenins calm lolimel looked shaken although he was trying to hide it kenin studied the skeleton before them look at those bonescompletely clean lolimel managed it might have been picked clean quickly by predators or carnivorous insects or his voice trailed off i already scanned it lolimel no microscopic bone nicks she decayed right there in bed along with clothing and bedding the three of them looked at the bones lying on the indestructible mattress coils of some alloy mia had once known the name of long clean bones as neatly arranged as if for a firstyear anatomy lesson the bedroom door had been closed the dehumidifying system had astonishingly not failed the windows were intact nothing had disturbed the womans long rot in the dry air until nothing remained not even the bacteria that had fed on her not even the smell of decay kenin finished speaking to the other team she turned to mia and lolimel her beautiful brown eyes serene there are skeletons throughout the city some in homes and some collapsed in what seem to be public spaces whatever the disease was it struck fast jamal says their computer network is gone but individual rec cubes might still work those things last forever nothing lasts forever mia thought but she started searching the cabinets for a cube she said to lolimel to give him something to focus on how long ago was this colony founded again three hundred sixty eyears lolimel said he joined the search three hundred sixty years since a colony ship left an established world with its hopeful burden arrived at this deadly eden established a city flourished and died how much of mias lifetime much of it spent traveling at just under c did that represent once she had delighted in figuring out such equations in wondering if shed been born when a given worldful of colonists made planetfall but by now there were too many expeditions too many colonies too many accelerations and decelerations and shed lost track lolimel said abruptly heres a rec cube play it kenin said and when he just went on staring at it in the palm of his smooth hand she took the cube from him and played it herself it was what she expected a native plague of some kind jumping dnabased species which included all species in the galaxy thanks to panspermia the plague had struck after the colonists thought they had vaccinated against all dangerous micros of course they couldnt really have thought that even three hundred sixty years ago doctors had been familiar with alien speciescrossers some were mildly irritating some dangerous some epidemically fatal colonies had been lost before and would be again complete medical data resides on green rec cubes the recorder had said in the curiously accented international of three centuries ago clearly dying he gazed out from the cube with calm sad eyes a brave man any future visitors to good fortune should be warned good fortune that was the planets name all right kenin said tell the guard to search for green cubes mia get the emergency analysis lab set up and direct jamal to look for burial sites if they had time to inter some victimsif they interred at all of coursewe might be able to recover some micros to create vacs or cures lolimel you assist me in one of the guards carrying weapons that mia could not have named blurted maam how do we know we wont get the same thing that killed the colonists mia looked at her like lolimel she was very young like all of them she would have her story about why she volunteered for the corps now the young guard was blushing i mean maam before you can make a vaccination how do we know we wont get the disease too mia said gently we dont no one however got sick the colonists had had interment practices they had had time to bury some of their dead in strong watertight coffins before everyone else died and their customs didnt include embalming much more than mia had dared hope for good fortune indeed in five days of tireless work they had the micro isolated sequenced and analyzed it was a virus or a virus analogue that had somehow gained access to the brain and lodged near the limbic system creating destruction and death like rabies mia thought and hoped this virus hadnt caused the terror and madness of that stubborn disease not even earth had been able to eradicate rabies two more days yielded the vaccine kenin dispensed it outside the large building on the edge of the city function unknown which had become corps headquarters mia applied her patch noticing with the usual distaste the leathery wrinkled skin of her forearm once she had had such beautiful skin what was it that a longago lover had said to her what had been his name ah growing old was not for the gutless something moved at the edge of her vision lolimel did you see that see what nothing sometimes her aging eyes played tricks on her she didnt want lolimels pity the thing moved again casually mia rose brushing imaginary dirt from the seat of her uniform strolling toward the bushes where shed seen motion from her pocket she pulled her gun there were animals on this planet of course although the corps had only glimpsed them from a distance and rabies was transmitted by animal bite it wasnt an animal it was a human child no not a child mia realized as she rounded the clump of bushes and amazingly the girl didnt run an adolescent or perhaps older but so short and thin that mias mind had filled in child a scrawny young woman with light brown skin and long matted black hair dressed carelessly in some sort of saronglike wrap staring at mia with a total lack of fear hello mia said gently ejes the girl said mia said into her wrister kenin weve got natives survivors the girl smiled her hair was patchy on one side marked with small white rings fungus mia thought professionally absurdly the girl walked right toward mia not slowing as if intending to walk through her instinctively mia put out an arm the girl walked into it bonked herself on the forehead and crumpled to the ground youre not supposed to beat up the natives mia kenin said god shes not afraid of us at all how can that be you nearly gave her a concussion mia was as bewildered as kenin as all of them shed picked up the girl whod looked bewildered but not angry and then mia had backed off expecting the girl to run instead shed stood there rubbing her forehead and jabbering and mia had seen that her sarong was made of an uncut sheet of plastic its colors faded to a mottled gray kenin lolimel and two guards had come running and still the girl wasnt afraid she chattered at them occasionally pausing as if expecting them to answer when no one did she eventually turned and moved leisurely off mia said im going with her instantly a guard said its not safe maam and kenin said mia you cant just you dont need me here she said too brusquely suddenly there seemed nothing more important in the world than going with this girl where did that irrational impulse come from and ill be perfectly safe with a gun this was such a stunningly stupid remark that no one answered her but kenin didnt order her to stay mia accepted the guards tanflefoam and kenins vidcam and followed the girl it was hard to keep up with her wait mia called which produced no response so she tried what the girl had said to her ejes immediately the girl stopped and turned to her with glowing eyes and a smile that could have melted glaciers had good fortune had such a thing gentle planet gentle person who was almost certainly a descendent of the original dead settlers or was she intergalactic had no record of any other registered ship leaving for this star system but that didnt mean anything intergalactic didnt know everything sometimes given the time dilation of space travel mia thought they knew nothing ejes the girl agreed sprinted back to mia and took her hand slowing her youthful pace to match the older womans she led mia home the houses were scattered as though they couldnt make up their mind to be a village or not a hundred yards away another native walked toward a distant house the two ignored each other mia couldnt stand the silence she said i am mia the girl stopped outside her hut and looked at her mia pointed to her chest mia esefeb the girl said pointing to herself and giving that glorious smile not ejes which must mean something else mia pointed to the hut a primitive affair of untrimmed logs pieces of foamcast carried from the city and sheets of faded plastic all tacked crazily together efef said esefeb which evidently meant home this language was going to be a bitch degraded and confusing esefeb suddenly hopped to one side of the dirt path laughed and pointed at blank air then she took mias hand and led her inside more confusion more degradation the single room had an open fire with the simple venting system of a hole in the roof the bed was high on stilts why with a set of rickety steps made of rotting untrimmed logs one corner held a collection of huge pots in which grew greenery mia saw three unfired clay pots one of them sagging sideways so far the soil had spilled onto the packeddirt floor also a beautiful titanium vase and a cracked hydroponic vat on one plant almost the size of a small tree hung a second sheet of plastic sarong this one an unfaded bluegreen dishes and tools littered the floor the same mix as the pots of scavenged items and crude homemade ones the hut smelled of decaying food and unwashed bedding there was no light source and no machinery kenins voice sounded softly from her wrister your vid is coming through fine even the most primitive human societies have some type of art work mia didnt reply her attention was riveted to esefeb the girl flung herself up the stairs and sat up in bed facing the wall what mia had seen before could hardly be called a smile compared to the light the sheer joy that illuminated esefebs face now esefeb shuddered in ecstasy crooning to the empty wall ejes ejes aaahhhh ejes mia turned away she was a medician but esefebs emotion seemed too private to witness it was the ecstasy of orgasm or religious transfiguration or madness mia her wrister said i need an image of that girls brain it was easytoo easy lolimel said later and he was right creatures sentient or not did not behave this way we could haul all the neuro equipment out to the village kenin said doubtfully from base its not a village and i dont think thats a good idea mia said softly the softness was unnecessary esefeb slept like stone in her high bunk and the hut was so dark illuminated only by faint starlight through the hole in the roof that mia could barely see her wrister to talk into it i think esefeb might come voluntarily ill try in the morning when its light kenin not old but old enough to feel stiff sleeping on the ground said will you be comfortable there until morning no but ill manage what does the computer say about the recs lolimel answeredevidently they were having a regular allhands conference the language is badly degraded international you probably guessed that the translators preparing a lexicon and grammar the artifacts food supply dwelling everything visual doesnt add up they shouldnt have lost so much in two hundred fifty years unless mental deficiency was a sideeffect of having survived the virus but kenin thinks he stopped abruptly you may speak for me kenins voice said amused i think youll find that military protocol degrades too over time at least way out here well kenin thinks its possible that what the girl has is a mutated version of the virus maybe infectious maybe inheritable maybe transmitted through fetal infection his statement dropped into mias darkness as heavy as esefebs sleep mia said so the mutated virus could still be extant and active yes kenin said we need not only neuroimages but a sample of cerebrospinal fluid her behavior suggests i know what her behavior suggests mia said curtly that sheer joy shuddering in ecstasy it was seizures in the limbic system the brains deep center for primitive emotion which produced such transcendent rapturous trances religious mystics saul on the road to damascus visions of our lady or of nirvana and the virus might still be extant and not a part of the vaccine they had all received although if transmission was fetal the medicians were safe if not mia said the rest of esefebs behavior doesnt fit with limbic seizures she seems to see things that arent there even talks to her hallucinations when shes not having an actual seizure i dont know kenin said there might be multiple infection sites in the brain i need her mia well be there mia said and wondered if that were going to be true but it was mostly mia after a brief uncomfortable sleep wrapped in the sheet of bluegreen plastic sat waiting for esefeb to descend her rickety stairs the girl bounced down chattering at something to mias right she smelled worse than yesterday mia breathed through her mouth and went firmly up to her esefeb mia pointed dramatically feeling like a fool the girl pointed back mia yes good now mia made a sweep of the sorry hut efef efef esefeb agreed smiling radiantly esefeb efef the girl agreed that this was her home mia pointed theatrically toward the city mia efef mia eb esefeb etej mia efef mia and esefeb come to mias home mia had already raided the computers tentative lexicon of good fortunese esefeb cocked her head and looked quizzical a worm crawled out of her hair mia repeated mia eb esefeb etej mia efef esefeb responded with a torrent of repetitious syllables none of which meant anything to mia except ejes the girl spoke the word with such delight that it had to be a name a lover maybe these people didnt live as solitary as shed assumed mia took esefebs hand and gently tugged her toward the door esefeb broke free and sat in the middle of the room facing a blank wall of crumbling logs and jabbered away to nothing at all occasionally laughing and even reaching out to touch empty air ejes ejes mia watched bemused recording everything making medical assessments esefeb wasnt malnourished for which the natural abundance of the planet was undoubtedly responsible but she was crawling with parasites filthy with water easily available and isolated maybe isolated lolimel mia said softly into the wrister whats the best dictionary guess for alone lolimel said the closest weve got is one there doesnt seem to be a concept for unaccompanied or at least we havent found it yet the word for one is eket when esefeb finally sprang up happily mia said esefeb eket the girl look startled ek ek she said no no esefeb ek eket esefeb eb ejes esefeb and ejes she was not alone she had the hallucinatory ejes again mia took esefebs hand and pulled her toward the door this time esefeb went with her as they set off toward the city the girls legs wobbled some parasite that had become active overnight in the leg muscles whatever the trouble was esefeb blithely ignored it as they traveled much more slowly than yesterday to kenins makeshift lab in the ruined city along the way esefeb stopped to watch laugh at or talk to three different things that werent there shes beautiful under all that neglect lolimel said staring down at the anesthetized girl on kenins neuroimaging slab kenin said mildly if the mutated virus is transmitted to a fetus it could also be transmitted sexually the young man said hotly i wasnt implying mia said oh calm down lolimel weve all done it on numerous worlds regs say regs dont always matter three hundred light years from anywhere else kenin said exchanging an amused glance with mia mia lets start the girls limp body slid into the neuroimager esefeb hadnt objected to meeting the other medicians to a minimal washing to the sedative patch mia had put on her arm thirty seconds later she slumped to the floor by the time she came to an incision ten cells thick would have been made into her brain and a sample removed she would have been harvested imaged electroscanned and mapped she would never know it there wouldnt even be a headache three hours later esefeb sat on the ground with two of the guards eating soysynth as if it were ambrosia mia kenin lolimel and the three other medicians sat in a circle twenty yards away staring at handhelds and analyzing results it was late afternoon long shadows slanted across the goldgreen grass and a small breeze brought the sweet heavy scent of some native flower paradise mia thought and then bonnet syndrome she said it aloud charles bonnet syndrome and five people raised their heads to stare at her returned to their handhelds and called up medical deebees i think youre right kenin said slowly i never even heard of it before or if i did i dont remember thats because nobody gets it anymore mia said it was usually old people whose eye problems werent corrected now we routinely correct eye problems kenin frowned but thats not all thats going on with esefeb no but it was one thing and why couldnt kenin give her credit for thinking of it the next moment she was ashamed of her petty pique it was just fatigue sleeping on that hard cold floor in esefebs home esefeb efef mia concentrated on charles bonnet syndrome patients with the syndrome which was discovered in the eighteenth century had damage somewhere in their optic pathway or brain it could be lesions macular degeneration glaucoma diabetic retinopathy or even cataracts partially blind people saw and sometimes heard instead things that werent there often with startling clarity and realism feedback pathways in the brain were twoway information avenues visual data memory and imagination constantly flowed to and from each other interacting so vividly that for example even a small child could visualize a cat in the absence of any actual cats but in bonnet syndrome there was interruption of the baseline visual data about what was and was not real so all imaginings and hallucinations were just as real as the ground beneath ones feet look at the amygdala medician berutha said oh merciful gods both of esefebs amygdalae were enlarged and deformed the amygdalae two almondshaped structures behind the ears specialized in recognizing the emotional significance of events in the external world they werent involved in charles bonnet syndrome clearly they were here kenin said i think whats happening here is a strengthening or alteration of some neural pathways at the extreme expense of others esefeb sees her hallucinations and she experiences them as just as realmaybe more realthan anything else in her world and the pathways go down to the limbic where seizures give some of them an intense emotional significance like like orgasm maybe ejes phantoms in the brain berutha said a viral god lolimel said surprising mia his tone almost reverential suddenly irritated her a god responsible for this peoples degradation lolimel theyre so absorbed in their phantoms that they dont concentrate on the most basic care of themselves nor on building farming art innovation nothing theyre prisoners of their pretty fantasies lolimel nodded reluctantly yes i see that berutha said to kenin we need to find the secondary virus because if it is infectious through any other vector besides fetal or sexual he didnt finish the thought i know kenin said but it isnt going to be easy we dont have cadavers for the secondary the analyzer is still working on the cerebralspinal fluid meanwhile she began organizing assignments efficient and clear mia stopped listening esefeb had finished her meal and walked up to the circle of scientists she tugged at mias tunic mia esefeb etej efef esefeb come home mia eb esefeb etej esefeb efef mia said and the girl gave her joyous smile mia kenin said im going with her kenin we need more behavioral data and maybe i can persuade another native or two to submit to examination mia argued feebly she knew that scientific information was not really her motive she wasnt sure however what was she just wanted to go with esefeb why did you first enter the corps lolimels question stuck in mias mind a rhetorical fishbone in the throat over the next few days mia had brought her medkit and she administered broadspectrum microbials to esefeb hoping something would hit the parasites were trickier needing lifecycle analysis or at least some structural knowledge but she made a start on that too i entered the corps to relieve suffering lolimel odd how naive the truest statements could sound but that didnt make them any less true esefeb went along with all mias pokings patches and procedures she also carried out minimal foodgathering activities with a haphazard disregard for safety or sanitation that appalled mia mia had carried her own food from the ship esefeb ate it just as happily as her own but mostly esefeb talked to ejes it made mia feel like a voyeur esefeb was so unselfconsciousdid she even know she had a self apart from ejes she spoke to laughed at with played beside and slept with her phantom in the brain and around her the hut disintegrated even more esefeb got diarrhea from something in her water and then the place smelled even more foul grimly mia cleaned it up esefeb didnt seem to notice mia was eket alone in her futile endeavors at sanitation at health at civilization esefeb eb mia etej efef how did you say neighbors mia consulted the computers lexicon steadily growing as the translator program deciphered words from context it had discovered no word for neighbor nor for friend nor mate nor any kinship relationships at all except baby mia was reduced to pointing at the nearest hut esefeb eb mia etej efef over there the neighboring hut had a baby both hut and child a toddler who lay listlessly in one corner were just as filthy and diseased as esefebs house at first the older woman didnt seem to recognize esefeb but when esefeb said her name the two women spoke animatedly the neighbor smiled at mia mia reached for the child was not prevented from picking him up and settled the baby on her lap discreetly she examined him sudden rage boiled through her as unexpected as it was frightening this child was dying of parasites of infection of something a preventable something maybe yes maybe no the child didnt look neglected but neither did the mother look concerned all at once the child in her arms stiffened shuddered and began to babble his listlessness vanished his little dirty face lit up like sunrise and he laughed and reached out his arms toward something not there his mother and esefeb turned to watch also smiling as the toddler had an unknowable limbic seizure in his dying ecstatic brain mia set him down on the floor she called up the dictionary but before she could say anything the mother too had a seizure and sat on the dirt floor shuddering with joy esefeb watched her a moment before chattering to something mia couldnt see mia couldnt stand it any more she left walking as fast as she could back to esefebs house disgusted and frightened and what envious why did you first enter the corps to serve humanity to live purposefully to find as all men and women hope happiness and she had sometimes been happy but she had never known such joy as that nonetheless she argued with herself the price was too high these people were dying off because of their absorption in their rapturous phantoms they lived isolated degraded sickly lives which were undoubtedly shorter than necessary it was obscene in her clenched hand was a greasy hair sample shed unobtrusively cut from the toddlers head as he sat on her lap hair that dead tissue was a persons fossilized past mia intended a dna scan esefeb strolled in an hour later she didnt seem upset at mias abrupt departure with her was lolimel i met her on the path lolimel said although nothing as wellused as a path connected the huts she doesnt seem to mind my coming here or anything else mia said what did you bring he had to have brought something tangible kenin would have used the wrister to convey information tentative prophylactic we havent got a vaccine yet and kenin says it may be too difficult better to go directly to a cure to hold in reserve in case any of us comes down with this mia caught the omission any of us what about them lolimel looked down at his feet its um a borderline case mia the decision hasnt been made yet borderline how lolimel its a virus infecting the brains of humans and degrading their functioning he was embarrassed section six says that um some biological conditions especially persistent ones create cultural differences for which corps policy is noninterference section six mentions the religious dietary laws that grew out of inherited food intolerances on i know what section six says lolimel but you dont measure a cultures degree of success by its degree of happiness i dont think that is i dont know maybe degree of success isnt what section six means he looked away from her the tips of his ears grew red poor lolimel she and kenin had as much as told him that out here regs didnt matter except when they did mia stood you say the decision hasnt been made yet he looked surprised how could it be youre on the senior corps board to make the decision of course she was how could she forget she forgot more things these days momentary lapses symbolic of the greater lapses to come no brain functioned forever mia are you all im fine and im glad youre here i want to go back to the city for a few days you can stay with esefeb and continue the surveillance you can also extend to her neighbors the antibiotic antiviral and antiparasite protocols ive worked through with esefeb here ill show you but i thats an order she felt bad about it later of course but lolimel would get over it at base everything had the controlled frenzy of steady unremitting work meek now not a part of the working team mia ran a dna scan on the babys hair it showed what she expected the child shared fifty percent dna with esefeb he was her brother the neighbor whom esefeb clearly never saw who had at first not recognized esefeb was her mother for which there was still no word in the translator deebee i think weve got it kenin said coming into mias room she collapsed on a stone bench still beautiful after two and a half centuries kenin had the beatific serenity of a hard job well done a cure tentative radical i wouldnt want to use it on one of us unless we absolutely have to but we can refine it more at least its in reserve so a part of the team can begin creating and disseminating medical help these people can actually use targeted microbials an antiparasite protocol ive already started on that mia said her stomach tightening kenin the board needs to meet not tonight im soooo sleepy theatrically she stretched both arms words and gesture were unlike her tonight mia said while kenin was feeling so accomplished let kenin feel the full contrast to what she could do with what esefeb could kenin dropped her arms and looked at mia her whole demeanor changed relaxation into fortress mia ive already polled everyone privately and run the computer sims well meet but the decision is going to be to extend no cure the phantoms are a biologically based cultural difference the hell they are these people are dying out no theyre not if they were heading for extinction itd be a different situation but the satellite imagery and population equations based on data left by the generation that had the plague show theyre increasing slowly but a definite population gain significant to the pointohone level of confidence kenin im exhausted mia can we talk about it tomorrow plan on it mia thought grimly she stored the data on the dying toddlers matrilineage in her handheld a week in base and mia could convince no one not separately nor in a group medicians typically had tolerant psychological profiles with higherthanaverage acceptance of the unusual divergent and eccentric otherwise they wouldnt have joined the corps on the third day to keep herself busy mia joined the junior medicians working on refining the cure for what was now verified as limbic seizures with impaired sensory input causing charles bonnet syndrome over the next few weeks it became clear to mia what kenin had meant this treatment if they had to use it would be brutally hard on the brain what was that old ditty cured last night of my disease i died today of my physician well it still happened enough in the corps another reason behind the boards decision she felt a curious reluctance to go back to esefeb or as the words kept running through her mind mia ek etej esefeb efef god it was a tongue twister these people didnt just need help with parasites they needed an infusion of new consonants it was a relief to be back at base to be working with her mind solving technical problems alongside rational scientists still she couldnt shake a feeling of being alone being lonely mia eket or maybe the feeling was more like futility lolimels back jamal said hed come up behind her as she sat at dusk on her favorite stone bench facing the city at this time of day the ruins looked romantic infused with history the sweet scents of that nightblooming flower which mia still hadnt identified wafted around her i think you should come now jamal said and this time mia heard his tone she spun around in the alien shadows jamals face was set as ice hes contracted it mia said knowing beyond doubt that it was true the virus wasnt just fetally transmitted it wasnt a slowacting retrovirus and if lolimel had slept with esefeb but he wouldnt be that stupid he was a medician hed been warned we dont really know anything solid about the goddamn thing jamal burst out we never do mia said and the words cracked her dry lips like salt lolimel stood in the center of the ruined atrium giggling at something only he could see kenin who could have proceeded without mia nodded at her mia understood kenin acknowledged the special bond mia had with the young medician the cure was untested probably brutal no more really than dumping a selection of poisons in the right areas of the brain in itself problematical with the bloodbrain barrier mia made herself walk calmly up to lolimel whats so funny lolimel all those sandwigs crawling in straight lines over the floor i never saw blue ones before sandwigs lolimel she remembered had been born on new carthage sandwigs were always red lolimel said but why is there a tree growing out of your head mia strong fertilizer she said lolimel did you have sex with esefeb he looked genuinely shocked no all right he might or might not be lying jamal whispered a chance to study the hallucinations in someone who can fully articulate no kenin said time matters with this mia saw that she couldnt bring herself to say cure realization dawned on lolimels face me youre going to me theres nothing wrong with me lolimel dear heart mia said i dont have it and the floor doesnt have sandwigs lolimel no the guards had been alerted lolimel didnt make it out of the atrium they held him flailing and yelling while kenin deftly slapped on a tranq patch in ten seconds he was out tie him down securely kenin said breathing hard daniel get the brain bore started as soon as hes prepped everyone else start packing up and impose quarantine we cant risk this for anyone else here im calling a section eleven section eleven if the medcorps officer in charge deems the risk to corps members to exceed the gain to colonists by a factor of three or more the officer may pull the corps offplanet it was the first time mia had ever seen kenin make a unilateral decision twentyfour hours later mia sat beside lolimel as dusk crept over the city the shuttle had already carried up most personnel and equipment lolimel was in the last shift because as kenin did not need to say aloud if he died his body would be left behind but lolimel had not died he had thrashed in unconscious seizures had distorted his features in silent grimaces of pain until mia would not have recognized him had suffered malfunctions in alimentary lymphatic endocrine and parasympathetic nervous systems all recorded on the monitors but he would live the others didnt know it but mia did were ready for him mia the young tech said are you on this shuttle too no the last one move him carefully we dont know how much pain hes actually feeling through the meds she watched the gurney slide out of the room its monitors looming over lolimel like cliffs over a raging river when hed gone mia slipped into the next building and then the next such beautiful buildings spacious atria beautifully proportioned rooms one structure flowing into another eight buildings away she picked up the pack shed left there it was heavy even though it didnt contain everything she had cached around the city it was so easy to take things when a base was being hastily withdrawn everyone was preoccupied everyone assumed anything not readily visible was already packed inventories were neglected and the deebees not crosschecked no time historically war had always provided great opportunities for profiteers was that what she was yes but not a profit measured in money measure it rather in lives saved or restored to dignity or enhanced why did you first enter the corps because im a medician lolimel not an anthropologist they would notice of course that mia herself wasnt aboard the last shuttle but kenin at least would realize that searching from her would be a waste of valuable resources when mia didnt want to be found and mia was so old surely the old should be allowed to make their own decisions although she would miss them these corps members who had been her family since the last assignment shuffle eighteen months ago and decades ago depending on whose time you counted by especially she would miss lolimel but this was the right way to end her life in service to these colonists health she was a medician it went better than mia could have hoped when the ship had goneshed seen it leave orbit a fleeting stream of lightmia went to esefeb mia etej efef esefeb said with her rosy smile mia come home mia walked toward her hugged the girl and slapped the tranq patch on her neck for the next week mia barely slept after the makeshift surgery she tended esefeb through the seizures vomiting diarrhea pain on the morning the girl woke up herself again esefeb was there to bathe the feeble body feed it nurse esefeb she recovered very fast the cure was violent on the body but not as debilitating as everyone had feared and afterwards esefeb was quieter meeker and surprisingly intelligent as mia taught her the rudiments of water purification sanitation safe food storage health care by the time mia moved on to esefebs mothers house esefeb was free of most parasites and mia was working on the rest esefeb never mentioned her former hallucinations it was possible she didnt remember them esefeb ekebet mia said as she hefted her pack to leave esefeb be well esefeb nodded she stood quietly as mia trudged away and when mia turned to wave at her esefeb waved back mia shifted the pack on her shoulders it seemed heavier than before or maybe mia was just older two weeks older merely but two weeks could make a big difference an enormous difference two weeks could start to save a civilization night fell esefeb sat on the stairs to her bed clutching the bluegreen sheet of plastic in both hands she sobbed and shivered her clean face contorted around her the unpopulated shadows grew thicker and darker eventually she wailed aloud to the empty night ejes o ejes ejes esefeb eket ejes etej efef o etej efef infall ted kosmatka the disc caved a hole in the starshine smooth graphene skin reflected nothing blotting out the stars as it swung through the vacuumblack on black the perfect absence of color it was both a ship and not a ship the disc lacked a propulsion system it lacked navigation inside two men awakened first one and then the other in truth the disc was a projectilea dark bolus of lifesupport fired into distant orbit around another stranger kind of darkness this second darkness is almost infinitely larger massing several hundred thousand sols and it didnt blot out the stars behind it but instead lensed them into a bright shifting halo bending light into a ring deforming the fabric of spacetime itself from the perspective of the orbiting disc the stars seemed to flow around an enormous circular gap in the star field it had many different names this region of space the astronomers who discovered it centuries earlier had called it bhat later physicists would call it the sink and finally to those who came here to those who dreamed of it it was known simply as the maw a black hole like none ever found before by the discs third day in orbit it had already traveled three hundred eighteen million miles but this is only a tiny fraction of its complete trajectory at the end of the discs seventysecond hour in orbit a small lead weight kilograms was fired toward the heart of the gravity wellconnected to the ship by a wire so thin that even mathematicians called it a line the line spooled out thousands of kilometers of unbreakable tetravalent filament stretching toward the darkness until finally pulling taut the line held fast to its anchor point sending a musical resonance vibrating through the discs carbon hull inexorable gravity a subtle shift slowly at first but gradually on the fourth day the ship that was not a ship changed course and began to fall the old man wiped blood from the young mans face ulii ul quisall the young man said dont touch me the old man nodded you speak thusi he said i speak this too the young man leaned close and spat blood at the old man it is an abomination to hear you speak it the old mans eyes narrowed he wiped the blood from his cheek an abomination he said perhaps this is true he held out his hand for the young man to see in his hand was a scalpel do you know why im here he asked light gleamed off the scalpels edge this time it was the old man who leaned close im here to cut you the old man placed the scalpels blade on the young mans cheek just beneath his left eye the steel pressed a dimple into his pallid skin the young mans expression didnt change he stared straight ahead eyes like blue stone the old man considered him but it would be a kindness to cut you he continued i see that now he pulled the blade away and ran a thumb along the young mans jaw tracing the web of scar tissue you wouldnt even feel it the young man sat motionless in the chair arms bound to the armrests by thick straps he was probably still in his teens the beginnings of a beard making patchy whorls on his cheek he was little more than a boy really he had probably once been beautiful the old man judged that explained the scars the boys psychological profile must have shown a weakness for vanity or perhaps the profiles didnt matter anymore perhaps they just scarred them all now the old man rubbed his eyes feeling the anger slide out of him he put the scalpel back on the tray with the other bright and gleaming instruments sleep he told the boy you will need it and the universe ticked on where are we going the boy said after several hours whether hed slept or not the old man wasnt sure but at least hed been silent the old man rose from his console on creaking knees acceleration accreted weight into the soles of his feet allowing the simple pleasure of walking he brought the boy water drink he said holding out the nozzle the boy eyed him suspiciously but after a moment took a long swallow where are we going he repeated the old man ignored him they have already tried to interrogate me the boy said i told them nothing i know if you told them what they wanted you wouldnt be here and so now theyre sending me someplace else to try again yes someplace else but not to try again the boy was silent for a long moment then he said for that they have you the old man smiled you are a smart one rage burned in the boys eyes and pain beyond measuring the earlier interrogations had been harsh he pulled against his straps again trying to jerk his arms free tell me where you are taking me he demanded the old man stared down at him you are scared he said i know what you are thinking you want out of your restraints youre thinking that if you could get loose oh the things you would do to me the old man glanced toward the tray of gleaming steel you wish you could use that blade on me you wish that you were in my shoes that i was sitting where you are but you dont understand the old man said then leaned forward again and whispered into the boys ear it is i who envy you the ship hummed as it fell charged ions blasted carbon skin why wont you tell me where were going the boy repeated the question every few minutes finally the old man walked to the console and pressed a button the wall revealed a view screen exposing deep space the looming maw there the old man said we are going there the black hole filled half the screen abyss if there ever was one the boy smiled you try to scare me with death i dont fear death i know the old man said death is my reward in the afterlife i will walk again with my father i will tread the bones of my enemies i will be seated at a place of honor with others who fell fighting for the side of god death will be a paradise for me you truly believe that dont you yes that is why i envy you the boy was a mass murderer or a freedom fighter or maybe just unfortunate the old man looked at the boys scars noting the creative flourish that had been lavished on his face during previous interviews yes unfortunate certainly perhaps that above all life in deep space is fragile and humans are as they have always been bombs though are different in space bombs can be much much more effective if placed just right a simple three pound bomb can destroy an entire colony open it to the sterilizing vacuum of the endless night and ten thousand people deada whole community wiped clean in a single explosive decompression hed seen that once a long time ago when this war first began seen the bodies floating frozen inside a ruptured hab the only survivors a lucky few who scrambled into pressure suits a lucky few like him because of a threepound bomb multiply it by a hundred colonies and a dozen years three airless worlds a fight over territory culture religion the things man has always fought over humans are as they have always been in space though the cost of zealotry is higher a thousand years ago nations bankrupted themselves to raise armies it cost a soldier to kill a soldier then came gunpowder technology increased population densitiesgradually leveraging the cost of death along a sliding scale of labor and raw materials until finally three pounds of basic chemistry had the power to erase whole swaths of society ever more effortless murder the final statistical flatline in the falling price of destruction what is your name the old man asked him the boy didnt answer we need the names of the others i will tell you nothing thats all we need just the names nothing more we can do the rest the boy stayed silent they watched the viewscreen the black hole grew the expanding darkness compressed the surrounding star field the old man checked his instruments were traveling at half the speed of light he said we have two hours our time until we approach the schwarzschildradius if you were going to kill me there are easier ways than this easier ways yes im worth nothing to you dead nor alive the silence drew out between them do you know what a black hole is the old man asked what it is really the young mans face was stone it is a sideeffect it is a byproduct of the laws of the universe you cant have the universe as we know it and not have black holes scientists predicted them before they ever found one youre wasting your time the old man gestured toward the screen this is not just a black hole though not really but they predicted this too do you think you can frighten me with this game im not trying to frighten you it makes no sense to kill me like this youd be killing yourself you must have a family i did two daughters you intend to change course no this ship has value even your life must be worth something if not to yourself then at least to those whose orders you follow why sacrifice both a ship and a man in order to kill one enemy i was a mathematician before your war made soldiers of mathematicians there are variables here that you dont understand the old man pointed at the screen again his voice went soft it is beautiful is it not the boy ignored him or perhaps this ship has an escape pod the boy continued perhaps you will be saved while i die but youd still be wasting a ship i cannot escape the line that pulls us cant be broken even now the gravity draws us in by the time we approach the schwarzschild radius well be traveling at nearly the speed of light we will share the same fate you and i i dont believe you the old man shrugged you dont have to believe you have merely to witness this doesnt make sense you think it has to shut up i dont want to hear more from a godless tathuun godless why do you assume i am godless because if you believed in god you would not do this thing you are wrong the old man said i do believe in god then you will receive judgment for your sins no he said i will not over the next several hours the black hole swelled to fill the screen the stars along its rim stretched and blurred torturing the sky into a new configuration the boy sat in silence the old man checked his instruments we cross the schwarzschild radius in six minutes is that when we die nothing so simple as that you talk in circles the old mathematician picked up the scalpel he touched his finger to the razor tip what happens after we cross that radius isnt the opposite of existence but its inverse what does that mean so now you ask the questions give me a name and ill answer any question you like why would i give you names so they can find themselves in chairs like this the old man shook his head you are stubborn i can see that so i will give you this for free the schwarzschild radius is the innermost orbit beyond which all things must fall inwardeven communications signals this is important to you for this reason beyond the schwarzschild radius asking you questions will serve no purpose because i will have no way to transmit the information after that you will be no use to me at all youre saying well still live once we pass it for most black holes wed be torn apart long before reaching it but this is something special supermassive and old as time for something this size the tidal forces are more dilute the image on the screen shifted the stars flowed in slowmotion as the circular patch of darkness spread blackness filled the entire lower portion of the screen a black hole is a two dimensional object there is no inside to enter no line to cross because nothing ever truly falls in at the event horizon the math of time and space trade positions what are you talking about to distant observers infalling objects take an infinite period of time to cross the event horizon simply becoming ever more redshifted as time passes more of your circles why are you doing this why not just kill me there are telescopes watching our descent recording the footage why as warning propaganda you mean to show what will happen to others we arent afraid to die our reward is in the afterlife the old man shook his head as our speed increases time dilates the cameras will show that well never actually hit the black hole well never cross the threshold the boys face showed confusion you still dont understand the line isnt where we die its where time itself ceases to functionwhere the universe breaks all matter and energy coming to a halt frozen forever on that final mathematical boundary you will never get your afterlife not ever because you will never die the boys face was blank for a moment and then his eyes went wide you dont fear martyrdom the mathematician gestured to the viewscreen so perhaps this the ship arced closer stars streamed around the looming wound in the starfield the old man put his hand on the boys shoulder he touched the scalpel to the boys throat if you tell me the names ill end this quickly while you still have time i need the names before we reach the horizon so this is what you offer the old man nodded death what did you do to deserve this mission i volunteered why would you do such a thing ive been too long at this war my conscience grows heavy but you said you believe in god youll be giving up your afterlife too the old man smiled a last smile my afterlife would not be so pleasant as yours how do you know this is all true what you said about time how do you know ive seen the telescopic images previous missions spread out like pearls across the face of the event trapped in their final asymptotic approach they are there still they will always be there but how do you know maybe its just some new propaganda a lie maybe it doesnt really work that way what matters is that this ship will be there for all to see forever a warning long after both our civilizations have come and gone we will still be visible falling forever it could still be false but we are good at taking things on faith you and i give me the names i cant the old man thought of his daughters one darkeyed the other blue gone because of boys like this boy but not this boy he reminded himself the old man looked down at the figure in the chair he might have been that boy if circumstances were different if hed been raised the way the boy was raised if hed seen what hed seen the boy was just a pawn in this game as was he what is death to those who take their next breath in paradise the old man asked where is the sacrifice but this and the old man gestured to the dark maw growing on the screen this will be true martyrdom when you blow up innocents who dont believe what you believe this is what youre taking away from them everything the boy broke into quiet sobs the horizon approached a graphic on the screen one minute remaining you can still tell me there is still time perhaps they are your friends perhaps your family do you think theyd protect you they wouldnt we just need names a few names and this will all be over ill end it for you before its too late the boy closed his eyes i wont his daughters because of boys like this boy why the old man asked honestly confused it does not benefit you you get no paradise the boy stayed silent i take your heaven from you the old man said you will receive nothing silence your loyalty is foolish tell me one name and i will end this i will not the boy said there were tears on his cheeks the old mathematician sighed hed never expected this i believe you he said then slashed the boys throat a single motion severing the carotid the boys eyes flashed wide in momentary surprise then an emotion more complicated he slumped forward in his bonds it was over the old man ran a palm over the boys eyes closing them may it be what you want it to be he said he sat down on the floor against the growing gravity he stared at the screen as the darkness approached the mathematician in him was pleased a balancing of the equation a soldier for a soldier he thought of his daughters one browneyed the other blue he tried to hold their faces in his mind the final thought that he would think forever not the reverse of existence but its inverse and he waited to be right or wrong to be judged for his sins or not the observer kristine kathryn rusch and so we went in combat formation all five of us me first face masks on so tight that the edges of our eyes pulled suits like a second skin weapons in both hands backups attached to the wrists and forearms flashbangs on our hips no shielding no vehicles no nothing just us dosed altered ready to go i wanted to rip somethings head off and i did the fury burning in me like lust the weapons became toolsi wanted up close and i got it fingers in eyes fists around tentacles poking pulling yanking they bled brown like soda like coffee like weak tea and they screamedor at least i think they did or maybe that was just me the commanders pulled us out before we could turn on each other gave us calming drugs put us back in our chambers for sleep but we couldnt sleep the adrenaline didnt stop neither did the fury monica banged her head against the wall until she crushed her own skull latrice shot up her entire chamber with a backup shed hidden between her legs she took out two mps and both team members in the chambers beside her before the commander filled the air with some kind of narcotic to wipe her out and me i kept ripping and gouging and pulling and yanking until my fingertips were bone by then i hit the circuits inside the door and fried myself and woke up here strapped down against a cold metal bed with no bedclothes the walls are some kind of brushed steel i can see my own reflection blurry paleskinned wildeyed i dont look like a woman and i certainly dont look like me and you well know doc that if you unstrap me ill kill the thing reflected in that brushed metal wall after i finish with you you ask how it feels and you know youll get an answer because of that chip you put in my head i can feel it you know itching if i close my eyes i can picture it like a gnat floating in gray matter free my hands and ill get it out myself free my hands and ill get us all out of here how does it feel by it i assume you mean me i assume you mean whatevers left of me heres how it feels there are three parts to me now the old remembered part which doesnt have a voice it stands back and watches appalled at everything that happens everything i do i can see her toothat remembered partgangly young woman with athletic prowess and no money she stands behind the rest of us wearing the same clothes she wore to the recruiters that daypants with a permanent crease her best blouse long hair pulled away from her horsy face there are dreams in her eyesor there were then now theyre cloudy disillusioned lost if youd just given her the money let her get the education first shed be an officer or an engineer or a goddamn tech soldier but you gave her that testbiological predisposition aggression sensitivity to certain hormones you gave her the test and found it wasnt just the physical that had made her a good athlete it wasnt just the physical it was the aggression and the way that minute alterations enhanced it aggression a strong predisposition and extreme sensitivity which after injections and genetic manipulation turned her into us im the articulate one im an observer too someone who stores information and can process it faster than the fastest computer im supposed to govern the reflexes but they gave me a blocker for that the minute i arrived back on ship then made it permanent when they got me to base i can see doc i can hear i can even tell you whats going on and why i just cant stop it any more than you can i know i said three and yet i didnt mention the third i couldnt think of her not and think of the remembered one at the same time im not supposed to feel doc yet the remembered one she makes me sad the third oh yeah the third shes got control of the physical but you know that you see her every day shes the one who raises the arms who clenches the bandaged and useless fingers who kicks at the restraints holding the feet shes the one who growls and makes it impossible for me to talk to you you know that or you wouldnt have used the chip an animal shes not an animal animals create small societies they have customs and instinctual habits they live in prides or pods or tribes shes a thing inarticulate violent useless and by giving her control of the physical you made the rest of us useless trapped inside destined to watch until she works herself free if she decides to bash her head against the wall until she crushes her own skull or to rip through the steel breaking every single bone she has if she decides to impale herself on the bedframe ill cheer her on not just for me but for the remembered one the one with hopes and dreams and a future she squandered when she reached for the stars the one who got us here and who cant ever get us out so you say im unusual how nice for me the ones who separate usually kill themselves before the mps ever get into the chamber the others the ones who integrate with their thing get reused you think that the women i trained withthe ones not in my unit the ones who didnt die when we got backyou think theyre still out there fighting an enemy we dont entirely understand i think youre naïve but youre preparing a study something for the government so that theyll know this experiment is failing not the chipinthebrain thing that allows you to communicate with me but the girl soldiers the footsoldiers the grunts on the ground and if they listen ha theyll listen because of people like me okay ill buy into your pipe dreams heres what everyone on earth believes we dont even know their names we can call them the others but thats only for clarity purposes there are namessquids etsbut none of them seem to stick they have ships in much of the solar system so were told but were going to prevent them from getting the moon the moon is the last bastion before they reach earth thats about it no one cares unless they have a kid up there and even then they dont really care unless the kid is a grunt like i was only they dont know the kids a grunt not until the kid comes home from a tour if the kid comes home heres what i learned on our ship most of the guys never came home thats when the commanders started the hormonalgenetic thing the thing that tapped into the maternal instinct apparently the female of the species has a ferocious need to protect her young it can beit istapped and in some of us its powerful and we become strong mostly though no one gets near the ground the battle is engaged in the blackness of space its like the video games our grandparents usedwhich some say and i never believed until nowwere used to train the kids for some kind of future war the kind were fighting now what i learned after a few tours before i ever had to go to ground was that ground troops footsoldiers rarely returned they have specific missions mostly clearing an area and they do it and they mostly die a lot of us died that daywhat i can remember of it mostly i remember the fingers and the eyes and the tentacles yes theyre real and the pull of the face mask against my skin what i suspect is this the troops the others have on the ground arent the enemy theyre some kind of captured race footsoldiers just like us fodder for the war machine i think if i concentrate real hard i remember them working putting chips places implanting stuff in the groundgrowing thingsim not entirely clear and i wonder if the talk of an invasion force is just that talk and if this isnt something else some kind of experiment in case we get into a real situation something thatll become bigger because i dont ever remember the others fighting back if squids can look surprised these did all of them so thats my theory for what good itll do theres still girls dying up there women i guess creatures footsoldiers whatever they want to create then we come back and we become this things because we cant ever be the remembered ones not again but you know that youre studying as many of us as you can thats clear too im not even sure you are a doc maybe youre a machine getting these thoughts processing them using some modulated voice to ask the right questions the ones that provoke these memories since ive never seen you i never see anyone except the ghosts of myself so what are you going to do with me reintegration isnt possible thats been tried you think i dont remember how do you think the remembered one and i split off in the first place once there was just her and the thing now theres three of us trapped in herewell two trapped and one growling but you know what i mean sending us back wont work we might turn on our comrades or ourself probably ourself sending us home is out of the question even if we had a home the remembered one does but shes so far away shell never reintegrate let me tell you what i think you should do i think you should remove the chip move me to a new location pretend youve never interviewed me then youd just be faced with the thing and the thing should be put out of its misery we should be put out of its misery monica and latrice werent wrong doc they were just crude they used what methods they had at their disposal they were proactive i cant be youve got all three of us bound up here let us go send us back all by ourselves no team no combat formation hell not even any weapons let us die its the only humane thing to do jennys sick david tallerman its a cold day in february and jennys sick again i ask what it is this time and she just looks at me with ghastly eyes staring out from over swollen purpling flesh shes sitting bolt upright propped by pillows and theres so much sweat everywhere that its like condensation in a steam room ive seen her look bad before but never quite this bad where did she get this shit how long is it going to last this time i cant be the one to deal with this weve been living together for maybe two years we started sleeping together and ended friends but mainly we just hit it off and sharing a place seemed a good idea i thought we had things in common then that maybe we were going the same places but im looking to finish studying as soon as possible to carve out a career and i have no idea what jenny wants maybe she just wants to die i think it was about a year ago she got into this though you never know do you people are like oceans the powerful stuff moves deep down and you almost never see it so perhaps there was always something there just waiting for an outlet either way its about a year ago that i find out theres a campus bulletin going around over a new drug the usual about watching for strange behavior in our fellow students absenteeism mood swings that kind of thing i figure its the same old government stuff rooting for subversives and troublemakers theres always some new drug or faction or threat and the next week youll hear that the campus police have been out then maybe theres a face missing in your next lecture if you keep your nose clean and stay in the right groups it isnt that big a deal so theres buzz about this drug without any real details i dont think anything of it until i get in one evening and theres this noise coming from jennys room like nothing ive heard though a couple of months later it will be all too familiar this first time i dont know what to think i mean ive heard coughing before but this isnt clearingyourthroat coughing this is a cruel hacking bout that goes on for two full minutes while i stand in the hallway not sure what im hearing by the time i knock on her door its started again when i open it the cough is shaking right through her throwing her about like a rag doll i dont know what to do whether i should try and help so i just stand watching and for a while she doesnt seem to know im there then finally theres a break and she looks up im sick she tells me she says it with a weird grin like shes challenging me what do you mean nobody gets sick theres nothing left to get sick with instead of answering she holds up a small plastic bottle somebody has written the word choke across it in blue permanent marker i can see one small green and white capsule rattling around inside what the hell is that she only grins at me again then starts on another fit of coughing i find out later that this first time its influenza she spends two days with it wrapped fetal in bed skin like wet flour choking until near the end i can see blood mixed with the filth shes bringing up then abruptly it goes away it always does i figure out eventually that the second capsule the green one is the cure she takes it and an hour later shes well except each time she goes a little longer without taking the green pill one hour five hours a day after that we dont talk about it and i guess we drift apart pretty quickly jennys out a lot she doesnt bother to make classes or lectures and i know theres a crowd she hangs out with but i dont see them mainly im worried that shell get caught and that somehow theyll blame me as well i study harder as though that will make up for her absences i will the days away and i feel scared as much as i like jenny i like the thought of my future more maybe i should try and talk to her about it but we dont talk about anything very much when i do see her its because shes sick too sick to go out i dont know what she tells the campus authorities each time i dont know where the pills come from all i know is every month theres a new bottle with a name written on it like puke or burn in the same messy blue highlighter as much as i try to keep away from it and from jenny its more and more a part of my life a dirty secret i cant help but hide after a few months i start downloading old medical texts from the librarys archive i figure maybe puke is gastroenteritis but im majoring in information analysis not science history a lot of whats in those books goes way over my head and its not like i can ask anybody i wonder if i should try to help to look after her somehow but im too scared deep down theres a part of me thats so damn afraid that one day shell decide not to take the green pill ill come in to find her cold and still and when the police find out what happened that will be my life over too christmas comes and goes and im glad of the break and to be with my folks for a few weeks except that jenny and her weird obsession have got into my head and my parents healthiness seems strange somehow their perfect skin their smiles and their peace of mind having jenny in my life is damaging me but i only recognize it properly in that gap in the exposure to normality and discovering how alien it seems when i get back to the flat ive already made my mind up that i have to move out i dont know how i didnt think of it sooner almost a years gone by and it never crossed my mind that i could just leave when i see jenny i realize why theres something so frail about her even when shes not sick a depth in her eyes that breaks my heart i dont even know if she likes me anymoremaybe she hates meyet suddenly all i can think about is the touch of her skin those times we slept together the smell of her sweat mixed with the scent of her hair im going to look for somewhere else to live she looks surprised if only for a second sure this place is kind of cramped i can manage on my own i choose to think that she means financially but im not sure i dont mention the sickness i hope she will but i know shes not going to the way she is now all of that is something that happens to another person right now she seems so damn normal except for that look in her eyes that sense of unfathomable depth thats what i figured i say i figured you could manage by february ive found a placea couple of guys with a spare roomand im living midway between the two flats while i shift the last of my things i dont know why im not hurrying more i could have been moved two weeks ago instead i drag my heels take over a box every couple of days and tell myself its easier this way then i come in and hear the coughing not like the first time but slow drawnout more of a dry wheeze i go in and its the worst ive seen her she looks hollow like a discarded shell and more than anything she reminds me of these old porcelain dolls my grandmother used to keep skin white except where age had yellowed it with black eyes that didnt look even remotely human what is it this time no answer just a stare and a halfsmile through flaking lips i go out and load up the trolley that ive borrowed with my last four boxes i dont even say goodbye the next time i run into jenny is two years later i just happen to take a certain corner on a certain street and there she is i can tell right away that shes dying ive never seen anyone die not for real but its some kind of instinct in my gut that tells me because suddenly i want to run away to be anywhere else instead i make smalltalk its very small because theres so damn much i know we cant talk about jenny was my friend and for a while something more and i walked away for two years ive kept her out of my mind how are you doing i ask it feels like about the stupidest thing ive ever said but she nods and smiles and says im okay you know i feel pretty good she doesnt look good i think about suggesting we go for a coffee but i know she always hated those places she called them obscenely clean and there was only one bar shed ever drink in a place that had dropped so far off the map that the hygiene inspectorate didnt know it existed what are you doing now how did uni go what i mean is did you drop out did they catch you jenny dodges the question with all its implications yeah im getting by and you how are you i finished with a pretty good grade serious data dissection work is hard to come by but ive got a couple of interviews coming up its looking promising its pretty tight these days i guess but im hopeful why do i feel guilty saying this im not the screwup here im not the disease junky yeah well thats good she tries to sound like she means it i feel as if were on different planets separated by a million miles all i can think is how i want to be somewhere else and maybe thats why i say what i do jenny you look really fucking sick its out of my mouth before i know it but shes not even fazed yeah she smiles oh yeah im dying this time i dont even try and make an excuse i turn and walk away and the closest i come to apologizing is that i try not to run that night i dream about jenny cold and blue and somehow happy grinning up at me from some deep dark place with a rictus smile cut over her lips the dream hangs beside me all the next day like smoke in the air and i feel like im caught in jennys gravity like im plummeting but its a week on from that chance meeting in the street just when ive almost managed to forget that my phone rings i dont recognize the name or face except that she looks familiar somehow for a moment i get that same gut feeling that urge to run i pick up anyway hello can i help you my name is linda ulek im sorry to intrude on your time but its very important and there really isnt anybody else im sorry i dont then i remember where ive heard the name ulek before youre jennys mother i met her once jennys parents came to the flat and looked uncomfortable and left as quickly as they could jenny told me once that they were both high up in some obscure branch of the government that explains how she got hold of my private number as i say im sorry to intrude but jenny doesnt have any friends that we know of and we remembered your name and that the two of you lived together and were close at one point of course wed like to go ourselves of course we would but were in rome this month and we have commitments and the doctors are adamant that somebody who knows her should be with her im sorry i dont understand what youre asking jennys in hospital she says shes very sick and the doctors have asked us to visit her as part of her treatment as i say we cant do that we thought that perhaps you could i didnt know there were any hospitals left in a world with a cure for everything i figured the common hospital was as extinct as the common cold whatever im expecting the rondelle panacea clinic isnt it its just another nondescript building a few klicks out of the city like the office i work in or the flats i live in i press the buzzer beside the doors and a few moments later a young woman in a white suit appears when i tell her who i am she says youre here for jenny ulek and ushers me inside the woman who gives her name as doctor meier leads me through blankwalled corridors into a small office and offers me a seat it occurs to me that jenny must hate this place that in fact its everything she despises white walls white furniture white people in white suits if somebody had to design a personal hell for jenny it would look a lot like this doctor meier sits opposite me and says it was good of you to come i nod theres no point telling her how close i came to saying no youre aware of jennys case history some of it we lived together for a while i know she likes to get sick well its a little more complicated than that but in essence yes jenny takes a certain gratification from physical illness recently jenny has introduced a disease into her system that left untreated will be terminal within the next two months she pauses for just a moment to let that sink in we could cure it of course completely eradicate it or we could use more outmoded techniques to keep it in check why would you do that doctor meier has clearly prepared her answer she looks the type to have prepared an answer for anything i could hope to ask because if we were to let jenny out into the world tomorrow she would immediately find a way to infect herself again with the same disease or perhaps with something worse put bluntly the condition we need to treat in this caseif jenny is to survive in any meaningful wayis not the physical one i nod again sure i get that from these peoples point of view jenny is crazy i guess if id thought about it i would have come to the same conclusion but somehow it never occurred to me so whats the alternative there are two options the first perhaps the easiest in many ways will involve gene therapy some alteration of memories intrusive brain surgery put bluntly we would correct jennys personality to a degree where she can function safely in society it sounds perhaps more drastic than it is but at the end of it jenny will obviously not be quite the same person she is now damn right it sounds drastic theres another option there is its slower and there are no guarantees but we have excellent psychologists on staff and similar cases have been treated with a high degree of success i know that theres going to be a but its written all over her face while theres a good chance that ms ulek can become well with sufficient help and support it will take more than the kindness of strangers what she will need is someone she knows someone who knows her who will devote time and no if youll just let me explain no i cant do that i have a career i have my life suddenly my heart has sunk right down into the pit of my stomach i havent seen jenny in years i dont think i mean anything to her at all and i cant possibly do that listening to my own voice i know that what im saying is true and yet at the same time i know its not the truth but what would be that i couldnt say wed only ask that you spend some time considering it sure i will ill consider it and then the answer is still going to be no its just not something i can do doctor meier nods she stands up and moves towards the door i can tell shes bluffing that she hasnt quite given up yet well call you in a few days when youve had time to consider i guess i know myself better than doctor meier does because when she calls three days later the answer hasnt changed i didnt make jenny sick i didnt make her want to be sick i have another interview coming up and i cant be asked to abandon that for someone i barely know but i dont tell her that i dont have to explain myself only the nightmares keep coming in some way a way i dont much like it seems that jenny is still a part of me i find myself remembering more and more those months we lived together jenny has become a ghost and i dont know if i can escape her a week after my visit i phone the hospital i dont recognize the doctor who answers so i have to explain who i am the whole situation before i can finally get to saying it ive changed my mind id like to help this new doctor male and middleaged looks away from me for a moment when he looks back he says very flatly ms uleks procedure was completed yesterday morning shes due to be released at the end of the week but perhaps you could visit her in the meantime im sure she would appreciate the company i dont kid myself that i go for jennys sake doctor meier meets me at the door and shes all smiles the procedure went well she says were very optimistic she leads me through corridors again presumably in a different direction this time but its all so indistinguishable that i honestly cant tell either way we wind up at a particular door and she steps back and says ill let you go in on your own ill wait here until youre finished i wont be long take as long as you need i wont be long i dont need long im only here to say goodbye i push through the door and the room on the other side is a lot like the corridor only wider jenny is propped up in bed with some glossy magazine spread over her knees when she hears the door she glances up and looks confused for just an instant then turns her puzzled look into a smile and says hi there youve come to see me jenny how are you oh im great they cured me they found a cure if shes telling the truth then its strange because ive never seen her look this bad i cant put my finger on why because she seems as healthy as ive ever known anybody to be not only not sick but radiant with health for some reason i find myself remembering again those porcelain dolls of my grandmothers with their white skin their black eyes all of their flawed perfection for the first time i think i understand jenny not this jenny sitting in front of me with her neatlystyled hair and her faultless smile but the jenny i cared about all those years ago suddenly i want to feel sickness writhing in my gut i want decay and impurity and fever burning under my skin more than anything i want to know im alive it occurs to me that this place this clinic was never designed for living things to inhabit i look at the pristine walls dizzyingly white like the face of the sun shit i say its all so ugly jenny only smiles back at me uncomprehending its kind of boring isnt it theyve taken good care of me though yeah thats good im glad to hear that i cough and scuff my feet no longer sure how to say what i came to say then i realize its really very simple listen i had an interview a couple of days ago and welli have a job theyre flying me out to portugal next week and i really just came by to see how you were and to say goodbye thats great its what you always wanted it is isnt it suddenly im not so sure anymore still ive done what i came for not knowing what to do next i lean over and kiss jenny on the cheek her skin is astonishingly smooth my stomach revolts just for an instant goodbye i say again and she smiles and waves back as i walk out the door outside i pause to lean against the wall my thoughts are a whirlpool and my breath comes in shudders goodbye jenny i whisper one final time its not meant for the stranger in the room beyond but for that impossibly fragile girl i walked away from probably im the only one who knows to grieve her passing but a whispered farewell is all the mourning i can offer because i cant carry her in my head anymore ive got what i wanted has jenny as well shes gone through health and found something beyond something as virulent as any disease shes annihilated herself as certainly as any suicide i wonder if the doctors realize how she tricked them the silence of the asonu ursula k le guin the silence of the asonu is proverbial the first visitors believed that these gracious gracile people were mute lacking any language other than that of gesture expression and gaze later hearing asonu children chatter the visitors suspected that among themselves the adults spoke keeping silence only with strangers we know now that the asonu are not dumb but that once past early childhood they speak only very rarely to anyone under any circumstances they do not write and unlike mutes or monks under vows of silence they do not use any signs or other devices in place of speaking this nearly absolute abstinence from language makes them fascinating people who live with animals value the charm of muteness it can be a real pleasure to know when the cat walks into the room that he wont mention any of your shortcomings or that you can tell your grievances to your dog without his repeating them to the people who caused them and those who can talk but dont have the great advantage over the rest of us that they never say anything stupid this may be why we are convinced that if they spoke they would have something wise to say thus there has come to be considerable tourist traffic to the asonu having a strong tradition of hospitality the asonu entertain their visitors courteously though without modifying their own customs some people go there simply in order to join the natives in their silence grateful to spend a few weeks where they do not have to festoon and obscure every human meeting with verbiage many such visitors having been accepted into a household as a paying guest return year after year forming bonds of unspoken affection with their quiet hosts others follow their asonu guides or hosts about talking to them continually confiding their whole life stories to them in rapture at having at last found a listener who wont interrupt or comment or mention that his cousin had an even larger tumor than that as such people usually know little asonu and speak mostly or entirely in their own language they evidently arent worried by the question that vexes some visitors since the asonu dont talk do they in fact listen they certainly hear and understand what is said to them in their own language since theyre prompt to respond to their children to indicate directions by gesture to inquiring tourists and to leave a building at the cry of fire but the question remains do they listen to discursive speech and sociable conversation or do they merely hear it while keeping silently attentive to something beyond speech their amiable and apparently easy manner seems to some observers the placid surface of a deep preoccupation a constant alertness like that of a mother who while entertaining her guests or seeing to her husbands comfort yet is listening every moment for the cry of her baby in another room to perceive the asonu thus is almost inevitably to interpret their silence as a concealment as they grow up it seems they cease to speak because they are listening to something we do not hear a secret which their silence hides some visitors to their world are convinced that the lips of these quiet people are locked upon a knowledge which in proportion as it is hidden must be valuablea spiritual treasure a speech beyond speech possibly even that ultimate revelation promised by so many religions and indeed frequently delivered but never in a wholly communicable form the transcendent knowledge of the mystic cannot be expressed in language it may be that the asonu avoid language for this very reason it may be that they keep silence because if they spoke everything of importance would have been said to some the utterances of the asonu do not seem to be as momentous as one might expect from their rarity they might even be described as banal but believers in the wisdom of the asonu have followed individuals about for years waiting for the rare words they speak writing them down saving them studying them arranging and collating them finding arcane meanings and numerical correspondences in them in search of the hidden message there is no written form of the asonu language and translation of speech is considered to be so uncertain that translatomats arent issued to the tourists most of whom dont want them anyway those who wish to learn asonu can do so only by listening to and imitating children who by six or seven years old are already becoming unhappy when asked to talk here are the eleven sayings of the elder of isu collected over four years by a devotee from ohio who had already spent six years learning the language from the children of the isu group months of silence occurred between most of these statements and two years between the fifth and sixth not there it is almost ready or be ready for it soon unexpected it will never cease yes when it is very good perhaps soon hot or very warm it will not cease the devotee wove these eleven sayings into a coherent spiritual statement or testament which he understood the elder to have been making little by little during the last four years of his life the ohio reading of the sayings of the elder of isu is as follows what we seek is not there in any object or experience of our mortal life we live among appearances on the verge of the spiritual truth we must be ready for it as it is ready for us for it will come when we least expect it our perception of the truth is sudden as a lightningflash but the truth itself is eternal and unchanging indeed we must positively and hopefully in a spirit of affirmation continually ask when when shall we find what we seek for the truth is the medicine for our soul the knowledge of absolute goodness it may come very soon perhaps it is coming even now in this moment its warmth and brightness are as those of the sun but the sun will perish and the truth will not perish never will the warmth the brightness the goodness of the truth cease or fail us another interpretation of the sayings may be made by referring to the circumstances in which the elder spoke faithfully recorded by the devotee from ohio whose patience was equaled only by the elders spoken in an undertone as the elder looked through a chest of clothing and ornaments spoken to a group of children on the morning of a ceremony said with a laugh in greeting the elders younger sister returned from a long trip spoken the day after the burial of the elders sister said while embracing the elders brotherinlaw some days after the funeral asked of an asonu doctor who was making a spiritbody drawing in white and black sand for the elder these drawings seem to be both curative and diagnostic but we know very little about them the observer states that the doctors answer was a short curving line drawn outward from the navel of the spiritbody figure this however may be only the observers reading of what was not an answer at all said to a child who had woven a reed mat spoken in answer to a young grandchild who asked will you be at the big feast grandmother spoken in answer to the same child who asked are you going to be dead like greatauntie said to a baby who was toddling towards a firepit where the flames were invisible in the sunlight last words spoken the day before the elders death the last six sayings were all spoken in the last halfyear of the elders life as if the approach of death had made the elder positively loquacious five of the sayings were spoken to or in at least in the presence of young children who were still at the talking stage speech from an adult must be very impressive to an asonu child but like the foreign linguists asonu babies must learn the language by listening to older children the mother and other parents encourage the child to speak only by attentive listening and prompt affectionate wordless response the asonu live in closeknit extendedfamily groups in frequent contact with other groups their pasturing life following the great flocks of anamanu which furnish them wool leather milk and meat leads them on a ceaseless seasonal nomadic circuit within a vast shared territory of mountains and foothills families frequently leave their family group to go wandering and visiting at the great festivals and ceremonies of healing and renewal many groups come together for days or weeks exchanging hospitality no hostile relations between groups are apparent and in fact no observer has reported seeing adult asonu fight or quarrel arguments evidently are out of the question children from two to six years old chatter to each other constantly they argue wrangle and bicker and sometimes come to blows as they come to be six or seven they begin to speak less and to quarrel less by the time they are eight or nine most of them are very shy of words and reluctant to answer a question except by gesture they have learned to quietly evade inquiring tourists and linguists with notebooks and recording devices by adolescence they are as silent and as peaceable as the adults children between eight and twelve do most of the looking after the younger ones all the children of the family group go about together and in such groups the twotosixyearolds provide language models for the babies older children shout wordlessly in the excitement of a game of tag or hideandseek and sometimes scold an errant toddler with a stop or nojust as the elder of isu murmured hot as a child approached an invisible fire though of course the elder may have used that circumstance as a parable in order to make a statement of profound spiritual meaning as appears in the ohio reading even songs lose their words as the singers grow older a game rhyme sung by little children has words look at us tumbledown stumbledown tumbledown all of us tumbledown all in a heap older children cheerfully play the game with the little ones falling into wriggling piles with yells of joy but they do not sing the words only the tune vocalized on a neutral syllable adult asonu often hum or sing at work while herding while rocking the baby some of the tunes are traditional others improvised many employ motifs based on the whistles of the anamanu none have words all are hummed or vocalized at the meetings of the clans and at marriages and funerals the ceremonial choral music is rich in melody and harmonically complex and subtle no instruments are used only the voice the singers practice many days for the ceremonies some students of asonu music believe that their particular spiritual wisdom or insight finds its expression in these great wordless chorales i am inclined to agree with others who having lived a long time among the asonu believe that their choral singing is an element of a sacred occasion and certainly an art a festive communal act and a pleasurable release of feeling but no more what is sacred to them remains in silence the little children call people by relationship words mother uncle clansister friend etc if the asonu have names we do not know them about ten years ago a zealous believer in the secret wisdom of the asonu kidnapped a child of four from one of the mountain clans in the dead of winter he had obtained a zoo collectors permit and smuggled her back to his home world in an animal cage marked anamanu believing that the asonu enforce silence on their children his plan was to encourage the little girl to keep talking as she grew up when adult he thought she would thus be able to speak the innate wisdom which her people would have obliged her to keep secret for the first year or so it appears that she would talk to her kidnapper who aside from the abominable cruelty of his action seems to have begun by treating her kindly enough his knowledge of the asonu language was limited and she saw no one else but a small group of sectarians who came to gaze worshipfully at her and listen to her talk her vocabulary and syntax gained no enlargement and began to atrophy she became increasingly silent frustrated the zealot tried to teach her his own language so that she would be able to express her innate wisdom in a different tongue we have only his report which is that she refused to learn was silent or spoke almost inaudibly when he tried to make her repeat words and did not obey he ceased to let other people see her when some members of the sect finally notified the civil authorities the child was about seven she had spent three years hidden in a basement room and for a year or more had been whipped and beaten regularly to teach her to talk her captor explained because shes stubborn she was dumb cowering undernourished and brutalized she was promptly returned to her family who for three years had mourned her believing she had wandered off and been lost on the glacier they received her with tears of joy and grief her condition since then is not known because the interplanary agency closed the entire area to all visitors tourist or scientist at the time she was brought back no foreigner has been up in the asonu mountains since we may well imagine that her people were resentful but nothing was ever said postings from an amorous tomorrow corey mariani march as of this second there are people over the age of four living in the world all of whom i am intimately familiar with of these there are that i love and one that i am currently in love with in ten years when i am twenty i hope to love everyone on the planet as gordon did once for almost two minutes he is my hero allison says that gordon is a good hero and that i have a good shot at achieving my goal even though i am only ten she says networking technology gets better every month and my generations mutations allow me to assimilate the technology faster than almost anyone even gordon it feels so good to love people that i just want to love as many people as i can it usually takes me two days of being intimately familiar with someone before the red heart appears to let me know that i love them this morning the red heart appeared on yuri who lives in omsk in the province of russia i had been expecting the heart to pop up and it made me happy when it happened because yuri and i both like playing in the interactive plays and we also sometimes partner up in the interdependent puzzle games he doesnt have a dog though and i always tell him that allison says that dogs can make your empathy levels higher dad says thats probably not true but i think it doesnt hurt to have a dog anyway sometimes my dad gets mad about the dog and talks really fast to my mom about it he thinks the dog is bad for me because it will make me want to love all the animals in the world the way some other people do and that is sick and wrong i have not reached puberty yet but i am hoping that when i do i will be bisexual that way it will be easier for me to fall in love with more people allison says that they can make me bisexual if i am not naturally bisexual but that it is easier always if i am just naturally that way she also says that i shouldnt worry because every generation has more and more bisexuals in it right now i am only in love with one person and her name is cindy she has blue eyes and blonde hair and bangs and she is really pretty she is not in love with me but she does love me it makes me sad sometimes that she is not in love with me but allison says that it shouldnt make me too sad because it is very rare for people my age to be in love with anyone one time during one of my empathy lessons allison told me that i was the best student she ever had march as of this second people have died in the world since my last posting i only loved out of those i was sadder about the ones i loved more than the ones i was only intimately familiar with its sad when people die there is part of my brain that is always sad and allison says that part is like a factory turning sadness into love and empathy all the time sometimes i visit that factory when someone i love dies and it makes me have to sit down especially when the person that died had two or three of my red hearts but allison says that is normal and it means i am healthy people turned four today and i am now intimately familiar with all of them it is easy to be intimately familiar with fouryearolds because there isnt much there to be intimately familiar with i remember when i turned four and my parents took me to the clinic where they make your brain bigger when i woke up after surgery it was like being awake for the first time i only knew my parents before then and my two older brothers and my two grandmas and one grandpa but after the surgery i knew over a million people and even more than that knew me it was awesome and it wasnt hard to remember them all either i could interact with over of them at the same time now i can interact with over three million at the same time but allison says that i am not really interacting with all of them not really what most people i know and love interact with is a computer program version of me sometimes i spy on the computer program version of me it is really weird because it really acts the way i would act twice a day i download their experiences into my memory banks that is how i know so many people march i am eating pancakes that mom made me for breakfast i am eating them fast because i am almost late for school she is telling me to stop posting at the table i dont know how she always knows when i am posting she says she can tell by the look in my eyes it is okay for me to interact with almost a million people at the table but it is not okay for me to post because mom says posting is not a part of my schoolwork and she doesnt know why i do it anyway nobody at school does it and only people in the world have done it in the last thirty days i like to do it because it helps me understand my thoughts but i have to stop now mom is giving me angry looks march we learned about the dunbar number at school today the dunbar number is the number of people that you can have in your social group and still know who they all are how big the number is depends on how big your brain is the bigger your brain the more people you can know monkeys dont have very big social groups because their brains are very small a long time ago peoples dunbar number was very small too like or something and it caused a lot of fear because most of the people in the world were strangers and strangers are afraid of strangers because they dont know each other and there were lots of wars because people didnt know each other and were afraid now that everyone knows each other there are no wars and everything is okay march allison is crying i dont understand ive never seen her cry before now i feel like crying she took me to her office after class and tried to say something but she just cried instead i ask her what is wrong and she holds up her hand and cries some more as i wait for her to get done i start crying too i cant help it allison is hurting we are both crying and i dont know why crying feels awful i am scared and i am very sad march the other children and i are in a shed picking out garden tools to use as weapons i grab a rake tom and sammy and lydia get shovels and katie finds a hoe the others are finding the same type of stuff but i am not paying attention anymore because my mind is confused and i am scared and it is hard to think and make my mind unconfused when i am scared we need the weapons so we can kill nick the adults say that these garden tools will work as weapons there havent been weapons for many years because no one has needed them but now we need them because nick is a sociopath it was almost two weeks ago when allison took me to her office and started crying after she was done crying and i was done too she taught me about sociopaths and how they dont love themselves there is something bad in their genes that scientists havent been able to find yet when sociopaths look at their own profile they do not see any red hearts i have five of my red hearts in my profile which is good because allison says that if you dont love yourself then you cant love other people that is whats wrong with sociopaths allison says that our world stays together because of empathy people are always selfish and they always do things for selfish reasons but that is not bad that is just how we are made and it cannot be changed allison says people dont hurt each other because of empathy she doesnt hurt me because it would make her feel bad to do that and it would make her feel bad to do that because then she would be able to imagine my pain and she would feel that pain even though it wasnt happening to her and because she loves me that pain would feel even worse it would be like she was doing something bad to herself that was why she was crying two weeks ago because she was hurting herself through me it made her very sad to ask me and the other children to kill nick nick had stopped loving himself and that made him a sociopath and a danger to the social group he hadnt killed anyone yet but the adults could not take the chance allison said that when i was very little there was a man who stopped loving himself and became a sociopath he killed men women and children and he took over the whole province of france all by himself and made the men women and children worship him and do strange things and they called him a dictator i remember asking my dad when i was very little what the word meant and my dad pointed my mind to the sociopaths face and said that is what it means there was nothing the people of france could do about the dictator because their empathy training made it impossible for them to hurt another person the training was glued in their brains and they couldnt get it out because they were too old and their brains were too set thats when someone thought of the children whose brains had not been set and so they gave the children garden tools to kill the dictator with and that was how they saved the province of france and maybe the world now there was a new dictator rising in the subprovince of ohio and his name was nick soon he would start killing people and making the ones that lived do strange things and there was nothing the adults could do about it that was why they asked me and my classmates to pick up garden tools like the children of france allison holds the shed door open while my friends walk in and grab their weapons she looks very scared all the adults that are gathered around look very scared my parents are crying i look at them and i cannot feel sadness i cannot cry maybe i have already cried out all the tears that are in me for the last two weeks they have stopped us from taking our empathy lessons instead they flash ugly pictures in our minds the pictures do not stop and i cannot get away from them i see bodies piles of them some are being eaten by wolves and vultures some are being burned i see humans turn into bodies after a thing called a bullet is fired through their heads the change does not even take a second i see people beaten to death by lots of other people i see one man get his head chopped off it takes the other man who is doing the chopping several chops to get the thing done and the man who is getting chopped makes terrible sounds while it happens at first when the adults showed us these pictures we cried and screamed and we closed our eyes really tight because it felt like it would make them stop but it didnt one time tom started banging his head against the wall and some of the other children did too the adults had to come in and stop them after the fifth day it seemed like everyone was getting kind of used to the ugly pictures i think i know i kind of was no one screamed anymore or banged their heads against the wall we all just sat at our desks staring straight ahead everyone in the world knew what was happening everyone that i loved and who loved me was trying to interact with me and send me their love but ever since i stopped taking my empathy lessons and started seeing awful things i could barely interact with more than of them at a time i felt their love though and it made me feel better it made me feel strong i knew that what i was doing was for them because they could not do it for themselves and i knew it was for me also and so i keep posting for the people that i cannot interact with we are gathered outside of nicks house now all the parents and the teachers from the school are behind us they are crying still i am starting to have a terrible feeling about their crying i am starting to hate it i think all they do is cry my classmates and i are walking up to nicks house surrounding it holding garden tools that are meant to kill nick and all the adults do is cry katie lights nicks house on fire with some liquid that jakes dad gave us and a lighter the adults are all hoping that nick will stay inside and die without anyone having to see it i was hoping that too before but now i am hoping that nick will come out and the adults will have to watch while almost a hundred of us children beat nick to death with garden tools i want them to see something like what they made me see but that does not happen we stand there for i dont know how long a really long time and watch the house burn to the ground nick does not come out we dont even hear him scream i feel disappointed somehow i know it is wrong to feel that way but that is how i feel i am mad at the adults now more than anything it seems to me that they could have lit that house on fire just as easily as we did they didnt have to show us all of those awful things they are still crying now i want them to shut up they didnt even do anything may it has been over a month since i stood outside of nicks house and watched it and him burn now there is only one of my red hearts showing in my profile i am looking at that red heart all the time these days i am scared that it will go out but i am also not scared i wonder what will happen if it ever does go out will the adultswill my parentssend my classmates to kill me if i dont love myself anymore will i become a sociopath i really dont know sometimes i wonder if nick was ever going to kill people at all i wonder if we killed him for no reason i was intimately familiar with nick before he died he liked music a lot and he was really good at playing it on the clarinet i remember that he didnt have very many people that he loved and there werent many people that loved him mostly he played his music and he also had plants i remember that he had plants and he took care of them really well he watered them every day and he gave them special food that would make them grow big and strong and healthy i remember nick i am sad for nick i dont keep track of how many people i love anymore but i am pretty sure that it is not very many because allison is always coming up to me and asking me to talk to her in her office she is worried about me and says that i have experienced something very traumatic and that it will take time but i will heal but i dont believe her when she says that i will heal i think that she is just lying to herself because it makes her feel good i can see in her eyes that she is scared of me it makes me angry it makes me angry that she is so weak it reminds me of my parents and the weakness of all the adults that i know and i am angry that almost half of the world thinks they know me they do not know me sometimes i think of those children in the province of france that killed the dictator i think they could know me i look for them sometimes online but i cant find them i hear that they went into the hills or mountains someplace and got rid of the brains they were given when they were four now they live like humans used to live sometimes i think that i should go find them then sometimes i think that my classmates and i should go do what they did i love my classmates they know me and i know them i think they are all that keeps that red heart in my profile from blinking out cucumber gravy susan palwick i wasnt too happy when the knocking started on my door that morning nobodys welcome out here except ups and customers and i wasnt expecting any deliveries and customers have to call first new buyers have to be referred by people i know thats a rule i check references too i dont let anybody in who isnt vouched for and even so its amazing ive never had cops out here some of my buyers ask why i didnt go legit when the medicalmarijuana bill passed four years ago but thats a nobrainer i do not need the government crawling up my backside to regulate me and i have a lot more customers this way and i make a lot more money being legal would be nothing but a pain in the ass even if i didnt have to worry about keeping people from finding out about the space cucumbers as it happened my latest bunch of cucumbers was due to start singing any minute which meant the last thing i needed was somebody in the house thats another reason buyers have to call first depending on what the cucumbers are up to i tell people they have to wait i cant see them today so when the knocking started i thought shit government and my stomach tied up in a knot id have pretended i wasnt home but you can get stranded motorists out here too and the sooner you let them use your phone or whatever the sooner they go away so when i heard that knock and looked out and didnt recognize who was theresome bearded guy pushing forty about my age in jeans and a plaid shirt and hiking boots had treehugging liberal written all over himi grabbed my gun and yelled through the door who is it since it was only one guy that made cops less likely but on the other hand his car was in front of the house a nice little toyota which made mechanical failure less likely too maybe he had to use the bathroom in which case id tell him to use the desert if he needed water id give him some though you always give people water out here youd think people would know not to drive anywhere in this state without extra water in the car but between the dumb college kids from reno and the morons moving here from california the average survival iq in nevada isnt what it should be this guy was too old to be in college so i pegged him as californian local folks only drive in the desert with fourwheel drive mr whitwell smith he yelled through the door welly yeah only buyers call me welly its a kind of code im whit to everybody else not that ive talked to much of anybody else since nancy ann left who wants to know my names jim humphreys the name didnt mean anything to me im a friend of sam mortimers that name did sam used to be one of my best customers out here once a month spending big money until he suddenly stopped coming altogether about six months ago no call nothing id been wondering what happened to him not that its any of my business id almost started to think of sam as a friend id known him so long wed even gone skeetshooting on my property a few times yeah you know sam you know you have to call before you come out here sam knows that ive been trying to call for three days mr smith your phones out of order shit that was the first i knew of it i hadnt gotten any calls for three days but thats not unusual you never know when business is going to be slow and nobody else calls me but it could still be a trick you wait just a minute i hollered through the door and ran and picked up the phone dead no dial tone nothing which meant id have to get telephone repair people out here but that would have to wait until the latest batch of cucumbers was gone in the meantime i turned on my cell phone in case anybody was trying to reach me i dont like the cell phone i dont like having my conversations broadcast all over hell and gone for the government to spy on but you have to have a cell phone for emergencies just like you have to have water if you miss a customer call you could lose business okay i hollered back at the door thank you for telling me about the telephone but i cant see you today we can make an appointment mr smith i drove seventy miles to get here and this is an emergency please open the door emergency nobodyd ever used that line on me before my crop isnt addictive which is one of the things i like about it you dont get strungout dopeheads at your door whod murder their own mothers for their next fix who needs that kind of trouble i checked my watch the cucumbers were due to start singing in about thirty minutes but sometimes they go off early im never sure exactly when theyve gotten here which makes the timing tricky and that means i wasnt about to open the door if its an emergency call mr humphreys im not in that line of work welly please sams very sick he has cancer he had surgery four months ago and now hes having chemo and its making him sicker than a dog and the prescription stuff isnt working for him he says it isnt strong enough he says yours is the best he sent me out here with two hundred and fifty dollars to buy some please dont send me back to that poor man emptyhanded huh i said i wasnt surprised the government couldnt grow good plants they were probably growing oregano and charging pot prices for it you cant trust those people as far as you can throw them i started with the best stock when i got into business fifteen years ago and ive been refining it since then genetics was my favorite part of biology in high school i looked at my watch again i could run and get a quarter bag and shove it through the door and pull this humphreys cash in and it would all be over in ten seconds and if the cucumbers started up and he heard them id tell him it was the tv you wait there i called out ill be right back i ran and got a quarter bag and a paper lunch sack and put the gun on a shelf near the door where i could grab it fast if i had to but humphreys couldnt reach inside and get it and then i opened the door a crack as far as the chain would allow here i said i held up the quarter bag so he could see it and dropped it in the lunch sack you pass the money through you get this he held up a sheaf of bills and slipped them through all singles and fives jesus what had sam been thinking come to think of it a quarter bag wouldnt get him very far not given sams smoking habits but i was guessing he didnt have much money left over after the cancer hed probably been saving up since the chemo started the poor bastard and insurance wouldnt pay for mine i wondered if i should give him some extra for freehed been a very good customer for a long timebut in the meantime i started counting the bills old habits while i was counting humphreys said drily sam said you let him come into the house i could hear him more clearly now with the door open and something about his voice nagged at me he had a little bit of an accent english or aussie maybe where had i heard a voice like that lately i know sam i said no offense i finished countingit was all thereand then i handed the bag through as i did i got a good look at humphreys face for the first time and two things happened at once the first thing was that i recognized him from tv you just dont see many preachers with aussie accents feeding bag ladies on the news especially when the preacher has one deformed ear the right one all ugly and lumpy and crumpled up like a cauliflower i hadnt picked up on the ear before because id only gotten a side view of him when i looked out the window the second thing was that the cucumbers starting singing all three of them at once wails and whistles and grunts like a cross between a porno soundtrack and an orchestra of teakettles humphreys eyes widened what its the tv i said and tried to slam the door but i couldnt because hed wedged his foot in there and he was staring behind me goggleeyed when i turned to look over my shoulder i saw that one of the cucumbers had staggered out of the den away from its friends and the nice warm heaters and was hopping in pathetic circles around my living room which makes it the first time in almost ten years that a cucumbers moved from where i put it once it got into the house i was about to have a very bad day the space cucumbers started coming here a few months after nancy ann ran off i dont know why they picked this placeits just a ranch house out in the middle of nowhere halfway between reno and gerlach with nothing to look at but sagebrush and lizards and alkali dust so flat that the mountains on the horizon seem like a mirageand i never have figured out how they keep from attracting the attention of the air base in stead those bastards are government and i figure they have to have instruments that can tell if you throw a penny in the air and the cucumbers have to come in some kind of ship or come down through the atmosphere anyway and you see those air base planes and copters doing maneuvers out here all the time so i dont know why theyve never picked up on whats going on i guess the cucumbers are smarter than they are its not hard to be smarter than the government i call them space cucumbers because they look like a sea cucumber i saw onceor at least they look more like that than like anything else my parents took me on a trip to san diego when i was a kid and we went to the aquarium there they had all kinds of animals scary ones like sharks and smart ones like dolphins and whales who did tricks but for some reason the one i always remembered best was the sea cucumber it was lying in a tank of water in this kind of petting zoo they had and you could reach in and touch it it was brown and very very soft and if somebody had grabbed it and started cutting it into pieces it couldnt have fought back it didnt swim or do tricks it didnt do anything it just sat there the aquarium lady said it ate by filtering tiny bits of food out of the water it was a really boring animal and i never have known why it made such an impression on me probably because i couldnt figure out how a creature like that could survive in the ocean with sharks and lobsters and stingrays i guess sharks dont think they taste good the aquarium lady said but you could tell she didnt know either that cucumber was a mystery which is what mine are too they show up two or three at a time every five or six weeks i just open the door in the morning and there they are waiting on my welcome mat theyre much bigger than the sea cucumber in san diego about three feet tall and as thick around as a flagpole and i cant touch them because theyre wrapped in something like plastic like really thick shrink wrap or maybe thats their skin but i dont think so i think its some kind of spacesuit and the animals the thing inside the brown blobby cylindrical thing that hops along on nine stubby little legs all clustered at the bottom of the cylinder like tentacles hopping isnt easy for them you can telli dont think its how they usually move around wherever they come fromso i usually pick them up to carry them inside wherever theyre from theyve come a long way to get here and i figure if theres anything i can do to make it easier for them why not theyre always exactly air temperature or the shrink wrap is and theyre not as heavy as youd expect from their size i can just stick them under my arm like pieces of firewood when the first ones came i was terrified of course the cucumbers would have been weird whenever they showed up but nancy ann had just left and i was out of my mind with grief and anger smoking entirely too much of my own crop just to get to sleep at night i felt like i was going crazy and having space cucumbers on my welcome mat didnt help i didnt know what they were or what they wanted i didnt know if they were going to kill me or take over the planet or poison the water supply and i couldnt ask anybody because that would have gotten the government involved and even if i trusted the government i couldnt have people tramping around my house and finding the plants and grow lights and sprinklers in the basement i have one hell of a professional setup down there no way i could argue personal use even if possession werent still a felony for anybody without an approved medical condition the first time they showed up and hopped into the house i just went weak in the knees and started babbling at them trying to figure out what they wanted trying to find some way to communicate didnt work of course if they can talk or understand me when i talk i havent found any way to tell not in all these years maybe the singings some kind of language like what whales have but if so i havent figured it out yet and they never respond in any way i can tell when i say things to them that first visit they all hopped over to my wood stove and stood around it shaking and the entire fortyeight hours until they started singing i dont think i slept a wink i didnt know what they were going to do i didnt dare shoot them because i didnt want to give them an excuse to destroy the planet and anyway i could tell even then they had some kind of suit on and if i broke through it and whatever they were made of came out who knew what kind of plague id start i never have breached one of those suits they didnt do anything that first time of course not until they started singing when the noise started i got into a duckandcover position under my coffee table because i thought they were going to attack me and then when nothing happened and the singing stopped i just crouched there waiting until about half an hour later the first one liquefied on me and then within half an hour after that the other two had gone gravy too you know those gravy packets that come with some kinds of tv dinners the plastic pouches you throw into boiling water and then pull out of the pot with tongs so you can cut them open to pour the gravy out i guess some people use microwaves but i think boiling water works better anyway thats what the cucumbers look like when they liquefy giant gravy pouches theres a big sploosh and then all of a sudden where there used to be something that looked like an animal theres just brown mush if you pick up the suit then its like holding a bag of thick brown water and frankly its pretty disgusting the first time i saw it i nearly got sick and then i got even more scared wondering what would happen next nothing happened nothings ever happened after they go gravy i think theyre dead then as near as i can tell they come here to die why theyd come here i have no idea dont think i havent thought about it but ive never come up with any idea that makes sense the first few times it happened i thought theyd just crashed here or gotten stranded like motorists without water and earth had killed them somehow or i had but its been happening every five or six weeks for ten years so now i think they come here deliberately maybe this is some kind of pilgrimage for them maybe my house was built on some kind of alien shrine like area i just dont know and i could be wrong anyway maybe they arent dead at all maybe if i opened one of the suits up theyd come back to life for a while i kept some of the cucumbergravy bags stacked out where the newest ones could see them when they showed up i thought maybe theyd show me somehow what to do with them they never responded at all it was like the gravy packets werent even there dont ask me what kind of animal doesnt recognize its own dead then i kept some of those first packets down in the basement to see if theyd change over time but they didnt the suits keep whatevers inside from decomposing more i guess now i bury them ive got forty acres here i dont know what ill do when my land gets filled in go out into the desert i guess and try to find places where people wont see me places that arent likely to get developed who knows what would happen if a backhoe sliced through one of those suits none of the ones ive buried have ever gotten dug up by coyotes i guess the cucumbers dead or alive are as invisible to coyotes as they are to the government and as far as i know the government hasnt seen me digging either i dont dig any time i can see or hear planes or copters not that thats any guarantee for a while at the beginning i thought maybe the cucumbers really were invisible thought i was having hallucinations losing it over nancy ann i drove into reno a bunch of times to use the internet at the libraryi wont have a computer here because i dont trust the government not to spy on what im looking upand did research trying to find out if anyone else was reporting space aliens who looked like sea cucumbers nothing i keep checking every six months or so but if other people are getting visits ive never found any sign of it ive read about crop circles and ufo abductions and all kinds of damnfool things but never anything about singing cucumbers in plastic suits who turn into mush after a few visits i wasnt scared of them anymore theyre nothing if not predictable every five or six weeks i wake up and open the door and find a couple or three on my welcome mat ive never seen any bright lights in the middle of the night or heard anything i just open the door and there they are and they hop into the house and fortyeight hours later give or take an hour they start singing they sing for three to seven minutes and within an hour after that they go gravy sometimes i wonder what my life would be like if theyd never started coming would i still be living here would i have taken all the money ive made and moved to hawaii the way nancy ann and i always planned would i have taken that trip around the world i dreamed about when i was a kid as it is three or four times a year i take off for a week or two always right after the latest cucumbers have gone gravy i go someplace fancy someplace that might as well be a different planetnew york or new orleans or bermudaand i live it up good hotels good food highclass hookers those women like me i tip well and i treat them like human beings they dont have to worry that ill get ugly on them and i dont have to worry that theyll break my heart works out for everybody i could use nevada hookers too of course the legal ones and sometimes i do but it feels less like a vacation that way i enjoy those trips but i always come back home because i always know another batch of cucumbers will be landing on my welcome mat ive learned what they like over the years or i think i have they like heat they shake and shiver less the closer they are to the wood stove or something else warm i dont like having them in my living room for anyone to see so early on i covered up the windows in the den and got some heavyduty space heaters in there the most powerful ones i could find at home depot i figure the cucumbers wouldnt move close to things that made them shake less unless shaking less meant they were comfortable or happy so i started paying attention to what else makes them shake i feel itchy when they shake its like watching someone about to sneeze theyre happier on soft things than on the floor so i used to cover the floor of the den with pillows but then one time i had an old blackandwhite polkadot beanbag chair and the cucumber sitting on that shook less than the ones on the pillows did i experimented moving them aroundi felt fine picking them up by thenand all of them seemed to like the beanbag chair better although some of them shook a little more on it than others did they seem to have individual tastes although i cant tell them apart to look at them so i went to walmartno sense buying fancy when budget will doand bought a bunch of beanbag chairs one of them was a really ugly dayglo pink and i found out the cucumbers liked that better than the other colors so i went back to walmart but they were out of pink ones they had dayglo orange and yellow and green so i got those the cucumbers love those dayglo beanbags they seem to have different favorite colors so when they get here i have to spend some time moving them around to see which one likes which color but all of them like the dayglo chairs better than anything else the walls are another thing most of my house is decorated with penthouse pets and some playboy pictures that started as revenge after nancy ann left but i kept doing it because it makes me happy those women are even more beautiful than the hookers i hire who cant always arrange perfect lighting but the cucumbers hate those pictures once i held one up to my favorite penthouse pet as a kind of joke and that cuke started shaking like it was about to explode i tried it with a few others same thing maybe they think naked humans look repulsive the way lots of people would think the cucumbers themselves do so i drove into the library and got out a bunch of art books and started showing them pictures they dont have eyes that i can tell but if you hold a picture up to any place along the middle of the cucumber it will respond french painters thats how they voted especially matisse and monet so now ive got matisse and monet posters all over the walls of the den i think those pictures are about as exciting as watching paint dry and they seriously clash with the dayglo beanbags not that im martha stewart but when i put the cucumbers in that room now they hardly shake at all of course theres always the chance im wrong about all of it if theres anything ive learned its that you cant trust appearances even in your own species i loved nancy ann and i thought she loved me she was as beautiful as a penthouse pet and she was smart and funny and taught me how to cook i loved her even after she got religion i loved her even after she started telling me that i was going to go to hell for cursing and growing pot and reading penthouse even when she said i was possessed by the devil i figured she was saying all those mean things because she loved me too and didnt want me to go to hell and even though i didnt believe in hell and never have i tried to make her happy i didnt shut down my business of course because we needed the money if we were going to move to hawaii which was what nancy ann wanted she had expensive tastes anyway diamonds and perfume and a new sports car every couple of years she cut down on some of that stuff after she got religion ill give her that she said showiness was the sin of pride since she seemed serious about it i tried to curse less and i canceled my penthouse subscription for a while and i even went to church with her a couple of times to hear the reverend jebediah wilkins bellow about jesus and satan and hellfire and how we had to tithe to the lord if we wanted to be saved hallelujah while people nodded and moaned and said oh yes tell it brother all around us that church was the scariest thing ive ever seen much worse than space cucumbers could ever be but i tried to love nancy ann through all of it i really did and i thought she was trying to love me too and then one day i came home from a trip to town where id just bought her some of her favorite perfume because it was her birthday and she deserved something nice on her birthday even if it would have been pride any other time and i found all her things gone and a note on the kitchen table saying she wouldnt be back because shed found true love with jebediah wilkins she said shed be praying for me oh yes she would praying that id change my sinful ways before the lord struck me down and i burned in hellfire forever so naturally i was not happy to have a preacher at my front door staring at a space cucumber staggering in circles around my living room the one time ive got unwanted company and thats when the cucumbers have to go and do something different i wish i could say i handled the whole thing calmly but i didnt i flatout panicked im not sure ive ever moved that fast before i got the chain off the door and grabbed humphreys and yanked him inside and grabbed my gun off the shelf and aimed it at him the safetys still on i said raising my voice over the cucumbers singing but if you do anything funny it wont be ill blow your head off i swear to god humphreys held his hands up and tried to say something but it came out as a squeak he was shaking worse than the cucumbers ever have and i knew the cucumber behind me was too although i couldnt turn around to look because i had to keep an eye on humphreys dont ask me what i thought he was going to do go to the government or start raving about satan and try to burn my house down all i knew was that i couldnt let him leave once hed seen the cucumber and id never killed a man before and didnt want to but i had no idea how else i was going to get out of this one except that sam was expecting humphreys back with the crop and if humphreys didnt come back sam would call the police and you can see how clearly i was thinking about all i could figure was that i was doomed i couldnt see any way out that didnt involve a jail cell or worse humphreys found his voice then please he said welly dont shoot me i donti dont it occurred to me right then that if i could get that cucumber back into the den where it belonged maybe i could convince him hed just been seeing things and hed just bought a quarter bag from me which made him a felon too he wouldnt want his flock to know about that except sam preachers may be hypocrites but most of them try to hide it i had some leverage here i started calming down the cucumber in the living room stopped singing too so it was a little easier to think sit down i said right there with your back to the wall he did just slid down that wall with his hands still up and i said if you dont move youll be fine got it he nodded his eyes still big but he was watching me and the gun not the cucumber close your eyes i said and he didhe was still shaking youd better believe itand i backed up keeping the gun on him and scooped that crazy lost cucumber back under my arm so i could take it back into the den but it picked that very instant to go sploosh and humphreys eyes flew open at the extra noisei guess he couldnt help itand he saw that bag of cucumber gravy and he turned green and gulped and whatever hed had to eat that day came back up all over his lap and my carpet while he was heaving i backed up quick and opened the door to the den and tossed the gravy bag inside and slammed the door shut again i dont know if humphreys saw that or not he was busy reviewing the contents of his stomach when hed finished losing his breakfast he looked up at me his face wet the way it gets after youve thrown up and said im sorry i really am sorry ill clean it up if you bring me some soap and water and some rags never mind that i said ill clean it up myself you just get out of here reverend you get out of here and bring sam his medicine you didnt see anything unusual you hear me he shook his head what was that it wasnt anything one of the other cucumbers stopped singing and i said you havent seen or heard anything go on home now he just looked at me the third cucumber shut up so the house was very quiet all of a sudden i still had the gun trained on humphreys the safety was still on i clicked it off and said reverend you need to go home now he swallowed hed stopped shaking when he spoke again his voice was a lot calmer than it had been before mr smith ive been in front of guns before the worst you can do to me is kill me i have to know one thing thatthat creature i didnt see is it dangerous something you didnt see cant be dangerous reverend go home he shook his head again i wish that were true but its not what we pretend not to see is what harms us and if anyones in danger nobodys in danger but you reverend i was starting to panic again this guy wasnt going to let himself be convinced that the cucumber had just been his imagination as far as i know the creature you didnt see isnt dangerous to anybody now go home he just looked at me he looked very sad if its not dangerous then why did you kill it i lost it then everything piled into my head in that one instant how nancy ann had told me i was evil and how shed left me even though i tried to make her happy and all the work id done over the years to try to keep those cucumbers comfortable to keep them from shaking jim humphreys didnt understand a single goddamn thing i didnt kill it it just died thats what they do they die thats how they die theyve been coming here to die for ten years and you dont know a single thing about it but you think you know everything dont you you think those creatures are the minions of satan and you think im going to hell for taking care of them and for having pictures of naked women on the walls and for selling pot and you think you can come in here and welly he said he sounded like id hit him over the head with one of those beanbag chairs welly if i thought you were going to hell for selling marijuana why would i have come here to buy some for sam how do i know so you could preach to me about it so you could preach to sam and tell him hes going to hell he probably confessed that hed been smoking because hes dying and scared for his soul because you people have your hooks in him just like you got them into my wife i bet you smoke yourself dont you i bet you stand up every sunday and preach about how drugs are a sin and everybody has to give you their money so theyll be saved and then you come out here and spend that money on pot for yourself all those fives and singles came from the collection plate didnt they little old ladies giving you their last dollar and then you turn around and spend it on its sams money jim humphreys said the marijuanas for him welly you can call and ask him i have a phone in the car im not done i said you just listen to me it felt awfully good to yell at him like that to have a man on the floor in front of me and to be able to point a gun at him and tell him exactly what i thought of him and have him not be able to do anything about it it felt better than anything had felt in a long time i know about you people dont think i dont i know how you ministers act in the pulpit trying to scare ordinary folks who are just trying to get by and do the best they can and then you turn around and you run off with peoples wives after youve had the goddamned fucking nerve to make all that noise about the devil your kind think theyre better than the rest of the world dont they dont they reverend you think you can tell me everything about who i am and how i should live my life like youve got god in your pocket your people think that all they have to do to be saved is to put somebody else down my people said jim humphreys very quietly believe in welcoming all strangers as christ i squinted at him because i couldnt believe how calm he was and he said even strangers who arent human i dont think i need to tell you anything about that welly i think youve been welcoming strangers as christ forwhat did you say ten years and if youre doing a better job with them than youre doing with me well thats because you think im not a stranger you think you know who i am but youre wrong welly im a stranger too i was ashamed then of how good id felt when i was yelling at him and then i got angry again because hed made me ashamed which was what nancy ann and jebediah had always tried to do high and mighty arent you i bet you think im the scum of the earth i think youre scared he said i think that if i were in your place id be scared too and i think it must be awfully hard having to watch things die like that for ten years without being able to talk to anybody about it i got a lump in my throat when he said that it shocked me because i hadnt cried since nancy ann left and i was damned if i was going to start in front of this preacher its not like that i said its not like i know them they all look the same and they all die the same way and i dont know how to talk to them this is where they come and i do the best for them i can but i dont get attached reverend so dont get all sentimental he smiled sitting there on the floor in his own puke all right i wont but would you mind if i cleaned up the floor here kicking him out hadnt worked i might as well let him clean up his own mess go on i said and used the gun to wave him into the kitchen bucket and rags are under the sink i watched while he filled the bucket with soapy water and carried it back into the living room and knelt down and cleaned up the mess he did a good job he was careful about it when he was done he took everything back into the kitchen and rinsed it all out and then he put a little clean water in the bucket and turned around and looked at me welly id like tomay i visit your guests may i see them what the hell he knew too much already i wasnt going to get anywhere by trying to keep it from him and i was starting to be curious about what hed think of them frankly and i guess i wanted him to see that i wasnt just killing them hed struck a nerve there i didnt even know i had i looked at my watch we had twentyfive minutes before the others went gravy max if they hadnt already i didnt know what had gotten into the one who ran into the living room maybe it was crazy or extra sick or maybe the cucumbers were about to start pulling new tricks on me in which case i couldnt count on anything i dont know if the others are still alive i said they may have gone grthey may have died while we were out here when they sing like that it means theyre going to die pretty soon so they may look like that other one now im just warning you thank you he said i think ill be fine now so i took him into the den it was way too hot in there with the space heaters but thats how the cucumbers like it i still had the gun with me just in case humphreys tried to pull something the other two cucumbers were still solid id never taken a gun into the den before and i was a little worried about how theyd respond if theyd start shaking again but they didnt even seem to notice jim humphreys had a plan you could tell he didnt pay attention to anything in that room except those two solid cucumbers he got down on his knees right away and started muttering and waving his hands over the water in the bucket then he dipped his hand in the water and used it to make a sign of the cross on each cucumberwhich was awfully brave really since it had taken me months to be comfortable touching them but i guess hed seen that i was okay after picking that other one upand mumbled some more look at you i said i didnt know whether to be impressed or disgusted you talk about welcoming all strangers as christ and here you are trying to do an exorcism he looked up at me looking shocked oh no then he looked a little sheepish emergency baptisms although its somewhat the same thing he rocked back on his heels and stood up and said now what i shrugged now nothing now they havei checked my watchmaybe fifteen minutes left he looked at his watch too may i wait here with them would that be all right i dont see why not i said he nodded and sat down on the floor and i sat on the polkadot beanbag chair all right reverend you tell me this if all strangers are christ already why do they have to be baptized humphreys smiled you should be a theologian thats a good question mainly because its what i know how to do and it makes me feel better huh you think itll do them any good i have no idea i dont see how it can hurt them he looked around the room then up at the walls and raised his eyebrows matisse they like matisse or i think they do dont ask me reverend i dont know a damn thing i do this and i do that and i find chairs i think they like and i say theyre dying but i could be wrong about all of it theyre not from around here theyre not dogs or cats theyre not the same kind of animal we are at all i try to keep them still and happy but maybe when theyre still that means theyre in pain maybe ive been torturing them all this time without meaning to maybe theyre invading earth and im the one making it possible and in another ten years all these dead aliens are going to come back to life and take over the world he listened to me his face still and serious yes its hard isnt it not knowing if were doing the right thing i dont think any of us ever know not really we do the best we can and we pray to do more good than harm but we have to trust god to see it all and to sort it all out and to forgive us when we go wrong i looked away from him i dont believe in god no offense none taken welly good what happened to your ear i saw you on tv feeding those bag ladies thats how i knew who you were when i saw your ear its a birth defect my family didnt have enough money for plastic surgery he shrugged i used to keep my hair long to hide it but it doesnt bother me anymore its a help in my work frankly people bring their scars to church they bring the wounds they want healed but theyre ashamed of them too if they can see mine that makes it easier ill just bet i said nancy ann had a little scar on the inside of her left thigh high up it was a birthmark too like humphreys ear it didnt take jebediah very long to see that one did it the second cucumber went sploosh just then and humphreys and i both jumped a little humphreys didnt puke this time he got back on his knees and made another sign of the cross and muttered some more when he was done i picked up that gravy bag and put it in the corner with the other one the one id tossed back into the den from the living room and then humphreys and i sat back down to wait for the third cucumber to go gravy five minutes now why do you suppose they come here he asked me damned if i know maybe theyre sick and their people send them away so they wont infect everybody else maybe theyre dead already when they get here and earths their eternal reward now thats scary isnt it maybe when we die were all going to land on some aliens doorstep and we just have to hope theyll have comfortable chairs for us and find out what kind of art we like my heaven will have layzboy recliners and penthouse pets but i wasnt going to tell humphreys that he smiled in my fathers house are many mansions what but the last cucumber went sploosh so i never did find out what humphreys had been talking about he did his little praying routine again and i piled the third cucumber in the corner with the other two he looked at the gravy bags and then at me how do youwhat do you do with them afterwards i bury them ive got these things all over my property he nodded do you need help if youre as good with a shovel as you are with a pail i could use the help reverend thank you so we piled the gravy bags into my pickup and i threw a tarp over them and loaded up a couple of shovels and then i drove out to the next gravesite ive been keeping track of where the cucumbers are so i can pick a fresh place each time i brought the gun with me but that was in case we ran into snakes or something i wasnt worried about humphreys anymore not that way he was good with a shovel strong and fast he hadnt always been a preacher you could tell hed done manual labor someplace watching him dig i started to get curious when we stopped to take a break i said so when were you in front of guns before in africa he wiped the sweat off his face in zaire back during the eighties a group of us were rebuilding a church mobutus thugs had burned it down because the clergy were speaking out against the government and the soldiers came when we were rebuilding and they lined us up against a wall and threatened to shoot us all i still dont know why they didnt they killed plenty of other people before and after that his eyes got far away then and he said all the people i worked with theretheyre all dead now thats not right i said no he started digging again and i let him i know how working with your hands can help when youre upset about something i reroofed the house all by myself after nancy ann left we got the cucumbers neatly buried one to a grave and humphreys said a little prayer over each one and then we got back into the truck to go back into the house i was worried i had to figure out what to do about him and it would have been easier if hed been easier to hate reverend i said you were right before im scared about what will happen if people find out about whats been going on out here im not going to tell them he said this is under the seal of clerical confidentiality welly i take that very seriously i didnt know if i could believe him or not i wanted to but thats not the same thing i just hope i can trust you reverend i hope youll learn that you can i cant expect you to yet youve only known me a few hours earning trust takes longer than that i grunted that was a better answer than a lot of other people would have given well listen you let me know when sam dies he may not die not for a long time we have to hope the chemo will work we have to hope hell be healed but if he dies certainly ill call you humphreys smiled hell be having a church service i have to warn you call me anyway we were back at the house i stopped the truck and said you left that bag inside didnt you yes i did wait here ill get it for you ill be right back out the paper lunch sack was still sitting in the hallway next to where humphreys had gotten sick it was wet from the soapy water hed used i threw the old sack away and got a fresh one and then for good measure i threw another eighth into the plastic bag i knew sam would notice and that kind of gestures good for business if you dont do it very often i guess it was my way of gambling that hed stay alive and if he mentioned it to humphreys maybe the reverend would be more likely to keep his mouth shut i took the sack back out and handed it to humphreys i have something for you too he said and gave me his business card call me if you ever want to talk about anything at all you can call me any time both my home number and the church number are on there kind of you i said although i was thinking when hell freezes over thank you reverend youre welcome welly he held out his hand and i shook it and then he got back into his car and drove away i watched his car until it disappeared and then i went back into the house i almost threw the business card away but something made me toss it into one of my kitchen drawers instead dont ask me what it wasnt like i planned on calling him it was just a superstitious thing maybe like what hed said about the emergency baptisms having his business card probably wasnt going to help me but it couldnt hurt either i was hot from all that digging i opened the fridge and got out a beer and drank it down in one gulp then i got my cell phone and took it into the living room and sat back in my recliner and started dialing the phone company black fire tanith lee witness a one i first see it as im driving back that night up the roadyou can bet i pulled over i thought it was a fucking plane coming down like a plunge of flames right through the sky as if the sky was tearing open from the top to the bottom the car slams to a halt and i jump outand im below the top of the hill so i run the rest of the way and just as i get there this thing whatever it was it lands in the woods well our house is around there me and hers only a mousehousewhat she saidmidterrace in the last street winds out the village i stand on the hill sort of frozen sort of turned to stone and i hold my breath the way like you do not knowing youre not breathing so while i watch all this firething just storms into and through the trees and down and it hits the ground and i think somethings crazy then because there should be a godawful great bang yeah and great columns of fire and crap but there aint a sound not a bloody whisper and then i remember and i take that missing breath but its so quiet i think thats what struck me anyhow even while i run up the hill theres always some kind of noise out here i mean were not that far from the town and theres animals too foxes and things snuffling and screeching and cars only there isnt a single sound now i dont never drink when i drive not no more i got pulled over a couple years ago random check and i was just over the limit half a glasswell a pintof beer but i wont take any chance now so nobody can say i imagined what i seen go on you can test me if you like no i see it and i see what come after too witness e one he was late hes always late thats what they says about dead people dont they well then he must be dead oh hes got some bint where he works says he hasnt hes got some anyhow i was washing my hair and this blinding like light sort ofi thought it was coming straight in the bleeding window i thought it was a bomb you knowa dirty bomb like they always go on about terrorists why does everyone hate everyone so i runs out in the garden and i look and this big lightits like the skys falling and its all on fireonly the fire is it isnt red or nothing itsi cant describe it really right in the wood i started to cry i was really scared and he werent there the bugger but theres no crash nothing justsilence you know that thing someone saidhear a pin drop like that and my hairs so wetbut i shakes it back and i thought i can go next door but the other three houses there as we come like out of the village no one lives in them now and then i sees him this guy hes walking out between the trees int he just walking witness a one fucking car wouldnt start would it when i goes back to it so i beats it up the fucking hill again and belts down the other side toward the house i mean im thinking of her arent i yeah i mean you do dont you witness e one it wasnt just he was well fit i mean he was fit i can see that like and like hes reallyhes beautiful and im standing there in my old jeans and an old bra and no slap on and my hair full of shampoo but hes got a sort of like hes sort of shining its likewhats that stuff phosbrosis it he gleams only hes dark too i dont mean hes a black guy his skin is just kind of like summer tan sort of like hes caught the sun but over here not a real tan and his hair is black but its so long all down his back its like silk and he has this face i dont think much of them movie celebs do you but this guy hes like in films my mum used to watch before she went mad and ended up in loonyvillei cant think who but he comes out the wood and up to the garden where the dustbin is and the broken gate and he looks at me i say dyou see that flaming thing come down and he smiles at me witness a two coming home on that train its always late and no trolly service i dread the damn thing but when i finally got to the station what do you think the shit volvo wont start will it so i walked perfect ending to a perfect day etc thats when i saw those fireworks all showering down on everything i admit i stopped and stared i mean i was recollecting that factorygod where was itthat place where all the fireworks blew up the only difference was and i eventually figured it out these fireworks were all in a mass just dropping in one single area they merely fell out of the sky glittering the rather peculiar thing was there were no colors it was quite a naturally welllit nightaside from the inevitable street lamp lightpollutiona half moon and stars and this fountain of fireworks looked somehow much darker they werethe nearest i can get is something like black sequins those kind of gowns sexy women wore in the forties of the last century anyway i started to walk again because even when the fountain hit the bloody houses on my street which i could see from up there on the far side of the park there wasnt any thudding noise no detonations you get so anxious now its how they want to make you isnt it all these warnings id been thinking ever since the trouble years ago i ought to relocate just work from home but its difficult my partner she likes the high life frankly and her own job shes a sort of pa simply doesnt cover the rent it took me an hour to get back on foot i steeled myself and didnt stop off at the kings arms i thought she might be worried sometimes i can be such a bloody fool by the time i reached the house the pyrotechnics were long gone it was just this incredibly silent night i noted that you see it struck me how dead quiet it was when i unlocked the door there seemed to be no one about that was unusual shes usually around even if shes asleep in front of the tv with an empty vodka bottle i called out i remember i called her namehoney im home sort of rubbish but no answer i felt fed up i was tired out and hungry i admit i felt unloved childish stupid but im trying to tell you the truth then i thought i heard a noise upstairs had she gone up to bed early no care for me get my own fucking meal even though shed been home all day or was she ill she gets migraines sometimesor she says she she said she did i went upstairs this i cant really explain i walked quietly maybe only because it really was so quiet not a sound even when id passed the pub now i come to think of it quiet aswell is even a grave so quiet upstairs the dimmer was on all the lights half doused then i did hear something then i heard it again through the bedroom door our bedroom this cry you cant mistake a cry like that unless of course you never ever heard it before witness a one i runs the last bit im getting really scared even though thered been no bang nor nothing i mean the house lights were all out when i gets there i nearly has a heart attack because the front door is standing wide open no lightno one in the lounge i say loungesize of a kitchen tablenowhere else though upstairs in the tiny little mouse room we called our bedroom i hear a long wild wailing noise and i fucking know that noise its her fetching off like they say its sex i thought hang on maybe shes just fixed herself me not being there then i know then i run upstairs fast as i could sounded like an elephant to myself in all the quiet when i pushed the door open there they are her and him there they are witness e two he rang the door bell i think that was it he must have done so i opened the door it wasnt that late anyway i was bored the utter rubbish on tv id been going to check the washingmachine because suddenly it seemed so silent that presumably itd packed up with all my gear in it oh and his favorite three shirtsunforgiveable i thought id seen a kind of flash in the sky earlier but im always seeing things in the sky altogether in the past two years ive seen six unidentified flying objects everyone laughs at me but i did anyway standing outside the door is this entirely gorgeous man there is no other way to describe him he looks likeoh god knows too good to be true no i dont remember what he was wearing yes id been drinking i always mean to cut down never do it when im at work but sometimes well but not that much i mean i could see he was so beautiful and he said here you are and he smiled this wonderful smile no not charismatic nothing so clichéd you looked at him and i fell in love with him on sight i fell in love with him can i stop now i need some water please witness e three wed been going to go up to the ridge there was supposed to be a meteor shower he said so were both very interested in that sort of thingspace you know he has a wonderful collection of meteor bitsdark fusion crust really special wed only been together a year it was awful when he lost his job but luckily i still have mine very luckily as it turns out i mean its just boring office work but ill still need a job wont i or not for a bit perhaps anyway we set off quite early around sunset it was lovely the light sinking over the fields and the birds singing i know the songs are only territorial their way of saying keep out to other birds i never knew that till he explained it to me i just thought they sang because they could do it so well the ridge is the highest open place for miles we sat down and looked at the dark coming and then all the lights coming on all round the two towns and the city to the north and the little villages you can never go far here without seeing people or signs of them it got dark then the moon was already quite far over to the west though still high enough to make the upper sky that deep night blue lots of stars we didnt see anything for a long time then this thing just erupted out of the zenith he jumped up we both did its a fireball he shouted my godits colossal it seemed to be falling straight on us but somehow neither of us could move then i remember being aware of turning as if i were being turned not doing it myselfand our shadows peeling out jet black behind us and then realizing the meteor was rushing down to the south in front of us not directly on to our heads he started to run he was running after it he didnt wait for me or even call to me i suppose he just thought id do exactly what he did id be so desperate to see but i was scared you know i mean it was so big and blazing brightand yet so dark i didnt know you could have fire like that black fireit must be a phenomenon associated with certain types of extraterrestrial objects so hed sprinted off and the fireball went down on the land and thenno shock wave no soundit just went out like a blown candle like that my legs had gone to jelly i had to sit down i thought hed be all right after all nothing had exploded or was burning what a coward i was and he was so brave hed really tell me off perhaps i could get up and follow him in a minute pretend id fallen over something as i ran then i noticed how completely quiet everything was nothing is ever that quiet ive been out with him enough nights to know animals move about there is the distant hum of traffic from the motorway or a plane even trees sort of settle and even the quietest flick of breeze moves the leaves and i could see the leaves on trees moving a little so the silence was just for me somehow id been closed in some sort of bubble of soundlessness then i stood up and then he spoke to me i mean him the man thei mean him he said are you here i said who are you where did you come from and he smiled he was so wonderful to look at long black hair he worei cant remember just ordinary clothes i expect because in fact he couldnt have been at all what he seemed it was a sort of illusion he could create just the way they do it in sf movies cgiin dr who for instance because he must be an alien a species from beyond this world i was terrified but then he touched me no im all right this isnt my blood witness a four i slung the door open and i ran straight at them they were by the wall no need to guess what hed been doing with her she just looked sad that was all she didnt even protest and hewell must have slipped out the side door while i was seeing to her mustnt he bastard he never even tried to stop me is she going to be okay no all right yes witness e seven of course i never want him near me again after what he did sure weve been married three years so what yes ill press charges look at me i dont remember yes there was another bloke a strangerso so what i dont remember i must have done dept rupsub x ps my profoundest apologies that the enc document did not accompany the coded transcript of this report here then belatedly it is i have to add at this point that whether it will shed any light of logic on the recorded eyewitness reports already deciphered and in your hands remains to be seen those of us here are frankly baffled i will refer to that again at the end of the enc document docu six six six on the night of the july see transcript a number of emergency calls began to be relayed to this department they involved urgent requests for all emergency services police paramedics and in some cases firefighters the peculiar feature of all these callouts was the basic similarity of the claims of all the participants each seemed to involve an episode which though variable mentioned similar events and actions and significantly one particular male person as described in the transcripts a youngish man tall and slimly built having very long dark hair and dark eyes all the living victimssome were no longer alive and even those who did not regard themselves as victimizedwere in a range of states representing shock paranoid rage or extreme exhilaration all reported a fundamentally similar scenario despite other countless unlike details however the occurrences took place on the same evening and across the length and breadth of england while the times too varied incidents began quite early in the evening and continued to surface until midnight it is evidentially impossible the same darkhaired man the main suspectwe use this term for want of anothercould have appeared in so many widely disseminated areas during so brief a time period i will add so far we have been entirely unable to trace him in this country or elsewhere this is partly due no doubt to the lack of any recoverable dna or other clue left behind with the subjects of his visits also although sightings of ufos are not uncommon on this particular night no one apart from the people directly involved called in with any queries about a fiery falling object whether thought to be a meteor a spaceship or a light aircraft no unusual reports either of an electric storm or alarming fireworks display the enclosed transcript relays to you only a sample of the huge group of persons who were subsequently interviewed initially by the police of the ambulance service and later on by ourselves it is a sample of the most typical reports of which in total there are to date some six hundred and sixtysix this number may of course not arouse any disquiet in the mind of a modern atheist nevertheless i am afraid in order to preserve for the victims where feasible a modicum of the anonymity the law currently prescribes we have perhaps frivolously labeled each and all of them not by an actual name but by the letter a in the case of males and e in the case of females plus a differentiating numberone two etc you may soon be aware why the letters a and e alone have been selected and we trust you will overlook any perceived levity on our part a stands for the biblical adam naturally and e for eve his ribcreated partner as i have said we have not here included every single eyewitness account but rendered for your consideration the most predominantly recurrent statements that is those most representative from all the six hundred and sixtysix interviews we were able to garner of those individuals resultantly dead or in a condition likely to lead to deathboth male and femalewe do not yet have conclusive figures the ultimate consequences of this replicated event remain so far unpredictable we shall be very glad to receive your input on this matter to accept it at apparent religious facevalue would seem shall we say grotesque but to ignore so widespread a phenomenon likewise itself poses many problems code seal and signature attached appendage psx my last thought is i confess is this really then what is meant by science fiction or more disquietingly was it always i direct your attention to the final words of the final included witness witness a two im very sorry i did that to her yes i know she wont speak to me i cant see her yes ive never done anything like that before i cant describe it cant you try to fucking understand she was lying on the bed with him she was naked he washe was inside her she was holding him in her arms i couldnt handle it you didnt see and there was this light in the room like a sort of bloody gilding the whole scene looked like a pornographic oil painting from the italian renaissance i dont remember what he looked like just another man some kid twenties maybe god knows he just moved away from her there was something then he waswhat whatsinuous something sinuous about how he moved that i do remember he moved like a trained dancer an athleteno like an animal like a big cat a panther or a snake i know i hit her im sorry i never did anything like that before with anyone no it wasnt really because shed fucked him it was what she said she said i can see inside you witness e two yes i could i could see all through him through everything no i cant explain i would if i could wouldnt i i mean all this fucking talk this interrogation when im covered in bruises and im still pretty articulate arent iokay if not very pretty ha ha i dont know now what it was it was as if i knew everything there was to know the heights the depths yesterday tomorrow the beginning the endoh shit i need the plastic thingthe bowlits your fault all these questionsget the fucking sick bowl before i throw up all over witness a one she gets off of the bed and she says to me i seen the stars thats what she says she doesnt meani dont know whati know what i dont know what to do do i i turn to him like a fucking dope but somehow hes not there no more but theres something i can feel it too theres this ringing in my head and this terrific smell a good smellno not good cant be can it but its clean sweetonly its drowning me i suppose she called you or someone thats all i remember mate the lot but i wont forget none of it and i aint been drinking i told you test me witness e three it was like looking through glass you know a glass case perhaps you can see everything so clearly but you cant touch it if you try you trigger the alarm but i do remember there was a tree it was very tall dark but golden both at once we were lying high up in it and there was this beautiful scentno more of a taste really witness e twentyfour he said to me you are here and then we made love it was never like that before wont ever be again i saw into this huge light only it was black a black light and for a moment just after my climax i knew that i was god i know this sounds insane but i dont think im insane it was only for a moment witness a one im afraid of her now dont want to see her again dont want to see any of you neither i wish youd all fuck off witness e three when he came running back the alien manmy loverwas gone but i suppose it must have been obvious to him i mean the man i lived with i wasnt in any tree at all but lying there on the ridge naked i must have lookedwell i suppose it was obvious it was to him he began to shout and yell at me he seemed to be speaking in another language but i could see right through the universe start to finish even if it was behind glass im such a coward normally ive said havent i but when he ran at me his first blow never even touched me i drove my knee into his stomachno lets be truthful into his genitals and i ripped at his eyes i am terribly sorry i understand he may lose his right eye but i knew he might have killed me otherwise and frankly i think you know that too dont you when i hurt him i felt nothing or rather all i could feel was what id felt when the alien had sex with me this incredible blissful opening to all things in the most amazing way and that lovely delicious scent i can still smell it that taste of fresh cut apples the elephants of poznan orson scott card in the heart of old poznan the capital of great poland since ancient times there is a public square called rynek glowny the houses around it arent as lovely as those of krakow but they have been charmingly painted and there is a faded graciousness that wins the heart the plaza came through world war ii more or less intact but the communist government apparently could not bear the thought of so much wasted space what use did it have public squares were for public demonstrations and once the communists had seized control on behalf of the people public demonstrations would never be needed again so out in the middle of the square they built a squat ugly building in a brutally modern style it sucked the life out of the place you had to stand with your back to it in order to truly enjoy the square but wed all seen the ugly building for so many years that we hardly noticed it anymore except to apologize to visitors ruefully remember the bad old days of communism and appreciate the irony that the occupants of such a tasteless building should include a restaurant a bookshop and an art gallery and when the plague came and the city was so cruelly and suddenly emptied those of us who could not let go of poznan who could not bear to eke out the last of our lives in the countryside drifted to the old heart of the city and took up residence in the houses surrounding the square as time passed even the ugly building became part of the beauty of the place for it had been part of the old crowded city now lost forever just as the toilets with little altars for the perusal of ones excrement reminded us of the many decades of german overlordship so this building was also a part of our past and now by its sheer persistence among us a part of ourselves if we could venerate the bones and other bodily parts of dead saints couldnt we also find holiness of a kind even in this vile thing it was a relic of a time when we thought we were suffering but to which we now would gladly return just to hear schoolchildren again in the streets just to see the flower shop once more selling the bright excesses of overcopious nature spots of vivid color to show us that poland was not by nature grey into this square came the elephants a group of males making their way in what seemed a relentless silence except that a trembling of the windows told us that they were speaking to each other in infrasound low notes that the human ear could not hear but the human hand could feel on glass of course we had all seen elephants for years on our forays out into the gardens of suburban poznanclans of females and their children following a matriarch gangs of mature males hanging out to kill time until one of them went into musth and set off in search of the nearest estrous female we speculated at first about where they came from whether their forebears had escaped from a zoo or a circus during the plague but soon we realized that their numbers were far too great to be accounted for that way too many different clans had been seen on radio day we learned from those few stations that still bothered that the elephants had come down the nile swum the suez swarmed through palestine and syria and armenia crossed the caucasus and now fed in the lush wheat pastures of ukraine bathed in the streams of belarus and stood trumpeting on the shores of estonia and pomerania calling out to some god of the sea demanding passage to lands as yet unpossessed by the great stumpy feet the probing noses the piercing ivory and the deep thrumming music of the new rulers of the world why should they not rule it we were only relics ourselves we who had had the misfortune of surviving the plague out of every hundred thousand only fifty or a hundred had survived and as we scavenged in the ruins as we bulldozed earth over the corpses we dragged from the areas where we meant to live as we struggled to learn how to keep a generator or two running a truck here and there the radios we used only once a week then once a month then once a year we gradually came to realize that there would be no more children no one conceived no one bore the disease had sterilized us almost all there would be no recovery from this plague our extinction had not required a celestial missile to shatter the earth and darken the sky for a year no other species shared our doom with us we had been taken out surgically precisely thoroughly a tumor removed with a delicate viral hand so we did not begrudge the elephants their possession of the fields and the forests the males could knock down trees to show their strength there was no owner to demand that animal control officers come and dispose of the rampaging beasts the females could gather their children into barns and stables against the winter blast and no owner would evict them only the crumbling bones and strands of hairy flesh showed where horses and cattle had starved to death when their masters died too quickly to think of setting them free from their stalls and pens why though had these males come into the city there was nothing for them to eat there was nothing for us to eat when our bicycles gave out and we could cobble together no more makeshift carts we would have to leave the city ourselves and live closer to the food that we gathered from untended fields why would the elephants bother with such a ruin curiosity perhaps soon they would see that there was nothing here for them and move on we found ourselves growing impatient as the hours passed and the days and still we kept encountering them on the city streets didnt they understand that we lived in the heart of poznan specifically because we wanted a human place didnt they feel our resentment of their trespass all the rest of earth is yours can you not leave undesecrated these crypts we built for ourselves in the days of our glory gradually it dawned on usdawned on me actually but the others realized i was rightthat the elephants had come not to explore poznan but to observe us i would pedal my bicycle and glance down a cross street to see an elephant lumbering along on a parallel path i would turn and see him behind me and feel that shuddering in my breastbone in my forehead that told me they were speaking to each other and soon another elephant would be shadowing me seeing where i went watching what i did following me home why were they interested in us humans were no longer killing them for their ivory the world was theirs we were going to diei who was only seven years old when the plague came am now past thirty and many of the older survivors are already if not at deaths door then studying the travel brochures and making reservations their bibles open and their rosaries in hand were these males here as scientists to watch the last of the humans to study our deathways to record the moment of our extinction so that the elephants would remember how we died with only a whimper or less than that a whisper a sigh a sidelong glance at god i had to know for myself for my own satisfaction if i found the truth whom else would i tell it to and for what purpose they would only die as i would die taking memory with them into the fire into the ash into the dust i couldnt get any of the others to care about the questions that preyed upon me what do the elephants want from us why do they follow us leave it alone lukasz they said to me isnt it enough that they dont bother us and i answered with the most perplexing question of all to me at least why elephants the other wild animals that roamed the open country were the ones one might expect to see the packs of dogs gone wild interbreeding back to mongrel wolfhood the herds of cattle breeding back to hardiness and of horses quick and free and uninterested in being tamed the companions of man the servants and slaves of man now masterless now free unshorn sheep unmilked goats suddenleaping housecats scrawny wild chickens hiding from evervigilant hawks illtempered pigs rooting in the woods the boars making short work of dogs that grew too bold that was the wildlife of europe no other animals from africa had made the journey north only the elephants and not just from africathe elephants of india were roaming the orient and on the most recent radio day we learned through messages relayed many times that they had somehow crossed the bering strait and were now in ever greater numbers grazing the prairies of america smalleared cousins to the greatcanopied beasts that now shadowed us on the streets of poznan i pictured them swimming or piling onto boats that some last human pilot guided for them onto the stygian shore they had inherited the earth and were bent on surveying their new domain so i took to spending my days in the library reading all i could about elephants and then about all the processes of life all the passages of history trying to understand not only them but ourselves and what had happened to us and what our cities might mean to them our houses our streets our rusting cars our collapsing bridges our sorry cemetery mounds where winter brought fresh crops of human bone to the surface white stubble on a fallow field i write this now because i think i know the answers or at least have found guesses that ring true to me though i also know they might be nothing more than a man hungry for meanings inventing them where they dont exist arguably all meanings are invented anyway and since i have no one to please but myself and no one to read this who will care except perhaps one then i may write as i please and think as i please and reread this whenever i can bear it they made no effort to follow me inside the library what good would it do them clever as they were with their inquisitive trunks i could imagine them being deft enough to turn pages without tearing them but what would the markings on the pages mean to them elephants sang their literature to each other in octaves we humans could not hear their science was the science of the temporal gland the probing nose they observed butor so i thoughtdid not experiment i did learn enough to warn the others before the first of the males went into musth when you see one of them acting agitated when his temporal glands pour out a steady black streak down his cheeks when the other males are shy of him and give him room then we must do the same staying out of his way not meeting his gaze let him pass the city is his wherever he wants to go he wont stay here long in musth he must go and find a female then and they were all outside in the open fields he would give his deep rumbling call and pour out his lusty scent into the air and dribble musky fluid onto the ground where every other elephant could smell it and know this way passed a male bent on making babies this way passed god looking for the holy virgin so we studied each other and avoided offending each other and grew used to each others ways the elephants and the fifty remaining residents of poznan and then one day they began to push the males all gathered in the public square we too gossiping to each other that something important was going to happen gathered in our houses and leaned at our windows to watch they wandered aimlessly through the square eleven of themthe twelve apostles i thought sans iscariotuntil noon made the smallest shadows then as if of one mind they surrounded the ugly old communist building facing it when all were in place they moved forward slowly each bull resting his massive brow against the miserable façade then slowly each began to tense his muscles to shift his weight to make little adjustments to plant his feet and then to push with greater and greater strength against the wall theyre trying to push it down i realized and so did the others all of us calling out to each other in our highpitched human voices theyre critics of architecture theyve come to beautify poznan we began to address the elephants with our calls as if they were our football team as if the plaza were a playing field we cheered them laughed in approval shouted encouragement placed meaningless bets about whether they could actually break through the walls then abruptly i was no longer part of the playfulness for without meaning to i changed perspective suddenly and saw us as the elephants must have seen us this was africa after all and we were the primates perched in the trees hooting and screeching at the giants unaware of our own insignificance or at least unbothered by it when i pulled my head back inside my window i was filled with grief though at that moment i could not have told you why i thought at first it was because we humans were so diminished reduced to chattering from safe perches but then i realized that the human race had always been the same had never risen really from our primate ways no what i was grieving for was that ugly old building that relic of noble dreams gone sour i had never lived under communism had only heard the stories of the russian overlords and the polish communists who claimed to be fulfilling the will of the masses and perhaps sometimes believed their own propagandaso my father told me and i had no reason to doubt him when the communists decided what was good and what was bad they acted as rigidly as any puritan aesthetic concerns in architecture led to wasteful overspending of the labor of the working class therefore the ugliness of all new buildings was a badge of virtue we human beings had reinvented ourselves homo sovieticus homo coprofabricus or whatever the scientific name would be a new species that never guessed how quickly it would be extinct the elephants would keep pushing until the walls came downi knew that intransigence was built into the elephants shoulders the way screeching and chattering were built into the primate mouth and even though the other humans were cheering them egging them on i was sad no wistful if we had really wanted that ugly building taken down we knew where the dynamite was kept we could have blown it out of existence elephants are mighty and strong as beasts go but when it comes to destruction their foreheads are no match for the explosives in the locked sheds at the construction sites of buildings that will never be finished we dont need you to take it down you meddlers i wanted to say we built it we humans its ours what right have you to decide which artifacts should stand and which should fall the fascination of it was irresistible though i couldnt stay away from the window for long i had to check again again to see if they were making any progress to see if some crack had appeared the beasts had enormous patience pushing and pushing until their shadows were swallowed up in the shade of the buildings as the sun headed out past germany past france out to the atlantic to be plunged steaming into the sea of night that was the clock they lived by these elephants they had put in their days work and now they wandered off heading out of the city as they did most nights to eat and drink and sleep in some more hospitable place the next morning they were back earlier this time and formed their circle much more quickly and pushed again the betting among us began in earnest then would they succeed would they give up how long till the first crack how long till a wall fell we had nothing of value to bet or rather we had everything we had inherited the city from the dead so that we could bet enormous sums of money and pay in cash or diamonds if we wanted to but when we wagered we never bothered to carry such useless objects from one house to another enough to say who won and who lost the only reason we had such wealth was because the dead had left it all behind if they didnt value it any more than that what was it worth to us except as counters in games of chance there was unguessedat meaning in their pushing after all for on the third day of the elephants pushingstill to no visible effectarek came home to poznan arek whom i had named for my father arek who dashed my last hope arek who killed my wife for years after the plague no children were conceived from berlin where one of the survivors was a doctor we learned that when the plague was new and they were still trying to study it the medical researchers determined that the virus rooted in the reproductive systems of men and women specifically attacking their bodies where the human seed was made this was not how the plague did its slaughtering but it guaranteed that the few survivors would be sterile the message left us in despair but i was young and though i had seen more death before i turned ten than i would ordinarily have seen even if i devoted my whole life to watching american movies my hope was still undashable or rather my bodys hope which in my teens was much stronger than my reason as the people from the hinterlands and smaller towns came seeking human company poznan became a gathering place in those days we lived on the outskirts of the city in a place where we could actively farm before we realized that farming was redundant with miles and miles of fields and gardens reseeding themselves faster than we could harvest them so i was hoeing the turnipsthe kind of task the adults gratefully left to my strong and flexible young arms and legswhen hilde and her family came to town in a horsedrawn wagon it wasnt hilde herself that i saw at first it was the miracle of seeing a family at first of course we assumed they were a nonce family clinging to each other because no one else in their area survived but no no they looked like each other that miracle of resemblance that told us all that they were genetically connected and soon we learned that yes they were a mother a father a daughter all of whom had survived the plague they knew it was wrong of them to grieve for the two sons and three daughters who died for they had not lost everyone they loved as all the rest of us had done there was something in them that was stronger than the disease and hilde a plump nordic blonde soon became beautiful to all of us because we knew that if any woman had a viable ovum left it would be her she and her parents understood that her womb if it was not barren could not belong to her alone and that her only hope of continuing our poor weak species was to find a mate whose body still could spew forth living sperm she had been sexually immature when the plague came but now was womanly ready to bear if bear she could one man at a time would husband her for three months then a month of solitude and then the next mans turn to try that way there would be no doubt of fatherhood if she conceived he would be her husband to father more children on her she agreed to this because there was no other hope i was third to try at fifteen a frightened child myself approaching her like the temple priestess that she was begging the god to choose me to let life come into her from me she was sweet and patient and told no one how clumsy i was i liked her but did not yet love her for she was still a stranger to me i could mate with her but not speak to heror at least not be understood for she came from a germanspeaking area in the westernmost mountains and had but little polishthough more of polish than i had of german the second month she had no period and the third and the fourth she was kept away from me from all men until in the fifth month she asked for me you are half of this miracle she said in halting polish and from then on i was her companion no more fieldwork for mewhat if i was injured what if i caught cold instead i stayed with her taught her to speak polish and learned to read german more or less in the eighth month the doctor finally came from berlin he had never worked in obstetrics but he was the best hope we had and since no one in berlin was pregnant they understood what was at stake even a halfpolish baby in poznan was better than no more babies anywhere at all we made him welcome he taught us how to make beer the ninth month nothing happened he spoke of inducing labor we worked to get a room in the hospital powered up the old equipment working and he gave hilde an ultrasound examination he could not face us after that you counted wrong he offered as a possibility no we did not count wrong we knew the last time she had sex with anyonewith meand it was nine months and two weeks ago the baby is not ready yet he said weeks to go maybe many weeks the limblength tells me this the development of the face and hands and then the worst news but the headit is very large and strangely shaped not a known condition though i looked in the books not seen before not exactly this if it is still growingand how can i tell since it is already as big as an adult human headthis does not look happy for her she cannot bear this child normally i will have to cut the baby out cut it out now her parents said it has been nine months no the doctor said if i cut now i think that it will die i think it has the lungs of a fetus of five months i did not come here to abort a fetus i came to deliver a baby but our daughter hilde agreed with the doctor if he has to cut me open anyway there is no hurry wait until the baby himself thinks that he is ready we knew now it would be a boy and were not glad of it a daughter would have been better everyone knew that everyone but mei was not ready to play lot with a daughter of mine and i was the only man proven to have viable sperm so i thought it was better that i would have a son and then could wander with hilde and the boy through all the world if need be searching for a place where another mating had happened where there might be a girl for him i could imagine that future happily ten months eleven no woman had carried a child for so long she could not sit up in bed now for still it grew and the ultrasound looked stranger and stranger wide hips and eyes far apart on a face appallingly broad the ultrasound with its grainy blackandwhite image made it look like a monster this was no baby it would never live worse it was draining the life out of hilde most of what she ate went across the placenta to feed this cancerous growth inside her she grew wan of face weak of muscle even as her belly grew more and more mountainous i would sit beside her and when she was tired of the book i read i would hold her hand and talk to her of walks along the streets of the city of my visit to krakow when i was six before the plague how my father took me along as he escorted a foreign author through the city how we ate at a country restaurant and the foreigner could not eat the floury bread and the chewy noodles and the thick lard spread she laughed or as she grew weaker smiled and finally near the end just clung to my hand and let me babble i wanted nothing more than to have hilde forget the baby its already dead to me this monster just let me have hilde the time with her that a man should have with his wife the life together in a little house the coming home at night to her embrace the going forth in the morning with her kiss on my lips and her blessing in my ears i will take it now said the doctor perhaps the next child will be normal but she grows too weak to delay any longer her parents agreed hilde also gave consent at last the doctor had taught me to be his nurse and trained me by making me watch the bloody surgeries he did on hares and once on a sheep so i would not faint at the blood when the time came to cut into my wife for wife she was at her insistence married to me in a little ceremony just before she went under the anaesthetic she knew as did i that the marriage was not permanent perhaps the community would give me one more try to make a normal child with her but if that one too should fail the rotation would begin again three months of mating a month fallow until a father with truer seed was found what we did not understand was how very weak she had become the human body was not designed to give itself so completely to the care of such a baby as this one somehow the baby was sending hormonal messages to her the doctor said telling her body not to bear not to present the cervix not to efface and open somehow it caused her body to drain itself to make the muscles atrophy the fat to disappear the doctors incision was not large enough at first nor with the second cut finally with the third her womb lay open like the belly of a dissected frog and at last he lifted the little monster out he handed it to me almost i tossed it aside but it opened its eyes babies arent supposed to be able to do that i know now but it opened its eyes and looked at me and i felt a powerful trembling a vibration in my chest and arms it was alive whatever it was and it was not in me its father to kill it so i set it aside where a couple of women washed it and did the rituals that the doctor had prescribedthe drops into the eyes the blood samples i did not watch i returned to hilde i thought she was unconscious but then the baby made a sound and even though it was lower than a babys mewling ought to be she knew it was his voice and her eyes fluttered open let me see she whispered so i ran and took the baby from the women and brought it to her it was as large as a toddler and i was loath to lay such a heavy burden on her chest but hilde insisted reaching with her fingers because she could not raise her arms i leaned over her bearing as much of the babys weight as i could he sought her breast and when she found the strength to raise a hand and guide a nipple into his mouth he sucked mightily it hurt her but her face spoke of ecstasy as well as pain mama loves the baby her lips said silently she died as the doctor was still stitching her he left the wound and tried to revive her shoving the baby and me out of the way and pumping at her heart later after the autopsy he told me that her heart had been used up like all her other muscles the child had ruled the mother had demanded her life from her and she had given it my hilde till death parted us there was some debate on whether to feed the child and then on whether to baptize it in both cases mercy and hope triumphed over fear and loathing i wanted to oppose them but hilde had tried to feed the baby and even after she was dead i did not wish to contradict her they made me choose a name i gave it my fathers name because i could not bear to give it mine arkadiusz arek he weighed nearly ten kilograms at birth at two months he walked at five months his babbling noises became speech they taught him to call me papa and i came to him because he was after all my own hildes parents were gone by then they blamed memy bad seedfor their daughters death in vain did the doctor tell them that what the plague had done to me it no doubt also did to her they knew in their hearts that hilde was normal and i was the one with the seed of monstrosity they could not bear to look at me or at arek either the killers of their last child their beautiful little girl arek walked early because his wideset legs gave him such a sturdy platform while crawling was near impossible for him his massive neck was strong enough to hold his widefaced deepskulled head his hands were clever his arms long and probing he was a font of questions he made me teach him how to read when he was not yet two the two strange apertures in his head behind the eyes before the ears seeped with fluid now and then he stank sometimes and the stench came from there at the time we did not know what to call these things or what they meant for the elephants had not yet come the whole community liked arek as they must always like children they played with him answered his questions watched over him but beneath the love there was a constant gnawing pain he was our hope but he was no hope at all whatever his strange condition was it might have made him quicker than a normal child but we knew that it could not be healthy that like most strange children he would no doubt die before his time and definitely mutant that he was he must surely be as sterile as a mule and then the elephants came great shadowy shapes out in the distant fields we marveled we wondered they came nearer day by day and arek became quite agitated i hear them he said hear what we heard nothing they were too far off for us to hear i hear them he said again he touched his forehead i hear them here he touched his chest and here the flow from the apertures in his head increased he took to wandering off we had to watch him closely in the middle of a reading lesson he would stand up and face the distant elephantsor face the empty horizon where they might beand listen rapt i think i understand them arek said heres a place with good water all of poland has good water now i pointed out no he said impatiently its what they said and now they talk of one who died they have the scent of him the one who died he listened more i still heard nothing and me he said they have the scent of me elephants care nothing for you i said he turned to me his eyes awash with tears take that back he said sit and do your lessons arek what do i care what dead people say i have no need of what they said youre five years old arek i know better than you what you need to know your father had to know all this he said but what is it to me what good has reading done for you i tried to hold him but at five years old he was too strong he ran from the room he ran out into the field he ran toward the elephants i followed him as best i could others joined me calling out areks name he was not swift and we could have caught him if we were willing to tackle him like rugby players but our goal was only to keep him safe and so we jogged alongside him his short and heavy legs lumbering forward ever closer to the elephants a matriarch and her clan with several babies of varying sizes we tried to stop him then to hold him back but by then the matriarch had noticed us and as she approached arek screamed and tried more violently to get away to run to her she trumpeted at us and finally tentatively in fear of her we set him down she let him embrace her trunk he clambered upward over her great impassive brow and sprawled his body across the top of her head her trunk reached up to him i feared that she would sweep him from her head like lint instead she touched the leaking aperture on his right cheek then brought the tip of her trunk down to her mouth to smell and taste it that was when i realized the matriarch too had an aperture between eye and ear a leaking stinkhole when i did my reading i learned that it was the temporal gland the elephants had it and so did my son neither hilde nor i was elephantine nor was there any logical way given the little science that i knew for me to explain how a gland that only elephants had should suddenly show up on a human child it wasnt just the temporal glands either as he sat perched atop the matriarch i could see how closely his brow resembled hers no great flapping ears no abnormality of nose and his eyes were still binocular not sideaimed like the elephants yet there was no mistaking how his forehead was a smaller echo of her own he has been waiting for them i murmured and then i thought but did not say they came in search of him he would not go home with me one by one the others drifted back to our village some returning to bring me food and offer food to arek but he was busy riding on the matriarch and playing with the babies always under the watchful gaze of the mothers so that no harm would come to him he made a game of running up the trunks and turning somersaults onto an elephants back he swung on tusks he rode them like horses he climbed them like trees and he listened to them like gods after two days they moved on i tried to follow the matriarch picked me up and put me back three times she did it before i finally acquiesced arek was their child now they had adopted him he had adopted them whatever music they were making he heard it and loved it the pied piper had come to lead away our only son our strange inhuman child the only hope we had from that day i did not see him until the twelfth bull elephant arrived with arek astride his neck fullgrown arekjust a little taller i estimated than his father but built like a tractor with massive legs and arms and a neck that made his enormous head look almost natural father he cried father he had not seen me at the window i wanted to hide from him he must be fifteen now the age i was when i met hilde i had put him from my mind and heart as i had already done with my parents my baby sister whom i had left behind unburied when i was too hungry to wait any longer for them to wake again for god to raise them up from their sickbeds of all those i had lost why was he the one that could return for a moment i hated him though i knew that it was not his fault he was their child anyway not mine i could see that now anyone could see it his skin was even filthy grey like theirs he didnt see me he slid down the brow and trunk of the bull he was riding and watched as his steedhis companion his mastertook its place in the circle that pushed against the walls of the ugly building he walked around them a wide circle looking up at the windows on the opposite side of the square but it was not by sight that he found me it was when he was directly under my window looking the other way that he stopped and turned and looked up at me and smiled father he said i have seen the world i did not want him to call me father those were his fathers those bull elephants not me i was the bearer of the seed its depositor but the seed itself had been planted in both hilde and me by the plague born in africa and carried to the world on airplanes virulent and devastating the plague was no accident of nature paranoid as it sounded even to myself i had the evidence of areks elephantinism to bolster what i knew but could not prove somehow in the kettle of the temporal gland the elephants created this new version of man and sent the seed out into the world carried by a virus they had judged us these beasts and found us wanting perhaps the decision was born as grieving elephants gathered around the corpses of their kinfolk slain and shorn of their tusks perhaps the decision came from the shrinking land and the drying earth perhaps it was their plan all along from the time they made us until they finally were done with us for in the darkness of the library as i moved along the table keeping my yellowing books always in the slant of light from the window i had conjured up a picture of the world the elephants the true gods of antiquity they had reached the limit of what they could do with their prehensile noses what was needed now was hands so virus by virus seed by seed they swept away one species and replaced it with another building and improving and correcting their mistakes there was plenty of the primate left in us the baboon the chimpanzee but more and more of the elephant as well the kindness the utter lack of warfare the benevolent society of women the lonely wandering harmless helpful men and the absolute sanctity of the children of the tribe primate and elephant always at war within us we could see the kinship between us and the apes but failed to see how the highbreasted elephant could possibly also be our kind only now with arek could the convergence at last be seen they had made at last an elephant with hands a clever toolmaker who could hear the voices of the gods i thought of the bulldancers of crete and then of arek running up the trunks of elephants and somersaulting on their heads the mastodons and mammoths were all gone and the elephants were south of the mediterranean but they were not forgotten in human memory we were supposed to dance with joy upon the horns and head of a great loving beast our father our maker our prophets were the ones who heard the voice of god not in the tempest but in the silent thrumming the still small voice of infrasound carried through stone and earth as easily as through the air on the mountain they heard the voice of god teaching us how to subdue the primate and become the sons of god the giants in the earth for the sons of god did marry the daughters of men we remembered that god was above us but thought that meant he was above the sky and so my speculation and imagining led me to this mad twisting of the scripture of my childhoodand no less of the science and history in the library what were the neanderthals why did they disappear was there a plague one day carried wherever the newmade cromagnon wandered and did the neanderthals understand what their woolly mammoth deities had done to them here was their ironic vengeance it was the new godmade men the chosen people who hunted the mammoths and the mastodons to extinction who bowed the elephants of india to slavery and turned the elephants of africa into a vast wandering ivory orchard we men of cromagnon descent we thought we were the pinnacle but when god told us to be perfect as he was perfect we failed him and he had to try again this time it was no flood that swept our souls away and any rainbow we might see would be a lie i spoke of this to no onei needed human company too much to give them reason to think me mad elephants as gods as god himself sacrilege heresy madness evil nor was i sure of it myself indeed most days most hours of the day i mocked my own ideas but i write them here because they might be true and if someday these words are read and i was right then youll hear my warning you who read this you are not the last and best any more than we were there is always another step higher up the ladder and a helpful trunk to lift you upward on your way or dash you to the ground if you should fail arek called me father and i was not his father but he came from hildes body she gave her life to give him breath and loved him ugly and misshapen as he was as she held him to her empty breasts while her heart pushed the last few liters of blood through her wornout body not a drop of pap came from her into his mouth he had already sucked her dry but for that moment she loved him and for her sakeand for his at first i will be honest herei tried to treat him well to teach him and provide for him and protect him as best i could but at five years of age they took him and he was raised by elephants in what sense now was he my son father he said to me again dont be afraid its only me your boy arek im not afraid i almost said but he would know it was a lie he could smell a lie on me silence was my refuge i left my room and went down the stairs to the level of the street i came blinking into the sunlight he held out a hand to me his legs were even stockier now whenever he stood still he looked as planted as a pair of old trees he was taller than i am and i am tall father he said i want them to meet you i told them all the things you taught me they already know me i wanted to say theyve been following me for years they know when and where i eat and sleep and pee they know all they want to know of me and i want nothing at all from them so so i followed him anyway feeling my hand in his the firm kind grasp the springy rolling rhythm of his walk i knew that he could keep walking forever on those legs he led me to the new elephant the one he had arrived with he bade me stand there as the trunk took samples of my scent for tasting as one great eye looked down on me the allseeing eye not a word did i say not a question did i ask until i felt the thrumming strong now so powerful that it took my breath away it shook my chest so strongly did you hear him father asked my son i nodded but did you understand i shook my head he says you understand said arek puzzled but you say that you dont at last i spoke i understand nothing the elephant thrummed out again you understand but do not know you understand said arek youre not a prophet the elephant had made me tremble but it was areks word that made me stumble not a prophet and you are my son i am said arek because i hear what he says and can turn it into language for the rest of you i thought you could understand him too because he said you could the elephant was right i did understand my mad guesses were right or somewhat right or at least not utterly wrong but i said nothing of this to arek but now i see you do understand said arek nodding content his temporal glands were dripping the fluid falling onto his naked chest he wore trousers though old polyester ones the kind that cannot rot or fade the kind that will outlast the end of the universe he saw me looking and again supposed that i had understood something youre right he said ive had it before only lightly though and it did me no good he smiled ruefully ive seen the world but none like me had what before the dripping time the madness musth i said yes he answered he touched the stream of fluid on his cheek then streaked it on my cheek it takes a special woman to bear my child what if there isnt one there is he said thats why i came here theres no one here like you not yet he said and besides i had this gift to give you what gift he gestured as if i should have understood all along the building that the elephants were pushing at you always told me how much you hated this building how ugly it was i wanted to give you something when i came again but i couldnt think of anything i could do for you except for this at his words the elephants grunted and bellowed and now it was clear that all their pushing before had been preliminary to this as they braced themselves and rammed all at once again and again now the building shuddered now the façade cracked now the walls buckled quickly arek drew me back out of danger the elephants too retreated as the walls caved in the roof collapsed dust blew out of the place like smoke blinding me for a moment till tears could clear my vision no silence now no infrasound the bulls gave voice a great triumphant fanfare and now the families came the matriarch the other females their babies their children into the square now unobstructed except for the rubble pile they came by the dozens there must be three clans here i thought four five trumpeting triumphant all this because they knocked down a building no the fall of the building was the gift to the father it was the signal for the real festivities to begin i made them bring her here said arek youre my family and these are my friends he indicated the people leaning out of the windows over the square isnt that what weddings are for the elephants made way for one last arrival an indian elephant lumbered into the square trunk upraised trumpeting it progressed in stately fashion to the place where arek and i were standing on its back sat areks bridetobe at first glance she was human boldly and charmingly nude but under the shock of thick straight hair her head was if anything larger than areks and her legs were set so wide that she seemed to straddle the elephants neck the way a woman of my species might bestride a horse down the forehead and the trunk of the beast she slid pausing only to stand playfully upon the tusks then jump lightly to the ground those legs those hipsshe clearly had the strength to carry a baby as large as arek had been for the entire year but wide as her body was could such a head pass through the birth canal because she was naked the answer was before my eyes the entrance to her birth canal was not between her thighs but in a pouch of skin that drooped from the base of her abdomen the opening was in front of the pubis no longer would the pelvic circle limit the size of a babys head she would not have to be cut open to give birth arek held out his hand she smiled at him and in that smile she became almost human to me it was the shy smile of the bride the smile that hilde had given me when she was pregnant before we knew it was no human child she carried shes in heat said arek and im in musth you have no idea how crazy it makes me he didnt sound crazy or act it either instead he had the poise of a king the easy confidence of an elephant at the touch of her hand his temporal glands gave forth such a flow that i could hear the fluid dripping onto the stones of the plaza but otherwise he betrayed no eagerness i dont know how its done said arek marriage i mean they said i should marry as humans do with words i remembered the words that had been said for me and hilde as best i could i said them now the girl did not understand her eyes i saw now had the epicanthic foldhow far had they brought her was she the only one were there only these two in all the world is that how close they came to the edge of killing us all of ending the whole experiment i said the words and she shaped the answers but i could tell that it didnt matter to her or to him either that she understood not a bit of the polish words she had to say below the level of audible speech they had another kind of language for i could see how her forehead thrummed with a tone too low for my ears to hear but he could hear not words i assumed but communication nonetheless the thing with speech theyd work that out it would still be useful to them when communication needed to be precise but for matters of the heart they had the language of the elephants the language of the gods the adamic tongue the idiom god had used one time to say multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it we did the first we did the last now perhaps this new couple in their new garden would learn the replenishing part as well only a few of us lingering beasts of us the dust of the earth would remain and not for long then the whole world would be their garden today theyre gone out of poznan the elephants and their new creatures the son and daughter of the gods my arek and his wife whose name he never spoke aloud to us no doubt he has some deep and rumbling name for her that i could never hear they will have many children they must watch them carefully or perhaps this time it will be different no stone crashed against a brothers head this time no murder in the world only the peace of the elephants theyre gone and the rejoicing is overfor we did rejoice because even though we know we all know that arek and his bride are not of our kind they still carry the only portion of our seed that will remain alive in the earth better to live on in them than to die utterly without casting seed at all theyre gone and now each day i go out into the square and work amid the wreckage of the building propping up the old façade leaning it against a makeshift wall before i die ill have it standing again or at least enough of it so that the square looks right already i have much of one wall restored and sometimes the others come and help me when they see im struggling with a section of wall too heavy or awkward for a man to raise alone it may have been an ugly thing that communist monstrosity but it was built by humans in a human place and they had no right to knock it down long enough and just so long cat rambo id never wanted to go to earth until the doctor told me i couldnt that my bones were too brittle after that it wasnt an obsession just an edge to my days otherwise my lifes good i run a courier ship between earth luna the space stations mars and the inner gate you need as little mass as possible to run a snipship and due to what that doctor called my defects im one of the smallest fastest good pay and most of the time im lowg which is easiest on me freetime i slum around luna where my best girlfriend pippi lives or she and i go prospecting out in the shadow of the gate like the dozens of other crazies hoping to stumble on an alien artifact make us all rich not too impossible a dream though its happened before i had a permanent cradle walker left at luna thats how much time i spent there pippi worked as a sportscaster for the biggest moon channel mbsa her names not really pippi but she had orange braids and long legs and freckles everywhere so what else could everyone call her im used to my name getting distorted my parents named me podkayne after a girl in an old story about mars it becomes poddy and special k usually kayne in college though they called me the gimp most of the time it was affectionate pippi was my roommate there from day one she had eight siblings ranging from twelve years to three months a roomie with lower limb reduction syndrome didnt faze her id come in with a chip preloaded on my shoulder but i relaxed after a couple of weeks pippi was borderline aspie called it like it was which caused her enough troubles on her own you had to explain to her why you were angry or sad or whatever but once she knew what was going on she knew what sounds to make the aspiness makes her an excellent sportscaster she knows every sports score for the last half century and a lot of prenet stuff too you cant come up with a trivia question thats lunar sportsrelated that she cant answer that was the only thing she really got passionate about and in a way that charmed the camera we never hooked up both of us were wired straight pippi had a regular friend named trevor who was usually away on business trips i paid for it or went virtual every once in a while and left things at that we were both enjoying sunlight at our favorite park two blocks away from pippis apartment complex sitting beside a sculpture there ive always loved spindly rails of color tumbling taller than me like animation lines edges glinting pink and blue and purple the smell of tomato and basil and sage filled the air pippi had her face turned up to the light soaking in the warmth she had been indulging in tanners again her orange shirt and shorts were vibrant against the expanse of her brown skin i was more cautious i dont want skin tumors later on so i keep a gauzy overshirt and hat about me silvery sleeves to deflect the light were set over my arms strapped into the walkers maneuvering legs underneath the sleeves mercurial light played over my skin we both saw him when he entered the park touristnew still dressed in arrival shorts and paper shirt with be nice im a newbie printed on the back which guaranteed him a discount at any participating business pippi squinted over is that i followed her gaze dark glasses gave me the advantage yep its an ai not just any ai though she said eyes watering unless im wrong nope its a sexbot i said it was just after what the newsies were calling the sexbot scandal when that senator was caught traveling with an ai and had used the momentary notoriety to call for ai rights now the senators droid and several others of its kind had bought themselves free id seen an interview with one while trapped in line picking up chinese takeout the night before its plans for the next year were to travel with its friend another of the bots wink wink nudge nudge the oldest human urge curiosity about who or what each other was fucking he had the white plastic skin most ais were affecting that year on his head a slouched wool hat like a noir detectives he looked up and saw us looking at him he froze like a car grinding gears to a stop then he moved again almost impatient flinging an arm up as though against us although i realized a second later that it shielded his eyes from the dazzle of sunlight off the sculpture trapezoids of colored light danced over his tunic glittered on the lenses that were his eyes pippi waved he stepped backwards ducked into the tunnel of course we went in pursuit he took the west tunnel moving fast dodging between walkers moving between stations grabbing handholds to hurl himself along it wasnt hard to follow himim small and mostly muscular in the chest and shoulders so i can rocket along as far as anyone from handhold to handhold pippi slowed me down kept hissing at me to wait up for her we emerged in the most touristy of plazas the complex of malls near the big hotels the public gardens i thought id seen the flicker of his tunic his hats crumpled feather as he ducked into the thai garden the dome overhead admitted unadulterated sunlight there were parrot flowers and bua pood a waterfall and a grove full of gibbons safely behind mesh trails led off to discreet clothing and lifestyle boutiques a restaurant and a walkway to the next mall i saw his hat bob through its glass confines and elbowed pippi pointing she said he could be going anywhere from there theres a tube stop in the middle of the mall where would a sexbot go do you think hes for hire she said the interview had said only a few sexbots had chosen to keep their professions most of the others had made enough to fund other careers most had become solominers or explorer pilots it cant be the first time hes been asked the question pippi said i hesitated i could talk her into asking could machines feel embarrassment what was the etiquette of communication was a sexbot like a human capable of being flattered by a flirtatious or even directly admiring question gibbons hooted overhead a longbilled bird clung upside down to the other side of the mesh if we stayed here much longer wed have a park fee added to our monthly taxes two parks in a single day was way too extravagant we went home i had a run to the gate the next morning so i got up early let myself out took the west tunnel to the tube stop grabbed a mushroom roll on the way and ate it on the platform peering into shop windows at orange and blue scarves and fake ferns and a whole window walls worth of animate muffs the latest wearable animals the sign said they lived off air impurities they had no eyes which to some people made them cute i guess but to me just looked sad tourists going past in bright shirts and arcs of perfect white teeth demigods powered by cash a feather reflected in the window behind me stood the sexbot this time i followed at a distance got in the train car at the opposite end but kept an eye on him luckily for me he was getting out at the port i dont know what i would have done if itd looked as though he was going further maybe followed him why i dont know there was something charming about the way he held himself and i was curiouswho wouldnt beabout the experience of someone made for sex someone for whom sex was his entire rationale for existence what would it have been like for him it awakening to that the port platform straddled the dundee cliffs overlooking the sea of tranquility he was there at that flickering curtain of energy and i remembered what it did to constructsshorted them out wiped them clean he had his hand outstretched and im the last to deny anyone their choices but even so i shouted hey he turned his hand dropping i caught up to him i was in the cradle walker because i was being lazy that day i could see him taking it in the metal spidering my lower body the bulge where my flesh ended where legs might have been on someone else the nubs of my left handtwo but as useful as three of your fingers i swear i said want to get a cup of tea and talk about it so cliché like something you might have seen in a cheapd but he said okay and his voice sounded as sincere as a mechanical voice can the café was halfdeserted just a couple of kids drinking coffee near the main window we were between main shifts and i was late for my pickup but i thumbed a dontbotherme code knowing i was one of the most reliable usually theyd curse me but let it slide its weird talking to a mechanical half the time your minds supplying all the little body movements so you feel like youre talking to a person then half the time youve got a selfconscious feeling like you were talking to your toaster in front of your grandmother maybe it was just as strange for him theres a lot of gimps up herelower gravity has its advantages and in a lot of spaces like my rig the less you mass the better plus times are leanless elective surgery here he was in the land of the unbeautiful the people who didnt care as much about their appearance strange when he was beautiful in every single inch every graceful economical move we didnt say a word about any of that i told him the best places to sightsee and where he could take tours i thought maybe he had some advantagesdid he need to breathe after all could he walk outside just as he was the big casinos are worth seeing particularly atlantis and spin city i sketched out a map on my cell and shot it to him where do you like to go he said im not much for shopping and i said so i liked to take the megarail between luna and the clustercheap and you could stare out the window at the landscape lets do that he said the cluster used to be a fundamentalistfounded station that ended up selling its space to private concerns in order to fund itself the remnants of the church were there they ran the greenhouses that grew food for luna where most of the water got processed too the stuff at the market there was always fresh and good and cheaper than in stores a jazz club had bought space and a tiny government office matched its grander counterpart in luna and there was xanadu which was a coop of five wealthy families along with a scattering of individuals who dealt in rare or handcrafted goods there was always music there and it had enough reputation for being dangerous that all but a few tourists steered clear his name was star he would be all right with me i knew enough to keep him safe we ate berries and sat beside rippling water he told me about earthnever about the people but the landscape trees pines and sycamores and madrona maples and honey locusts and cedar he talked about cliffs that were bound with color yellows and reds and deep browns everything grew there it seemed he talked about rain about slow gray clouds and tearing noreasters rain drumming on a tin roof versus its sound on slate fine spring mist and the hot rain that fell during drought coinsized and evaporating too quickly rain on sand echoed by waves thunderheads gathering themselves over the ocean he had lived beside the sea for a few years he said i wondered who he had lived with so much was unsaid it was like a cloud in the room we relaxed despite it he didnt know where he was staying he had no luggage i approved of that i stick to plaswear and carry no souvenirs other than the rooms inside my head even my ship where i spend more time than anywhere else is unpersonalized i liked it that way i was staying with pippi star had money or so he said and asked where a clean hotel was i steered him to blizz which caters to the gate regulars and went back to pippis she was surprised to see me i hadnt felt like going out on a trip i said and offered to take her out to dinner all the time we were eating sweet potato fries and tempeh steaks i tried to figure out how to tell her about star i dont know what kept me from just blurting it out that was usually the level we communicated at straightforward and without pretense i felt like a shit keeping quiet eventually it would come out and the longer it took the worse it would be i wasnt prepared to see him at the door the next day pippi answered the door bless you my dear little friend she shouted over her shoulder what i scooted back in my chair glimpsed his hat you got me a present she reached out her hands come in come in her place is tiny three of us made it feel crowded we stood around the table bumping it with our hips how much do you cost pippi asked star he looked at me i dont do that anymore then why are you here i came to see podkayne pippi was unembarrassed she shrugged and said okay he wanted advice about buying into the colony where to pick a spot i made him buy me lunch in return for my advice and we took pippi along since she knew better than i where the good deals were over there in cluster someone told me a month or two ago she said he was saying the church is going to sell off more space and its going to get gentrified its a long ways off though over an hour by tram she licked barbecue sauce off her fingers star pushed a wipe across the table towards her i dont think he likes me much she said to me later i dont think he likes humans much i said he makes allowances but i think hed be just as happy dealing with mechanicals only not many mechs up here she said why i said youd think it would be ideal for them no rust less dirt fewer pollutants in the air it would make sense she said what does it say about us were so crazy we pick a place even mechanicals dont want to live maybe ten thousand on the face of the moon the space stations ranged in size from a few hundred to a few thousand twenty thousand on the surface of mars i didnt go back there much even though it was where i had grown up after my parents died in a crash maybe two or three thousand existing around the bounty of the gate another hundred pilots and vagabonds and parasiteridden the few the proud the crazy why had star chosen to come up here i asked he said theres too many living things on the planet why not mars its enough people to qualify as civilization theyre spread out and its dusty here its clean you like the sterility up here i said then why think about living over in the cluster its the most organic spot on the moon his face never smiled just tilted from one degree to another its a controlled organic but what do you want to do live he said by myself with a few friends he nodded towards me according to my own devices what about sex i blurted out he froze like a stuck struts shadow i beg your pardon im sorry i said i didnt mean to intrude its just that i was somewhat interested but only if you were he shook his head mere centimeters of rejection im afraid not words id heard before including what he said next we can be friends though hes not interested i told pippi screw him she said lets go play sex rangers we climbed into the virtual suits and tapped in i found someone interested in fooling around on a rocky shore underneath fuzzy pines the suits as good as sex any dayreleases all the tensions you need released in my opinionand a lot cleaner afterwards we logged out and ate pizza and watched a deck about boxing pippi said the guy had an percent chance of winning he did percent chance by knockout he did not i asked star to come mining with us i said to her when we were getting ready for bed i took the couch she had a folddown bunk you did what hell be an extra pair of eyes not like hell take up oxygen she paused fair enough he was good enough at spotting he learned the difference between ice and metal fast enough to satisfy impatient pippi who hated explaining things i focused on getting us close to the debris that swirled in and out of the gate you never knew what you might find one guy picked up a device that fueled a company in food replication and yielded over forty patents one pilot found a singing harp another the greasy lump that ended up becoming snipship fuel you never knew pippi and i had a routine star didnt intrude on it much went to the secondary display and focused on looking for mineral spikes usually we chatted back and forth there star was an intrusive if silent presence pippi ended up thumbing on the usual newschat channel nothing much an outbreak on mars but small and wellcontained an ambassador stricken but rallying in order to continue his mission through the gate how much he looked forward to being the fifth human through the interstellar passage that allowed us access to the wild and varied universe how much he looked forward to opening new trade channels who knew what he might find out there whats this star said from afar just a glitter then closer a silversided chest the size of a foot locker but covered with golden triangles an odd glittery powder encrusted the hinges and catch as it spun in space we brought it in pippis gloved hand reached to undo the latch i waited holding my breath nothing hissed out a glass sphere inside clouded with bubbles and occlusions as pippi slipped it out of the gray material surrounding it we could see oily liquid filling it could be useless pippi said her voice unhappy plenty of stories like that before could be beaucoup bucks i pointed out of course pippi said her voice loud and angry its the time you bring someone along to split it three ways that we actually hit a lode i dont want any claim star said flummoxed i stared at him what must it be like to have enough to not need more to have just that one extra layer against yourself and poverty my parents had left me enough to buy my snipship but all my capital was tied up in that rig i just wanted the company he said i thought it would be interesting fucking tourist pippi said want to watch the monkeys dance well kiss for another five grand he backed up raising his hands his feet clattered on the deck before he had moved quietly did he choose to make that sound to remind us he was a machine thought wed just love to take the walking vibrator on tour pippi said when he remained silent she turned on me see it doesnt have anything to say to that he he said he what makes you a he that youve got a stickyout bit i bet youve got a stickyin bit or two as well she laughed meanness skewed her face enough i said lets tag the find in our names pippi she dropped back i clung to the rigging started to thumb in figures she pushed forward let me its faster fingers clicking she muttered under her breath get us all home faster that way i took over after shed tagged the spot and put the coordinates in i was trying not to be angry hope mellowed out some of the harsh emotion it could be a significant find it was nice of star to give up his claim back in the ship bay the lights laddered his face till he looked like a decoration pippi was strapping our find into a jitney why not a place where theres rain i said that could only be earth he said do you know the worst thing about rain there what pippi tied a rope into place tested it with a quick tug glanced over her shoulder at us rain there has gotten so acidic that if i stand out in it i have to come in and shower after a few minutes it damages my outer skin i tried to picture the cold then acid burn luna was better im sorry about pippi she honked the horn go ahead im taking the tram over to the cluster he said i hesitated meet me later ill call you he didnt of course we cashed in the casea lump sum from a companys rd division that doubled our incomes and then some i texted him come celebrate with us were dockside and buying dumplings but he didnt reply until three days later sorry things got busy bought house come out and see it when tomorrow morning ill make you breakfast i left in the morning before pippi was awake his place was swank built into a cliffside with a spectacular view of the endless white plains below he made me waffles with real maple syrup he was an amazing cook i said so i was programmed that way he said and made a sound that was sort of a laugh the sexbotsall of the ais struggling for emancipation latelyhad had to demonstrate empathy and creativity i wondered what that had been like he was standing uncomfortably close i leaned forward to make it even closer thinking hed draw back he didnt im programmed a certain way he said how is that i want to please you but at the same time i know its just the way im programmed it cant be something more than that my arm was pressed against his surface it was warm and yielding as flesh i couldnt have told the difference he pulled away i bit my lip in frustration but i liked him enough to be civilized i drank the last of my coffee real blue mountain blend he kept his kitchen well stocked for human visitorswho did he hope would stop in as it turns out pippi next time i came through on a quick flight i might be rich but who was i to turn down fast and easy money she told me how hed fed her pasta she said rolling the words out and wine and little fish from earth and afterwards something sweet to drink she said theyd fucked i believed her it wouldnt be her style to lie it would never occur to her so i did and said id fucked him too she didnt respond not right off the bat but i caught her looking at me oddly by the time i said toodleoo and went off to sleep in my ship it wasnt the first time id slept in there not by a long shot i wished them both happiness i supposed still two weeks later i came in response to pippis panicked call he was going back to earth she said we both showed up at the farewell hall he was standing with a tall blonde woman earthfat star slipped away from us came over with a bearing jaunty and happy his polished face expressionless as always who is that pippi said a journalist shes going to help me tell my story back on earth i see pippi said she and i both surveyed the woman who pretended not to notice us her manicured hand waved a porter over to take her luggage aboard the hardshelled cases the same color as her belt pippi said is this because you dont want to fuck me any longer you said you liked it making me feel good we dont have to do that we can do whatever you like as long as you stay he averted his face looking at the ship thats not it then what i want to go back to the rain earths acid rain i said the rain that will destroy you now he was looking at neither of us what about your place pippi said you can have it he said it never felt like home will anyplace i asked anywhere when im telling my story it feels like home he said i see myself on the camera and i belong in the world thats what i need to do good luck i said what else could i say pippi and i walked away through the terminal there were tourists all around us going home after theyd played exotic for a few days experienced zerograv and skydiving and painted their faces in order to play glideball and eaten our food and drunk our wine and now were going home to the rain we didnt look at each other i didnt know how long stars shadow would lie between us maybe years maybe just long enough for sunlight to glint on forgotten metal out there in the sky maybe long enough and just so long the passenger julie e czerneda it was a pilgrimage and he was its goal this understanding had taken years had the passenger the means or desire to measure them decades to be convinced of any purpose beyond curiosity to the parade outside his walls in the first months he had cowered behind the furnishings terrified almost to insanity by the ceaseless silent mass of flesh quivering against one side of his prison at any moment he could slide his eyes that way and make out a hundred bodies hung with broadtipped tentacles moving with a boneless grace as if the atmosphere outside his prison were liquid it could have been for all he knew a hundred bodies they could be the same as the hundred before or different he still couldnt tell any of them apart were only those of the same size and shape allowed to see him they wore and carried nothing he was fond of the notion that there were some religious or cultural mores that said they should come before him as he was for they had never provided him clothing other things yes every few days or weeks or months a panel on the far wall from his bed would glow hed learned to set his fingers properly in the seven slots beside the panel to trigger it to slide open behind the panel would be a box he would open it of course despite what hed come to expect of its contents at first the sight of charred and melted wood and plastic stained with blood had provoked him to rage he had cursed his captors spat at the transparency keeping him from them them from him tried with ingenuity to kill himself with whatever sad relic or trophy theyd provided they had never reacted beyond simply causing him to slip into unconsciousness while they repaired what damage hed managed to inflict on himself eventually hed stopped what was the point the pilgrimage of watchers never ended the boxes with their pitiful cargo continued to come he began to sort their contents carefully when he slept anything he hadnt touched or handled would be removed from his prison he made sure to touch it all when a new box was due anything he had left on the floor would also disappear like a dream so he began to sort out what mattered to him there was nothing useful bits of fabricnever enough for clothing even when he tried to hoard some the smell of burned flesh usually clung to it metal and plastic usually bent or damaged beyond recognition once in a while a package that seemed intact another passengers personal possessions he assumed better protected than other things while these were the most distressing gifts from his captors he treated them with care the opaque walls of his prison were uneven with plentiful ledges he filled these with trinkets from the dead he slept watched over by the images of other mens mothers and wives and spent hours contemplating the fates of children whose faces were not reflections of his own if he slid his eyes that way to watch his watchers he knew it would be the same sight as every other minute since he came to be here but the thought brought the involuntary glance tentacles overlapping either because they wanted to or there was no room to avoid touching made the same corrugated pattern as always each body was topped with seven small red eyes pupilled in black rolling in unison to face him to track him as their owner moved along from one side of the wall to the other he looked away there had been a time when he tried to communicate or at least learn by watching the watchers after that had been a time of anger and depression of attempts at selfdestruction when nothing in the room could be defacedattempts that availed him only intimate memories of futility then he had stopped caring he had remained motionless waiting to die they wouldnt allow his body to fail he would wake to find himself nourished no matter how hard he resisted sleep but he could allow his brain to die and he tried and had almost succeeded but that was when his captors though they seemed incapable of communicating with him or understanding him began giving him the boxes of belongings every item tore his heart every one reconnected his humanity at last one gave him a purpose to match the unknown one sending the aliens sliding past his prison day in day out it was a childs box of markers he held them against his cheek when he found them breathing in a faint scent of corruption as well as the clean promise of colour he cried for the child who had lost them then with painful carehed never been an artistused the markers to draw a stick figure child on the floor he expected the vivid lines to be gone when he awoke fingers cramped around the markers but his captors had left them so he added a dog a ball a tree a house a rabbit a book the markers failed him dry halfway through the shining red of a bicycle he flung them away and cried turning his back to the wall of watchers sleeping he dreamed for the first time in years of home a dream that for once didnt spiral into the nightmare of chase burning struggle and capture a dream that gave him up peacefully to reality there he found his captors had left him something of their own on the floor was a sevensided sheet of white there was a tray containing greasy sticks each about the length of his hand in a variety of colors they were awkward to hold but he grabbed them eagerly and waved them happily at his watchers as if theyd respond or as if hed recognize a response if they did another hundred beings slid past it took each exactly fifteen heartbeats to glide from one end of his wall to the other always sixtythree years had passed since he knew precisely because that sheet of white had marked the beginning of his purpose there were a few years lost in the beforetime ten years ago the sad packages from other passengers had stopped appearing behind the panel it didnt matter he no longer remembered his age when he arrived in this place but he could rely on nature ending his imprisonment in the nottoodistant future regardless of the devoted attention of his captors he surveyed this days work the colors were subtle layered in explanations of light and shadow refinements hed begun several pieces ago the centerpiece a bridge swept upwards its luminous archways of stone almost hanging in air the legion marching across moved in trained synchrony save for the eyes of one man looking out as if wary of surprise attack there were storm clouds on the horizon and dewdrops on the moss in the foreground there were probably errors throughout the scene he worried as he always did but the errors were irrelevant hed done his best this one was ready to go he rolled it up the motion inflaming the soreness in his joints and leaned it against the panel like all the others it would be gone when he awoke boneless grace studded with eyes could any even see the colors he intended hed learned his art it was after all a way to communicate and hed hoped until hope died this medium would be the breakthrough allowing him to reach the intelligence that held him here that marched in unending ranks just to look at him but there had been no response beyond the disappearance of only finished works those he rolled up and placed near the panel he didnt bother wondering anymore if they valued his art or washed off his colors to return the paper to him in some frenzied economy it was enough he completed each image it took three sets of hands to open the roll safely when it was spread on the sevensided table specially built for this purpose they eversogently slid the holding bars over each edge each bar locking in place with a light snick of contact only then did they release their careful grip the lights around the table dimmed isolating the brightness glowing down on colors and shapes the encircling six didnt speak for a long moment their faces lost in shadows their thoughts in reverence they were a close group drawn together years before by common interests and goals held together by a responsibility none could escape these rooms the automated equipment and most importantly the wonderful artwork such as the latest supine before them had been their discovery the romans said dr susan crawley softly drawing in a slow breath around the unfamiliar word ive read about them earth early th century i think they were conquerors builders definitely preindustrial well this proves what i have been saying all these years dr tom letners voice held its customary fine and precise diction in the dark as if those lips never slurred into shipslang after a few beers he must have been an historian someone keyed the room lights to full brightness again bedlam erupted as others vehemently countered the physicists assertion the loudest voice belonged to lt tony shrib all it proves is he was wellread susan here is an engineer for stars sake and she knows about these remans romans susan corrected under her breath she ignored the continuing wellworn arguments what was new lay before her her eyes moved hungrily over the scene on the table feasting on its complexity she admired the stonework of the bridge the odd moisture on a plant whose name she would have to look up in a text all were images strange and exotic to the shipborn of those party to the secret of this art only master electrician huong trang could claim to have set foot on the planet glorified by the artist and huong stubbornly refused to discuss what he remembered as if the memories were sweeter for the hoarding typically it was huong who interrupted her pleasure my friends he said in his gentle clear voicethe voice that had reproached them so many times before my colleagues is it not time the goodnatured bickering faltered and stopped the others all officers or senior scientists found good reasons to look anywhere but at huongs stern face he recaptured their attention by placing one bluntfingered hand firmly on the surface of the art dr natalie emil a trim woman in her late forties whose love for the art was matched only by her love for her patients in the ships hospitaland truth be told for her mothers legacy of earth chocolatecried out careful the sacrilegious hand stayed where it was is it not time huong insisted looking from one to the other in turn has he not suffered long enough the ships senior psychologist dr wayne simmons shook his mane of heavy gray hair his eyes troubled behind their thick lenses we dont dare release him from the sim program you know that huong we cant predict what the effect on his mind would be we dont have the facilities on this ship to ensure his recovery huong lifted his hand prompting at least one sigh of relief then waved it eloquently over the artwork imprisoned on the table and we dont want this to stop do we susan felt the blood draining from her face she didnt need to glance at her colleagues to know they too would be showing signs of shock how dare huong accuse them ofof what we cherish the artists work she said involuntarily how is that wrong despite his weakness hes valued by all of us susan looked pleadingly at her peers was strengthened by natalies nod of support by tonys smile youve seen for yourself how our shipmates flock to the gallery to see his images of our heritage weve arranged school tours we let anyone order a reproduction for their quarters we we imprison him in his dream of earth we ensure he continues to produce what we crave huong said heavily and we wait for him to die and release us from our conscience no how dare you waynes hand touched hers briefly susan calmed herself but refused to back down youve never been comfortable with our decision huong i understand your feelings about it i dont think you do i dont think any of you really do the master electrician walked to the side of the room they usually avoided he activated the sole control on its surface turning the blank surface into a oneway view of a room larger than most of the quarters on the colony ship pilgrim iii the rooms sole occupant squatted naked and old on the floor colors in those marvelous hands poised to coax shape and texture from the empty page just as the artist had done each and every day since they had discovered his existence almost ten years ago yet susan remembered it as if it had been yesterday theyd searched for the release catches frantic to rescue the imprisoned stranger only to be stopped by wayne and natalie their medical experts it was obviously a sim chamber like enough to the hundreds on the pilgrim iii to be recognizable if far more elaborate the planetborn visited the sims regularly having come onship with their private recorded scenes from the verdant world left behind ready to comfort them when the shipworld became too strange to bear the shipborn entered the chambers as part of their schooling a refresher course built from open skies scented winds and uneven ground it was a matter of pride to avoid them as adults to prefer acclimation to the ship though all recognized the coming generations would need the sims and more to prepare for their new home but no one lingered in the sims more than a day at a time only those who could accept leaving earth had boarded the ship to admit otherwise was to unsettle ones own sanity and disturb those around you and there was work to be done the carefully planned busyness designed to occupy minds tempted to hold on to the past survival for all meant looking to the future not dwelling on what was now forever beyond their reach the sim chamber hosting the artist was quite different from those offering education or a harmless moment of blueskyed nostalgia it was capable of full life support even if the ship failed of remote functions better suited to quarantine facilities that had been one of their early fears that he had been a carrier of some disease perilous to the ship theyd used the remotes to run tests as he lay unconscious until they were sure he was nothing more dangerous than a puzzle there were recording devices notes left behind in this secret place those had been studied too though all they offered was a seemingly endless lists of bodily functions chilling evidence the artist had indeed been in this chamber every minute since launch as vividly susan remembered the morning when theyd met here to listen with horror as wayne presented their conclusion they must do nothing to disturb the artist within his sim chamber with its automated if bizarre treatment he and natalie had been utterly convinced and so convincing releasing the artist from his dreams of earth replacing them with the hereandnow of the ship after all this time would only shatter whatever reality his mind still recognized and unsaid but understood it would very likely stop his art so they resigned themselves to being his keepers to hiding the dark secret within the bowels of the ship and to sharing the art with as many as possible huong wasnt the only one to have nightmares since how dare he set himself as their conscience huongs small eyes glittered at susan as though he heard her thoughts or as though he were close to tears his emotions were becoming embarrassingly public as he aged perhaps a consequence of outliving most who had walked onto the ship with him ive found out where he came from he said calmly enough i know the truth what tony the ships senior stellar cartographer ran one hand over his closecropped hair then down over his face as if to smooth away an expression hed rather not share how where susan understood his dismay tony had taken the greatest risk of them all using his clearance and knowledge to search the ships records for any clue as to the origin of the artist on the ship hed found nothing nothing to explain how the ships senior psychologist dr randall clarke had been able to requisition then hide the construction of this chamber at the edge of livable gravity inside the immense core of pilgrim iii nothing to identify the artist even when theyd taken advantage of the automatics and obtained dna samples from his unconscious body nothing to challenge their assumption that the artist suffered from some delusional state some flaw dr clarke had been treating him for in this private hidden place some condition too severe to allow exposure to the ships environment or company our past is recorded in places other than the ships systems mr bridge officer huong said with deliberate irony tell us what youve learned wayne ordered impatiently huong spoke slowly methodically as if to impress each word on them all did randall mention his wife to any of you they didnt look at susan but she felt their focus on her everyone knew she and randall had been lovers until his death is this relevant she asked coldly very then no i didnt know he had ever married oh yes in fact randall was supposed to board with his wife yet tonys checked the manifest ships records clearly show randall arriving alone where did you find this information tom demanded hed found the datacube giving directions to this place in randalls cabin safeotherwise they might never have discovered it sometimes the thought made susan weak the beauty and richness of the artists work languishing as dustcovered rolls on the floor where the automatics dumped them no classes of school children seeing his work awed by their own past made manifest theyd have reached orbit around new earth moved to the surface and started their new lives all unaware while the great seed ship reconstructed itself as an orbital platform its automatics sweeping up and recycling the dead organics of the artist and his art she shivered their attention was distracted by the artist as he stretched then scratched one wrinkled buttock absently before settling back to his labours corridor sale susan blinked trying to imagine staid conservative huong visiting one of the hundreds of junk sales that went on throughout the colonists section of the ship they werent particularly legal but the captains had long ago relented secondgen officers tending to be more practical than those raised and trained earthside besides being a useful diversion for the colonists the sales redistributed personal goods no longer obtainable from their source i picked up a collection of gossip mags in the last one huong paused patiently as natalie laughed it was worth it i found our late psychologistand his wife in a gossip mag susan said with disbelief the wife charlette dord was an athlete turned sports broadcaster a bit of a celebrity in her way i found several images of them togetherthe captions refer to randall only as her husband but you can see him plainly enough here huong drew a datacube out of his pocket and tossed it to susan numbly she walked over to the nearest reader panel and inserted the cube the rectangular screen produced an image of a group of people at some public event randalls thin face with its surprisingly sensual lips was easy enough to recognize despite the passage of years he had one arm possessively around the shoulders of an incredibly beautiful woman susan smoothed the skirt over her ample hips before she could resist the impulse i know that face natalie breathed so would anyone on the ship susan thought those classic features and warm smile were straight from the artists most popular work almost every cabin had its copy of the angelic figure hovering arms spread to shield the earth from the dark of space the serene loveliness of the perfect yet sohuman face a comfort to folk all too aware they were separated from vacuum by only a hull and skills both a generation stale pull up the faces behind them huong ordered as if this revelation wasnt enough susan did so watching with the others as three faces from the background became clearer the centermost a young man was plainly not paying attention to the photographer or event his dark familiar eyes were fixed on charlette susan turned off the image inexplicably frightened by the longing captured in that one look huong didnt object trapping them instead with his slow voice charlette died in a car accident six months before pilgrim iii began final assembly the accident took place over one hundred miles from their home the car contained her luggage and there was an unconfirmed witness report that someone else had been driving the car randall was apparently questioned by police then released after all he was going offworld for the rest of his life what point in pursuing an investigation wayne moved closer to the viewscreen covering the opposite wall his face shadowed and grim as he stared at the artist susan wanted to refuse his vision to see a patient under sophisticated care not a victim her lips moved numbly youre saying the artist is that young man in the image youre accusing randall of murdering his wife and somehow arranging to kidnap and imprison her lover bringing him on the ship randall was on the planning team natalie said reluctantly he had the access and opportunity to make modifications why susan breathed whylike this huong answered we can guess revenge randall could be ruthless we all knew that about him no one disagreed pilgrim iii was immense as colony ships had to be it would be their childrens children who reached humanitys latest new frontier in the meantime the ship was a world onto itself shelter workplace and space for growth yet her thousands of inhabitants existed within smaller insular communities communities that had to get along or fail to function the scientific community was one and randall had not endeared himself to many in it susan was the first to admit that her social standing with her peers had improved after her lover choked to death on his favourite synthetic sweetmeat now you know what i believe the artist is no madman cared for in an automated sim to calm his delusions and keep him functioning he isor wasas sane as any of us before being tortured by our colleague a man who perverted his knowledge to harm not heal the artist does not belong in this travesty of a life and so we agree huong said swiveling to look at each of them his hand rising slowly as if to lift some curtain it is time wayne shook his head an identical gesture to his first response to huongs plea and susan felt her heart starting to pound for no reason she cared to admit no wayne replied we cant why huongs eyes blazed he raised his fists in the air in the name of justice why not dont you believe me susan answered when no one else spoke it doesnt matter the artist lives in his own world at peace you know that huong and if we free him now so close to his end what are we offering him in return your theory that all he has suffered was to satisfy one mans desire for revenge that whatever purpose he found to sustain himself has been a lie she paused for emphasis that his very world is gone huongs face was deathly pale what do you care about him his finger stabbed the air first at natalie then at wayne youd keep him locked away just to hide your mistakes his finger stabbed at tom you for an excuse to break the rules then at tony youre terrified of the captains judgment and you susan stared at the nowshaking fingertip targeting her you want to keep your lovers legacy for yourself dont you i know you believe his art belongs to you rant all you want huong natalie countered her voice a shade too calm whatever you think are our reasons youve missed the most important one of all our shipmates they believe the art they love is the secret work of someone among us someone keeping our heritage alive in a way no datacube can do you wish to tarnish their feelings for his work turn his accomplishments into this sordid melodrama we must not consider this one individual above the good of the ship there was a murmur of agreement susan sensed their resolve hardening so did huong at what cost he asked his passion drained away at last replaced by disgust at what cost he repeated susan found nothing to say huong turned and left the room his feet dragging with each step will he go to the captains tony asked it wasnt a meaningless concern theyd used their privileged ranks to hide what theyd found to produce the art as if by some miracle if huong told now they would all become suspect at the very least they would lose control of their departments to underlings and have their work scrutinized for the remainder of their lives in many ways pilgrim iii was not a large ship at all no wayne said going over to gaze down at the image of the legion captured in time one legionnaire looked back at him as if seeking an unknown enemy huong protests he goads us to do what he believes is right but he also knows we have no choice the artist will live a year more at best perhaps only months whatever fantasy fills his mind whatever beloved view of home comforts him let him keep it let him finish his work when he is gonethen it will be time to tell his story wayne sighed at least as much of his story as we choose to tell thanks to him humanity will not forget its past there was a blank sevensided canvas ready underneath he sat on one corner of it half his mind already planning the other half gently engaged watching his watchers sliding past tentacle upon tentacle eyes rolling from side to side he believed he understood now both their purpose and his he picked up an alien crayon nodded a proud acknowledgment to the race that forced its guilty millions to parade in shame before him and prepared to record another piece of human history as long he lived humanity would not be forgotten for like that precious bird kept until death in a glass cage for all to see wasnt he the last passenger of earth simulacrum ken liu a photograph is not only an image as a painting is an image an interpretation of the real it is also a trace something directly stenciled off the real like a footprint or a death mask susan sontag paul larimore you are already recording i should start okay anna was an accident both erin and i were traveling a lot for work and we didnt want to be tied down but you cant plan for everything and we were genuinely happy when we found out well make it work somehow we said and we did when anna was a baby she wasnt a very good sleeper she had to be carried and rocked as she gradually drifted to sleep fighting against it the whole time you couldnt be still erin had a bad back for months after the birth and so it was me who walked around at night with the little girls head against my shoulder after feedings although i know i must have been very tired and impatient all i remember now is how close i felt to her as we moved back and forth for hours across the living room lit only by moonlight while i sang to her i wanted to feel that close to her always i have no simulacra of her from back then the prototype machines were very bulky and the subject had to sit still for hours that wasnt going to happen with a baby this is the first simulacrum i do have of her shes about seven hello sweetheart dad dont be shy these men are here to make a documentary movie about us you dont have to talk to them just pretend theyre not here can we go to the beach you know we cant we cant leave the house besides its too cold outside will you play dolls with me yes of course well play dolls as long as you want anna larimore my father is a hard person for the world to dislike he has made a great deal of money in a way that seems like an american fairy tale lone inventor comes up with an idea that brings joy to the world and the world rewards him deservedly on top of it all he donates generously to worthy causes the larimore foundation has cultivated my fathers name and image as carefully as the studios airbrush the celebrity sex simulacra that they sell but i know the real paul larimore one day when i was thirteen i had to be sent home because of an upset stomach i came in the front door and i heard noises from my parents bedroom upstairs they werent supposed to be home no one was a robber i thought in the fearless and stupid way of teenagers i went up the stairs and i opened the door my father was naked in bed and there were four naked women with him he didnt hear me and so they continued what they were doing there in the bed that my mother shared with him after a while he turned around and we looked into each others eyes he stopped sat up and reached out to turn off the projector on the nightstand the women disappeared i threw up when my mother came home later that night she explained to me that it had been going on for years my father had a weakness for a certain kind of woman she said throughout their marriage he had trouble being faithful she had suspected this was the case but my father was very intelligent and careful and she had no evidence when she finally caught him in the act she was furious and wanted to leave him but he begged and pleaded he said that there was something in his make up that made real monogamy impossible for him but he said he had a solution he had taken many simulacra of his conquests over the years more and more lifelike as he improved the technology if my mother would let him keep them and tolerate his use of them in private he would try very hard to not stray again so this was the bargain that my mother made he was a good father she thought she knew that he loved me she did not want to make me an additional casualty of a broken promise that was only made to her and my fathers proposal did seem like a reasonable solution in her mind his time with the simulacra was no different from the way other men used pornography no touching was involved they were not real no marriage could survive if it did not contain some room for harmless fantasies but my mother did not look into my fathers eyes the way i did when i walked in on him it was more than a fantasy it was a continuing betrayal that could not be forgiven paul larimore the key to the simulacrum camera is not the physical imaging process which while not trivial is ultimately not much more than the culmination of incremental improvements on technologies known since the days of the daguerreotype my contribution to the eternal quest of capturing reality is the oneiropagida through which a snapshot of the subjects mental patternsa representation of her personalitycan be captured digitized and then used to reanimate the image during projection the oneiropagida is at the heart of all simulacrum cameras including those made by my competitors the earliest cameras were essentially modified medical devices similar to those legacy tomography machines you still see at old hospitals the subject had to have certain chemicals injected into her body and then lie still for a long time in the devices imaging tunnel until an adequate set of scans of her mental processes could be taken these were then used to seed ai neural models which then animated the projections constructed from detailed photographs of her body these early attempts were very crude and the results were described variously as robotic inhuman or even comically insane but even these earliest simulacra preserved something that could not be captured by mere videos or holography instead of replaying verbatim what was captured the animated projection could interact with the viewer in the way that the subject would have the oldest simulacrum that still exists is one of myself now preserved at the smithsonian in the first news reports friends and acquaintances who interacted with it said that although they knew that the image was controlled by a computer they elicited responses from it that seemed somehow paul thats something only paul would say or thats a very paul facial expression it was then that i knew i had succeeded anna larimore people find it strange that i the daughter of the inventor of simulacra write books about how the world would be better off without them more authentic some have engaged in tiresome pop psychology suggesting that i am jealous of my sibling the invention of my father that turned out to be his favorite child if only it were so simple my father proclaims that he works in the business of capturing reality of stopping time and preserving memory but the real attraction of such technology has never been about capturing reality photography videography holography the progression of such realitycapturing technology has been a proliferation of ways to lie about reality to shape and distort it to manipulate and fantasize people shape and stage the experiences of their lives for the camera go on vacations with one eye glued to the video camera the desire to freeze reality is about avoiding reality the simulacra are the latest incarnation of this trend and the worst paul larimore ever since that day when she well i expect that you have already heard about it from her i will not dispute her version of events we have never spoken about that day to each other what she does not know is that after that afternoon i destroyed all the simulacra of my old affairs i kept no backups i expect that knowing this will not make any difference to her but i would be grateful if you can pass this knowledge on to her conversations between us after that day were civil careful performances that avoided straying anywhere near intimacy we spoke about permission slips the logistics of having her come to my office to solicit sponsors for walkathons factors to consider in picking a college we did not speak about her easy friendships her difficult loves her hopes for and disappointments with the world anna stopped speaking to me completely when she went off to college when i called she would not pick up the phone when she needed a disbursement from her trust to pay tuition she would call my lawyer she spent her vacations and summers with friends or working overseas some weekends she would invite erin up to visit her in palo alto we all understood that i was not invited dad why is the grass green its because the green from the leaves on the trees drips down with the spring rain thats ridiculous all right its because you are looking at it from this side of the fence if you go over to the other side it wont be so green you are not funny okay its because of chlorophyll in the grass the chlorophyll has rings in it that absorb all colors of light except green youre not making this up are you would i ever make anything up sweetheart its very hard to tell with you sometimes i began to play this simulacrum of her often when she was in high school and over time it became a bit of a habit now i keep her on all the time every day there were later simulacra when she was older many of them with far better resolution but this one is my favorite it reminded me of better times before the world changed irrevocably the day i took this we finally managed to make an oneiropagida that was small enough to fit within a chassis that could be carried on your shoulder that later became the prototype for the carousel mark i our first successful home simulacrum camera i brought it home and asked anna to pose for it she stood still next to the sun porch for two minutes while we chatted about her day she was perfect in the way that little daughters are always perfect in the eyes of their fathers her eyes lit up when she saw that i was home she had just come back from day camp and she was full of stories she wanted to tell me and questions she wanted to ask me she wanted me to take her to the beach to fly her new kite and i promised to help her with her sunprint kit i was glad to have captured her at that moment that was a good day anna larimore the last time my father and i saw each other was after my mothers accident his lawyer called knowing that i would not have answered my father my mother was conscious but barely the other driver was already dead and she was going to follow soon after why cant you forgive him she said i have a mans life is not defined by one thing he loves me and he loves you i said nothing i only held her hand and squeezed it he came in and we both spoke to her but not to each other and after half an hour she went to sleep and did not wake up the truth was i was ready to forgive him he looked olda quality that children are among the last to notice about their parentsand there was a kind of frailty about him that made me question myself we walked silently out of the hospital together he asked if i had a place to stay in the city and i said no he opened the passenger side door and after hesitating for only a second i slipped into his car we got home and it was exactly the way i remembered it even though i hadnt been home in years i sat at the dinner table while he prepared frozen dinners we spoke carefully to each other the way we used to when i was in high school i asked him for a simulacrum of my mother i dont take simulacra or keep them as a rule i dont have the same rosy view of them as the general public but at that moment i thought i understood their appeal i wanted a piece of my mother to be always with me an aspect of her presence he handed me a disc and i thanked him he offered me the use of his projector but i declined i wanted to keep the memory of my mother by myself for a while before letting the computers extrapolations confuse real memories with madeup ones and as things turned out ive never used that simulacrum here you can take a look at it later if you want to see what she looked like whatever i remember of my mother its all real it was late by the time we finished dinner and i excused myself i walked up to my room and i saw the sevenyear old me sitting on my bed she had on this hideous dress that i must have blocked out of my memorypink flowery and there was a bow in her hair hello im anna pleased to meet you so he had kept this thing around for years this naïve helpless caricature of me during the time i did not speak to him did he turn to this frozen trace of me and contemplate this shadow of my lost faith and affection did he use this model of my childhood to fantasize about the conversations that he could not have with me did he even edit it perhaps to remove my petulance to add in more saccharine devotion i felt violated the little girl was undeniably me she acted like me spoke like me laughed and moved and reacted like me but she was not me i had grown and changed and id come to face my father as an adult but now i found a piece of myself had been taken and locked into this thing a piece that allowed him to maintain a sense of connection with me that i did not want that was not real the image of those naked women in his bed from years ago came rushing back i finally understood why for so long they had haunted my dreams it is the way a simulacrum replicates the essence of the subject that makes it so compelling when my father kept those simulacra of his women around he maintained a connection to them to the man he was when he had been with them and thus committed a continuing emotional betrayal that was far worse than a momentary physical indiscretion a pornographic image is a pure visual fantasy but a simulacrum captures a state of mind a dream but whose dream what i saw in his eyes that day was not sordid it was too intimate by keeping and replaying this old simulacrum of my childhood he was dreaming himself into reclaiming my respect and love instead of facing the reality of what he had done and the real me perhaps it is the dream of every parent to keep his or her child in that brief period between helpless dependence and separate selfhood when the parent is seen as perfect faultless it is a dream of control and mastery disguised as love the dream that lear had about cordelia i walked down the stairs and out of the house and i have not spoken to him since paul larimore a simulacrum lives in the eternal now it remembers but only hazily since the oneiropagida does not have the resolution to discern and capture the subjects every specific memory it learns up to a fashion but the further you stray from the moment the subjects mental life was captured the less accurate the computers extrapolations even the best cameras we offer cant project beyond a couple of hours but the oneiropagida is exquisite at capturing her mood the emotional flavor of her thoughts the quirky triggers for her smiles the lilt of her speech the precise inarticulable quality of her turns of phrase and so every two hours or so anna resets shes again coming home from day camp and again shes full of questions and stories for me we talk we have fun we let our chat wander wherever it will no conversation is ever the same but shes forever the curious sevenyear old who worshipped her father and who thought he could do no wrong dad will you tell me a story yes of course what story would you like i want to hear your cyberpunk version of pinocchio again im not sure if i can remember everything i said last time its okay just start ill help you i love her so much erin larimore my baby i dont know when youll get this maybe it will only be after im gone you cant skip over the next part its a recording i want you to hear what i have to say your father misses you he is not perfect and he has committed his share of sins the same as any man but you have let that one moment when he was at his weakest overwhelm the entirety of your life together you have compressed him the whole of his life into that one frozen afternoon that sliver of him that was most flawed in your mind you traced that captured image again and again until the person was erased by the stencil during all these years when you have locked him out your father played an old simulacrum of you over and over laughing joking pouring his heart out to you in a way that a sevenyear old would understand i would ask you on the phone if youd speak to him and then i couldnt bear to watch as i hung up while he went back to play the simulacrum again see him for who he really is hello there have you seen my daughter anna breakaway backdown james patrick kelly you know in space nobody wears shoes well new temps wear slippers they make the soles out of that adhesive polymer griprite or griptite sounds like paper ripping when you lift your feet temps whove been up awhile wear this glove thing that snugs around the toes the breakaways they go barefoot you cant really walk much in space so theyve reinvented their feet so they can pick up screwdrivers and spoons and stuff its hard because you lose fine motor control in micro gee i had have this friend elena who could make a krill and tomato sandwich with her feet but she had that operation that changes your big toe into a thumb i used to kid her that maybe breakaways were climbing down the evolutionary ladder not jumping off it are we people or chimps shed scratch her armpits and hoot sure breakaways have a sense of humor theyre people after all its just that theyre like no people you know the thing was elena was so limber that she could bite her toenails so can you fix my shoe how long is that going to take why not just glue the heel back on i know theyre donya durands but ive got a party in half an hour okay what you think im going to walk around town barefoot ill waitexcept whats with all these lights its two in the morning and youve got this place bright as noon in khartoum how about a little respect for the night thanks what did you say your name was im cleo you are are you jane honey lots of people think about going to space but youd be surprised at how few actually applymuch less break away so how old are you oh no they like them young just as long as youre over nineteen no kids in space so the stats dont scare you not shoe repair thats for sure but if you can convince them youre serious theyll find something for you to do they trained me and i was nobody a business major i temped for almost fifteen months on victor foxtrot and i never could decide whether i loved or hated it still cant so how could i even think about becoming a breakaway everything is loose up there okay it makes you come unstuck the first thing that happens is you get spacesick for a week your insides are so scrambled that youre trying to digest lunch with your cerebellum and write memos with your large intestine meanwhile your face puffs up so that you cant find yourself in the mirror anymore and your sinuses fill with cotton candy and youre fighting a daily hair mutiny i mightve backed down right off if it hadnt been for elenyou know the one with the clever toes then when youre totally miserable and empty and disoriented your brain sorts things out again and you realize its all magic some astrofairy has enchanted you your body is as light as a whisper free as air ill tell you the most amazing thing about weightlessness it doesnt go away you keep falling down up sideways whatever you might bump into something once in a while but you never ever slam into the ground extremely sexy but it does take some getting used to i kept having dreams about gravity down here you have a whole planet hugging you but in space its not only you thats enchanted its all your stuff too for instance if you put that brush down it stays it doesnt decide to drift across the room and out the window and go visit elena over on b deck i had this pin that had been my mothersa silver dove with a diamond eyeand somehow it escaped from a locked jewelry box turned up two months later in a dish of butterscotch pudding almost broke jack pitzers tooth you get a lot of pudding in space oatmeal stews sticky food is easier to eat and you cant taste much of anything but salt and sweet anyway why do you think im babbling god i am babbling it must be the zentadone the woman at the persona store said it was just supposed to be an icebreaker with a flirty edge to it like panital only more sincere you wouldnt have any reset would you hey spare me the lecture honey i know they dont allow personas in space anyway imprinting is just a bunch of probrain propaganda personas are temporaryperiod when you stop taking the pills the personas go away and youre your plain old vanilla self again theres bushels of studies that say so im just taking a little vacation from cleo maybe ill go away for a weekend or a week or a month but eventually ill come home always have always will i dont care what your jesus puppet says you cant trust godware okay look im not going to convince you and youre not going to convince me truce the shoes four five years lets see i bought them in five years i had to store them while i was up you get used to walking in spike heels actually i mean im not going to run a marathon or climb the matterhorn elena has all these theories of why men think spikes are sexy okay theyre kind of a short term body mod they stress the leg muscles which makes you look tense which leads most men to assume you could use a serious screwing and they push your fanny out like youre making the world an offer but most important is that when youre teetering around in heels it tells a man that if he chases you youre not going to get very far not only do spike heels say youre vulnerable they say youve chosen to be vulnerable of course its not quite the same in micro gee she was my mentor elena assigned to teach me how to live in space i was an ag tech worked as a germ wrangler in the edens microorganisms okay you probably think that if you stick a seed in some dirt add some water and sunlight and wait a couple of months mother nature hands you a head of lettuce doesnt work that way especially not in space the edens are synergistic symbiotic ecologies your carbo crops your protein crops your vitamin cropstheyre all fussy about the neighborhood germs if you dont keep your clostridia and rhizobium in balance your eden will rot to compost stinky slimy compost its important workand duller than accounting it wouldnt have been so bad if we couldve talked on the job but co in the edens runs which is great for plants but will kill you if youre not wearing a breather elena painted an enormous smile on mine with about eight hundred teeth in it she had lips on hers puckered so that they looked like she was ready to be kissed alpha ralpha the chicken man had this plastic beak only sometimes we switchedconfused the hell out of the nature lovers ill tell you the job wouldve been a lot easier if we couldve kept the rest of the crew out but the edens are designed for recreation as much as food production on victor foxtrot we had to have signups between and see the edens have lots of open space and we keep them eight degrees over crew deck nominal and theyre lit twenty hours a day by grolights and solar mirrors and they have big windows crew floats around sucking up the view soaking up photons communing with the life force shredding foliage and in general getting in our way breakaways are the worst they actually adopt plants like they were pets is that crazy or what i mean a tomato has a life span of three maybe four months before it gets too leggy and stops bearing ive seen grown men cry because elena pulled up their favorite marigold no all my plants now are silk when i backed down i realized that i didnt want anything to do with the day my family was a bunch of poor nobodies we moved to the night when i was seven so nightshifting was like coming home the fact is i got too much sun while i was up the sun is not my friend havent seen real daylight in over a year i make a point of it i have a daynight timeshare at lincoln street under while the sun is shining im asleep or safely cocooned at dusk my roomie comes home and i go out to work and play hey being a mommy to legumes is not what i miss about space how about you what turned you into an owl well well maybe you are serious about breaking away sure they prefer recruits whove nightshifted shows them youve got circadian discipline elena said something like that once she said that its hard to scare someone to death in broad daylight it isnt just that the daytime is too crowded its too tame the night is edgier scarier sexier you say and do things that wouldnt occur to you at lunchtime its because we dont really belong in the night in order to survive here we have to fight all the old instincts warning us not to wander around in the dark because we might fall off a cliff or get eaten by a sabertoothed tiger living in the night gives you a kind of extra i dont know right and its the same with space its even scarier and sexier well maybe sexy isnt exactly the right word but you know what i mean actually i think thats what i miss most about it i was more alive then that i ever was before maybe too alive people live fast up there they know the stats they have to you know you sort of remind me of elena must be the eyesit sure as hell isnt the body if you ever get up give her a shout youd like her even though she doesnt wear shoes anymore almost a year i wish we could talk more but its hard she transferred to the marathon theyre out surveying saturns moons theres like a three hour lag its impossible to have realtime conversation she sent a few vids but it hurt too much to watch them they were all happy chat you know nothing important in them i didnt plan on missing her so much so you have any college credits no real difference between harvard and a net school unless youre some kind of snob about bricks now thats a hell of a thing to be asking a perfect stranger what do i look like some three star slut dont make assumptions just because im wearing spiked heels for all you know honey i could be dating a basketball player maybe im tired of staring at his navel when we dance if youre going to judge people by appearances hey youre the one with the machine stigmata whats that supposed to be rust or dried blood well you ought to be though actually thats what everyone wants to know that and how do you go to the bathroom truth is jane sex is complicated like everything about space first of all forget all that stuff youve heard about doing it while youre floating free its dangerous hard work and no fun you want to have sex in space one or both of you have to be tied down most hetero temps use some kind of a joystrap its this wide circular elastic that fits around you and your partner helps you stay coupled okay but even with all the gear sex can be kind of subtle as in disappointing you dont realize how erotic weight is until there isnt any you want to make love to a balloon some people do nothing but oralkeeps the vectors down of course the breakaways theyve reinvented love just like everything else they have this kind of sex where they dont move if theres penetration they just float in place staring into one anothers eyes or some such until they tell one another that its time to have an orgasm and then they do if theyre homo they just touch each other elena tried to show me how once i dont know why but it didnt happen for me maybe i was too embarrassed because i was the only one naked she said id learn eventually that it was part of breaking away no i thought i was going to break away i really did i stuck it out until the very last possible day its hard to explain i mean when nobodies on earth look up at nightno offense jane i was one toowhat calls them is the romance of it all the high frontier okay sheena steele and captain kirk cowboys and asteroids kid stuff except they dont let kids in space because of the cancer then you go up and once youre done puking you realize that it was all propaganda space is boring and its indescribably magic at the same timehow can that be sometimes id be working in an eden and id look out the windows and id see earth blue as a dream and id think of all the people down there twelve billion ants looking up into the night and wondering what it was like to be me i swear i could feel their envy as sure as i can feel your floor beneath me now its part of what holds you up when youre in space you know youre not an ant there are fewer than twenty thousand breakaways youre brave and youre doomed and youre different from everyone else who has ever lived only then your shift ends and its time to go to the gym and spend three hours pumping the ergorack in a squeeze suit to fight muscle loss in case you decide to back down ill tell you being a temp is hell the rack is hard work if youre not exhausted afterward you havent done it right and you sweat god see the sweat doesnt run off it pools in the small of your back and the crook of your arm and under your chin and clings there shivering like an amoeba and while youre slaving on the rack elena is getting work done or reading or sleeping or talking about you with her breakaway pals they have three more hours in their day see and they dont ever have to worry about backing down then every nine weeks you have to leave what youre doing and visit one of the wheel habitats and readjust to your weight for a week so that when you come back to victor foxtrot you get spacesick all over again but you tell yourself its all worth it because its not only space that youre exploring its yourself how many people can say that you have to find out who you are so that you decide what to hold onto and what to let go of excuse me i cant talk about this anymore right now no ill be all right only okay so you dont have any reset you must have some kind of flash thatll have to do tell you what ill buy the whole liter from you ahh ethanol with a pedigree but a real backdown kind of drug janeweighs way too much to bring out of the gravity well and besides the flash is about the same as hitting yourself over the head with the bottle want a slug come on its twothirty time to start the party youre making me late you know do me a favor would you pass me those shoes on the shelf there no no the blue ones yes beautiful real leather right i love leather shoes theyre like faces i mean you can polish them but once they get wrinkles youre stuck with them look at my face okay see these wrinkles here right at the corner of my eyes got them working in the edens too much sun how old do you think i am twentynine but thats okay i was up fifteen months and it only aged me four years still my permanent bone loss is less than eight percent and ive built my muscles back up and i only picked up eighteen rads and im not half as crazy as i used to be hey im a walking advertisement for backing down so have i talked you out of it yet i dont mean to okay id probably go up again if theyd have me dont plan on it the wheel habitats are strictly for tourists they cost ten times as much to build as a micro gee can and once youre in one youre pretty much stuck to the rim and youre still getting zapped by cosmic rays and solar xrays and energetic neutrons if youre going to risk living in space you might as well enjoy it besides all the important work gets done by breakaways see thats where youre wrong its like elena used to say we didnt conquer space it conquered us break away and youre giving up forty maybe fifty years of life okay the stats dont lie fiftysix is the average that means some breakaways die even younger you dont well good for you hey it looks greatbetter than new how much does that include the vodka well thanks listen jane im going to tell you something a secret they ought to tell everybody before they go up no im not promise so anyway on my breakaway day elena calls me to her room and tells me that she doesnt think i should do it that i wont be happy living in space im so stunned that i start crying which is a very backdown thing to do i try to argue but shes been mentoring for years and knows what shes talking about only about a third breakawaybut of course you know that anyway it gets strange then she says to me i have something to show you and then she starts to strip see the time shed made love to me she wouldnt let me do anything to her and like i said shed kept her clothes on breakaways have this thing about showing themselves to temps i mean id seen her hands before her feet they looked like spiders and id seen her face kissed it even but now im looking at her naked body for the first time shes fiftyone years old i think she mustve been taller than me once but its hard to be sure because she has the deep micro gee slouch her muscles have atrophied so her papery skin looks as if its been sprayed onto her bones shes had both breasts prophylactically removed ive got bonerot she says and i mass thirtyeight kilos she shows the scars from the operations to remove her thyroid and ovaries the tap on her hip where they take the monthly biopsy to test for leukemia look at me she says what do you see i start to tell her that ive read the literature and watched all the vids and im prepared for whats going to happen but she shushes me do you think im beautiful she says all i can do is stare i think i am she says so do the others its our nature cleo this is how space makes us over can you tell me you want this to happen to you and i couldnt see she knew me better than i knew myself what i wanted was to float forever to feel i was special to stay with her maybe i was in love with her i dont know if thats possible but loving someone isnt a reason to break away especially if the stats say that someone will be dead in five years so i told her she was right and thanked her for everything shed done and got on the shuttle that same day and backed down and became just another nobody and she gave up mentoring and went to saturn and now that weve forgotten all about each other we can start living happily ever after no heres the secret honey the heart is a muscle okay that means it shrinks in space all breakaways know it now you do too anyway its been nice talking to you sure good night saying the names maggie clark on the shuttle out to our connecting flight the bo assigned to my mission fixes the bulge of his eyes unwaveringly upon me i was told to expect this the species so alien to death it finds our every parting curious its sense of privacy so absent not one of its fortythree languages contains the word though ldrive allows us to return long before our loved ones pass on just the thought of my journeys purpose already has me pining for home of all the ways ive imagined meeting my father as defense council in his murder trial does not rank high on the list our shuttle crests the white round of the lships hull powering down nonessentials while preparing to dock i can bear the bos steady gaze even less in the dark inflight i dream vega iii my home world holds a species of deepwater squid that can regress at will to any prior phase in its development when i was small my mother introduced me to this creature as a means of describing the bo and with them my fathers permanent absence no more was ever said about either the man or the mission and for years i thought of the bo as slimy cephalopods forever darting from the light not until the academy did my perception of the species take its proper form of large mottled amphibians with forelimbs caught between quadrupedal and bipedal use who did indeed revert to earlier stages of development when their warts grew too big for them to move before then as a child embroiled in misconceptions i dreamed of my father trapped at the bottom of the bos oceans assailed by giant barbed tentacles in underground caves now he is indeed held prisoner as best the bo understand the term and while hurtling towards him in a prison all its own my subconscious returns to these vague inky nightmares of my youth when i wake for meals taken with the crew in a long narrow galley sporting tiny portholes to the stars we can hear the bo singing through the ventilation shafts i find it hard sometimes just to chew the captain sits with me the day before our arrival he has the appropriate look of a spacemanhardened lank with an indifferent cast about his beard hands lanced with burns and calluses from his work i think he expects some move on my part for his companionshipthe novice travelers last desperate cleaving to the familiar before ejection into the great and terrible unknownbut ive decided to wait for the return trip to make such an overture and only then if i cant bring my father home captain sedgwick sets a small parcel before me whats this in the wrapping i find two small devices each the size of an earbud white noise he says youll need it to work to sleep is it that loud its that constant i have a portable thats not enough here he shows me the settings each ones capacity to block out bo songs on select frequencies youre going to be speaking i gather for the trial of course but surely then it never stops it cant stop you know the story of the first ambassador and the last yes i worry hell go on anyway but the captain accepts my response at face value or at least seems not to unduly favor the sound of his own voice well hold to it then they abbreviate nothing sentences can go on for days and they dont take kindly to being told to keep it short youre better off just blocking out the background bits thanks i remember the story of the ambassador from conflict differentials at the academy where it served as a classic anecdote on the limits of preparation the poor overeducated man in this case thought to ask what the bo called themselves and their home world so he might see both proper names used throughout the galaxy in place of other species words pleased by this gesture the bo proceeded to speak the names as they did everything elseat length and sparing no historical or biological detail for the first three hours captivated by the sudden wealth of data the ambassador recorded everything noting patterns where he could grappling with obscure referents whenever they emerged but by the fourth exhausted and thinking at last of the realpolitik of his original query he asked if there might be some shorter variant he could write down instead though slow to speak his counterparts were surprisingly quick to anger abbreviation an act of offense of disdain with no equal among their kind in the immediacy of their contempt they gave the ambassador one syllable bo to serve for both requests and thereafter declared a complete disinterest in diplomacy with the rest of the galaxy its vast species all clearly lacking either the intelligence or civility to learn real words the utterance of these vehement declarations of course took a week all its own during which time the ambassador suffered a massive heart attack from the constant thunderous rebukes directed against his person and soon afterone hopes with a modicum of regretthe bo shipped his body and field notes home no ambassadorship has since existed on their planet and even scientists avoid the territory my father is the first in four human generations to make bo his home captain sedgwick hesitates at the entrance to my berth your father yes if hes found guilty now its my turn to hesitate like you said the bo dont abbreviate anything and they dont take kindly to those who do captain sedgwick nods drumming his hand once on the frame of my door i study the floor so as not to watch him when he goes i had never even seen a picture of my father until his vid showed up at my office requesting my presence on an alien planet with no readily discernible criminal code still when the bo bring him to meet my shuttlehis hair long matted and graying his body broad and lean and gaunti cant help thinking how much hes changed how tired he now looks bo is a tidallylocked world one side of the planet forever scorched by the heat and light of its sun the other cast in perpetual darkness and cold yet for a particular stretch of land along the circumference between opposing halves the constant flux of hot and cold creates an oasis where life somehow prevails what manner of life is debatable however where the shuttle sets downpresumably a metropolis from the intensity of bo songs aloneit is foggy and dark and i think it no wonder that a human should look wilted under such an oppressive absence of sun at the very least the bo do not have my father in restraints when i arrive indeed they seem perfectly uncertain how best to handle him and say as much in ceaseless song to one another their hindlegs and throat sacs rumbling with agitated words on at least two different wavelengths apiece i wish i could be so open with my own uncertainty approaching my father for the first time with no sense of what to do next shake hands embrace my father bows his head then looks at me with an uncomfortable smile hello nia im glad you came be angry yes this is an option id forgotten a feeling id pushed aside for years it rears its head now at my fathers proximity the almost amused quality of guilt upon his face be angry yes and make damn sure the bo spare my fathers life so i have time to be angry some more the bo have not yet finished their death songs for the one my father is said to have killed and the city rumbles with this unrelenting grief as we walk the briny length of the docks under escort marsh homes emerge to either side of us in the fog while a thread of golden light persists on distant waters recalling the intractable sun just beyond absent a routine for criminal courts the bo permit my father to move where he will during waking hours but he is under strict curfew and no bo will look favorably upon escape if they cannot speak the way they must they are silent my father says the bo who came with youhe said nothing of course thats how they survive on the rare occasions they travel among us so if theyre suddenly silent no ones going to come running right but its still uncommon most often it signals an impending regression which they do alone away from the noise quite the opposite they regress in plain sight with as much noise around them as possible my father pauses a measure of excitement rising in his voice actually its what i came here to studythe function of that regression its mechanisms when i make no reply he continues gathering steam you see evolutionarily the bo are already extraordinary they exist in a narrow margin of viable territory in the middle of a planet of extremes so of course theres little competition and few possible niches to fill consequently they lack the evolutionary incentive to evolve fully out of vestigial forms and boast a wealth of intermediate features practically unheard of at this level of sentience but then as if that werent enough theres also their ability to regress a process weve only seen among rudimentary species beforeaquatic animals mostly and some insects on vega iii even theres a squid yes i know he registers my tone and cuts his lecture short nia he says gently i find i cant look directly at him we have a lot of casework to cover he waits but my position does not improve all right he says at last there is an unpleasant weight in his words now a pointed brevity what do you want to know the bo assigned to me has a large dark patch of skin around his left eye a welcome distinction that allows me to pick it out from others in a crowd i think to wish it good night after my father is taken away and im escorted to quarters of my own but i worry the cursory words might cause offense and of course with the sky here dark at all hours illumined only slightly by twin orange moons on the horizon the concept of night also seems moot i am thus neither surprised nor upset when the bo leaves without speaking one word to me its hindlegs humming general notes of exhaustion as it lurches into the street better silence i imagine than diplomatic incident i too am exhausted but even with sedgwicks white noise buds turned on i lie awake in my pod replaying my fathers words and reconstructing the scene of the bos sudden death according to my father the deceased was his laboratory assistant a bo who predominantly sang words of discovery while collecting soil and water samples from the metropolitan marshlands listening to my fathers detailed description of eventsthe circumstances under which he and the bo met and hashed out a working relationship the hours preceding the bos unfortunate demise the means by which its death became suspectthe complexity of my task grows painfully apparent the bo are so suspicious of brevity so dependent on motive for truth that to ask potential corroborating witnesses their side of the story bears all the telltale signs of walking a minefield will they trust me will they speak and if so how long will all their answers take my fathers answers alone are slower and more drawn out than i am used to in my work a consequence i nonetheless expected of his thirtyodd years among the bo how does a human manage so long without its own kind i wondered we have ritualistic orders on vega iii that emulate emptiness silence and of course celibacy but for the singing out of our very existence our every interaction in minute and protracted detail i can only conjure up one god cult that believed the universe would cease to exist if its singing ever stopped all of its members perished in an avalanche thousands of years back of course the universe to my knowledge has not my thoughts drift eventually to captain sedgwick though the air is clammy and cold and my pod an unusual texture a truly alien space there are few places i had thought where human desire could not reach and yet my father seems to have found oneeven sought it out i think of my mother the robustness of her figure the strength of her mind given up for over thirty loveless years in the far reaches of space what kind of man was my father then to commit such an act of selfdenial what kind of man is he now having done it i turn off the white noise buds having given up on sleep one sacrifice i think as bo songs rumble about me in the foolhardy hope of ever understanding anothers in the first waking hours on the dark side of bo my father takes me to his laboratory the scene of the incident in question nothing has been moved since that wake cyclenot even the dead bo its mummifying remains giving me a start when i approach the head of the room there are no morgues here no cemeteries to the bo this is castoff matter a skin one might find at the site of regression the bo that accompanies us does not so much as eye the mound of gray and crumbling flesh it looks bored standing guard by the door and hums impatience alongside its standard mourning chord there have been deaths before my father says his hands ghosting but not touching the long array of enclosures sustaining samples of other lifeforms on bo its rare since their proximity to one another their constant chatter sings out potential threats few environmental disasters ever claim a life but it does happen the last was a year after my arrival a bo in the middle of regression when a sandstorm hit in the drylands where the light touches the black rocks and makes them molten and plant life turns to fire in an instant the bo was in a bad place an inopportune place and it also caught fire there were bo about it saying its names minding its abandoned skins as it sought to escape the heat through regression and they might have caught it when the winds struckbut they didnt they missed they were slow to this day they sing mourning songs that are heard over the escarpments down in the valleys with the hot and the oxidized rocks they sing for all their poor timing and the poor timing of the bo in their care and their fears of regression even now none of those watchers has regressed again yet that i know of though their warts have grown heavy and stiff and their sacs hardly move when they speak in his lumpy bo cloak my father looks toadlike himself hunched over to peer at old notes on his desk he has been speaking this rambling protobospeak since our arrival and even without my earbuds i quickly tune him out instead of lending him my ear i muster the courage to approach the decaying corpse slumped over in the bottom of an open tank but what was it doing inside how could it have fallen in my eyes narrow at the thread of a plastic tube still affixed to the back of its wrist i thought you said this bo was assisting you it was i turn to my father my gaze flicking quickly to the bo by the door can we talk in private my father straightens glancing at my bo in turn then back to me his longwinded speech comes to its end with one word no as your legal counsel id strongly advise youre not my counsel nia excuse me he shakes his head say what you were going to say i hesitate i know i should ignore my fathers words and get him to plead mental unfitness for refusing legal aid but at the tone in his voice that base dismissal the primal anger rises in me again there is a dead bo beside me with an iv sticking out of its arm what game does my father think hes playing now this bo wasnt just assisting you i say at last it was the experiment my father looks disconcertingly triumphant yes he says it most certainly was in the gathering space of the bo the songs from the spectator pods are indeed deafening and unchecked by the gravity of proceedings so i gratefully finetune my precious earbuds until most of the chatter has been reduced to a murmur the one voice that still filters through is that of the inquisitor bo who presides over the room with tremendous warts wreathed about his skull and coursing down his mottled forelimbs beside me my father is quite content to recline in his pod so that my blood alone is still agitated from the fallout of his words in the laboratory now two wake and rest cycles past at this time i have just finished my opening remarks to the inquisitor who itself took half an hour to formally greet the room and establish the purpose of this second wake cycles assembly of bo my own remarks were simple i tried to draw them out in appropriate bostyle but did not last ten minutes though in that time i had already explained my journey how far id traveled how i first learned of my fathers case and what it was like to arrive on bohow different everything seemed and how deeply sorry i was if any of my words gave offence in their brevity as concision was all i was used to back home now we come to the part of the trial for which my father has given clear instructions and at which i can feel his gaze surreptitiously upon me the inquisitor bo asks me if i think to plead my fathers case in this matter and after five minutes when its question is completed and fully translated i glance at my father and then turn to the incessantly murmuring room i say to them my father has caused the death of a bo of this there can be no doubt you know it and now i know it too therefore i do not come to draw out a game of the courts of misdirection and passive deceit as it is played on my world but to serve in another role an honest role secondary to my fathers testimony which i hope you will take into consideration before verdict is passed i bite my lip before the last to that end i stand before you nia palino character witness in my fathers defense the conversation in my fathers laboratory two wake and rest cycles prior was not so remarkable in form the whole of it oversimplified by my shock at his last words as in function and thrust after my fathers selfcongratulatory answer regarding the dead bo there was really only one thing i could think to say so i said it what the hell have you done easy my father said holding out his hands it was consensual the bo agreed we followed every precaution its just that this time it failed this time what do you think you were doing putting its life at risk even once like that like that my fathers mouth twitched in annoyance you dont even know what that is i know a bo is dead because of it i know it could cost you your life too what else do i need to know what the hell were you doing that was so important youd risk everythingeven your own damned lifeto see it through a glint returned to my fathers eyes and he smiled what do you think he said go on try me i set my teeth against the smugness in his voice the goading you and your goddamn science i said but this seemed only to feed into his pleasure his aggravating tone exactly so youll be my character witness then character witness now thats a laugh i dont even know you at all how could you possibly i was too angry to finish my sentence and stalked back to the body instead though considerably decayed there were strange features upon the remains that stood outclear differences between this bo and the bo to my right still guarding the door if id been any more levelheaded i might have paused long enough then and there to question my father about each incongruent detailbut of course i was not how could i have been right again my father said not even remotely giving me pause to cool down and why dont you know me what did i choose over you and your mother i could hear my own heartbeat in my ears my skin hot to the touch goddamn you dad i said if my words deflated his humor then they did not also strip him of his relief the sense of it clear in both voice and expression when i faced him again god yes he said softly meeting my sudden asserted gaze but with your help nia at least not the bo i am a good speaker even under unusual circumstances even when obliged to be more bombastic than even the most pompous human windbag i know which in my profession is always saying a lot and so i tell the assembly of bo that my fathers scientific ideals are so important to him that he even abandoned his family in their pursuit over thirty years ago knowing full well that humans cannot regress and thus that such opportunities for kinship once forsaken almost never emerge again considering the ignorance of my audience the bos absence of preferential family bonding from which to draw comparison for this loss i then explain what it means to be a father and a husband and also a daughter or a wife lacking the desired presence of one of the former two i close by offering up a variation of the words my father gave at yesterdays first assembly of bo my conviction that the bos death happened in the name of science as a consensual act to that end alone and that if any among the bo in attendance grieved the loss of their companion rest assured they could not even begin to approach the grief my father had felt at the time of its passing and every moment since having sacrificed so much of himself his mortality and all claims to happiness therein to those same scientific ideals only to see his greatest work destroyed in the sunset of his life i have to backtrack here alone to explain the term sunset and then to emphasize how the terms very strangeness among the bo only furthers my point about the sanctity of life to a human being the verdict comes back in four days taking another full day to be delivered during which time i fall asleep regularly in the courtroom while my bo ducks out on occasion to provide us with food and drink twice i linger by the waste receptacles nauseated by the poorness of my sleep stalling my return to that ceaseless chatter of spectator bo as long as i can clamping my hands to my ears in an effort to recall the sound of pure silence a fairy tale i hold deep in my heart i have my white noise buds on their highest settings by the end of it all and still the bospeak trickles through my ears damnably attuned by then to the chorus of them against all odds all internal appeals for sanity and peace finally the summation arrives guilty but pardoned i close my eyes and sink in my seat my father is silent unmoving beside me i fall asleep again the whole of my body tingling and drained and when i wake anew he is gone the gathering space empty save for one bo with a dark cast over its left eye waiting patiently off to one side can i go home now i hear the words come out in a croak and think only to hell with convention and prudence let the bos anger pour out but to my great surprise the bo hesitates parting its long thin mouth in turn and with clear effort musters a mere three words in response it is done it is not of course done captain sedgwick greets me grimly when my shuttle docks in the dark cavern of his ship he knows nothing of my fathers verdict save the language of my body and my body is tired and defeated we speak scarcely at all before the inevitable unraveling of tensions between us my blissfully dry berth turned doubly warmblooded for a spell only after in the darkness which i find at last i am learning to bear do i allow myself to think through all of my lingering doubts that my father was experimenting with regression was apparent but so too it seemed to me were the aims of his work perhaps the bo at large could not see what i had seenthe discordant number of digits on the dead bos shriveled body the unusual nature of its legs its head and its chest but my father had also said the bo sought out companion songs when regressing could the bo have missed that too had none of them wondered who had been this bos singer as it regrew in the long dark night that followed the trial my thoughts had grown wilder still perhaps saying the names did not sustain the universe but what if the ritual of it could sustain even one creature one bo at a time and if those songs changedif the singer changedwhat of the bo in regression could it take on other forms through the right song alone these might all have been the idle fool thoughts of a nonscientist an outsidereasily pondered that is and just as easily let goif it hadnt been for the last conversation i had on bo i knew it would also be the last time i saw my father that conversation in the last wake cycle before the shuttle arrived to take me home my father was back in the laboratory by then dusting the rank and file of his reclaimed research shelves when i entered for one last look around the dead bo i quickly noted was now gone ive buried it my father said in case youre wondering the bo dont care dont mind what happens to the flesh do you mean that i said it my father paused in his cleaning to look at me what else would i mean my heart was pounding at his scrutiny and i knew then that the anger i felt for him the coarse utilitarianism of his first and only attempt to contact meto use me as a tool of his own meticulous construction and then cast aside againhad to be coloring my view of things no human could be so cruel i told myselfso cold everyone i had almost convinced myself had a soft spot somewhere even my bo had been kindly in its way by the end her i said at last thats what you were doing wasnt it turning the bo into something else something not just for science but for you thirty years alone out here thirty years i was not alone the terseness in my fathers voice sings out my only victorymeager and for me already fraught with remorse i do not say the words that follow in my head but now you are arent you some losses are caverns his i realize at long last are active mines our breath has fogged up the tiny porthole in my lship berth blotting out the farthest stars and home captain sedgwick sits on the edge of the bunk finding his boots hitching up his uniform to his hips but no further not yet i rest my hand on the small of his browned and hairy back studying my fingers in a glimmer of starlight as just days ago i had studied the dead bosall five digits not quite squidlike but still strong enough pliant enough to hold something fierce in its grip and never let go gossamer stephen baxter the flitter bucked lvov looked up from her data desk startled beyond the flitters translucent hull the wormhole was flooded with sheets of bluewhite light which raced towards and past the flitter giving lvov the impression of huge uncontrolled speed weve got a problem cobh said the pilot bent over her own data desk a frown creasing her thin face lvov had been listening to her data desks synthesized murmur on temperature inversion layers in nitrogen atmospheres now she tapped the desk to shut it off the flitter was a transparent tube deceptively warm and comfortable impossibly fragile astronauts have problems in space she thought but not me im no hero im only a researcher lvov was twentyeight years old she had no plans to dieand certainly not during a routine fourhour hop through a poole wormhole that had been humanrated for eighty years she clung to her desk her knuckles whitening wondering if she ought to feel scared cobh sighed and pushed her data desk away it floated before her close up your suit and buckle up whats wrong our speed through the wormhole has increased cobh pulled her own restraint harness around her well reach the terminus in another minute what but we should have been travelling for another halfhour cobh looked irritated i know that i think the interface has become unstable the wormhole is buckling what does that mean are we in danger cobh checked the integrity of lvovs pressure suit then pulled her data desk to her cobh was a caucasian strongfaced a native of mars perhaps fifty years old well we cant turn back one way or the other itll be over in a few more secondshold tight now lvov could see the interface itself the terminus of the wormhole the interface was a bluewhite tetrahedron an angular cage that exploded at her from infinity glowing struts swept over the flitter the craft hurtled out of the collapsing wormhole light founted around the fleeing craft as stressed spacetime yielded in a gush of heavy particles lvov glimpsed stars wheeling cobh dragged the flitter sideways away from the energy fount there was a lurch a discontinuity in the scene beyond the hull suddenly a planet loomed before them lethe cobh said where did that come from ill have to take her downwere too close lvov saw a flat complex landscape greycrimson in the light of a swollen moon the scene was dimly lit and it rocked wildly as the flitter tumbled and stretching between world and moon she saw no it was impossible the vision was gone receded into darkness here it comes cobh yelled foam erupted filling the flitter the foam pushed into lvovs ears mouth and eyes she was blinded but she found she could breathe she heard a collision a grinding that lasted seconds and she imagined the flitter ploughing its way into the surface of the planet she felt a hard lurch a rebound the flitter came to rest a synthesized voice emitted blurred safety instructions there was a ticking as the hull cooled in the sudden stillness still blinded by foam lvov tried to recapture what she had seen spiderweb it was a web stretching from the planet to its moon welcome to pluto cobhs voice was breathless ironic lvov stood on the surface of pluto the suits insulation was good but enough heat leaked to send nitrogen clouds hissing around her footsteps and where she walked she burned craters in the ice gravity was only a few per cent of gee and lvov earthborn felt as if she might blow away there were clouds above her wispy cirrus aerosol clusters suspended in an atmosphere of nitrogen and methane the clouds occluded bonewhite stars from here sol and the moon charon were hidden by the planets bulk and it was dark dark on dark the damaged landscape visible only as a sketch in starlight the flitter had dug a trench a mile long and fifty yards deep in this worlds antique surface so lvov was at the bottom of a valley walled by nitrogen ice cobh was hauling equipment out of the crumpledup wreck of the flitter scooters data desks lifesupport boxes lvovs equipment most of the stuff had been robust enough to survive the impact lvov saw but not her own equipment maybe a geologist could have crawled around with nothing more than a hammer and a set of sample bags but lvov was an atmospheric scientist what was she going to achieve here without her equipment her fear was fading now to be replaced by irritation impatience she was five light hours from sol already she was missing the online nets she kicked at the ice she was stuck here she couldnt talk to anyone and there wasnt even the processing power to generate a virtual environment cobh finished wrestling with the wreckage she was breathing hard come on she said lets get out of this ditch and take a look around she showed lvov how to work a scooter it was a simple platform its inertgas jets controlled by twists of raised handles side by side cobh and lvov rose out of the crash scar pluto ice was a rich crimson laced with organic purple lvov made out patterns dimly on the surface of the ice they were like basrelief discs the size of dinner plates with the intricate complexity of snowflakes lvov landed clumsily on the rim of the crash scar the scooters blunt prow crunching into surface ice and she was grateful for the low gravity the weight and heat of the scooters quickly obliterated the ice patterns weve come down near the equator cobh said the albedo is higher at the south pole a cap of methane ice there im told yes cobh pointed to a bright blue spark high in the sky thats the wormhole interface where we emerged fifty thousand miles away lvov squinted at constellations unchanged from those shed grown up with on earth are we stranded cobh said with reasonable patience for the time being the flitter is wrecked and the wormhole has collapsed were going to have to go back to jupiter the long way round three billion miles ten hours ago i was asleep in a hotel room on io and now this what a mess cobh laughed ive already sent off messages to the inner system theyll be received in about five hours a oneway gutship will be sent to retrieve us it will refuel here with charon ice how long it depends on the readiness of a ship say ten days to prepare then a tenday flight out here twenty days were in no danger weve supplies for a month although were going to have to live in these suits lethe this trip was supposed to last seventytwo hours well cobh said testily youll have to call and cancel your appointments wont you all we have to do is wait here were not going to be comfortable but were safe enough do you know what happened to the wormhole cobh shrugged she stared up at the distant blue spark as far as i know nothing like this has happened before i think the interface itself became unstable and that fed back into the throat but i dont know how we fell to pluto so quickly that doesnt make sense how so our trajectory was spacelike superluminal she glanced at lvov obliquely as if embarrassed for a moment there we appeared to be travelling faster than light through normal space thats impossible of course it is cobh reached up to scratch her cheek but her gloved fingers rattled against her faceplate i think ill go up to the interface and take a look around there cobh showed lvov how to access the life support boxes then she strapped her data desk to her back climbed aboard her scooter and lifted off the planets surface heading for the interface lvov watched her dwindle lvovs isolation closed in she was alone the only human on the surface of pluto a reply from the inner system came within twelve hours of the crash a gutship was being sent from jupiter it would take thirteen days to refit the ship followed by an eightday flight to pluto then more delay for taking on fresh reaction mass at charon lvov chafed at the timescale restless there was other mail concerned notes from lvovs family a testy demand for updates from her research supervisor and for cobh orders from her employer to mark as much of the flitter wreck as she could for salvage and analysis cobhs ship was a commercial wormhole transit vessel hired by oxfordlvovs universityfor this trip now it seemed a complex battle over liability would be joined between oxford cobhs firm and the insurance companies lvov five lighthours from home found it difficult to respond to the mail asynchronously she felt as if she had been cut out of the online mind of humanity in the end she drafted replies to her family and deleted the rest of the messages she checked her research equipment again but it really was unusable she tried to sleep the suit was uncomfortable claustrophobic she was restless bored a little scared she began a systematic survey of the surface taking her scooter on widening spiral sweeps around the crash scar the landscape was surprisingly complex a starlit sculpture of feathery ridges and fine ravines she kept a few hundred feet above the surface whenever she flew too low her heat evoked billowing vapour from fragile nitrogen ice obliterating ancient features and she experienced obscure guilt she found more of the snowflakelike features generally in little clusters of eight or ten pluto like its moontwin charon was a ball of rock clad by thick mantles of water ice and nitrogen ice and laced with methane ammonia and organic compounds it was like a big stable comet nucleus it barely deserved the status of planet there were moons bigger than pluto there had been only a handful of visitors in the eighty years since the building of the poole wormhole none of them had troubled to walk the surfaces of pluto or charon the wormhole lvov realised hadnt been built as a commercial proposition but as a sort of stunt the link which connected at last all of the systems planets to the rapidtransit hub at jupiter she tired of her plodding survey she made sure she could locate the crash scar lifted the scooter to a mile above the surface and flew towards the south polar cap cobh called from the interface i think im figuring out what happened herethat superluminal effect i talked about lvov have you heard of an alcubierre wave she dumped images to lvovs deskportraits of the wormhole interface various graphics no lvov ignored the input and concentrated on flying the scooter cobh why should a wormhole become unstable hundreds of wormhole rapid transits are made every day all across the system a wormhole is a flaw in space its inherently unstable anyway the throat and mouths are kept open by active feedback loops involving threads of exotic matter thats matter with a negative energy density a sort of antigravity which but this wormhole went wrong maybe the tuning wasnt perfect the presence of the flitters mass in the throat was enough to send the wormhole over the edge if the wormhole had been more heavily used the instability might have been detected earlier and fixed over the greywhite pole lvov flew through banks of aerosol mist cobhs voice whispered to her remote without meaning sunrise on pluto sol was a point of light low on lvovs unfolding horizon wreathed in the complex strata of a cirrus cloud the sun was a thousand times fainter than from earth but brighter than any planet in earths sky the inner system was a puddle of light around sol an oblique disc small enough for lvov to cover with the palm of her hand it was a disc that contained almost all of mans hundreds of billions sol brought no heat to her raised hand but she saw faint shadows cast by the sun on her faceplate the nitrogen atmosphere was dynamic at perihelionthe closest approach to sol which pluto was nearingthe air expanded to three planetary diameters methane and other volatiles joined the thickening air sublimating from the planets surface then when pluto turned away from sol and sailed into its twohundredyear winter the air snowed down lvov wished she had her atmosphericanalysis equipment now she felt its lack like an ache she passed over spectacular features buie crater tombaugh plateau the lowell range she recorded them all walked on them after a while her world of earth and information and work seemed remote a glittering abstraction pluto was like a complex blind fish drifting around its twocentury orbit gradually interfacing with her changing her she suspected ten hours after leaving the crash scar lvov arrived at the subcharon point called christy she kept the scooter hovering puffs of gas holding her against plutos gentle gravity sol was halfway up the sky a diamond of light charon hung directly over lvovs head a misty blue disc six times the size of luna as seen from earth half the moons lit hemisphere was turned away from lvov towards sol like luna charon was tidally locked to its parent and kept the same face to pluto as it orbited but unlike earth pluto was also locked to its twin every six days the worlds turned about each other facing each other constantly like two waltzers plutocharon was the only significant system in which both partners were tidally locked chirons surface looked pocked lvov had her faceplate enhance the image many of the gouges were deep and quite regular she remarked on this to cobh at the interface the poole people mostly used charon material for the building of the wormhole cobh said charon is just rock and water ice its easier to get to water ice in particular charon doesnt have the inconvenience of an atmosphere or an overlay of nitrogen ice over the water and the gravitys shallower the wormhole builders had flown out here in a huge unreliable gutship they had lifted ice and rock off charon and used it to construct tetrahedra of exotic matter the tetrahedra had served as interfaces the termini of a wormhole one interface had been left in orbit around pluto and the other had been hauled laboriously back to jupiter by the gutship itself replenished with charonice reaction mass by such crude means michael poole and his people had opened up the solar system they made lethes own mess of charon lvov said she could almost see cobhs characteristic shrug so what plutos surface was geologically complex here at this point of maximal tidal stress she flew over ravines and ridges in places it looked as if the land had been smashed up with an immense hammer cracked and fractured she imagined there was a greater mix here of interior material with the surface ice in many places she saw gatherings of the peculiar snowflakes she had noticed before perhaps they were some form of frosting effect she wondered she descended thinking vaguely of collecting samples she killed the scooters jets some yards above the surface and let the little craft fall under plutos gentle gravity she hit the ice with a soft collision but without heatdamaging the surface features much beyond a few feet she stepped off the scooter the ice crunched and she felt layers compress under her but the fractured surface supported her weight she looked up towards charon the crimson moon was immense round heavy she caught a glimmer of light an arc directly above her it was gone immediately she closed her eyes and tried to recapture it a line slowly curving like a thread a web suspended between pluto and charon she looked again with her faceplate set to optimal enhancement she couldnt recapture the vision she didnt say anything to cobh i was right by the way cobh was saying what lvov tried to focus the wormhole instability when we crashed it did cause an alcubierre wave whats an alcubierre wave the interfaces negative energy region expanded from the tetrahedron just for a moment the negative energy distorted a chunk of spacetime the chunk containing the flitter and us on one side of the flitter cobh said spacetime had contracted like a model black hole on the other side it expandedlike a rerun of the big bang the expansion at the beginning of the universe an alcubierre wave is a front in spacetime the interfacewith us embedded insidewas carried along we were pushed away from the expanding region and towards the contraction like a surfer on a wave right cobh sounded excited the effects been known to theory almost since the formulation of relativity but i dont think anyones observed it before how lucky for us lvov said drily you said we travelled faster than light but thats impossible you cant move faster than light within spacetime wormholes are one way of getting around this in a wormhole you are passing through a branch in spacetime the alcubierre effect is another way the superluminal velocity comes from the distortion of space itself we were carried along within distorting space so we werent breaking lightspeed within our raft of spacetime but that spacetime itself was distorting at more than lightspeed it sounds like cheating so sue me or look up the math couldnt we use your alcubierre effect to drive starships no the instabilities and the energy drain are forbidding one of the snowflake patterns lay mostly undamaged within lvovs reach she crouched and peered at it the flake was perhaps a foot across internal structure was visible within the clear ice as layers of tubes and compartments it was highly symmetrical and very complex she said to cobh this is an impressive crystallisation effect if thats what it is gingerly she reached out with thumb and forefinger and snapped a short tube off the rim of the flake she laid the sample on her desk after a few seconds the analysis presented its mostly water ice with some contaminants she told cobh but in a novel molecular form denser than normal ice a kind of glass water would freeze like this under high pressuresseveral thousand atmospheres perhaps its material from the interior brought out by the chthonic mixing in that region perhaps lvov felt more confident now she was intrigued cobh theres a larger specimen a few feet further away take it easy lvov she stepped forward ill be fine i the surface shattered lvovs left foot dropped forward into a shallow hole something crackled under the sole of her boot threads of ice crystals oddly woven together spun up and tracked precise parabolae around her leg the fall seemed to take an age the ice tipped up towards her like an opening door she put her hands out she couldnt stop the fall but she was able to cushion herself and she kept her faceplate away from the ice she finished up on her backside she felt the chill of pluto ice through the suit material over her buttocks and calves lvov are you okay she was panting she found im fine you were screaming was i im sorry i fell you fell how there was a hole in the ice she massaged her left ankle it didnt seem to be hurt it was covered up show me she got to her feet stepped gingerly back to the open hole and held up her data desk the hole was only a few inches deep it was covered by a sort of lid i think move the desk closer to the hole light from the desk controlled by cobh played over the shallow pit lvov found a piece of the smashed lid it was mostly ice but there was a texture to its undersurface embedded thread which bound the ice together lvov cobh said take a look at this lvov lifted the desk aside and peered into the hole the walls were quite smooth at the base there was a cluster of spheres fistsized lvov counted seven all but one of the spheres had been smashed by her stumble she picked up the one intact sphere and turned it over in her hand it was pearlgrey almost translucent there was something embedded inside discshaped complex cobh sounded breathless are you thinking what im thinking its an egg lvov said she looked around wildly at the open pit the egg the snowflake patterns suddenly she saw the meaning of the scene it was as if a light had shone up from within pluto illuminating her the snowflakes represented life she intuited they had dug the burrows laid these eggs and now their bodies of water glass lay dormant or dead on the ancient ice im coming down cobh said sternly were going to have to discuss this dont say anything to the inner system wait until i get back this could mean trouble for us lvov lvov placed the egg back in the shattered nest she met cobh at the crash scar cobh was shovelling nitrogen and water ice into the lifesupport modules raw material hopper she hooked up her own and lvovs suits to the modules recharging the suits internal systems then she began to carve gutdrive components out of the flitters hull the flitters central grand unified theory chamber was compact no larger than a basketball and the rest of the drive was similarly scaled i bet i could get this working cobh said although it couldnt take us anywhere lvov sat on a fragment of the shattered hull tentatively she told cobh about the web cobh stood with hands on hips facing lvov and lvov could hear her sucking drink from the nipples in her helmet spiders from pluto give me a break its only an analogy lvov said defensively im an atmospheric specialist not a biologist she tapped the surface of her desk its not spiderweb obviously but if that substance has anything like the characteristics of true spider silk its not impossible she read from her desk spider silk has a breaking strain twice that of steel but thirty times the elasticity its a type of liquid crystal its used commerciallydid you know that she fingered the fabric of her suit we could be wearing spider silk right now what about the hole with the lid there are trapdoor spiders in america on earth i remember when i was a kid the spiders make burrows lined with silk with hinged lids why make burrows on pluto i dont know maybe the eggs can last out the winter that way maybe the creatures the flakes only have active life during the perihelion period when the atmosphere expands and enriches she thought that through that fits thats why the poole people didnt spot anything the construction team was here close to the last aphelion plutos year is so long that were still only halfway to the next perihelion so how do they live cobh snapped what do they eat there must be more to the ecosystem than one species lvov conceded the flakesthe spidersneed water glass but theres little of that on the surface maybe there is some biocycleplants or burrowing animalswhich brings ice and glass to the surface from the interior that doesnt make sense the layer of nitrogen over water ice is too deep then where do the flakes get their glass dont ask me cobh said its your dumb hypothesis and what about the web whats the point of thatif its real lvov ground to a halt i dont know she said lamely although plutocharon is the only place in the system where you could build a spiderweb between worlds cobh toyed with a fitting from the drive have you told anyone about this yet in the inner system i mean no you said you wanted to talk about that right lvov saw cobh close her eyes her face was masked by the glimmer of her faceplate listen heres what we say weve seen nothing here nothing that couldnt be explained by crystallisation effects lvov was baffled what are you talking about what about the eggs why would we lie about this besides we have the desksrecords data desks can be lost or wiped or their contents amended lvov wished she could see cobhs face why would we do such a thing think it through once earth hears about this these flakespiders of yours will be protected wont they of course whats bad about that its bad for us lvov youve seen what a mess the poole people made of charon if this system is inhabited a fast gutship wont be allowed to come for us it wouldnt be allowed to refuel here not if it meant further damage to the native life forms lvov shrugged so wed have to wait for a slower ship a liner one that wont need to take on more reaction mass here cobh laughed at her you dont know much about the economics of gutship transport do you now that the system is crisscrossed by poole wormholes how many liners like that do you think are still running ive already checked the manifests there are two liners capable of a round trip to pluto still in service one is in dry dock the other is heading for saturn on the other side of the system right theres no way either of those ships could reach us for id say a year we only have a months supplies a bubble of panic gathered in lvovs stomach do you get it yet cobh said heavily well be sacrificed if theres a chance that our rescue would damage the new ecology here no it wouldnt happen like that cobh shrugged there are precedents she was right lvov knew there were precedents of new forms of life discovered in corners of the system from mercury to the remote kuiper objects in every case the territory had been ringfenced the local conditions preserved once lifeor even a plausible candidate for lifewas recognised cobh said pangenetic diversity panenvironmental management thats the key to it the public policy of preserving all the species and habitats of sol into the indefinite future the lives of two humans wont matter a damn against that what are you suggesting that we dont tell the inner system about the flakes lvov tried to recapture her mood of a few days before when pluto hadnt mattered to her when the crash had been just an inconvenience now suddenly were talking about threats to our lives the destruction of an ecology what a dilemma if i dont tell of the flakes their ecology may be destroyed during our rescue but if i do tell the gutship wont come for me and ill lose my life cobh seemed to be waiting for an answer lvov thought of how sol light looked over plutos ice fields at dawn she decided to stall well say nothing for now but i dont accept either of your options cobh laughed what else is there the wormhole is destroyed even this flitter is disabled we have time days before the gutship is due to be launched lets search for another solution a winwin cobh shrugged she looked suspicious shes right to be lvov thought exploring her own decision with surprise ive every intention of telling the truth later of diverting the gutship if i have to i may give up my life for this world i think in the days that followed cobh tinkered with the gutdrive and flew up to the interface to gather more data on the alcubierre phenomenon lvov roamed the surface of pluto with her desk set to full record she came to love the wreaths of cirrus clouds the huge misty moon the slow oceanic pulse of the centurieslong year everywhere she found the inert bodies of snowflakes or evidence of their presence eggs lidded burrows she found no other life formsor more likely she told herself she wasnt equipped to recognise any others she was drawn back to christy the subcharon point where the topography was at its most complex and interesting and where the greatest density of flakes was to be found it was as if she thought the flakes had gathered here yearning for the huge inaccessible moon above them but what could the flakes possibly want of charon what did it mean for them lvov encountered cobh at the crash scar recharging her suits systems from the life support packs cobh seemed quiet she kept her face hooded by her faceplate turned from lvov lvov watched her for a while youre being evasive she said eventually somethings changedsomething youre not telling me about cobh made to turn away but lvov grabbed her arm i think youve found a third option havent you youve found some other way to resolve this situation without destroying either us or the flakes cobh shook off her hand yes yes i think i know a way but but what its dangerous damn it maybe unworkable lethal cobhs hands pulled at each other shes scared lvov saw she stepped back from cobh without giving herself time to think about it she said our deals off im going to tell the inner system about the flakes right now so were going to have to go with your new idea dangerous or not cobh studied her face cobh seemed to be weighing up lvovs determination perhaps even her physical strength lvov felt as if she were a data desk being downloaded the moment stretched and lvov felt her breath tighten in her chest would she be able to defend herself physically if it came to that andwas her own will really so strong i have changed she thought pluto has changed me at last cobh looked away send your damn message she said before cobhor lvov herselfhad a chance to waver lvov picked up her desk and sent a message to the inner worlds she downloaded all the data she had on the flakes text images analyses her own observations and hypotheses its done she said at last and the gutship im sure theyll cancel it lvov smiled im also sure they wont tell us theyve done so so were left with no choice cobh said angrily look i know its the right thing to do to preserve the flakes i just dont want to die thats all i hope youre right lvov you havent told me how were going to get home cobh grinned through her faceplate surfing all right youre doing fine now let go of the scooter lvov took a deep breath and kicked the scooter away with both legs the little device tumbled away catching the deep light of sol and lvov rolled in reaction cobh reached out and steadied her you cant fall cobh said youre in orbit you understand that dont you of course i do lvov grumbled the two of them drifted in space close to the defunct poole wormhole interface the interface itself was a tetrahedron of electric blue struts enclosing darkness its size overwhelming lvov felt as if she was floating beside the carcase of some huge wrecked building pluto and charon hovered before her like balloons their surfaces mottled and complex their forms visibly distorted from the spherical their separation was only fourteen of plutos diameters the worlds were strikingly different in hue with pluto a blood red charon ice blue thats the difference in surface composition lvov thought absently all that water ice on charons surface the panorama was stunningly beautiful lvov had a sudden gutlevel intuition of the rightness of the various system authorities rigid panenvironment policies cobh had strapped her data desk to her chest now she checked the time any moment now lvov youll be fine remember youll feel no acceleration no matter how fast we travel at the centre of an alcubierre wave spacetime is locally flat youll still be in free fall there will be tidal forces but they will remain small just keep your breathing even and shut up cobh lvov said tightly i know all this cobhs desk flared with light there she breathed the gutdrive has fired just a few seconds now a spark of light arced up from plutos surface and tracked in complete silence under the belly of the parent world it was the flitters gutdrive salvaged and stabilised by cobh the flame was brighter than sol lvov saw its light reflected in pluto as if the surface was a great fractured mirror of ice where the flame passed tongues of nitrogen gas billowed up the gutdrive passed over christy lvov had left her desk there to monitor the flakes and the image the desk transmitted displayed in the corner of her faceplate showed a spark crossing the sky then the gutdrive veered sharply upwards climbing directly towards lvov and cobh at the interface cobh are you sure this is going to work lvov could hear cobhs breath rasp shallow look lvov i know youre scared but pestering me with dumbass questions isnt going to help once the drive enters the interface it will take only seconds for the instability to set in seconds and then well be home in the inner system at any rate or or what cobh didnt reply or not lvov finished for her if cobh has designed this new instability right the alcubierre wave will carry us home if not the gutdrive flame approached becoming dazzling lvov tried to regulate her breathing to keep her limbs hanging loose lethe cobh whispered what lvov demanded alarmed take a look at pluto at christy lvov looked into her faceplate where the warmth and light of the gutdrive had passed christy was a ferment nitrogen billowed and amid the pale fountains burrows were opening lids folded back eggs cracked infant flakes soared and sailed with webs and nets of their silkanalogue hauling at the rising air lvov caught glimpses of threads long sparkling trailing down to plutoand up towards charon already lvov saw some of the baby flakes had hurtled more than a planetary diameter from the surface towards the moon its goose summer she said what when i was a kid the young spiders spin bits of webs and climb to the top of grass stalks and float off on the breeze goose summergossamer right cobh said sceptically well it looks as if they are making for charon they use the evaporation of the atmosphere for lift perhaps they follow last years threads to the moon they must fly off every perihelion rebuilding their web bridge every time they think the perihelion is here now the warmth of the driveits remarkable but why go to charon lvov couldnt take her eyes off the flakes because of the water she said it all seemed to make sense now that she saw the flakes in action there must be water glass on chirons surface the baby flakes use it to build their bodies they take other nutrients from plutos interior and the glass from charon they need the resources of both worlds to survive lvov the gutdrive flared past them sudden dazzling and plunged into the damaged interface electricblue light exploded from the interface washing over her there was a ball of light unearthly behind her and an irregular patch of darkness ahead like a rip in space tidal forces plucked gently at her belly and limbs pluto charon and goose summer disappeared but the stars the eternal stars shone down on her just as they had during her childhood on earth she stared at the stars trusting and felt no fear remotely she heard cobh whoop exhilarated the tides faded the darkness before her healed to reveal the brilliance and warmth of sol spider the artist nnedi okorafor zombie no go go unless you tell am to go zombie zombie zombie no go stop unless you tell am to stop zombie no go turn unless you tell am to turn zombie zombie no go think unless you tell am to think from zombie by fela kuti nigerian musician and selfproclaimed voice of the voiceless my husband used to beat me that was how i ended up out there that evening behind our house just past the bushes through the tall grass in front of the pipelines our small house was the last in the village practically in the forest itself so nobody ever saw or heard him beating me going out there was the best way to put space between me and him without sending him into further rage when i went behind the house he knew where i was and he knew i was alone but he was too full of himself to realize i was thinking about killing myself my husband was a drunk like too many of the members of the niger delta peoples movement it was how they all controlled their anger and feelings of helplessness the fish shrimps and crayfish in the creeks were dying drinking the water shriveled womens wombs and eventually made men urinate blood there was a stream where i had been fetching water a flow station was built nearby and now the stream was rank and filthy with an oily film that reflected rainbows cassava and yam farms yielded less and less each year the air left your skin dirty and smelled like something preparing to die in some places it was always daytime because of the noisy gas flares my village was shit on top of all this peoples movement members were getting picked off like flies the killandgo had grown bold they shot peoples movement members in the streets they ran them over dragged them into the swamps you never saw them again i tried to give my husband some happiness but after three years my body continued to refuse him children its easy to see the root of his frustration and sadness but pain is pain and he dealt it to me regularly my greatest my only true possession was my fathers guitar it was made of fine polished abura timber and it had a lovely tortoiseshell pick guard excellent handwork my father said that the timber used to create the guitar came from one of the last timber trees in the delta if you held it to your nose you could believe this the guitar was decades old and still smelled like fresh cut wood like it wanted to tell you its story because only it could i wouldnt exist without my fathers guitar when he was a young man he used to sit in front of the compound in the evening and play for everyone people danced clapped shut their eyes and listened cell phones would ring and people would ignore them one day it was my mother who stopped to listen i used to stare at my fathers fast longfingered hands when he played oh the harmonies he could weave anything with his musicrainbows sunrises spider webs sparkling with morning dew my older brothers werent interested in learning how to play but i was so my father taught me everything he knew and now it was my longfingers that graced the strings id always been able to hear music and my fingers moved even faster than my fathers i was good really good but i married that stupid man andrew so i only played behind the house away from him my guitar was my escape that fateful evening i was sitting on the ground in front of the fuel pipeline it ran right through everyones backyard my village was an oil village as was the village where i grew up my mother lived in a similar village before she was married as did her mother we are pipeline people my mothers grandmother was known for lying on the pipeline running through her village shed stay like that for hours listening and wondering what magical fluids were running through the large neverending steel tubes this was before the zombies of course i laughed if she tried to lie on a pipeline now shed be brutally killed anyway when i was feeling especially blue id take my guitar and come out here and sit right in front of the pipeline i knew i was flirting with death by being so close but when i was like this i didnt really care i actually welcomed the possibility of being done with life it was a wonder that my husband didnt smash my guitar during one of his drunken rages id surely have quickly thrown myself on the pipeline if he did maybe that was why hed rather smash my nose than my guitar this day hed only slapped me hard across the face i had no idea why hed simply come in seen me in the kitchen and smack maybe hed had a bad day at workhe worked very hard at a local restaurant maybe one of his women had scorned him maybe i did something wrong i didnt know i didnt care my nose was just starting to stop bleeding and i was not seeing so many stars my feet were only inches from the pipeline i was especially daring this night it was warmer and more humid than normal or maybe it was my stinging burning face the mosquitoes didnt even bother me much in the distance i could see nneka a woman who rarely spoke to me giving her small sons a bath in a large tub some men were playing cards at a table several houses down it was dark there were small small trees and bushes here and even our closest neighbor was not very close so i was hidden i sighed and placed my hands on the guitar strings i plucked out a tune my father used to play i sighed and closed my eyes i would always miss my father the feel of the strings vibrating under my fingers was exquisite i fell deep into the zone of my music weaving it then floating on a glorious sunset that lit the palm tree tops and click i froze my hands still on the strings the vibration dying i didnt dare move i kept my eyes closed the side of my face throbbed click this time the sound was closer click closer click closer my heart pounded and i felt nauseous with fear despite my risk taking i knew this was not the way i wanted to die who would want to be torn limb from limb by zombies as everyone in my village did multiple times a day i quietly cursed the nigerian government twing the vibration of the guitar string was stifled by my middle finger still pressing it down my hands started to shake but still i kept my eyes shut something sharp and cool lifted my finger i wanted to scream the string was plucked again twang the sound was deeper and fuller my finger no longer muffling the vibration very slowly i opened my eyes my heart skipped the thing stood about three feet tall which meant i was eyeto eye with it id never seen one up close few people have these things are always running up and down the pipeline like a herd of super fast steer always with things to do i chanced a better look it really did have eight legs even in the darkness those legs shined catching even the dimmest light a bit more light and id have been able to see my face perfectly reflected back at me id heard that they polished and maintained themselves this made even more sense now for who would have time to keep them looking so immaculate the government came up with the idea to create the zombies and shell chevron and a few other oil companies who were just as desperate supplied the money to pay for it all the zombies were made to combat pipeline bunkering and terrorism it makes me laugh the government and the oil people destroyed our land and dug up our oil then they created robots to keep us from taking it back they were originally called anansi droids but we call them oyibo contraption and most often zombie the same name we call those killandgo soldiers who come in here harassing us every time something bites their brains its said that zombies can think artificial intelligence this is called i have had some schooling a year or two of university but my area was not in the sciences no matter my education as soon as i got married and brought to this damn place i became like every other woman here a simple village woman living in the delta region where zombies kill anyone who touches the pipelines and whose husband knocks her around every so often what did i know about zombie intellect it looked like a giant shiny metal spider it moved like one too all smoothshifting joints and legs it crept closer and leaned in to inspect my guitar strings some more as it did so two of its back legs tapped on the metal of the pipelineclick click click it pushed my thumb back down on the strings and plucked the string twice making a muted pluck it looked at me with its many blue shining round eyes up close i could see that they werent lights they were balls of a glowing metallic blue undulating liquid like charged mercury i stared into them fascinated no one else in my village could possibly know this fact no one had gotten close enough eyes of glowing bright blue liquid metal i thought na wa it pressed my hand harder and i gasped blinking and looking away from its hypnotic eyes then i understood you you want me to play it sat there waiting placing a leg on the body of my guitar with a soft tap it had been a long time since anyone had wanted me to play for him i played my favorite highlife song love dey see road by oliver de coque i played like my life depended on it the zombie didnt move its leg remaining pressed to my guitar was it listening i was sure it was twenty minutes later when i stopped finally playing sweat running down my face it touched the tips of my aching hands gently some of these pipelines carry diesel fuel others carry crude oil millions of liters of it a day nigeria supplies twentyfive percent of united states oil and we get virtually nothing in return nothing but death by zombie attack we can all tell you stories when the zombies were first released no one knew about them all people would hear were rumors about people getting torn apart near pipelines or sightings of giant white spiders in the night or youd hear about huge pipeline explosions charred bodies everywhere but the pipeline where the bodies lay would be perfectly intact people still bunkered my husband was one of them i suspected that he sold the fuel and oil on the black market he would bring some of the oil home too you let it sit in a bucket for two days and it would become something like kerosene i used it for cooking so i couldnt really complain but bunkering was a very very dangerous practice there were ways of breaking a pipeline open without immediately bringing the wrath of zombies my husband and his comrades used some sort of powerful laser cutter they stole them from the hospitals but they had to be very very quiet when cutting through the metal all it took was one bang one vibration and the zombies would come running within a minute many of my husbands comrades had been killed because of the tap of someones wedding ring or the tip of the laser cutter on steel two years ago a group of boys had been playing too close to the pipeline two of them were wrestling and they fell on it within seconds the zombies came one boy managed to scramble away but the other was grabbed by the arm and flung into some bushes his arm and both of his legs were broken government officials said that zombies were programmed to do as little harm as possible but i didnt believe this na lie they were terrible creatures to get close to a pipeline was to risk a terrible death yet the goddamn things ran right through our backyards but i didnt care my husband was beating the hell out of me during these months i dont know why he had not lost his job i knew he was seeing other women we were poor but we were not starving maybe it was because i couldnt bear him children it is my fault i know but what can i do i found myself out in the backyard more and more and this particular zombie visited me every time i loved playing for it it would listen its lovely eyes would glow with joy could a robot feel joy i believed intelligent ones like this could many times a day i would see a crowd of zombies running up and down the pipeline off to do repairs or policing whatever they did if my zombie was amongst them i couldnt tell it was about the tenth time it visited me that it did something very very strange my husband had come home smelling practically flammable stinking of several kinds of alcoholbeer palm wine perfume i had been thinking hard all day about my life i was stuck i wanted a baby i wanted to get out of the house i wanted a job i wanted friends i needed courage i knew i had courage i had faced a zombie many times i was going to ask my husband about teaching at the elementary school id heard that they were looking for teachers when he walked in he greeted me with a sloppy hug and kiss and then plopped himself on the couch he turned on the television it was late but i brought him his dinner pepper soup heavy with goat meat chicken and large shrimp he was in a good drunken mood but as i stood there watching him eat all my courage fled all my need for change skittered and cowered to the back of my brain do you want anything else i asked he looked up at me and actually smiled the soup is good today i smiled but something inside me ducked its head lower im glad i said i picked up my guitar im going to the back its nice outside dont go too close to the pipeline he said but he was looking at the tv and gnawing on a large piece of goat meat i crept into the darkness through the bushes and grasses to the pipeline i sat in my usual spot a foot from it i strummed softly a series of chords a forlorn tune that spoke my heart where else was there to go from here was this my life i sighed i hadnt been to church in a month when it came clicking down the pipe my heart lifted its blue liquid eyes glowed strong tonight there was a woman from whom i once bought a bolt of blue cloth the cloth was a rich blue that reminded me of the open water on sunny days the woman said the cloth was azure my zombies eyes were a deep azure this night it stopped standing before me waiting i knew it was my zombie because a month ago it had allowed me to put a blue butterfly sticker on one of its front legs good evening i said it did not move im sad today i said it stepped off the pipeline its metal legs clicking on the metal and then whispering on the dirt and grass it sat its body on the ground as it always did then it waited i strummed a few chords and then played its favorite song bob marleys no woman no cry as i played its body slowly began to rotate something id come to understand was its way of expressing pleasure i smiled when i stopped playing it turned its eyes back to me i sighed strummed an a minor chord and sat back my life is shit i said suddenly it rose up on its eight legs with a soft whir it stretched and straightened its legs until it was standing a foot taller than normal from under its body in the center something whitish and metallic began to descend i gasped grabbing my guitar my mind told me to move away move away fast id befriended this artificial creature i knew it or i thought i knew it but what did i really know about why it did what it did or why it came to me the metallic substance descended faster pooling in the grass beneath it i squinted the stuff was wire right before my eyes i watched the zombie take this wire and do something with five of its legs while it supported itself on the other three the legs scrambled around working and weaving the shiny wire this way and that they moved too fast for me to see exactly what they were creating grass flew and the soft whirring sound grew slightly louder then the legs stopped for a moment all i could hear was the sounds of crickets and frogs singing the breeze blowing in the palm and mangrove tree tops i could smell the sizzling oil of someone frying plantain or yam nearby my eyes focused on what the zombie had done i grinned i grinned and grinned what is that i whispered it held it up with two of its front legs and tapped its back leg twice on the ground as it always seemed to when it was trying to make a point a point that i usually didnt understand it brought three legs forward and commenced to pluck out what first was a medley of my favorite songs from bob marley to sunny ade to carlos santana then its music deepened to something so complex and beautiful that i was reduced to tears of joy awe ecstasy people must have heard the music maybe they looked out their windows or opened their doors but we were hidden by the darkness the grass the trees i cried and cried i dont know why but i cried i wonder if it was pleased by my reaction i think it was i spent the next hour learning to play its tune ten days later a group of zombies attacked some oil workers and soldiers deep in the delta ten of the men were torn limb from limb their bloody remains scattered all over the swampy land those who escaped told reporters that nothing would stop the zombies a soldier had even thrown a grenade at one but the thing protected itself with the very force field it had been built to use during pipeline explosions the soldier said the force field looked like a crackling bubble made of lightning wahala trouble the soldier frantically told television reporters his face was greasy with sweat and the sides of his eyes were twitching evil evil things ive believed this from start look at me with grenade ye ye i could do nothing the pipeline the men had barely even started was found fully assembled zombies are made to make repairs not fully assemble things it was bizarre newspaper writeups said that the zombies were getting too smart for their own good that they were rebelling something had certainly changed maybe its only a matter of time before the damn things kill us all my husband said a beer in hand as he read about the incident in the newspaper i considered never going near my zombie again they were unpredictable and possibly out of control it was midnight and i was out there again my husband hadnt laid a heavy hand on me in weeks i think he sensed the change in me i had changed he now heard me play more even in the house in the mornings after cooking his dinners in the bedroom when his friends were over and he was hearing songs that i knew gave him a most glorious feeling as if each chord each sound were examined by scientists and handpicked to provoke the strongest feeling of happiness my zombie had solved my marital problems at least the worst of them my husband could not beat me when there was beautiful music sending his senses to lush sweet places i began to hope to hope for a baby hope that i would one day leave my house and wifely duties for a job as music teacher at the elementary school hope that my village would one day reap from the oil being reaped from it and i dreamt about being embraced by deep blue liquid metal webs of wire and music id woken up that night from one of these strange dreams i opened my eyes a smile on my face good things were certainly coming my husband was sleeping soundly beside me in the dim moonlight he looked so peaceful his skin no longer smelled of alcohol i leaned forward and kissed his lips he didnt wake i slipped out of bed and put on some pants and a long sleeve shirt the mosquitoes would be out tonight i grabbed my guitar id named my zombie udide okwanka in my language it means spider the artist according to legend udide okwanka is the supreme artist and she lives underground where she takes fragments of things and changes them into something else she can even weave spirits from straw it was a good name for my zombie i wondered what udide named me i was sure it named me something though i doubted that it told the others about me i dont think it would have been allowed to keep seeing me udide was waiting for me there as if it sensed i would come out this night i grinned my heart feeling so warm i sat down as it left the pipeline and crept up to me it carried its instrument on top of its head a sort of complex star made of wire over the weeks it had added more wire lines some thin and some thick i often wondered where it put this thing when it was running about with the others for the instrument was too big to hide on its body udide held it before its eyes with a front leg it plucked out a sweet simple tune that almost made me weep with joy it conjured up images of my mother and father when they were so young and full of hope when my brothers and i were too young to marry and move away before the kill and go had driven my oldest brother away to america and my middle brother to the north when there was so much potential i laughed and wiped away a tear and started strumming some chords to support the tune from there we took off into something so intricate enveloping intertwining chei i felt as if i was communing with god ahah this machine and me you cant imagine eme our music instantly fell apart eme my husband called again i froze staring at udide who was also motionless please i whispered to it dont hurt him samuel messaged me my husband said his eyes still on his cell phone as he stepped up to me through the tall grass theres a break in the pipeline near the school not a goddamn zombie in sight yet throw down that guitar woman lets go and get he looked up a terrified look took hold of his face for a very long time it seemed we all were frozen in time my husband standing just at the last of the tall grass udide standing in front of the pipeline instrument held up like a ceremonial shield and me between the two of them too afraid to move i turned to my husband andrew i said with the greatest of care let me explain he slowly dragged his gaze to me and gave me a look as if he was seeing me for the first time my own wife he whispered i udide raised its two front legs for a moment it looked almost like it was pleading with me or maybe offering me a hug then it clicked its legs together so hard that it produced a large red spark and an ear splitting ting my husband and i clapped our hands over our ears the air instantly smelled like freshly lit matches even through the palms of my hands i could hear the responses from down the pipeline the clicking was so numerous that it sounded like a rain of tiny pebbles falling on the pipeline udide shuddered scrambled back and stood on it waiting they came in a great mob about twenty of them the first thing that i noticed was their eyes they were all a deep angry red the others scrambled around udide tapping their feet in complex rhythms on the pipe i couldnt see udides eyes then they all ran off with amazing speed to the east i turned to my husband he was gone word spread like a disease because almost everyone had a cell phone soon everyone was clicking away on them messaging things like pipeline burst near school no zombies in sight and hurry to school bring bucket my husband never let me have my own cell phone we couldnt afford one and he didnt think i needed one but i knew where the elementary school was people now believed that the zombies had all gone rogue shrugging off their mangiven jobs to live in the delta swamps and do whatever it was they did there normally if bunkerers broke open a pipeline even for the quietest jobs the zombies would become aware of it within an hour and repair the thing within another hour but two hours later this broken pipe continued to splash fuel that was when someone had decided to put the word out i knew better the zombies werent zombies at all they were thinking creatures smart beasts they had a method to their madness and most of them did not like human beings the chaos was lit by the headlights of several cars and trucks the pipeline here was raised as it traveled south someone had taken advantage of this and removed a whole section of piping pink diesel fuel poured out of both ends like a giant fountain people crowded beneath the flow like parched elephants filling jerri cans bottles bowls buckets one man even held a garbage bag until the fuel ate through the bag splashing fuel all over the mans chest and legs the spillage collected into a large dark pink pool that swiftly flowed toward the elementary school gathering on the playground the fumes hit me even before i got within sight of the school my eyes watered and my nose started running i held my shirt over my nose and mouth this barely helped people came in cars motorcycles buses on foot everyone was messaging on their cell phones further spreading the word it had been a while since people who did not make a career out of fuel theft had gotten a sip of free fuel there were children everywhere they ran up and down sent on errands by their parents or just hanging around to be a part of the excitement theyd probably never seen people able to go near a pipeline without getting killed hiphop and highlife blasted from cars and suvs with enhanced sound systems the baseline vibrations were almost as stifling as the fumes i had not a doubt that the zombies knew this was going on i spotted my husband he was heading toward the fountain of fuel with a large red bucket five men started arguing amongst each other two of them started pushing and shoving almost falling into the fountain andrew i called over all the noise he turned when he saw me he narrowed his eyes please i said im im sorry he spat and started walking away you have to get out of here i said they will come he whirled around and strode up to me how the hell are you so sure did you bring them yourself as if in response people suddenly started screaming and running i cursed the zombies were coming from the street forcing people to run toward the pool of fuel i cursed again my husband was glaring at me he pointed into my face with a look of disgust i couldnt hear what he said over all the noise he turned and ran off i tried to spot udide amongst the zombies all of their eyes were still red was udide even amongst them i stared at their legs searching for the butterfly sticker there it was closest to me to the left udide i called as the name came out of my mouth i saw two of the zombies in the center each raise two front legs my smile went to an o of shock i dropped to the ground and threw my hands over my head people were still splashing across the pool of fuel trying to get into the school their cars continued blasting hiphop and highlife the headlights still on lighting the madness the two zombies clicked their legs together producing two large sparks ting whoooooooosh i remember light heat the smell of burning hair and flesh and screams that melted to guttural gurgles the noise was muffled the stench was awful my head to my lap i remained in this hellish limbo for a long long time ill never teach music at the elementary school it was incinerated along with many of the children who went to it my husband was killed too he died thinking i was some sort of spy fraternizing with the enemy or something like that everyone died except me just before the explosion happened udide ran to me it protected me with its force field so i lived and so did the baby inside me the baby that my body allowed to happen because of udides lovely soothing music udide tells me it is a girl how can a robot know this udide and i play for her every day i can only imagine how content she is but what kind of world will i be bringing her into where only her mother and udide stand between a flat out war between the zombies and the human beings who created them pray that udide and i can convince man and droid to call a truce otherwise the delta will keep rolling in blood metal and flames you know what else you should also pray that these zombies dont build themselves some fins and travel across the ocean woman leaves room robert reed she wears a smile i like her smile nervous and maybe a little scared sweet and somewhat lonely she wears jeans and a sheer green blouse and comfortable sandals and rings on two fingers and a glass patch across one eye standing at her end of the room she asks how i feel i feel fine i tell her so and i tell her my name and she puts her hands together and says thats a nice name i ask to hear hers but she says no then she laughs and says that she wants to be a creature of secrets both of us laugh and watch each other her smile changes as she makes herself ready for what happens next i read her face her body she wants me to speak the perfect words offer themselves to me and i open my mouth but there comes a soundan important urgent noteand the glass patch turns opaque hiding one of those pretty brown eyes she takes a quick deep breath watching what i cant see seconds pass her shoulders drop and she widens her stance absorbing some burden then the patch clears and she tells me what i have already guessed something has happened something needs her immediate attention please be patient please she says then she promises to be right back i watch her turn away i watch her legs and long back and the dark brown hair pushed into a sloppy temporary bun a purse waits in the chair she picks it up and hangs it on her shoulder her next two steps are quick but then she slows doubt and regret take hold as she reaches the open door entering the hallway she almost looks back at me she wants to and doesnt want to and her face keeps changing she feels sad and im sure that she is scared but whatever the problem she wants to smile not quite meeting my eyes with her final expression and i wave a hand and wish her well but she has already vanished down the hallway the room is my room the chairs and long sofa are familiar and look comfortable and i know how each would feel if i sat but i dont sit standing is most natural and it takes no energy the carpet beneath me is soft and deep and wonderfully warm on bare feet i stand where i am and wait and wait the walls are white and decorated with framed paintings of haystacks and there is a switch beside the door and a fan and light on the ceiling the light burns blue the fan turns clicking and wobbling slightly with each rotation a window is on my right but its blinds are drawn and dark behind me is another door i could turn and see what it offers but i dont i am waiting she is gone but will return and she has to appear inside the first door and i spend nothing not even time waiting for what i remember best which is her pretty face a similar face appears but this is a man wearing white trousers and a black shirt and glovelike shoes and no jewelry and no eye patch he stands on the other side of the door in the hallway holding his hands in front of himself much as she did he stares at me and says nothing i ask who he is he blinks and steps back and asks who i am i tell him and he laughs nervously i dont know why i like the sound of laughter so much he repeats my name and asks new questions and i answer what i can answer while smiling at him wondering how to make this man laugh again do i know what i am meant to be he asks which is a very different question than asking who i am i have no answer to give then he lists names one after another waiting for me to recognize any of them i dont thats not surprising he says i was only begun and then left which is too bad which is sad i nod and smile politely then he asks if i have ever seen anybody else and i describe the woman who just left the room thats how i get him to laugh again but it is a nervous little laugh dissolving into sharp confused emotions that woman was my mother he says he claims that thirtyone years have passed and she barely started me before something happened to her but he doesnt explain this is all unexpected i am not expected i nod and smile watching him cry he wants to hear about the woman i tell him everything and then she left i tell how the patch darkened interrupting us and i describe the purse and how she carried it and the last troubled look that she showed me and what does it mean that im not finished it means you are small and nearly invisible he says it means that you have existed for three decades without anybody noticing but time has no weight no object outside this room has consequences and this young man standing out in the hallway is no more real than the painted haystacks on the walls what i want is for the woman to return i want her weight and reality and thats what i tell this stranger shaking his head he tells me that i am unreal why he would lie is a mystery he mentions his father and cries while looking at me do i know that his father died before he was born an unreal person can never be born i think you were begun but only just begun he keeps saying then he admits that he doesnt know what to do with me as if he has any say in these matters his final act is to turn and vanish never trying to step inside the room but he wasnt real to begin with i know this what cannot stand beside me is false and suspicious and the lesson gives me more weight more substance the epiphany carrying me forward another man appears like the first man he cannot or will not step out of the hallway he looks at my face and body and face again he wears a necklace and sturdy boots and odd clothes that cant stay one color he says that it took him forever to find me and finding me was the easiest part of his job operating systems were changed after the cleansing he had to resurrect codes and passwords and build machines that havent existed in quite some time then on top of that he had to master a dialect that died off ages ago he wants to know if hes making any sense he is a madman and i tell him so i found your file logs he says laughing and nodding stored in another server and mislabeled but that was just another stumbling block i dont know what that means he claims that his greatgrandfather was the last person to visit me phantoms like to tell stories i nod politely at his story saying nothing he tells me that the man lived to be one hundred and fifty but he died recently there was a will and my location was mentioned in the will until then i was a family legenda legend wrapped around twin tragedies his great grandfathers father was killed in the fourth gulf war and his greatgreatgrandmother missed him terribly she was the one who began me she spent quite a lot of money using medical records and digital files to create a facsimile of her soul mate and she would have finished me at least as far as the software of the day would have allowed but her son was hurt at daycare he fell and cut himself and she was hurrying to the hospital when a stupid kid driver shut off his cars autopilot and ran her down in the street the boy wasnt seriously hurt what mattered was that the boy his greatgrandfather was three and orphaned and a drunken aunt ended up raising him and for the rest of his many many days that man felt cheated and miserable i listen to every word nodding patiently he wants to know what i think of the story he is crazy but i prefer to say nothing frowning he tells me that a great deal of work brought him to this point he says that i should be more appreciative and impressed then he asks if i understand how i managed to survive for this long but no time has passed i reply he waves a hand dismissing my words you are very small he says tiny files that are never opened can resist corruption i am not small i am everything he has copied me he claims he says that he intends to finish the new copy as best he can but he will leave the original alone pausing he waits for my thanks i say nothing showing him a grim suspicious face but you do need clothes he says except this is how i am my greatgreat grandma had some plan for you he says but i wont think about that he says and besides clothes wont take much room in the file my body feels different much better he says and steps out of view time becomes real when the mind has great work to do my first eternity is spent picking at the trousers and shirt eroding them until they fall away threads of changing color sprawled across the eternal carpet yet nothing is eternal each of the haystacks begins with the same pleasantly rounded shape but some have turned lumpy and ragged at the edges while my favorite stack has a large gap eaten through its middle and i remember the straw having colors instead of that faded uniform gray and i remember the sofa being soft buttery yellow and the rooms walls were never this rough looking and the colored threads have vanished entirely which seems good but the carpet looks softer and feels softer than seems right my feet practically melting into their nature portions of my room are falling apart as an experiment i study the nearest haystack until i know it perfectly and then i shut my eyes and wait and wait and wait still longer remembering everything when i look again the painting has changed but i cant seem to decide how it has changed which means the problem perhaps lies in my memory or maybe with my perishable mind fear gives me ideas my legs have never moved and they dont know how i have to teach them to walk one after the other each step requires learning and practice and more time than i can hope to measure but at least my one hand knows how to reach out and grab hold i push at the windows blinds but for all of my effort nothing is visible except a dull grayishblack rectangle that means nothing to me stepping backwards is more difficult than walking forwards but turning around is nearly impossible and i give up in little steps i retreat to the place where i began the carpet remembers my feet but the carpet feels only halfreal or my feet are beginning to dissolve the woman will be here soon i tell myself that even when i dont believe it and the fear grows worse i start to look at my favorite hand studying each finger noting how the flesh has grown hairless and very simple the nails on the end of every finger swallowed by the simple skin a stranger suddenly comes to the door hello it says what it looks like is impossible to describe i have no words to hang on what i see and maybe there is nothing to see but my feeling is that the visitor is smiling and happy and it sounds like a happy voice asking how i am feeling i am nearly dead i say there is death and there is life it tells me you are still one thing which means you are not the other i am alive it claims that i am lucky it tells me much about systems and files and the history of machines that have survived in their sleep mode lasting thousands of years past every estimate of what was possible i am a fluke and alive and my guest says something about tidying the room and me the work takes no time my favorite hand is the way it began my favorite haystack is rather like it began in terms of color and shape legs that never moved until recently barely complain when i walk across the room it never occurred to me that i could reach into the haystack paintings touching those mounds of dead grass some feel cool some warm i sing out my pleasure and even my voice feels new my guest watches me making small last adjustments because it is proper i thank it for its help but the original file is gone now it says i ask what that means it tells me that i am a copy of the file filtered and enhanced according to the best tools available once more i offer my thanks and with a voice that conveys importance my guest tells me that i have a new purpose what i am will be copied once more but this time as a kind of light that can pierce dust and distance and might never end its travels across the galaxy and beyond i dont understand and i tell it so then my friend does one last task and everything is apparent to me i ask when am i going to be sent in another few moments it promises for the last time i thank my benefactor then i let my legs turn me around looking at the door that was always behind me a second room waits the bed is longer than it is wide and rectangular and neatly made pillows are stacked high against the headboard and identical nightstands sport tall candles that have not stopped burning in some great span of time i know this other room i think of her and the room and step toward the door and then suffer for my eagerness what is wrong asks a new voice i turn back a creature with many arms stands in the hallway you appear agitated says the creature which is true but i am not sure why i feel this way i stare into a face that seems buried in the creatures chest hanging word after inadequate word on my emotions it listens i pause you are interesting says the creature i am nothing but a file with a name and a few rough qualities but my new companion dismisses my harsh outlook every arm moves drawing complex shapes in the air you are part of a large cultural package it says and do you know how long you have been traveling in space i could guess i say i could invent infinite estimates all but one of them wrong and then it laughs revealing a reassuring humor even this strange laugh makes me happier than i was before an eight billion year voyage it says that seems like an unlikely preposterous figure and it shakes me it explains that it cant determine which star was mine and my galaxy barely wears a name and most of the data that came with me has been lost to the vagaries of time and the great distance being covered but here you stand it says i am standing but sad my savior is full of hearty laughter yet i feel sick and sorry and lost she is gone forever i say it knows whom i am talking about it measures my misery and learns what it can from my longing and then at the end as if delivering the punch line of a joke it laughs and says but the universe is infinite and in too many ways to count i dont know what that means infinite means eternal it says and eternal means that nothing is unthinkable and what can be imagined is inevitable but when i ask and again the alien laughs saying are you hearing me there is no such monster as when i am a file and i am protected and i dont know where i am or how well i am protected time stretches and i suspect that i exist mostly inside some sleep mode probably initiating only when i blink my eyes once again the two rooms decay and the haystacks fall apart and i forget how to move and forget a great deal more too beyond the walls worlds die and dissolve away little flickers tear the walls to pieces but the pieces knit themselves back together and i wait and wait and then she comes through the door once again her clothes are different there is no eye patch and no purse but while i am uncertain about much i know that beautiful face it took me a little while she explains she walks toward me pulling the pins out of her brown hair and thats when i remember what i was going to tell her that first time that we met i wont ever let you out of this room darling i say it now she thinks that is funny and wonderful and laughs and in another moment i cant remember anything else that ever happened the universe is nothing but the two of us holding each other laughing ourselves sick all that touches the air an owomoyela when i was ten i saw a man named menley brought out to the ocean of starve thirty of us colonials gathered around sweating in our envirosuits under the cerulean sky while bailiffs flashed radio signals into the ocean soon enough the silvery vosth fog swarmed up and we watched the bailiffs take off menleys suit helmet first they worked down his body until every inch of his skin was exposed every last inch menley was mad colonists dementia born on earth he was one of the unlucky sixpointthree percent who set down outside the solar system in strange atmospheres gravities rates of orbit and rotation and just snapped because everything was almost like earth but wasnt quite right in his dementia hed defecated somewhere public uncouth of him but it wouldnt have got him thrown to the ocean except that the governors were fed up with limited resources and strict colonial bylaws and earths fuck off on your own attitude and menley crapping on the communal lawns was the last insult they could take he was nobody here on predonia he was a madman no one would miss him the fog crawled out of the water and over his body colonizing his pores permeating bone and tissue bleeding off his ability to yell or fight back he was on his side in a convulsion before the vosth parasites took his motor functions and stood his body up they turned around and staggered into the ocean of starve and it was eight years before i saw menley again before that when i was sixteen i was studying hydroponics and genetic selection in the heat of the greenhouse everyone could notice that i wore long clothing high collars gloves id just passed the civics tests and become a voting adult and that meant dressing in another envirosuit and going out to the ocean again the auditor sat me down in a comm booth and the vosth swarmed into its speakers the voice they synthesized was tinny and inhuman we tell our history of this colony they said you came past the shell of atmosphere we were at that time the dominant species you made your colonies in the open air we harvested the utility of your bodies but you proved sentience and sapience and an understanding was formed you would keep your colony to lands prescribed for you you would make shells against our atmosphere you would accept our law all that touches the air belongs to us what touches the air is ours endria was a prodigy she passed her civics tests at thirteen she was also stupid after two years in hydroponics i graduated to waste reclamation specialty in chemicalaccelerated blackwater decomposition no one wanted the job so the compensation was greatand it came with a hazard suit i used to take a sterile shower in the waste facility and walk to my room in my suit past the airlock that led to the open air thats where i caught endria emancipated adults werent beholden to curfew so she was out unsupervised she was also opening the door without an envirosuit on i ran up to stop her and pulled her hand from the control panel hey she wrenched her hand away no thanks there what are you doing what are you doing i asked back youre endangering the colony i should report you is it my civic or personal responsibility to leave people out there when theyre trying to get in i looked through the porthole to see what she was talking about i had no peripheral vision in the suit so i hadnt seen anyone in the airlock but endria was right someone was trying to get in menley was trying to get in he looked the same silvery skin dead expression eyes and muscles moving like the vosth could work out how each part of his face functioned but couldnt put it all together i jumped back i thought i could feel vosth crawling inside my envirosuit hes not allowed in i said im contacting security response why isnt he of all the idiotic questions hes been taken over by the vosth and we maintain a civil reciprocal policy toward them endria said were allowed in their territory without notification so they should be allowed in ours besides the vosth there was nothing i hated more than someone whod just come out of a civics test unless we take them over when they wander in its not reciprocal i said vosthmenley put his hand against the porthole his silver fingers squished against the composite i stepped back you know it all who gets notified if an infested colonist tries to walk into the habitat her face screwed up i guess that wasnt on her exam ill find out she said turning on her heel dont create an interspecies incident while im gone she flounced away i turned back to the porthole where vosthmenley had smooshed his nose up against the composite as well i knocked my helmet against the door leave i told him them it he stared dead eyes unblinking then slouched away i didnt sleep that night my brain played oldearth zombie flicks whenever i closed my eyes staffed by silver monstrosities instead of rotting corpses endria thought id create an interspecies incident i thought about how many people would be trapped without esuits if a vosth infestation broke out how many people would be screaming and convulsing and then just staggering around with dead silver eyes soft hands pressing into portholes skin teeming with parasites ready to crawl into anyone they saw i talked to the governor on duty the next day who confirmed that the colony would strongly prefer if the vosth werent allowed to walk around in naked fleshsuits inside the habitat she even sent out a public memo three days later endria came to give me crap about it the way she walked into my lab she looked like someone took one of the governors shrunk them and reworked their face to fit that impish craze back in the s she even had a datapad and a buttonup tunic under her hygienic jacket im not going to enjoy this am i i asked i came to interview you about civil law and the vosth she said its for a primary certification in government apprenticeship im going to be a governor by the time im sixteen i stared at her its part of a civics certification so i can make you answer she added wonderful after these titrations i told her endria went to one of the counters and boosted herself onto it dropped her datapad beside her and reached into a pocket to pull out something colorful and probably fragrant and nutrientscarce thats okay we can make small talk while youre working i know titration isnt demanding on the linguistic portions of your brain excepting the vosth there was nothing i hated more than people who thought they knew more about my work than i did sit quietly i said ill be with you shortly to my surprise she actually sat quietly to my annoyance that lasted through a total of one titration and a half im going to interview you about the sentence passed on ken menley in colony record zerozerozerothreezerofour she said according to my research you were the youngest person there as well as the only person there to meet menley again you have a unique perspective on vosthhuman interactions after the incident a few nights ago i thought it would be a good idea to focus my paper on them my perspective i started to say but thought better of calling the vosth names usually reserved for human excrement they were shit they were horrifying they were waiting out there to crawl inside us and if endria was going to be a governor by age sixteen shed probably have the authority to rehabilitate me by sixteen and a half i didnt want her thinking i needed my opinions revised i have no perspective i dont deal with them endria rolled the candy around in her mouth i dont think any of my friends are friends with you she said isnt it weird to go past two degrees of separation wouldnt know i said my primary degrees of separation were limited to my supervisor and the quartermaster i requisitioned esuits from i wouldnt call either of them friends endria kicked her heels tilting her head so far her ear rested on her shoulder everyone thinks youre a creep because you never take that esuit off thats nice i said are you afraid of the vosth endria asked she said it like that was unreasonable i have a healthy skepticism that theyre good neighbors i said and thats why you wear an esuit no i said thats why im active in colonial politics and took the civics track with an emphasis on interspecies diplomacy i set down the beaker i was working with for irony endria sucked on her teeth then gave me a smile i couldnt read you could go into vosth research its a promising new area of scientific inquiry i pushed the beaker aside what new area weve been here for a generation bureaucracy is slow but its not that slow its a hard science not sociological she said we couldnt do that before i dont know much about it but theres all sorts of government appropriations earmarked for it dont you read the public accounting i turned to look at her she was kicking her heels against the table you should go into vosth research and you should use your experience with menley to open up a line of inquiry its probably xenobiology or something but it might be fertile ground for new discoveries then you could be the colonys expert on the vosth interspecies relations are an important part of this colony thats why im writing a paper on them for my civics certification im not getting this titration done am i endria smiled and said the words most feared by common citizens interacting with civil law this will only take a minute it wasnt against the law to go outside the compound and some people liked the sunlight some peopledaredevils and risktakerseven enjoyed the fresh air as for me i passed the front door every time i got off work and always felt like i was walking along the edge of a cliff id tried taking different routes but that made it worse somehow like if i didnt keep my eye on it the airlock would blow out and let these seething waves of silver flow in and i wouldnt know until i got back to my shower or had to switch out my suit for cleaning or id be opening my faceplate for dinner and feel something else on my lips and there would be the vosth crawling inside i had trouble eating if i didnt walk past the airlock to make sure it was closed yeah menley made that worse i started staring at the airlock expecting to see his face squashed up against it maybe he was just outside seconds away from getting some idiot like endria to let him in people walked past me and i could hear them talking in low tones while i watched the airlock like maybe id gone into an absence seizure and they should get someone to haul me away and then they could have me investigated for colonists dementia despite the fact that id been born here and they could take me out to the ocean of starve after two nights i realized if i didnt step outside to make sure the vosth werent coming with a swarm i was heading for a paranoid fugue actually walking out took two more nights because i couldnt stand to open the airlock myself i finally saw a couple strolling out as i passed esuited hand in esuited hand and i fell in behind them the airlock and the outside were the only places i could be anonymous in my esuit the couple didnt even cross to the other side of the enclosure as it cycled the air and opened the outer door the grass was tealgreen i hear its less blue on earth and the sky is less green but i was just glad neither one was silver the sunlight was strong and golden the clouds were mercifully white and there wasnt a trace of fog to be seen so that was good for the moment the ocean of starve was a good tenminute hike away and i didnt want to get near it i walked around the habitat instead eyeing the horizon in the oceans direction id made it about a halfkilometer around the periphery when i caught a flash of silver out of the corner of my eye and jumped ready for it to be a trick of the light or a metal component on the eggshell exterior of the dome no it was menley i screamed the scream instinct isnt one of evolutions better moves actually its a terrible idea the instant sound left my mouth menley turned and dragged himself toward me i considered running but i had this image of tripping and either losing a boot or ripping a hole in my esuit menley staggered up and stared at me i took a step back menley turned his head like he wasnt sure which eye got a better view and i stepped back again after about a minute of this i said you really want inside the compound dont you the vosth opened menleys mouth his nostrils flared i guess they were doing something like they did to the speakers in the audience boothvibrating the equipment the voice if you wanted to call it that was quiet and reedy we are the vosth i know that i said and took another step back from them him vosthmenley you will let us inside he asked with an artificial rise to his voice i guess the vosth had to telegraph their questions maybe they werent used to asking no i told him he shifted his weight forward and ignored my answer the vosth are allowed inside your partition shell look what you do to people i said no youre not allowed inside this is natural they said and i had no idea if that was supposed to be an argument or agreement what take off your suit vosthmenley said hell no the air creates a pleasurable sensation on human skin and the vosth create a pleasant infestation we will promise not to take you if they had to tell me i wasnt trusting them why do you want me to do you want to the vosth asked i checked the seal on my suit take off your suit vosthmenley said again im going home now i answered and ran for the compound door endria was in the canteen sitting on a table watching a slowwave newsfeed from earth and nibbling on a finger sandwich and i was annoyed to run into her there i was also annoyed that it took me that long to run into her after trying to run into her in the library the courthouse auditorium the promenade and my lab endria just annoyed me i dodged a few people on their rest hours and walked up to her table putting my hands down on it i hadnt sterilized them after being outside and was technically breaching a bylaw or two but that didnt occur to me i guess i was lucky endria didnt perform a civilian arrest one i said i dont want anything to do with the vosth in a lab or outside of one and two in no more than thirty seconds explain vosth legal rights outside the colony compound endria jumped kicking over the chair her feet were resting on and looking agape at me in the middle of a bite of sandwich sweet schadenfreude the first word out of her mouth was the nonetoosmart uh of course she regrouped quickly first of all the vosth dont believe in civil or social law she said just natural law so the treaty we have isnt really a treaty just them explaining what they do so we had the option not to let them we dont have legal recourse its like that inside the colony toowe can adjust the air system to filter them out and kill them so they know were in charge in here and dont try to come inside except for menley but thats weird and thats why im doing a paper did you find anything out i ignored that and he doesnt act like the otherhow many other infested colonists are there she shrugged a lot like more than forty a few of them were killed by panicked colonists though we dont know much about them in the last hundred records menleys the only vosthmenley i corrected endria rolled her eyes yeah that whatever vosthmenley is the only one to make contact with us theres actually this theory that the rest are off building a civilization now that the vosth have opposable thumbs even if its only like eighty opposable thumbs the base of my neck itched fortunately years in an envirosuit let me ignore that we lost forty colonists to the vosth oh yeah she said and more when everyone panicked and there were riots and we thought there was going to be a war thats why so many earthshipped embryos were matured so fast in fact our colony has the highest percapita percentage of invitro citizens weve got sixtythree percent im one of them i said ive got parents endria responded i managed not to strangle her so theres no law not really endria said but theres a lot of unwritten stuff and assumed stuff like we just assume that if we wear esuits out they wont think they own the esuits even though they touch the air and we assume that if they did come in the compound theyd be nice she shot me a sharp look but i dont think thats an issue now since you squealed to the governors yeah thanks i did not squeal endria just didnt see what was wrong with having a sentient invasive disease wandering around your colony im going to go now i still want to complete our interview endria said i think you have opinion data youre holding back later i said gave a little wave and headed off on the way out of the canteen i ran into one of the auxiliary governors who pulled me aside and gave my envirosuit the usual look of disdain citizen she said i need a thumbprint verification to confirm that your complaint to the colony council was resolved to your satisfaction your complaint about the infested colonist i looked to the hall leading in the direction of the outside doors right now it will only take a moment i looked to the vents and then back at endria i hated thumbprint confirmations quickly i unsealed one glove pulled my hand out and pressed my thumb into the datapad sensor the air drew little fingers along my palm tested my wrist seal tickled the back of my hand thank you citizen the auxiliary said and wandered off i tucked my exposed hand under my other arm and hurried back toward my room to sterilize hand and glove and put my suit back together i went outside again i dont know why specialized insanity maybe actually no this was like those people on mulciber whod go outside in their hazard suits even though the mulciber colony was on a patch of stable ground that didnt extend much beyond the habitat and they always ran the risk of falling into a magma chamber or having a glob of superheated rock smash their faceplate in some people find something terrifying and then just have to go out to stare it in the face another one of evolutions lessthanbrilliant moves vosthmenley was stretching his stolen muscles by the shore of the starve i could see the muscles moving under his skin he laced his fingers together and pulled his hands above his head he planted his feet and bent at the waist so far that his forehead almost touched the ground i couldnt do any of that i went through the usual colonyprescribed exercises every morning the envirosuit pinched and chafed but like hell i was going to show off my body any longer than i had to vosthmenley didnt have that problem the vosth could walk around naked for all they cared if they had a body to be naked the vosth noticed me and vosthmenley turned around he clomped his way over and i tried not to back away the air is temperate at this time at these coordinates vosthmenley said i looked over the turbid water it caught the turquoise of the sky and reflected slate underlaid with silver why do you call this the ocean of starve vosthmenley turned back to the ocean his gaze ran over the surface eyes moving in separate directions and his mouth slacked open our genetic structure was encoded in a meteorite he said we impacted this world long ago and altered the ecosystem we adapted to rely on the heat of free volcanic activity which was not this worlds stable state when the world cooled our rate of starvation exceeded our rate of adaptation here underwater vents provided heat to sustain our adaptation until we could survive my stomach turned why do you take people over your bodies are warm and comfortable even though we proved sapience to you i said vosthmenley didnt answer what would you do if i took off my envirosuit you would feel the air vosthmenley said like i wouldnt notice that he hadnt answered the question i know that what would you do you the vosth you would feel the gentle sun warming your skin i backed away nothing was stopping him from lunging and tearing off my suit not if what endria said was true that it was the law of the wild out here why didnt he you dont see anything wrong with that i wished he would blink maybe gesture tapdance anything you have been reacting to us with fear the conversation was an exercise in stating the useless and obvious i dont want to end up like menley i said cant you understand that would you want that to happen to you we are the dominant species the vosth said we would not be taken over empathy i muttered i wasnt expecting him to hear it learn it we are not averse to learning the vosth said do you engage in demonstration demonstration empathy i shook my head you dont get what im saying would we be better if we understood he asked and stumbled forward with sudden intensity i jumped back ready to fight him off ready to run we want to understand can the vosth change was the first thing i wrote to endria when i sat down at my terminal i dont know why i kept asking her things maybe despite the fact that she was five years my junior and a pain in the rectum she was still less annoying than the diplomatic auditors maybe because she was the only person who didnt look at me like they might have to call security response if i walked up i didnt really talk to anyone on my off hours she never wrote me back instead she showed up at my door youre going to have to be a little more specific hello endria i said as i let her in nice of you to stop by you couldnt have just written that out she huffed you have a pretty nice room you know that the quarters i can get if i want to move out of our familys allotment are all little closets get a job i said look when you said the vosth dont you ever take that suit off she interrupted i mean were inside about five different air filtration systems and an airlock or two i ran a hand around the collar of my envirosuit i like having it on how do you eat i open it to eat and shower and piss and i took it off to change into other suits and have the ones id been wearing cleaned i just didnt enjoy it can you reason with the vosth endria shook her head more specific do they change their behavior i asked endria wandered over to my couch and sat down giving me a disparaging look nice specifics they adapt if thats what you mean didnt you listen at your initiation they came to this planet and couldnt survive here so they adapted some people think thats why we can negotiate with them at all i didnt follow what does that have to do with negotiation well its all theoretical she said and tried to fish something out of her teeth with her pinky endria negotiation adaptation what they adapt she said they fell out of the sky and almost died here and then they adapted and they became the dominant species then we landed which is way better than falling and we have all this technology they dont have and they cant just read our minds even if they take us over so wouldnt you negotiate for that to stay the dominant species i think they want to be more like us would we be better if we understood the vosth had asked they said they took over colonists because our bodies were comfortable i said endria shrugged maybe being dominant is comfortable for them i ran a hand over my helmet charming i mean letting them be dominant sure isnt comfortable for you i glared what its comfortable for you theyre not that bad endria said i mean theyre not territorial or anything they just do their thing when im a governor i want to see if we can work together yeah us and the bodysnatchers endria tilted her head at me you know i think it would be kinda neat sharing your body with the vosth i mean if it wasnt a permanent thing i bet youd get all sorts of new perspectives i gaped i dont think endria saw my expression through the helmet but it was disturbing enough that she didnt share it it is a permanent thing and you dont shareyou dont get control they take you over and you just die theres probably nothing left of you or if there is youre just stuck in your head screaming and thats why youre asking if the vosth can change endria asked im asking because i started and then couldnt finish that sentence endria smiled it was a nasty sort of hahiknewit smile see she said hopping off the couch and heading for the door you are interested in vosth research twenty minutes later someone knocked on my door i opened it thinking it was endria back to irritate me no in the corridor outside my room stood a widefaced highcollared balding man with an expression like hed been eating ascorbic acid and a badge on his lapel reading diplomatic auditor in big bold letters hed even brought a datapad this is a notice citizen he said youre not authorized to engage in diplomatic action with the vosth im not engaging in diplomatic action i said shuffling through possible excuses itd be easier if i had any idea what i was doing im engaging in research he didnt look convinced civil research i said picking up a pen from my desk and wagging it at him like he should know better helping endria with her civics certification didnt she fill out the right forms to make me one of her resources there were no forms as far as i knew still if there were i could probably shuffle off the responsibility onto endria and if there werent the sourface in front of me would probably go and draft some up to mollify himself either way i was off the hook for a moment he marked something down on his datapad im going to check into this he warned at which point hed argue his case against endria poor bastards both of them expect further communication from a member of the governing commission he warned satisfied with that threat he turned and went away for about a day i decided work was safer if i kept to the restrictedaccess parts of the waste reclamation facility i could cut down on endria sightings and i could work long hours surely the governors wouldnt work late just to harass me it wasnt a longterm solution still i thought itd be longerterm than one work shift i got back to my room and my terminal was blinking and when i sat down it triggered an automatic callback and put me on standby for two minutes now in theory automatic callbacks were only for highpriority colony business which considering id seen my supervisor not ten minutes ago and i wasnt involved in anything important in governance i expected to mean that endria wanted something and they took civics certification courses way more seriously than id thought i went to get a drink while it was trying to connect and i came back to a line of text on an encrypted channel coming from the office of the prime governor most of my water ended up on my boots sorry im doing this over text she wrote i just wanted an official record of our conversation when a governor wants an official record of your conversation youre fucked what can i do for you i typed back someone stopped by to talk to you she went on the lines spooling out over the screen in realtime about your not being authorized to engage in diplomatic action i had expected that to be defused not to escalate escalating up to the prime governor had been right out i still believe that i wasnt engaging in diplomatic i started but she typed right over it how would you like authorization that hadnt been on the list of possibilities either im sorry i typed what i almost typed and might have typed if i didnt value my civil liberties was i recycle shit for a living my skillset is not what youre looking for you may be aware that were pioneering a new focus of study into the vosth the governor typed vosth research i wondered if endria had recommended me upward yes maam i wrote we now believe that we can reverse the effects of vosth colonization of a human host i looked at my water i looked at my boots after a moment i typed maam and got up for another glass i needed it i came back to a paragraph explaining youve been in contact with one of the infested colonists wed like you to bring him back to the compound for experimentation okay so long as i was just being asked to harvest test subjects you want to cure menley we believe it unlikely that human consciousness would survive anywhere on the order of years she typed back and my stomach twisted like it had talking to menley this would be a proof of concept which could be applied to the more recently infected and menley wasnt someone whod be welcomed back into the colony i read between the lines i shouldve asked endria who had sat on the council that decided menleys sentence was this particular prime governor serving back then why did i never remember these things why did i never think to ask so you would extract the vosth i started and was going to write leaving a corpse maybe hoping that wed at least get a breathing body she interrupted me again the vosth parasite organisms would not be extracted they would die my mouth was dry but the idea of drinking water made me nauseous it was like anyone or anything in menleys body was fair game for anyone i want to be clear with you she said dammit she could have just lied like they did in every dramatic work id ever read then if the truth ever came out i could be horrified but still secure in the knowledge that there was no way i could have known no i just got told to kidnap someone so the scientists could kill him i wasnt even saving anyone well maybe in the future if anyone got infested again anyone the governors felt like curing anyway then she had to go and make it worse we would not be in violation of any treaties or rules of conduct she wrote if we can develop a cure for or immunity to vosth infestation the de facto arrangement in place between our colony and the vosth will be rendered null and the restrictions imposed on our activities on the planet will become obsolete i wished endria was there she could interpret this isnt this an act of war were confident that the vosth will regard an unwarranted act of aggression as an expression of natural law the governor explained that didnt make me feel better and i think it translated to yes i thought it was understood that things like that wouldnt happen it was understood that the dominant species could at any time exercise their natural rights the governor explained perhaps its time they learned that they arent the dominant species any more we believe the ambient temperature to be pleasant for human senses today vosthmenley told me when i got to the ocean of starve i was beginning to wonder whether his reassurances were predation or a mountain of culture skew what is your obsession with me feeling the air i asked him them the vosth you would be safe vosthmenley insisted i should have asked endria if the vosth could lie i should have kept a running list of things i needed to ask listen i said we would like to understand vosthmenley said again i read a lot of earth lit id never seen a butterfly but i knew the metaphor of kids whod pull off their wings looking at menley i wondered if the vosth were like children oblivious to their own cruelty what would you do if someone could take you over our biology is not comparable to yours vosthmenley said bad hypothetical what would you do if someone tried to kill you it is our perception of reality that species attempt to prolong their own existence he said yeah i was having trouble following my own conversation look youre a dominant species and were supposed to have a reciprocal relationship but you take people over andlook id gone past talking myself in circles and was talking myself in scatterplots the back of my neck itched and i couldnt ignore it what if i do want to take off my suit i asked and then scatterplotted do you have any reason to lie to me the vosth considered yes oh okay great our present actions are concurrent with a different directive he added there is reason to establish honesty nothing was stopping him from attacking he could have torn off my suit or helmet by now even if it was a risk and it was a risk and even if i had a phobia the size of the meterorite the vosth had ridden in id seen how many vosth had swarmed over menleys whole body and how long it had taken him to stop twitching if it was just a few of them i might be able to run back to the compound then if the governors really had a cure they could cure me and id feel fine about tricking the vosth into being test subjects if theyd tricked me into being a host thats what i told myself i didnt feel fine about anything i brought my gloves to the catch on my helmet two minutes later i was still standing like that with the catch still sealed and vosthmenley was still staring you could come back to the compound with me i said the governors would love to see you we are curious as to the conditions of your constructed habitat vosthmenley said yeah i thought but are you coming back as a plague bearer or an experiment i squeezed my eyes shut and pried my helmet off id lost way too many referents the outside air closed around my face with too many smells i couldnt identify or describe other than nothing like sterile air and nothing like my room or my shower every nerve on my head and neck screamed for broadcast time registering the temperature of the air the little breezes through the hairs on my nape the warmth of direct sunlight my heart was racing i was breathing way too fast and even with my eyes shut i was overloaded on stimuli i waded my way through it took time but amidst the slog of what i was feeling i eventually noticed something i wasnt anything identifiable as vosth infestation i opened my eyes vosthmenley was standing just where he had been watching just as he had been and i was breathing with my skin touching the outside air touching the air that which touched the air belonged to the vosth i wasnt belonging to the vosth i looked toward the ocean its silver underlayer was still there calm beneath the surface i took a breath i tasted the outside world the gas balance the smell of vegetation working its way from my nostrils to the back of my throat this was a vosth world unless the governors made it a human world and i wasnt sure how to feel about that looking back to vosthmenley i didnt know how hed feel about it either you came from beyond the shell of atmosphere i said like we did right vosthmenley said our genetic predecessors came to this world on an meteorite and you adapted right i almost ran a hand over my helmet but stopped before i touched my hair i hadnt sterilized my gloves never mind that my head wasnt in a sterile environment anymore either do you understand that we adapt it is our perception of reality that living organisms adapt he said that was a yes maybe look we dont have to fight for dominance do we i spread my hands like if you go off and reinvent technology now that you have hands to build things with you dont need to come back here and threaten us we can have an equilibrium his eyes were as dead as usual i had no idea what understanding on a vosth colonist would look like wed both be better we are not averse to an equilibrium vosthmenley said i swallowed then youve gotta go now then when i thought he didnt understand the governors are adapting a way to cure you to kill you making us the dominant species look im telling you what will happen and im giving you the option not to let us do it vosthmenley watched me for a moment then he turned and walked back toward the ocean of starve interspecies incident said a little voice at the corner of my mind it sounded like endria sterile or not i sealed my helmet back onto my esuit and walked back toward the colony at doubletime that night i filed a report saying that id invited vosthmenley back but hed declined for reasons i couldnt make sense of communications barrier i thought of telling the prime governor that she should have sent a diplomatic auditor but didnt i didnt hear anything until the next day when a survey buggy came back in and its driver hopped down and said that something strange happened at the ocean of starve far from being its usual murky silver it was perfectly clear and reflecting the sky he said it to a governor but news spread fast it came to me via endria as i was walking out of my lab the only thing that would cause that would be a mass migration of the vosth but thats not something weve seen in their behavior before now she glared at me like i might know something which of course i did a diplomatic auditor came by later to take a complete transcript of my last interaction with vosthmenley i left most of it out survey buggies kept going out people walked down to the ocean shore auditors flashed radio signals out of the communications booth but no one answered the vosth had vanished and that was all anyone could tell i stopped wearing my envirosuit the first day stepping out of my door i felt lightbodied lightheaded not entirely there i felt like id walked out of my shower without getting dressed i had to force myself to go forward instead of back back to grab my envirosuit to make myself decent i walked into the hall where every moment was the sensory overload of air on my skin where my arms and legs felt loose where everyone could see the expressions on my face that was as frightening as the vosth id just left behind the environmental advantage id had since i was ten but i was adapting maneki neko bruce sterling i cant go on his brother said tsuyoshi shimizu looked thoughtfully into the screen of his pasokon his older brothers face was shiny with sweat from a latenight drinking bout its only a career said tsuyoshi sitting up on his futon and adjusting his pajamas you worry too much all that overtime his brother whined he was making the call from a bar somewhere in shibuya in the background a middleaged office lady was singing karaoke badly and the examination hells the manager training programs the proficiency tests i never have time to live tsuyoshi grunted sympathetically he didnt like these latenight videophone calls but he felt obliged to listen his big brother had always been a decent sort before he had gone through the elite courses at waseda university joined a big corporation and gotten professionally ambitious my back hurts his brother groused i have an ulcer my hair is going gray and i know theyll fire me no matter how loyal you are to the big companies they have no loyalty to their employees anymore its no wonder that i drink you should get married tsuyoshi offered i cant find the right girl women never understand me he shuddered tsuyoshi im truly desperate the market pressures are crushing me i cant breathe my life has got to change im thinking of taking the vows im serious i want to renounce this whole modern world tsuyoshi was alarmed youre very drunk right his brother leaned closer to the screen life in a monastery sounds truly good to me its so quiet there you recite the sutras you consider your existence there are rules to follow and rewards that make sense its just the way that japanese business used to be back in the good old days tsuyoshi grunted skeptically last week i went out to a special place in the mountains mount aso his brother confided the monks there they know about people in trouble people who are burned out by modern life the monks protect you from the world no computers no phones no faxes no email no overtime no commuting nothing at all its beautiful and its peaceful and nothing ever happens there really its like paradise listen older brother tsuyoshi said youre not a religious man by nature youre a section chief for a big importexport company well maybe religion wont work for me i did think of running away to america nothing much ever happens there either tsuyoshi smiled that sounds much better america is a good vacation spot a long vacation is just what you need besides the americans are real friendly since they gave up their handguns but i cant go through with it his brother wailed i just dont dare i cant just wander away from everything that i know and trust to the kindness of strangers that always works for me tsuyoshi said maybe you should try it tsuyoshis wife stirred uneasily on the futon tsuyoshi lowered his voice sorry but i have to hang up now call me before you do anything rash dont tell dad tsuyoshis brother said he worries so i wont tell dad tsuyoshi cut the connection and the screen went dark tsuyoshis wife rolled over heavily she was seven months pregnant she stared at the ceiling puffing for breath was that another call from your brother she said yeah the company just gave him another promotion more responsibilities hes celebrating that sounds nice his wife said tactfully next morning tsuyoshi slept late he was selfemployed so he kept his own hours tsuyoshi was a video format upgrader by trade he transferred old videos from obsolete formats into the new highgrade storage media doing this properly took a craftsmans eye word of tsuyoshis skills had gotten out on the network so he had as much work as he could handle at ten am the mailman arrived tsuyoshi abandoned his breakfast of raw egg and miso soup and signed for a shipment of flaking twentiethcentury analog television tapes the mail also brought a fresh overnight shipment of strawberries and a homemade jar of pickles pickles his wife enthused people are so nice to you when youre pregnant any idea who sent us that just someone on the network great tsuyoshi booted his mediator cleaned his superconducting heads and examined the old tapes home videos from the s someones grandmother as a child presumably there had been a lot of flaking and loss of polarity in the old recording medium tsuyoshi got to work with his desktop fractal detail generator the image stabilizer and the interlace algorithms when he was done tsuyoshis new digital copies would look much sharper cleaner and better composed than the original primitive videotape tsuyoshi enjoyed his work quite often he came across bits and pieces of videotape that were of archival interest he would pass the images on to the net the really big network databases with their armies of search engines indexers and catalogues had some very arcane interests the net machines would never pay for data because the global information networks were noncommercial but the net machines were very polite and had excellent net etiquette they returned a favor for a favor and since they were machines with excellent enormous memories they never forgot a good deed tsuyoshi and his wife had a lunch of ramen with naruto and she left to go shopping a shipment arrived by overseas package service cute baby clothes from darwin australia they were in his wifes favorite color sunshine yellow tsuyoshi finished transferring the first tape to a new crystal disk time for a break he left his apartment took the elevator and went out to the comer coffeeshop he ordered a double iced mocha cappuccino and paid with a chargecard his pokkecon rang tsuyoshi took it from his belt and answered it get one to go the machine told him okay said tsuyoshi and hung up he bought a second coffee put a lid on it and left the shop a man in a business suit was sitting on a park bench near the entrance of tsuyoshis building the mans suit was good but it looked as if hed slept in it he was holding his head in his hands and rocking gently back and forth he was unshaven and his eyes were redrimmed the pokkecon rang again the coffees for him tsuyoshi said yes said the pokkecon he needs it tsuyoshi walked up to the lost businessman the man looked up flinching warily as if he were about to be kicked what is it he said here tsuyoshi said handing him the cup double iced mocha cappuccino the man opened the cup and smelled it he looked up in disbelief this is my favorite kind of coffee who are you tsuyoshi lifted his arm and offered a hand signal his fingers clenched like a cats paw the man showed no recognition of the gesture tsuyoshi shrugged and smiled it doesnt matter sometimes a man really needs a coffee now you have a coffee thats all well the man cautiously sipped his cup and suddenly smiled its really great thanks youre welcome tsuyoshi went home his wife arrived from shopping she had bought new shoes the pregnancy was making her feet swell she sat carefully on the couch and sighed orthopedic shoes are expensive she said looking at the yellow pumps i hope you dont think they look ugly on you they look really cute tsuyoshi said wisely he had first met his wife at a video store she had just used her credit card to buy a disk of primitive blackandwhite american anime of the s the pokkecon had urged him to go up and speak to her on the subject of felix the cat felix was an early television cartoon star and one of tsuyoshis personal favorites tsuyoshi would have been too shy to approach an attractive woman on his own but no one was a stranger to the net this fact gave him the confidence to speak to her tsuyoshi had soon discovered that the girl was delighted to discuss her deep fondness for cute antique animated cats theyd had lunch together theyd had a date the next week they had spent christmas eve together in a love hotel they had a lot in common she had come into his life through a little act of grace a little gift from felix the cats magic bag of tricks tsuyoshi had never gotten over feeling grateful for this now that he was married and becoming a father tsuyoshi shimizu could feel himself becoming solidly fixed in life he had a mans role to play now he knew who he was and he knew where he stood life was good to him you need a haircut dear his wife told him sure his wife pulled a gift box out of her shopping bag can you go to the hotel daruma and get your hair cut and deliver this box for me what is it tsuyoshi said tsuyoshis wife opened the little wooden gift box a maneki neko was nestled inside white foam padding the smiling ceramic cat held one paw upraised beckoning for good fortune dont you have enough of those yet he said you even have maneki neko underwear its not for my collection its a gift for someone at the hotel daruma oh some foreign woman gave me this box at the shoestore she looked american she couldnt speak japanese she had really nice shoes though if the network gave you that little cat then youre the one who should take care of that obligation dear but dear she sighed my feet hurt so much and you could do with a haircut anyway and i have to cook supper and besides its not really a nice maneki neko its just cheap tourist souvenir junk cant you do it oh all right tsuyoshi told her just forward your pokkecon prompts onto my machine and ill see what i can do for us she smiled i knew you would do it youre really so good to me tsuyoshi left with the little box he wasnt unhappy to do the errand as it wasnt always easy to manage his pregnant wifes volatile moods in their small sixtatami apartment the local neighborhood was good but he was hoping to find bigger accommodations before the child was born maybe a place with a little studio where he could expand the scope of his work it was very hard to find decent housing in tokyo but word was out on the net friends he didnt even know were working every day to help him if he kept up with the nets obligations he had every confidence that some day something nice would turn up tsuyoshi went into the local pachinko parlor where he won half a liter of beer and a train chargecard he drank the beer took the new train card and wedged himself into the train he got out at the ebisu station and turned on his pokkecon tokyo street map to guide his steps he walked past places called chocolate soup and freshness physique and the aladdin maitai panico trattoria he entered the hotel daruma and went to the hotel barber shop which was called the daruma planet look may i help you said the receptionist im thinking a shave and a trim tsuyoshi said do you have an appointment with us sorry no tsuyoshi offered a hand gesture the woman gestured back a jerky series of cryptic finger movements tsuyoshi didnt recognize any of the gestures she wasnt from his part of the network oh well never mind the receptionist said kindly ill get nahoko to look after you nahoko was carefully shaving the fine hair from tsuyoshis forehead when the pokkecon rang tsuyoshi answered it go to the ladies room on the fourth floor the pokkecon told him sorry i cant do that this is tsuyoshi shimizu not ai shimizu besides im having my hair cut right now oh i see said the machine recalibrating it hung up nahoko finished his hair she had done a good job he looked much better a man who worked at home had to take special trouble to keep up appearances the pokkecon rang again yes said tsuyoshi buy bay rum aftershave take it outside right he hung up nahoko do you have bay rum odd you should ask that said nahoko hardly anyone asks for bay rum anymore but our shop happens to keep it in stock tsuyoshi bought the aftershave then stepped outside the barbershop nothing happened so he bought a manga comic and waited finally a hairy blond stranger in shorts a tropical shirt and sandals approached him the foreigner was carrying a camera bag and an oldfashioned pokkecon he looked about sixty years old and he was very tall the man spoke to his pokkecon in english excuse me said the pokkecon translating the mans speech into japanese do you have a bottle of bay rum aftershave yes i do tsuyoshi handed the bottle over here thank goodness said the man his words relayed through his machine ive asked everyone else in the lobby sorry i was late no problem said tsuyoshi thats a nice pokkecon you have there well the man said i know its old and out of style but i plan to buy a new pokkecon here in tokyo im told that they sell pokkecons by the basketful in akihabara electronics market thats right what kind of translator program are you running your translator talks like someone from osaka does it sound funny the tourist asked anxiously well i dont want to complain but tsuyoshi smiled here lets trade meishi i can give you a copy of a brandnew freeware translator that would be wonderful they pressed buttons and squirted copies of their business cards across the network link tsuyoshi examined his copy of the mans electronic card and saw that his name was zimmerman mr zimmerman was from new zealand tsuyoshi activated a transfer program his modern pokkecon began transferring a new translator onto zimmermans machine a large american man in a padded suit entered the lobby of the daruma the man wore sunglasses and was sweating visibly in the summer heat the american looked huge as if he lifted a lot of weights then a japanese woman followed him the woman was sharply dressed with a dark blue dress suit hat sunglasses and an attache case she had a haunted look her escort turned and carefully watched the bellhops who were bringing in a series of bags the woman walked crisply to the reception desk and began making anxious demands of the clerk im a great believer in machine translation tsuyoshi said to the tall man from new zealand i really believe that computers help human beings to relate in a much more human way i couldnt agree with you more said mr zimmerman through his machine i can remember the first time i came to your country many years ago i had no portable translator in fact i had nothing but a printed phrasebook i happened to go into a bar and zimmerman stopped and gazed alertly at his pokkecon oh dear im getting a screen prompt i have to go up to my room right away then ill come along with you till this software transfer is done tsuyoshi said thats very kind of you they got into the elevator together zimmerman punched for the fourth floor anyway as i was saying i went into this bar in roppongi late at night because i was jetlagged and hoping for something to eat yes and this woman well lets just say this woman was hanging out in a foreigners bar in roppongi late at night and she wasnt wearing a whole lot of clothes and she didnt look like she was any better than she ought to be yes i think i understand you anyway this menu they gave me was full of kanji or katakana or romanji or whatever they call those so i had my phrasebook out and i was trying very hard to puzzle out these pesky ideograms the elevator opened and they stepped into the carpeted hall of the hotels fourth floor so i opened the menu and i pointed to an entree and i told this girl zimmerman stopped suddenly and stared at his screen oh dear somethings happening just a moment zimmerman carefully studied the instructions on his pokkecon then he pulled the bottle of bay rum from the baggy pocket of his shorts and unscrewed the cap he stood on tiptoe stretching to his full height and carefully poured the contents of the bottle through the iron louvers of a ventilation grate set high in the top of the wall zimmerman screwed the cap back on neatly and slipped the empty bottle back in his pocket then he examined his pokkecon again he frowned and shook it the screen had frozen apparently tsuyoshis new translation program had overloaded zimmermans oldfashioned operating system his pokkecon had crashed zimmerman spoke a few defeated sentences in english then he smiled and spread his hands apologetically he bowed and went into his room and shut the door the japanese woman and her burly american escort entered the hall the man gave tsuyoshi a hard stare the woman opened the door with a passcard her hands were shaking tsuyoshis pokkecon rang leave the hall it told him go downstairs get into the elevator with the bellboy tsuyoshi followed instructions the bellboy was just entering the elevator with a cart full of the womans baggage tsuyoshi got into the elevator stepping carefully behind the wheeled metal cart what floor sir said the bellboy eight tsuyoshi said adlibbing the bellboy turned and pushed the buttons he faced forward attentively his gloved hands folded the pokkecon flashed a silent line of text to the screen put the gift box inside her flight bag it read tsuyoshi located the zippered blue bag at the back of the cart it was a matter of instants to zip it open put in the box with the maneki neko and zip the bag shut again the bellboy noticed nothing he left tugging his cart tsuyoshi got out on the eighth floor feeling slightly foolish he wandered down the hall found a quiet nook by an ice machine and called his wife whats going on he said oh nothing she smiled your haircut looks nice show me the back of your head tsuyoshi held the pokkecon screen behind the nape of his neck they do good work his wife said with satisfaction i hope it didnt cost too much are you coming home now things are getting a little odd here at the hotel tsuyoshi told her i may be some time his wife frowned well dont miss supper were having bonito tsuyoshi took the elevator back down it stopped at the fourth floor the womans american companion stepped onto the elevator his nose was running and his eyes were streaming with tears are you all right tsuyoshi said i dont understand japanese the man growled the elevator doors shut the mans cellular phone crackled into life it emitted a scream of anguish and a burst of agitated female english the man swore and slammed his hairy fist against the elevators emergency button the elevator stopped with a lurch an alarm bell began ringing the man pried the doors open with his large hairy fingers and clambered out into the fourth floor he then ran headlong down the hall the elevator began buzzing in protest its doors shuddering as if broken tsuyoshi climbed hastily from the damaged elevator and stood there in the hallway he hesitated a moment then he produced his pokkecon and loaded his japanesetoenglish translator he walked cautiously after the american man the door to their suite was open tsuyoshi spoke aloud into his pokkecon hello he said experimentally may i be of help the woman was sitting on the bed she had just discovered the maneki neko box in her flight bag she was staring at the little cat in horror who are you she said in bad japanese tsuyoshi realized suddenly that she was a japanese american tsuyoshi had met a few japanese americans before they always troubled him they looked fairly normal from the outside but their behavior was always bizarre im just a passing friend he said something i can do grab him mitch said the woman in english the american man rushed into the hall and grabbed tsuyoshi by the arm his hands were like steel bands tsuyoshi pressed the distress button on his pokkecon take that computer away from him the woman ordered in english mitch quickly took tsuyoshis pokkecon away and threw it on the bed he deftly patted tsuyoshis clothing searching for weapons then he shoved tsuyoshi into a chair the woman switched back to japanese sit right there you dont you dare move she began examining the contents of tsuyoshis wallet i beg your pardon tsuyoshi said his pokkecon was lying on the bed lines of red text scrolled up its little screen as it silently issued a series of emergency net alerts the woman spoke to her companion in english tsuyoshis pokkecon was still translating faithfully mitch go call the local police mitch sneezed uncontrollably tsuyoshi noticed that the room smelled strongly of bay rum i cant talk to the local cops i cant speak japanese mitch sneezed again okay then ill call the cops you handcuff this guy then go down to the infirmary and get yourself some antihistamines for christs sake mitch pulled a length of plastic whipcord cuff from his coat pocket and attached tsuyoshis right wrist to the head of the bed he mopped his streaming eyes with a tissue id better stay with you if theres a cat in your luggage then the criminal network already knows were in japan youre in danger mitch you may be my bodyguard but youre breaking out in hives this just isnt supposed to happen mitch complained scratching his neck my allergies never interfered with my job before just leave me here and lock the door the woman told him ill put a chair against the knob ill be all right you need to look after yourself mitch left the room the woman barricaded the door with a chair then she called the front desk on the hotels bedside pasokon this is louise hashimoto in room i have a gangster in my room hes an information criminal would you call the tokyo police please tell them to send the organized crime unit yes thats right do it and you should put your hotel security people on full alert there may be big trouble here youd better hurry she hung up tsuyoshi stared at her in astonishment why are you doing this whats all this about so you call yourself tsuyoshi shimizu said the woman examining his credit cards she sat on the foot of the bed and stared at him youre yakuza of some kind right i think youve made a big mistake tsuyoshi said louise scowled look mr shimizu youre not dealing with some yankee tourist here my name is louise hashimoto and im an assistant federal prosecutor from providence rhode island usa she showed him a magnetic id card with a gold official seal its nice to meet someone from the american government said tsuyoshi bowing a bit in his chair id shake your hand but its tied to the bed you can stop with the innocent act right now i spotted you out in the hall earlier and in the lobby too casing the hotel how did you know my bodyguard is violently allergic to bay rum you must have read his medical records who me never ever since i discovered you network people its been one big pattern said louise its the biggest criminal conspiracy i ever saw i busted this software pirate in providence he had a massive network server and a whole bunch of ai freeware search engines we took him in custody we bagged all his search engines and catalogs and indexers later that very same day these cats start showing up cats louise lifted the maneki neko handling it as if it were a live eel these little japanese voodoo cats maneki neko right they started showing up everywhere i went theres a china cat in my handbag theres three china cats at the office suddenly theyre on display in the windows of every antique store in providence my car radio starts making meowing noises at me you broke part of the network tsuyoshi said scandalized you took someones machines away thats terrible how could you do such an inhuman thing youve got a real nerve complaining about that what about my machinery louise held up her fat eerielooking american pokkecon as soon as i stepped off the airplane at narita my pda was attacked thousands and thousands of email messages all of them pictures of cats a denialofservice attack i cant even communicate with the home office my pdas useless whats a pda its a pda my personal digital assistant manufactured in silicon valley well with a goofy name like that no wonder our pokkecons wont talk to it louise frowned grimly thats right wise guy make jokes about it youre involved in a malicious software attack on a legal officer of the united states government youll see she paused looking him over you know shimizu you dont look much like the italian mafia gangsters i have to deal with back in providence im not a gangster at all i never do anyone any harm oh no louise glowered at him listen pal i know a lot more about your setup and your kind of people than you think i do ive been studying your outfit for a long time now we computer cops have names for your kind of people digital panarchies segmented polycephalous integrated influence networks what about all these free goods and services youre getting all this time she pointed a finger at him ha do you ever pay taxes on those do you ever declare that income and those benefits all the free shipments from other countries the little homemade cookies and the free pens and pencils and bumper stickers and the used bicycles and the helpful news about fire sales youre a tax evader youre living through kickbacks and bribes and influence peddling and all kinds of corrupt offthebooks transactions tsuyoshi blinked look i dont know anything about all that im just living my life well your network gift economy is undermining the lawful government approved regulated economy well tsuyoshi said gently maybe my economy is better than your economy says who she scoffed why would anyone think that its better because were happier than you are whats wrong with acts of kindness everyone likes gifts midsummer gifts new years day gifts yearend presents wedding presents everybody likes those not the way you japanese like them youre totally crazy for gifts what kind of society has no gifts its barbaric to have no regard for common human feelings louise bristled youre saying im barbaric i dont mean to complain tsuyoshi said politely but you do have me tied up to your bed louise crossed her arms you might as well stop complaining youll be in much worse trouble when the local police arrive then well probably be waiting here for quite a while tsuyoshi said the police move rather slowly here in japan im sorry but we dont have as much crime as you americans so our police are not very alert the pasokon rang at the side of the bed louise answered it it was tsuyoshis wife could i speak to tsuyoshi shimizu please im over here dear tsuyoshi called quickly shes kidnapped me she tied me to the bed tied to her bed his wifes eyes grew wide that does it im calling the police louise quickly hung up the pasokon i havent kidnapped you im only detaining you here until the local authorities can come and arrest you arrest me for what exactly louise thought quickly well for poisoning my bodyguard by pouring bay rum into the ventilator but i never did that anyway thats not illegal is it the pasokon rang again a shining white cat appeared on the screen it had large staring unearthly eyes let him go the cat commanded in english louise shrieked and yanked the pasokons plug from the wall suddenly the lights went out infrastructure attack louise squawled she rolled quickly under the bed the room went gloomy and quiet the air conditioner had shut off i think you can come out tsuyoshi said at last his voice loud in the still room its just a power failure no it isnt louise said she crawled slowly from beneath the bed and sat on the mattress somehow the darkness had made them more intimate i know very well what this is im under attack i havent had a moments peace since i broke that network stuff just happens to me now bad stuff swarms of it its never anything you can touch though nothing you can prove in a court of law she sighed i sit in chairs and somebodys left a piece of gum there i get free pizzas but theyre not the kind of pizzas i like little kids spit on my sidewalk old women in walkers get in front of me whenever i need to hurry the shower came on all by itself louise shuddered but said nothing slowly the darkened stuffy room began to fill with hot steam my toilets dont flush louise said my letters get lost in the mail when i walk by cars their theft alarms go off and strangers stare at me its always little things lots of little tiny things but they never ever stop im up against something that is very very big and very very patient and it knows all about me and its got a million arms and legs and all those arms and legs are people there was the noise of scuffling in the hall distant voices confused shouting suddenly the chair broke under the doorknob the door burst open violently mitch tumbled through the sunglasses flying from his head two hotel security guards were trying to grab him shouting incoherently in english mitch fell headlong to the floor kicking and thrashing the guards lost their hats in the struggle one tackled mitchs legs with both his arms and the other whacked and jabbed him with a baton puffing and grunting with effort they hauled mitch out of the room the darkened room was so full of steam that the harried guards hadnt even noticed tsuyoshi and louise louise stared at the broken door why did they do that to him tsuyoshi scratched his head in embarrassment probably a failure of communication poor mitch they took his gun away at the airport he had all kinds of technical problems with his passport poor guy hes never had any luck since he met me there was a loud tapping at the window louise shrank back in fear finally she gathered her courage and opened the curtains daylight flooded the room a windowwashing rig had been lowered from the roof of the hotel on cables and pulleys there were two windowwashers in crisp gray uniforms they waved cheerfully making little catpaw gestures there was a third man with them it was tsuyoshis brother one of the washers opened the window with a utility key tsuyoshis brother squirmed into the room he stood up and carefully adjusted his coat and tie this is my brother tsuyoshi explained what are you doing here louise said they always bring in the relatives when theres a hostage situation tsuyoshis brother said the police just flew me in by helicopter and landed me on the roof he looked louise up and down miss hashimoto you just have time to escape what she said look down at the streets he told her see that you hear them crowds are pouring in from all over the city all kinds of people everyone with wheels street noodle salesmen bicycle messengers skateboard kids takeout delivery guys louise gazed out the window into the streets and shrieked aloud oh no a giant swarming mob theyre surrounding me im doomed you are not doomed tsuyoshis brother told her intently come out the window get onto the platform with us youve got one chance louise its a place i know a sacred place in the mountains no computers there no phones nothing he paused its a sanctuary for people like us and i know the way she gripped his suited arm can i trust you look in my eyes he told her dont you see yes of course you can trust me we have everything in common louise stepped out the window she clutched his arm the wind whipping at her hair the platform creaked rapidly up and out of sight tsuyoshi stood up from the chair when he stretched out tugging at his handcuffed wrist he was just able to reach his pokkecon with his fingertips he drew it in and clutched it to his chest then he sat down again and waited patiently for someone to come and give him freedom mama we are zhenya your son tom crosshill mama this is zhenya your son im in a castle with gnomes when you said dr olga would pay many rubles for a boy to help her i was afraid but i didnt tell you i didnt want to be selfish because with rubles you can pay for the hospital so you can be strong again now im happy that i came dr olga says i must write what happens in a letter so you can read it and not worry we cant send pictures because the gnomes have no cameras silly gnomes so i will describe everything i fell asleep in dr olgas big room in the red university building by the botanical garden i had a helmet on my head stuffed with wires there were lots of lights and noises like in that game which dimas papa bought him and you said we couldnt buy because we dont have a papa or rubles then the lights went away and i was in a castle its not like moscow at all except maybe on the red square there are stone corridors and pretty towers with mushroom tops and a big hall with a glass roof so you can see the stars when its dark the gnomes live in the cellar theyre short and green and wear big fluffy hats with their names on them like gui gui gui which they said means gnome user innerface i asked them for food but they didnt understand me real good only jumped around and sang songs i think sulyik is smarter oh yes sulyik is here dr olga put a helmet on his head too at first he was afraid of the gnomes but now he barks at them very loud we found a run place for him with grass and water i told dr olga about the linden tree behind our building where he likes to bury bones and she put a linden tree in the run place too he likes that dr olga cant come here but she talks to us sometimes her face is in the wall like the stone is soft and moving she hasnt told me what work i have to do yet but i promise ill work the hardest i can mama zhenya your son mama this is zhenya your son we are hungry its not so bad for me but sulyik whines and drags his belly on the floor dr olga says there is a food place and its our job to find it but we cant because the path between places keeps changing we go all around the castle and we should be where we started and were not start in sleep place end in run place start in run place end in the big hall its like that time i got lost in izmaylovsky park and you said i was a stupid boy because anyone could just follow the signs but there are no signs here dr olga doesnt help she says if i train my mind to get from sleep place to food place and food place to sleep place then i can find the treasure place i ask her what treasure place but she doesnt tell me i hope she doesnt think im stupid too but maybe i am maybe sulyik is hungry because im not smart enough zhenya your son mama this is zhenya your son sulyik found the food place we were in the big hall and he ran away from me like at the carnival with the mirrors many sulyiks in every direction then he barked and ran back and pulled at my pants just one sulyik when i tried to go with him there were many sulyiks again and i didnt know which one to follow then he brought me a banana and i got excited because i remembered the time i got to eat one for my birthday but the gnomes took it from me before i could have it i ran after them but the gnomes are very fast i told dr olga and she says i should be more flexible after all i am only eight and my pathways are fresh and its really not hard if sulyik can do it dr olga doesnt know sulyik hes a very smart dog i cant win hide and seek with him even with my eyes open when i watch him run away there are many sulyiks everywhere so that doesnt help but when i see him somewhere and go catch him i cant guess which way hes running and how fast the gnomes watch and laugh and chant haizenberg haizenberg haizenberg i dont get angry at them though my sulyik is smarter than me im still hungry zhenya your son ps did you go to the hospital mama are you all right mama this is zhenya your son im afraid mama the gnomes make me play a game and they hit me when i lose it hurts very much sulyik tries to stop them but they hit him too and dr olga doesnt come when i call its a hard game the gnomes have a big gold box with two rooms and a paper wall and no door in the wall they put me in one room by the wall and they leave me theres a dragon painted on the wall all red and black the gnomes say i must get to the other room or the dragon will eat me but the dragon doesnt come the gnomes come back later and ask me why are you still in this room and then they hit me and make me do it again one time i broke the paper wall and went to the other room and they got very angry and hit me many times and said i shouldnt do that tunnel they say use a tunnel but the floor is hard and i dont even have a shovel what can i do mama i know i must try hard for you but it hurts zhenya your son waiting for your letter mama the dragon came she came and i was so scared i went through the wall and it didnt break only she came again on the other side and i couldnt run away she burned me she burned me real bad mama im sorry mama im sure i did something very bad but i dont know what please can i leave now i know we need rubles but im scared please mama mama i think this is zhenya your son im not sure nothing is sure i understand that now everything is and is not the dragon helped me understand a wall is no wall if im everywhere i can find the food place now if every one of me goes looking every me doesnt find every food place but one of me finds a food place i dont know why i was all in one place before i think all the little parts of me they could be many different places but they disagreed they pulled in different directions like in that story about the wagon and the horses so they stayed in place now every little piece of me agrees and i am everywhere i want to be oh yes dr olga came back i was angry about the dragon but she said its okay because i can go home soon you always said i should keep my mouth shut around aunts and uncles mama i try very hard with dr olga but i dont like her so much anymore she says my pathways changed a miracle of tabyula raza she says a young mind can learn to think qantumikally in a simulated qantumikal environment i think she wanted to talk very much because she said many more things about how she proved the brain of somebody called penroz is real which is silly because how could a brain not be real then she looked very strange and cried i asked her why and she said many important aunts and uncles would be very happy and put her name in books which i guess is important like when you get a giness record for how big a cake you can bake i dont care about any of that mama i just want to come home zhenya probably your son mama we are zhenya your son all of i found the dr olga says i have to write clearly because you cant understand is that why you dont send me letters mama im sorry i want you to write very much i found the treasure place its on the roof with the stars right above the treasures a groaning metal thing as big as a house i knew what it was as soon as i saw it because gnomes were standing in a circle holding their hats and singing treasure treasure treasure im not sure its a very good treasure if gnomes have to tell you thats what it is and sulyik doesnt like it i called him over but he just barked and wouldnt come near anyway i thought the treasure was interesting there are so many handles you can pull its like a big yellow hedgehog with twisting knobbly gears which are never in the same place when you look dr olga said she couldnt understand the treasure because its a qantumikal motor and it needs a qantumikal brain but i should understand it because ive got one shes right when im everywhere at once i get all tangled up with the treasure and the handles become my arms like im conducting an orchestra and i understand everything but its scary when that happens mama the castle becomes squishy like plasticine in my hands and i can shape it i was very bad at shaping at first so i broke the food place there were sparks everywhere and dr olga said the hash had overflowed though i dont know why because i never saw potatoes in the food place then i learned to stretch the castle so for every thin part there is a thick part and it doesnt break i stretched and stretched until i could see through to other castles mama there are many castles just like this one except each a little different some are a lot different and when i stretch more with the handles i can make openings to those other castles and reach through and be in all castles at once dr olga said i should grab rooms and light from the other castles and bring them back so we have more energy i did it but i think there is another zhenya and another sulyik in each of the other castles and they didnt like it because there was a loud noise and the castle moved very much and some of the gnomes screamed and fell to the ground now there is green blood on their hats and they dont move anymore dr olga said not to worry its a soft wear glitch and theyre not important anyway i dont like the gnomes but i think thats not very nice of her the treasure hurt them and its all because of her im scared mama zhenya your son we are mama today dr olga told me to use the treasure to look out of the castle and at the big room where sulyik and i went to sleep i moved the handles to stretch the air and i saw us sleeping on a long table sulyik and me aunts and uncles worked all around and in the middle of the room there was a big metal box it hummed and flashed lights when i moved the handles of the treasure i think the metal box is like the treasure except its in moscow and it doesnt move when i used the treasure and the box started to make noises all the aunts and uncles looked very excited and not afraid i thought that was dumb because i was very afraid dr olga told me to use the treasure to open other moscows like id opened other castles but when i stretched the big room thin i saw bad little fast things come out of the metal box they were hitting dr olga and all the aunts and uncles so i stopped the aunts and uncles and dr olga didnt believe me because they couldnt see the bad little fast things dr olga said they had gaigar counters and eyeon chambers and there was nothing there she said i had to use the treasure to get energy from other moscows because only i had a qantumikal brain and the whole world was waiting and anyway sulyik wanted me to i said no i dont think sulyik wants me to do a bad thing i asked him and he licked me which is not very bad he just wants to sleep with me under the linden tree in the sun when i told dr olga that she said she cant give me rubles if i dont help with the treasure i think maybe that is important but some of i are not sure anymore in some moscow always she gives me rubles in some moscow always she does not give me rubles both happen always youre sick and youre fine always mama some of you in some moscow if that is so always why should i help all is always somewhere but the bad little fast things are bad everywhere zhenya your son we are mama okay i will help dr olga with the treasure tomorrow okay okay i will help all of i loves sulyik when dr olga said she will hurt sulyik i thought many sulyiks everywhere cant hurt all sulyiks we will be okay but she took sulyik away from the castle and when i used the treasure i saw him standing alone by the table with my body outside in moscow he looked very sad with his head all shaved dr olga came and took him away and now i cant see him at all but he barks very loud like he hurts and its hard to remember there are other sulyiks in other moscows i dont think dr olga is nice i think maybe she was never nice i think maybe when she promised us rubles she didnt really mean it please ask her to give me sulyik back ill be good i promise ill do anything she wants zhenya mama zhenya son i put this letter your table dont afraid dont scream yes hide under bed under bed safe dont open windows dont go outside moscow not safe hungry smoke bad i protect you sorry write little only have fingers if think hard zhenya mama zhenya again got more time now so i can write better please come out from under the bed dont stare like that arent you happy that im back i know i look scary but at least im strong enough for eyes and fingers i cant talk but i can write you letters i saw you got all the old letters i wrote for you you must have been very busy at the hospital if you couldnt answer thats okay im glad dr olga gave you rubles after all you look stronger soon ill be stronger too mama ill have arms many many arms and ill hold you and well be together wont that be lovely mama you always took care of me even when i was stupid and bad and now ill take care of you and wont ever ever ever let you go wont that be great but we wont have sulyik he died mama when i started the treasure the metal box in dr olgas room growled and sulyik ran out of a closet barking then the air stretched and broke and out came all the bad little fast things they flowed together and became the hungry smoke and came flying buzz buzz buzz like many black bees i stopped the treasure but it was too late the hungry smoke buzzed and wrapped around sulyik and he barked and barked and then the hungry smoke ate his head and i couldnt do anything i thought maybe its okay because there are other sulyiks in other moscows but it didnt feel okay it didnt feel okay at all mama then the smoke barked like sulyik loud and sad it barked lots while it ate all the aunts and uncles and dr olga too dr olga screamed very long and i thought maybe she wanted another giness record but she stopped and the smoke ate her head too after that the smoke gave up barking and whispered things real soft like dr olga take take take from us steal from us no boy no no no no it ate my head last because i was on the table and couldnt run when i heard it comingboy boy boyi ran to the castle but the castle got dark so i came back i got real scared and i twisted the treasure very much and the metal box roared and i ripped open the air between the castle and moscow and i came through all the way all of me everywhere i tried using my body again but it didnt work the hungry smoke ate my head after all it didnt even hurt because i was everywhere at once dont worry about me mama its okay sorry about moscow i couldnt help all the aunts and uncles and boys and girls and grandmas and grandpas sorry about the blood and the screaming it makes me want to cry but i dont have any tears i dont think crying would help anyway i couldnt protect everyone but at least i protected you the smoke wont get into the apartment dont you worry mama i think its real angry cause we tried to steal from its moscow and it gets smarter when it eats heads like when i read books but youve got me and im smart too and im everywhere i have to catch the hungry smoke now i hope i can use dr olgas metal treasurebox and stretch the air and send it all home then ill come for you you just hold on zhenya mama i caught much hungry smoke and sent it home i promised we wouldnt steal from other moscows again but it just yelled slide the curve blast the boy twisted metric it sounded like uncles and aunts and grandpas and grandmas and little kids too happy and sad and angry and calm i think maybe eating all those heads wasnt so good for it i think maybe it got confused im home mama i sit next to you right now here on the couch do you feel my fingers on your back see the curtains move its me mama smile mama please why wont you smile once i catch the last of the smoke well be together for good we can even go to paris like you always wanted i dont think the smoke got to paris but before that can you help me look outside the door i left sulyik there his fur is sticky and his head is gone can you wash him mama can you bury him in the garden under the linden tree when everyone died i thought i was sad but i wasnt sure there are many moscows and this is only one moscow so why is it important anyway but then i remembered sulyik there was only one sulyik who mattered in the end that means there will always be only one sulyik i will remember him all of i for sure sulyik taught me that even being qantumikal i can still know things for sure zhenya your son all of i for sure velvet fields anne mccaffrey of course we moved into the cities of the planet we now know we must call zobranoirundisi when worlds federated finally permitted a colony there although survey had kept a watch on the planet for more than thirty years standard and the cities were obviously on a standby directive the owners remained conspicuous by their absence since resources and supplies had agitated in council for another breadbasket planet in that sector of the galaxy and zobranoirundisi was unoccupied we were sent in chartered to be selfsufficient in one sidereal year and to produce a surplus in two it would therefore have been a great misdirection of effort not to have inhabited the citieswe only moved into fourso patently suitable for humanoid lifeforms the murals that decorated a conspicuous wall in every dwelling unit gave only a vague idea of the physiology of our landlords always depicted in an attitude of reverent obeisance toward a dominating tree symbol so that only the backs the rounded fuzzcovered craniums and the suggestions of arms extended in front of the bodies were visible i suppose if we had not been so concerned with establishing the herds generally breaking our necks to meet the colony charter requirements we might have discovered sooner that there had been a gross error the clues were there for example although we inhabited the cities they could not be made fully operational despite all the efforts of dunlapil the metropolitan engineer then too we could find no single example of the tree anywhere on the lush planet but with rs on our backs to produce produce produce we didnt take time to delve into the perplexing anomalies dunlapil with his usual urbane contempt for the botanical quipped to martin chavez our ecologist that the tree was the tree of life and therefore mythical carry the analogy further he would tease martin and it explains why the tree worshipersthats what we called them before we knew arent around anymore some dissident plucked the apple and got em all kicked out of the garden of eden eden might well have been modeled on this planet with its velvet fields parklike forests and rolling plains amid these sat lovely little cities constructed of pressed fibrous blocks tinted in pleasant colors during a manufacturing process whose nature frustrated dunlapil as much as the absence of trees perplexed chavez so suppressing our pervasive sense of trespassing we moved into the abandoned dwellings careful not to make any irreparable changes to accommodate our equipment in fact the only sophisticated nonindigenous equipment that i as colony commissioner permitted within any city was the plastisteel comtower i ordered the spaceport constructed beyond a low range of foothills on the rather scrubby plain at some distance from my headquarters city an old riverbed proved an acceptable road for moving cargo to and from the port and no one really objected to the distance it would be far better not to offend our landlords with the dirt and chaos of outerspace commerce close to their pretty city we pastured the cattle in neatly separated velvet fields martin chavez worried when close inspection disclosed that each velvet field was underpinned by its own tenmeterthick foundation of ancient rockhard clay those same foundations housed what seemed to be a deep irrigation system i did ask martin chavez to investigate the curious absence of herbivores from a planet so perfectly suited to them he had catalogued several types of omnivores a wide variety of fowl and a plethora of fishes he did discover some fossil remains of herbivores but nothing more recent than traces comparable to those of our pleistocene epoch he therefore was forced to concludeand submitted in a voluminous report with numerous comparisons to nearby galactic examplesthat some catastrophes perhaps the same that had wiped out the humanoids had eliminated herbivores at an earlier stage whatever the disaster had beenbacterial viral or something more esotericit did not recur to plague us we thrived on the planet the first children conceived under the bluish alien sun were born just after we had shipped our first years surplus offworld life settled into a pleasant seasonal routine the beef sheep horses kine even the windoers of graces world imported on an experimental basis multiplied on the velvet fields the centenarian crops from half a dozen worlds gave us abundant yields we had some failures of course with inedible or grotesque ergotic mutations but not enough to be worth more than a minor chavezian thesis in the record and the shrug of the pioneering farmer if a colonist is eating well living comfortably with leisure time for his kids and time off with his wife on the languid southern seas he puts up with minor failures and irritations even with the omnipresent guilt of trespassing i was not the only one who never felt entirely at ease in the pretty cities but as i rationalized the intermittent twinges of conscience it would have been ridiculous to build facilities when empty accommodations were already available despite their obstinate refusal to work no matter how dunlapil tried to energize them still we managed fine and gradually came to ignore the anomalies we had never fully explored settling down to make our gardens and our families grow the tenth year was just beginning with surprising warmth when martin chavez called a meeting with me and dunlapil chavez had even convened it on a restday which was annoying as well as unusual just in case we have to call a meeting of the colony he told me when i protested that statement on top of his insistence on a meeting was enough to make me feel apprehensive although martin was a worrier he was no fool he did not force his problems on anyone unnecessarily nor was he one for calling useless meetings ive an unusual report to make on a new plant growth discernible on the velvet fields commissioner sarubbi he announced addressing me formally such a manifestation is not generally associated with simple monocotyledonous plants ive crosschecked both used and unused pastures and the distortions of the growth in the used fields are distressing you mean weve imported a virus thats mutating the indigenous grasses i asked or has the old virus that killed off the herbivorous life revived nothing like this mutation has ever been classified and no i dont think its a return of a previous calamity chavez frowned with worry ah champion martin dunlapil said with some disgust dont go calling for a planetary quarantine just when were showing a nice credit balance chavez drew himself up indignantly he hasnt suggested anything of the sort dun i said wondering if the urban engineer was annoyed because chavez might be closer to solving the enigma of the tree than dunlapil was the mechanics of the cities please explain specialist chavez ive just recently become aware of a weird evolution from the family graminaceae which these plants have resembled until now he snapped on the handviewer and projected a slide onto the only wall in my office bare of the ubiquitous murals the nodular extrusions now developing in the velvet fields show none of the characteristics of herbaceous plants no joined stems or slender sheathing leaves he looked around to see if we had seen enough before he flashed on a slide of magnified cellular material this cross section suggests genus helianthus an improbable mutation chavez shrugged his helplessness in presenting such contradictory material however something new is under every sun and we have not yet determined how the usual blue light of this primary will affect growth after prolonged exposure we might get a bragae two effect the next thing youll be telling us martin dunlapil said as if to forestall a discourse on galactic comparisons is that these plants are the aliens who built these cities he shot me a grin that ought to be obvious chavez said with such a lack of rancor that the disbelief i had been entertaining disappeared commissionerchavezs grave eyes met minecan you give me another reason why every city has similarly fenced lots all placed to catch full daily sun why the velvet fields with that central dominant tree symbol appear to be the reverent focus of the aliensexcuse methe indigenous species but theyre humanoid dunlapil said in protest their culture is agrarian and there are no grazers not a single example of that blasted tree anywhere on the planetyet that was when i truly began to be afraid there are no grazing beasts chavez went on inexorably because they have been eliminated to protect the velvet fields and whatever is growing in them now you mean when those fields bloom with whatever it is they bloom with the aliens will return dunlapil asked chavez nodded if we havent irreparably altered the growth cycle but thats fantastic an entire civilization cant be dependent on a crazy whoknowshowlong cycle of plant life dunlapil was sputtering with indignation nothing is impossible replied chavez at his most didactic your research has been sufficiently comprehensive i asked him although i was sick with the sense of impending disaster as comprehensive as my limited equipment and xenobotanical experience allow i would welcome a chance to submit my findings to a board of specialists with greater experience in esoteric plantlife forms and i respectfully request that you have colonial central send us a team at once im afraid that weve already done incalculable damage to the he paused and with a grim smile corrected himself indigenous organism seeded in those fields the semantic nicety jarred me if chavez was even remotely correct we would require not only xenobotanists and xenobiologists but an entire investigation team from worlds federated to examine our intrusion into a domain that had not after all been abandoned by its occupants like a marieceleste but had simply been lying fallowwith the indigenous natives quiescently in residence as chavez dunlapil and i walked from my office toward the comtower i remember now that i felt a little foolish and very scared like a child reluctant to report an accident to his parents but dutifully conscientious about admitting his misdemeanor the plastisteel tower had never looked so out of place so alien so sacrilegious as it did now hey wait a minute you two dulapil protested you know what an investigation team means anything and everything must be done to mitigate our offense as soon as possible chavez said interrupting nervously dammit dunlapil stopped in his tracks weve done nothing wrong indeed we have we may have crippled an entire generation chavez spoke with an expression of ineffable sorrow there are plenty of fields we never touched the aliensnativescan use them for food chavezs sad smile deepened and he gently removed dunlapils hand from his arm from dust ye came to dust ye shall return and from dust shall ye spring again it was then that dunlapil understood the enormity of our crime you mean the plants are the people what else have i been saying they are born from the trees we did what we could even as we waited for the specialists and investigation team to arrive first we cleared the animals and crops from every one of the velvet fields we removed every sign of our colonial occupation from the cities the team composed of five nonhuman and three humanoid species arrived with menacing expedition well before the initial flood of xenospecialists the team members did not comment on our preliminary efforts to repair our error nor did they protest their quarters in the hastily erected dwellings on the bare dusty plain and the subsequent roaring activity of the spaceport close by all they did was observe with portentous intensity of course except for vacating the citiesand occupying them was apparently the least of our cumulative crimeseverything we did to remedy our trespass proved horribly inept in the final analysis we would have been less destructive had we kept the cattle on the velvet fields and not slaughtered them for food we ought to have let the crops ripen die and return to the special soils that had nourished them for the fields we stripped produced the worst horrors but how were we to know now of course we know all too fully we are burdened to this very day with guilt and remorse for the wholesale dismemberment and dispersal of those irretrievable beings eaten digested defecated upon by grazers and again eaten digested and eliminated by those who partook of the grazers flesh of the countless disintegrated natives removed from their home soil by unwitting carriers none can bear fruit on foreign soil and on their own soil to repeat the fields we had stripped produced the worst horrors i remember when the last report had been turned in to the eight judges composing the investigation team its members wasted no further time in formulating their decree i was called to their conference room to hear the verdict as i entered i saw the judges seated on a raised platform several feet above my head that in itself was warning that we had lost all status in worlds federated a flick of the wrist attracted my attention to one of three humans on the team humbly i craned my head back but he refused to glance down at me the investigation is complete he said in an emotionless tone you have committed the worst act of genocide yet to be recorded in all galactic history sir my protest was cut off by a second peremptory gesture xenobiologists report that the growths in the velvet fields have reached the third stage in their evolution the parallel between this lifeform in its second stage and that of the cellulose fauna of brandon two is inescapable chavez had already told me of that parallel now the plants resemble the exorhizomorphs of planariae five and it is inevitable that this third stage will give way to the sentient life pictured in the murals of their cities you came here as agrarians and agrarians you shall be in the fields of those you have mutilated what final reparations will be levied against you one and all cannot be known until the victims of your crimes pronounce the penance whereby you may redeem your species in the eyes of the worlds federated he stopped speaking and waved me away i withdrew to announce the verdict to my dazed fellow colonists i would far rather that we had been summarily executed then and there instead of being worn and torn apart by bits and pieces but that was not the way of judgment for those who trespass in modern enlightened times we could not even make an appeal on the grounds that the planet had been released to us for the colony in its charter took on all responsibility for its subsequent actions having reaped benefits now so dearly to be paid for so we worked from that day until budding time late that heinous fall we watched anxiously as the seedling exorhizomorphs grew at a phenomenal rate until they were ten then twenty finally twentyfive feet high thicktrunked branching out lush with green triangular foliage by midsummer we knew why it was that during our time on the planet we had never been able to find any examples of the tree such trees grew once every hundred years for they were the trees of life and bore the fruit of zobranoirundisi in the cellular wombs two to a branch three to eleven branches per tree in the good fieldsthat is the unviolated fields in the others the galaxy knows we tried to atone for our crime every man woman and child was devoted to tending the twisted stunted deformed halfbranched trees that grew so piteously in those desecrated fields every one of us watched with growing apprehension and horror as each new day showed further evidence of the extent of our sacrilege oh the hideous difference between those straight tall fine zobranoirundisi andthe others we were ready for any sacrifice as penance then the morning after the first good frost when the cold had shriveled the stems the first zobranoirundisi tore through his vegetable placenta he shook his tall willowy body turned and made obeisance to his natal tree of life ate of the soil at its roots of its triangular foliage and knew i can never retell the agony of that day when all those zobranoirundisi faced us their maimers and announced the form our expiation would take we bowed our heads to the inevitable for we knew the sentence to be just and of hammurabian simplicity we had to give back to the soil what we had taken from it the handless zobranoirundisi recognizing his missing member from the cells now incorporated into the fingers of a young colony child nurtured on milk from cattle fed in the velvet fields had every right to reclaim what was undeniably his own flesh the legless zobranoirundisi could not be condemned to a crippled existence when the terran child had used the same cells to run freely for seven years on land where previously only zobranoirundisi had trod we rendered all of us unto the zobranoirundisi that which was truly theirsseed and soil of the velvet fields part and particle of the originally fertilizing dust that would have been reconstituted during the cycle we had so impiously interrupted nor were we permitted to evade the least segment of required reparation for the galaxy watched i will say this of us proudly though i no longer have a tongue mankind will be able to live with its conscience not one of us when required failed to give his flesh to the zobranoirundisi in atonement the harrowers eric gregory the kid didnt have a feed he glanced over his shoulder and scratched the back of his head and i saw there was nothing in his neck you didnt find many folks without feeds in the city right away i knew hed brought me a problem im looking for ez he said and i said yeah i was him he looked relieved then lowered his voice and youre a guide i wiped grease on the front of my jeans closed the hood of the runner and gestured for the kid to follow me he took the hint nodding with absurd gratitude and i led him down past the line of old rigs all waiting to be stripped across the yard someone cranked up a saw who gave you my name i asked guy called himself coroner you dont want to talk to him again the kid gave a sad sort of smile no i really dont he wasnt the roughneck sort who usually came around looking for a guide right age maybe seventeen eighteen but the boy had a pressed conservative look to him skinny cleanshaven all done up in slacks and suspenders and a white sweaty shirt i didnt know what to make of him and i didnt like that i didnt know you from around here i asked he shook his head no sir lynchburg nice town i lied hive of fanatics how long you been here then not quite a day and you already want to go outside i grinned jesus it wasnt much cooler in the office but there was beer and shade the kid settled onto my ratty floralprint sofa and i opened two yanjings thinking maybe he was used to the fancy stuff i still couldnt get a fix on him but he dressed like a big spender he folded his arms and crossed his legs at the knee glancing at the old gas station signs on the wall what do i call you i said he frowned into his beer pk all right pk you want to tell me about your deathwish he shook his head no deathwish i just want to see my old man again my turn to frown your old man yessir hes outside i slid my bottle across the desk back and forth from one hand to the other how far outside cherokee north between here and johnson city thats a lot of forest he shrugged some guides dont like to get nosy take the job dont ask questions lot of those guides develop a nasty case of dead you want my help i said youre going to have to tell me what he was doing there if coroner had sent him i didnt have many choices here but maybe the boy didnt know that he nodded answered without hesitation we were out harrowing christ i thought and then of coursepk preachers kid shouldve caught that earlier i finished off the yanjing then opened the cooler and unscrewed a jar of whiskey id heard of harrowers before but never met one alive you were with him i said yessir he preaches you shoot that how it works the kid looked embarrassed i havent learned to bless yet and you got separated he inclined his head pack of wolves surprised us we were running and my father he paused he fell over a ledge i saw him roll heard him call out but the slope sharpened andi didnt see where he landed i searched until sundown i love my father buthe pursed his lipsbut im not stupid you did right i leaned forward but you understand hes dead the boy was silent i aint gonna sell you false hope your daddys gone ill take your money ill take you out there and ill help you make whatever amends you want to make but i want us both to understand whats going on here i dont want any confusion between us you have to show me that you know were not going to find him smiling i have to find him he said i know the odds i wasnt sure he did i aint cheap and i aint stupid either i told him the deposit i need to see triple the advance in a credit account and i need the account linked to my feed in the event of my death the triple transfers automatically to my family little joke there family thats fair he said and if i die we link your feed to my account the deposit transfers back he shook his head i dont have a feed id forgotten mark of the devil i smiled through a stir of jealousy the little metal nub in my neck let me work in the city let me spend and collect credit but mostly it just felt like a warm seed of debt always itching beneath my skin waiting for me to die or default always threatening to grow we can go to my credit agency and set up a timed withdrawal from my account i said if youre not around to cancel it in three days the advancell transfer to the account of your choice he nodded works for me i think we understand one another pk i took the colt from my drawer set it on my desk the old faded sticker on the grip said keep asheville weird if you got the yuan i got the yeehaw and just like that we were in business no one ran outside the law in asheville without owing money to coroner he found you when you were down desperate earthless he fed you paid your rent if you wanted to be a guide he made it easy set you up as a company mechanic pulled all the right bureaucratic triggers to assign you to truckers on his payroll to divert shipping routes last christmas hed bought me a suit of skintight armor straight out of cupertino sometimes it was hard to figure out where the companies ended and coroner began but it was absolutely clear who owned you coroner had placed me and xin sun together so often that i could tell you her granddaddys favorite singer johnny cash and the city where her mama was born raleigh she was short wiry somewhere in her forties with a line of faded hearts tattooed around her wrist her rig was a behemoth a messy cross between a humvee and an old furniture truck i sat in the cab behind the old automatic rifle mounted on the hood pk huddled in the cargo crawlspace with the liquor xin caught my eye as she eased toward the gate youre a bad person ez yeah the daddys gone she said boy dont need to see that i told him he can make up his own mind she shook her head scratched her neck hes green as shit the dead on the moon can see it you ought to know better hes shot his share of dead he dont need a mama xin she stared straight ahead gripped the wheel asshole said the silence the traffic light changed and xin eased forward again bluecoats crowded around us with rifles and pads my feed ran hot so i could almost feel their fingers in the back of my neck sifting through my licenses and permissions my employers and outstanding debts the bluecoat captain read through our manifest while his grunts looked over the cargo xin ignored me and i tried not to touch my gun or crack my knuckles or otherwise announce that i was scared turdless i listened to the clang of footsteps in the back and wondered what the kid was thinking hidden down there with the liquor the footsteps in the back receded the door slammed shut and the captain waved us on i tipped an invisible hat and xin told him to have a good one the gate opened and we drove outside theres something about leaving a city that makes you want to get drunk and scream you ride out into the emptiness of the frontier and you can feel the weight of gazes falling away with every mile debts shopping centers manifestsall that headsmoke recedes until its just you and the quiet the clouds wrapped around roadcarved mountains i watched the trees as we rode out the leaves were only just tinged with orange ahead the interstate wound through the broad swells of the blue ridge all steep slopes and sharp drops if you rode fifteen miles outside of asheville you could hardly tell that anyone had ever bothered to live on the mountains even the billboards were scarce and choked by kudzu want to let him out said xin guess i ought to i pulled myself out of the gunners seat grappled my way to the back and ducked past stacked pallets marked in portuguese italian chinese all the worlds shit packed up in crates you couldnt see much by the emergency lights and as often as id navigated xins rig they packed it a little different every time i pushed a box of canned soup off of the hidden door rapped three times waited rapped again i heard the door unlatch from his side and i pulled it open pk stared out from the crawlspace his arms crossed over his chest like an oldfashioned corpse mason jars shifting slightly around him he was redfaced his hair sweatwet against his forehead thank you he breathed i offered my hand everything all right down there he blinked are we out yessir i helped him up guided him to the front have a sitdown i said waving him into the gunners seat xin glanced over her shoulder and smiled at the boy hope you didnt sample the whiskey she said gently teasing i dont want coroner to come knocking he flushed no maam i dont drink i tried not to imagine coroner at my door xin laughed that so youre either wise or insane not sure which out here pk ventured smiling nervously i think its for the best out here you may be right on the side of the road empty signs words scraped and weathered away a lone dead woman onearmed and skeletal limped along the side of the road stumbling now and then into the guardrail threatening to tumble over and down into a far hollow xin and pk fell silent and i watched the sky for birds i still couldnt work out what coroner was trying to say sending me this job when id called to line up the ride i asked about the kid but the minder only told me that the operation was important to the boss make sure the boy and his daddy come back with you hed said finish the job youll be fine coroner wasnt an idiothe knew the preacher was dead by now was he trying to play the kid for money that didnt make sense this was small change for him he wanted the job done but i didnt understand why i didnt know the stakes didnt understand what i stood to lose xin braked hard lashing me out of my thoughts i barely caught myself from toppling headfirst into the windshield ahead an eighteenwheeler lay on its side its head curled into the median and its ass blocking half of the interstate splayed out like a sleeping cat the semis rear turret was shredded the cowcatcher banged up and twisted into bad art gathered around the cab was a cluster of red bearsdead from the look of themripping the skin from the rig in unison the bears looked up from their work some people call dead eyes dull but ive never understood that you look the dead in the eyes you see the judgment when guides and truckers get together to drink you hear talk of road churches that worship the red bears were not a very spiritual lot but i believe it sometimes you got to pray to the thing that scares you and if you aint scared of a twelvefoot threethousandpound monster bred to consume as much flesh as possible youre already underground the companies engineered the red bears to clear the forests of the dead and on paper it still sounds like a good idea carnivorous cyborg weapons carrioneaters with titaniumreinforced skeletons they were supposed to be uninfectable a walking immune system for the world outside problem was they got infected anyway i grabbed pks shoulder tried to pull him out of the seat but he shook me off four of the animals broke off from the pack loping toward us xin gripped the wheel shifted the truck into reverse the approaching dead split into two groups flanking us the ones that stayed behind tore open the cab of the downed rig crack the nearest bear lurched to the right as blood sprayed from the side of its head his face blank pk swung the barrel of the rifle toward the next animal then frowned slightly when he noticed that the first bear was still coming its jaw hanging loose and swinging sidetoside as it ran xin watched the mirror and held the wheel steady pushing the truck backward as fast as it would go but the bears moved faster hardly slowing as pk shot them in the chest in the head finally the one with the loose jaw stumbled and fell forward as if it was dizzy or out of breath at first i thought pk had worn it down but no its hind legs had collapsed the other three bears were close enough that i could see the meat between their teeth i leaned into pks ear shouted over the gun shoot them in the legs he nodded once and concentrated his fire on the space in front of the animals there was less flesh around the joints where their forelimbs met their paws red fur and muscle fell away and bonealloy gleamed underneath pk didnt waste a shot but wed have to reload soon the tallest bear staggered and hit the pavement scraped away its snout as it fell the last hurled itself forward and hit our hood the rig shook but xin kept it steady the bear slumped and fell away then lay still on the road xin slowed and we watched the rest of the dead in the distance there were seven or eight bears circled there maybe more theyd already pulled apart the cab of the fallen truck and now were eating i can turn us around xin said quietly get off the last exit bypass the interstate for a couple miles i wondered about the folks in the middle of that circle other truckers other guides maybe i wondered if i knew them yeah i said lets do that i hope they were christians pk said softly we talked about our families xins mother half out of her mind in a nursing home in charlotte she didnt mention her exhusband and sons my daughter grown and living on a monsanto farm colony in the pacific still writing every couple months for money xin had heard the story a dozen times beforeoften enough that she ought to have pegged it for bullshitbut she still watched me with something between warmth and bitterness pk told us about his father joseph at first the kid spoke hesitantly responding to xins questions with short oneword answers but finally he relaxed into his story seeming to surprise himself with the pleasure of the telling joseph hadnt always harrowed souls in the wilderness as a young man of the lynchburg watch hed walked the walls and killed the dead joseph had mumbled his prayers since he was a boy the town being what it was but he didnt find religion until a circuit rider passed through in the summer of his twentieth year hed only recently become a father and the death hed dealt out weighed on him with new urgency even if it was only the longrotted hed sent to their final repose the circuit rider preached that the souls of the dead still resided in those wasted bodies that for all their hunger and decay they could always receive or reject the love of christ he preached that the living death was an opportunity a flesh limbo and that it was the duty of all christians to speak the gospel to lost souls and offer them salvation just as christ had descended to hell to harrow pagan souls the faithful were bound to travel the wilderness and minister to the dead joseph found his calling he rode with the circuit man for three years preaching in the walled cities and preaching to the dead outside returning now and then to lynchburg to give his wife and son the money hed collected from churches throughout the south when pk was seven joseph came home to find his wife lost to pneumonia his son motherless and afraid for almost a year joseph gave up the circuit and raised the boy working the wall as hed done before now hollering salvation as he delivered bullets into creeping bodies it was on the wall that he had his revelation as he fired his rifle at a cluster of dead in army camouflage an angel of the lord seized his tongue and set it ablaze with the language enoch knew the words spoken in the kingdom of heaven the dead paused to hear his ministry and he saw the light of christ in their eyes he killed them all immediately before they could move or doubt he was ecstatic his fervor restored joseph resolved to return to the wilderness this time with his son pk was already a fine shot a junior watchman the circuit rider had traveled in an armored truck declaiming over loudspeakers but joseph now understood that glass and metal separated him from the souls he meant to save he bought two horses and taught pk to ride wait i said you rode horses out here pk shrugged theyre fast youre fucking with me now no sir i glanced aside at xin she focused on the road negotiating the sharp mountainside scurves of cherokee north we had to drive at a crawl but pk said we werent far from the last place hed seen joseph how do you survive something like those bears he smiled tightly i got lucky last night but the dead stand aside for my father he preaches as he rides they stand aside i thought of course what happened next said xin he taught you pk seemed reluctant thats all there is to tell he taught me to ride and we rode we visited churches often enough to keep food in our stomachs but his heart was never much in ministering to the living we spent more and more time in the wild released thousands of souls to the lord fathers done his best to teach me the tongue of heaven but i lack he trailed off stared out the window the revelation he finished quietly the tires whined as the road wound back around on itself almost a threehundredsixty degree turn i gritted my teeth tried not to see the sheer drop to my left or the rock face to my right pk leaned forward pointed at a graffiti symbol on the rock i recognize something hit the side of the truck hard on the right side we screeched toward the side of the road mangled the guardrail the hell xin shouted i swung behind pks seat pulled on the safety straps and curled into a ball there was another deep metalrending crash and another and then the world rolled and blurred a rank cloudy explosion as the airbags deployed and then gravity fell out from underneath me snapped back in brief vicious cracks against my knees and elbows i covered my head the best i could but suddenly it felt hot and then everything was heavy and dark metal ground against metal keening wake shouted xin the fuck up two gunshots i took a breath like a knife to the chest opened my eyes the cab was pillowy and white almost heavenly except for the bent metal and bloodstains there was a sour stench piss mixed with sulfur my feed burned i moved my fingers feet blinked blood out of my eyes felt like maybe id bruised a rib but i could sit up breathe limbs intact head was wet but it was a shallow gash xin stood over me covered in white powder from the airbags a pleasant middleaged phantom with a desert eagle there was a wide hole in the back of the rig jeans and soda and high heels all strewn around like christmas in the asheville mall not that id ever had the yuan or selfloathing to step in there three dead men in faded orange jumpsuits peered inside the truck eager in the instant before xin shot them down you good she asked golden pk up top she gestured toward the roof with her head looks like they hit us with rocks i unbuckled the safety straps stood up shakily almost fell but steadied myself against the drivers seat kid have a gun i asked fumbling for my holster hes got the rifle so why isnt he shooting xin bit her lip i flicked off the safety on my colt and we pressed our way to the back kicking aside boxes of designer boots finally stepping outside it looked like xin had killed the last of the orangesuited dead there was nothing but breeze and the glare of afternoon light the truck was caught between two large trees we hadnt rolled all the way to the bottom maybe hadnt rolled that far at all which meant we were still on a sharp slope also pk wasnt up top i ripped the handset from my belt prayed it wasnt broken where the hell are you i hissed there was a long silence i wondered what coroner would do if i lost the boy lost the money down the hill a bit pk answered at last his voice crackling on the handset to the east you can probably still see me and there he was through the trees a dot i already sent the sos xin said leaning into my handset companys coming maybe thirty minutes we just got to wait here pk said my old mans close i can find him in half an hour wait here for the rescue xin said well all go out and look for him he gave a sad little laugh the companys not going to send out a search party you know that all they care about is their cargo and whatever they can salvage from the truck my fathers less than meaningless to anyone but me well i wanted to say he is dead instead i started down the hill slow down i said im coming with you what said xin i took my thumb off the handset kid cant die i said wondering how much honesty i could afford you mean you need the money i held on to a low tree limb with my free hand moved ahead grabbed hold of another tree all the while trying not to slip on leaves or trip on roots jesus ez xin was flushed agitated she took a step forward not following me so much as making sure i could hear her we all need the money but its no goddamned good if youre dead not true boy owes me a pile if i die yeah what if you both get eaten thatll be complicated may have to hire an accountant i save your life and youre going to leave me alone all those times we rode together youre going to leave me alone i forced myself to keep walking to fix my eyes on the kid you know guilt dont work on me xin lock yourself in the crawlspace pour a few shots drink to our health and dont let the rescue team leave without us i stepped over another corpse in an orange jumpsuit pale and gaunt and forestscratched its face little more than a skull beneath skin these were the desperate dead the old and ravenous the fatter younger brighter ones favored the night when the sun wouldnt rot muscle from their bones ez said xin the boys lying i stopped i dont know whats truth and whats lies she said but i seen him before back home at the new french playing cards and throwing back shots she lowered her voice spoke in a highspeed hiss that nomaamidontdrink business was horseshit and i reckon hes been in asheville a lot longer than a night i dont know what his game is here but i dont feel like dying for a lie today just stay back if the kid gets himself killed well we lose a little money well have another job tomorrow was she telling the truth or just trying to keep me from getting myself killed as long as coroner was knocking on my door it didnt really matter tomorrows too late i said she shook her head and stepped back she said you stupid asshole i worked my way down pk waited in a hollow where the ground flattened out there was a creek nearby invisible but mumbling he forced a smile cradled the m his clothes were sweatsoaked weighted down with ammunition the air smelled smogless and new like god had just invented it and still thought it was good you aint a tourist i said he shrugged a shoulder then turned away and raised his rifle toward the trees skipped over a rocky outcrop and made toward the sound of the creek i told you ive spent every day outside for as long as i can remember we should keep our mouths shut ordinarily id have welcomed the caution there was a certain flavor of tourist who hooted his glee every time he pulled a trigger or almost pulled a trigger or thought about pulling triggers but silence seemed ridiculous now and i didnt appreciate the boy hushing me were the only game in town kid every corpse for miles around already knows were here he gave another halfshrug the creek was low enough that we didnt bother walking on stones tadpoles flitted around our boots on the other side we started moving uphill again the leaves here were shot through with streaks of red as if wed stumbled our way deep into autumn youre a hell of a good son i said boy your age usually wants to strangle his daddy he looked back did you strangle yours never knew him but i wanted to i paused strangle him i mean he chewed that over a while where did you grow up richmond never heard of it thats because it aint there anymore the flutter of birds overhead you could depend on birds they died and stayed dead twigs snapped underfoot the climb sharpened i have to be honest with you he said okay sometimes i think im not a good enough person i know im not i mean to speak the tongue the angels language are you an angel no there you go pk pursed his lips looked like he wanted to say something instead he pointed up i followed the line of his finger to the purpling sky ahead and the silhouette of an old fire tower when clients wanted to hunt i took them to towers like that tall ancient sturdy dead folks are slow climbers thats where hell be said the boy i should warn you i raised my hand to cut him off listened do you hear that i whispered the strongest argument against talking when youre outside is that your voice masks important warnings like the sound of feet against dirt running we sprinted up the hill pk scanned the woods ahead his rifle following his eyes and i glanced back over my shoulder my lungs felt like someone had balled them up pissed on them and stapled them into my ribcage but i pushed on legs dragging underneath me my feed was hot with its broadcast of i am alive i am still alive i will pay my debts and a tendril of shame shot through the middle of my fear because this was the only reason anyone cared that i was alive to earn and owe money we made it halfway to the tower before i saw our pursuers and realized id been wrong about the sound it wasnt just feet against the dirt there were also paws the wolves were ragged skeletal things ribs halfexposed beneath gray and white fur they wove like steel needles through the trees a man and a woman trailed the wolves wearing tattered green uniforms i fired at the closest animal missed behind us i rasped pk twisted around as he ran took aim tore the front legs off the wolf id missed i couldnt tell how many were leftthey ducked in and out of sight graygreen blurs faces of the forest one appeared a bodys length from pks left side i got it in the head almost fell over the body as it crumpled caught my footing and squeezed off a shot at the man in green the dead didnt breathe didnt growl or hiss or groan they watched and lunged and snapped silent eyes flashed ahead they flanked us with a kind of brutal grace closing from every side with each footfall and i had one of those idiot epiphanies that seem profound when youre dizzy with adrenaline and about to be eaten its like theyre dancing every lunge in concert every bite we were going to die because the dead were dancers the kid stopped i was running too fast too close behind him we hit the dirt someone shouted but i didnt understand the words i smelled rotted meat i tried to stand but my legs were tangled someone was still shouting my shoulder throbbed each breath was a suckerpunch i gripped the colt braced for the bite and someone was still shouting i looked up the dead all stared at the man in black he was tall pale he wore a days graybrown stubble and his eyes were hidden by the shadow of his widebrimmed hat his voice was hoarse but commanding as hungerevery nonsense syllable he shouted was a slap a crack all thunder and hard edges the dead folks slumped as he spoke cowed or subdued or enraptured the wolves pawed the dirt uncertain saliva dripping from their mouths their eyes never leaving the preacher joseph took off his hat and stared down at his son his blue eyes blunt and then he spoke english instead of the babble of heaven go on and shoot em he said my throat hurts like a bitch when i first came to asheville id lived for six months with an expentecostal poet from the mountain collectives south of blacksburg once after a night of smoke and sweat and blackjack shed given me slurred lessons in glossolalia giggling as she coached me on tongues there were she said patterns in the babble sounds that looped and recurred subtle cadences the language of heaven was poetry without meaning empty words taking shapes there was an art to it silently i wrapped my tongue around the syllables of josephs sermon nalumasakala sayamawath shit like that kidsounds but theyd tamed the dead the man had reached out with his tongue and controlled them i tried to memorize his rhythms and words that werent words i wanted to beg him to preach again joseph wasnt lost he wasnt stranded or waiting for saviors he was at home at ease there was a reinforced steel stable at the base of the towera horse grunted inside after we killed the last of the dead joseph lit a cigarette and gestured to a rope ladder invited us up for coffee i aint got much to offer he said but i can boil you some beans pk didnt move you need to come with us he said terse and low rescues coming soon but we have to meet them on the other side of the creek already told you i aint going nowhere pk gripped his rifle father you cant live out here joseph snorted missed you too christopher how you like the city you going to introduce me to your friend hes a tour guide hes here to help youre sick we want to help you christopher the kid glanced at me frowned my names ezekiel i said held out my hand he eyed me carefully then shook it you from around here he asked no sir richmond he grimaced exhaled smoke you had people there my joke my family i did i passed through once few months after christopher left he flicked ash into the dirt you see that place you have a hard time looking the lord in the eye i didnt know what to say i said yes sir father christopher pressed you need to come with us now joseph shook his head its good to see you son im happy to drink a cup of coffee with you and you can tell me what it is you really want grace baptist took up a collection last monthyou need money we can talk but i aint going to live inside of walls for you he turned around started to walk back to his ladder and pkchristopherhit him in the head with the butt of his rifle the preacher crumpled my instinct was to reach for the colt but i balled my fist and stood very still christopher kneeled and fumbled in his fathers jacket withdrew a ring of keys he doesnt want to leave the wilderness anymore he said hes senile he needs saving if you want to help him the best thing you can do is help me get him on the horse you could smell the bullshit in every word i watched him as he searched through his daddys keys and i remembered xins story about the new french i remembered that the minder told me to bring back the old man and a nasty hunch worked itself out in my head i would have shaken my head in grudging admiration but no one had told me and that left me scratching the nub in the back of my neck feeling the dim heat of my feed the constant heat of debt and return coroner had sent me into this blind and now i was stuck choiceless why had he chosen me because i was dependable or because he thought i was stupid expendable finish the job and youll be fine okay i said slowly ill get this arm well hold him up together we pulled his father to his feet draped his arms over our shoulders and carried him to the stable christopher unlocked the steel door and we hauled joseph inside the place was cramped and thick with shitstink bars of light slanted through the grates and the ground was covered with hay the horse huffed stepped back it was gaunt its fur as black as josephs coat i couldnt remember the last time id seen such a large animal alive rodents tended to stay dead but most mammals bigger than cats were liable to come back you didnt see them much in the cities the horse was calm it let us push joseph onto its back without much fuss we swung the preacher around by his legs so that he was sitting more or less upright his head hanging forward christopher climbed onto the horse inclined his head to me thank you he said then he shot me in the chest the blast knocked me into the dirt even with the armor under my coat it felt like someone had jackhammered the breath out of me and i fought to suck down air christophers horse charged into the woods and for a beautiful adrenalinesoaked moment i stopped worrying about money and consequences and coroner i raised the colt fired the first shot missed the second hit its mark and the boy toppled from the horse the animal panicked reared back and knocked off the preacher who fell on his side and rolled i winced and climbed to my feet staggered outside in time to see the kid duck behind a tree weaving and heavybreathing but alive the m in hand i pulled the trigger again splintered bark took cover behind a fallen trunk it looked an awful lot like coroner had bought the kid californian armor too so i called you want to sell your old man christopher coughed it took me a moment to realize he was laughing is that why youre shooting at me because im a bad son his shot grazed bark burned moss whistled over my head or do you want to sell him yourself didnt plan on it i said i slid down the length of the log listened for footsteps or tells i just make a point of shooting folks who shoot me he was silent i want to know if i got this right i shouted i willed him to make a move while i talked willed him to peer out and try to find me you were sick of it werent you the preaching the wilderness you were sick of it and you were sane and you wanted to go live with the living so you ran off to the city and got caught up in cards and whiskey do i have it right so far wind in the leaves the snap of a reloaded magazine i focused on the snap raised the barrel of the colt over the log you play the tables long enough in the new french you start owing money around town which in the end really just means you owe coroner i bet it wasnt long before coroner came calling and you started to wonder what you could give him to get him off your back then you remembered your daddy and it all he cut me off with a thundercrack i fired twice over the log the colt clicked christopher must have heard it he coughed and fired into the dead tree tearing through moss and bark and wood as if he were hacking with a machete moving closer and coughing and ripping apart the air and then he stopped there was a snap and the woods fell silent i peered over the log she held him like a lover his head hung limp twisted her forearm was mangled her mouth bloodstained she was still covered in the powder from the airbag three dead rescue workers in camouflage armor staggered through the trees behind her i gave up then those armor suits so bulky and futile xin sun with blood in her mouth everyone was dead no one was coming for me and even if i found my way home coroner would be waiting xin pressed her lips against the dead boys throat at first it looked like a kiss and then it didnt she opened the artery ripped away muscle her eyes flicked to the side and met mine she seemed torn between finishing her meal and moving on to me the boys blood ran down the front of her shirt the rescue crews legs were all bent into painful anglesmaybe theyd wreckedbut they still hitched toward us inch by inch you were right i said softly im a stupid asshole she watched me shifted her weight you look the dead in the eyes you see the judgment i cant go back to the city dont know why id go back anyway i aint got no family no daughter in california all i got is a landlord and some funerals i aint paid for the rescuers were close now i opened my fingers dropped the colt i dont want to be owned i said i dont want to owe nobody no more i been stuck a long time she was silent i tried to relax tried not to feel the blood drum in my neck my chest the air tasted goodi was glad to die outside it was the best i could hope for going out where i could see the birds there was a kind of relief in it a lightness this is how its going to be feet scuffed the dirt one step and then another go on xin i said she jerked backward with a thwip xin and christopher fell tangled together before they hit the dirt the rescue workers heads shattered in a spray of bone and blood i spun around followed the sound of silenced shots the preacher stood at the base of his tower with a pistol in each hand his guns raised toward me and the dead his face empty as an abandoned city we burned the bodies in silence joseph stood too close to christophers pyre head bowed and lips moving wordlessly the sun was almost down i held one of his pistols and watched the woods far as i could tell the preacher didnt know what his son had planned to do i wasnt going to tell him i didnt have anything more to say to xin and i felt guilty for it still i stood by her pyre clinging quietly to my only friend at a lonely party when the preacher finished his prayers we climbed the tower and watched the fires burn down he made bitter coffee and we drank it slowly as the stars came out denser and brighter than id seen in years when joseph spoke his voice was hoarse and flat you still want to try to take me back to your city i reckoned i could do it carry him to coroner my debt might not be paid but the boss would be off my back for another day hed have something priceless something that no thuglord or companynot even the few who could fly over oceanscould buy words that could hold the dead at bay joseph might not cooperate but coroner knew how to make a man talk hed learn the loops and rhythms put poets on his payroll try to vivisect the tongue of heaven hed try to figure out what other things those words could make the dead do i swallowed my coffee no sir the old man nodded then unsheathed his knife you were blessing her he said i watched the knifes tip tried to work out the right answer he took my silence for confusion the woman you were blessing her the pyrecoals glowed below a constellation of deaths her name was xin sun i said she was the nearest thing to family that i had i looked up from the knife and met his eyes willing him to believe me i dont know how to save a soul but i would have liked to have saved hers there was nothing about xins soul that needed saving i hoped she would have forgiven the lie joseph leaned on the rail and toyed with his knife moonlight glinting on the blade my palms were sweaty my throat tight with unasked questions i wasnt used to wanting something like this wanting to walk in the wilderness outside of walls wanting to ride the roads and forests far from companies and criminals free from coroner and the machinery of obligation id never believed that kind of life was possible and now i was drunk on the fantasy if you want me to teach you joseph said at last im gonna have to cut out your feed i touched the warm nub on my neck and bit back a smile mark of the devil already i could feel it the sting of alcohol metal on skin the knifes edge like nightbreeze blood one drop and then a trickle the cut the last hum of the feed running my numbers and then a release when it tells the world that im a dead man bibi from jupiter tessa mellas when i marked on my roommate survey sheet that id be interested in living with an international student i was thinking shed take me to switzerland for christmas break or to puerto rico for a month in the summer i wasnt thinking about a romp around the red eye of jupiter which is exactly what id have gotten had i followed my roommate home apparently american school systems have gotten popular all over universities shepherd the foreigners in anything to be able to write on the brochures our student body hails from thirtythree countries and the far reaches of the solar system youd think thered have been an uproar over the matter i mean here we have studentfunding going down the toilet and everyone staging protests to show theyre pissed and she gets a full ride all the amenities paid for she comes in like a cuban refugee minus the boat sweeps up all the scholarships and why shouldnt she she probably qualifies as fifteen different types of minority dont get me wrong i dont have anything against her we were friends i just didnt expect her to be so popular i figured id have to protect her from riots and reporters but as it turns out she was really well liked the first time i met her i nearly peed my pants its the end of august and ive got all my stuff shoved in the family van a bit too unorganized for my fathers taste but we only live an hour away im hoping to get there first to pick the best side of the room the one with the most sunlight and the least damaged furniture i get up earlyjust to beat her there but i dont shes sitting at her desk already reading the student handbook i doublecheck the room number ive got the right place this is my roommate at first i think shes an inmate shes wearing this lightblue jumpsuit and shes got palegreen skin that looks sickly gangrene i think not quite knowing what that is it just sounds like a disease that would turn you green shes not an allout green tinted rather like she got a sunless tanner that didnt work out her ears are inset like a whales and she doesnt have eyelids shes this tiny creature not even five feet tall completely flat no breasts it doesnt even look like she has nipples my parents are right behind me my mothers carrying my lava lamp like some offering my fathers got my futon extended over his head trying to be all macho in case my roommates a babe they drop my stuff on the side of the room with a broken closet door and turn to this green earless girl theyre all excited want to make friends with the new roommate so they start asking questions how was your drive do you like the campus have your parents left not even acknowledging the obvious that shes green maybe they didnt notice like i said it was a pale green a tint really but it was pretty obvious to me and she had weird eyes too beady black pinhead eyes like a hamsters so finally i ask where are you from and she says jupiter jupiter new york my parents ask not that they know there is a jupiter new york it just makes more sense than the other possibility no she says jupiter jupiter the planet oh they say i didnt realize wed found life on other planets yet how interesting she says you didnt we found you and goes back to her reading that shuts my parents up fast they have no response they do an aboutface and head back to the car jupiter my fathers saying you believe that cath my mothers shaking her head saying jupiter over and over first like its a word shes never heard a word shes trying to get used to then like a question jupiter not quite sure whether or not to believe it she says it several more times looks at my father then me i was worried about angela living with city kids she says this is a bit different she unlocks the car grabs a handful of pillows and adds is jupiter the one with the rings i thought jupiter was made of gas my father says how can she live on a gaseous planet lets just drop it i say she could be from the moon for all i care as it turned out she was from the moon well one of them apparently jupiters got a few dozen the one shes from is called europaby americans at least but she tells everyone shes from jupiter says its easier to explain her name is bibi no last name just bibi i looked it up it means lady in arabic ironic as her kind doesnt have genders just one type like flowers selfgerminating and everything but she looks more like a girl than a guy so thats how we treat her while shes here even though her body parts serve both functions she tells me most of this the first night in the dorm im unpacking my toiletries and makeup and shes still reading i say your parents were cool with you coming to america mine wouldnt even let me go out of state i dont have parents bibi says oh christ i say im sorry that sucks what can you say in a situation like that id never met an orphan its fine she says nobody has parents i grew up like this sort of in a dorm how can nobody on jupiter have parents i ask i know im being nosy but youve got to admit its a bit strange its complicated she says i dont feel like getting into it im about to insist when theres a knock at the door bibi jumps to get it and these men wheel in a fullsize fridge its brandnew a frigidaire one of those sidebyside freezerandfridge jobs complete with icemaker they prop it against the window plug it in and leave what the hell is that i ask knowing damn well its a fridge not quite sure what its doing in our room my parents bought us one of those mini units just enough space for a brita filter pudding snacks and string cheese the university had exact specifications on which ones were allowed this frigidaire wasnt on the list bibi explains how she got special permission to have it in the room says she has a medical condition what kind of condition i ask are you contagious its not a viral condition she says i need a daily supply of ice ice i say for what dont they teach you this stuff in school she asks the basics of the solar system of course i say third grade we memorized the planets there was a song apparently she doesnt believe me she goes to my dresser and starts grabbing stuff she throws my nightie in a lump in the middle of the floor and says thats the sun she places a red thong beside it and calls that mercury venus is a pair of toe socks earth a blue bra mars a pair of leggings and jupiter and all its moons are my best sparkly panties she lines them up stands to the side says see yeah i get your point i say though i dont really im too pissed that my underwear are on the floor matching bras and panties arent cheap i appreciate the astronomy lesson i say but she cuts me off she points at my bra youre here she says were there see how far we are from the sun its cold we dont have sweat glands your planet is hot so i need ice capisce capisce who the hell does she think she is a jupitarian girl trying to intimidate me with italian barging in with her refrigerator taking the best side of the room and making my thong a planet i snatch her solar system off the floor and stuff it back in my drawer say i dont know much about jupiter but here shit like that just isnt cool theres another knock at the door im about to say that better not be a fucking stove when these guys from down the hall walk in they want bibi to join them for a game of pool im angela i say extending my hand you can come too if you want they say but its clear theyre just interested in bibi i shrug i got stuff to do maybe next time and bibi takes off no apology no im not going without my roommate no nothing she just leaves me there with her big fucking fridge while she goes to shoot pool with these boys shes never even seen im not sure what they see in her she isnt at all pretty i mean i dont think so we have rigid aesthetics here right how can you count a green earless girl without eyelids as pretty i watch them head down the stairs the dorm is quiet empty i thought people were supposed to congregate on their floor the first night praise each others bedspreads and posters and shit the door across the hall opens and a guy wearing pink pants and a polo shirt steps out hey i say hey he replies hes wearing his collar propped up like hes snow white his hair is gelled back and all goopy i want to tell him that went out of style with the fonz but instead say im angela even though its written on the construction paper sign on my door call me skippy he says even though his sign says john ward iii whered the nickname come from i ask i made it up people say you can reinvent yourself in college huh i say good choice so that green girls your roommate he asks yeah afraid so do you know when shes getting back he asks i heard shes from jupiter you think you could introduce me lloydin space is my favorite cartoon the first week wasnt at all what i expected from freshman year bibi followed me all over the place dragging her leaky ice packs along didnt quite understand we had different schedules shes taking all these science and math courses and i have this good mix swahili ballet psychology statistics my adviser made me take that last one said i needed a math credit but besides statistics im thinking classes will be fun then in psych lab i turn around and there she is sitting behind me shes even got the books i figure she must have bought them for both our schedules hows a girl from jupiter to know better everyone wants to be her lab partner they crowd around her desk and ask stupid questions like are you going to be a psychologist will you go back to jupiter and counsel manicdepressives no she says im a neurobiology major stem cell research im going to learn to grow pancreases and livers on rats then take them back to jupiter and implant them in bodies right i say youre not even supposed to be here dont you have chemistry she doesnt answer just prepares her rat for the maze of course hers finishes first mine gets stuck in a corner and goes into shock but what does it matter that her rats the smartest the girl doesnt have any common sense she forgets her shoes all the time puts the toothpaste in her mouth instead of on the brush and doesnt close the stall door behind her when she goes to the bathroom no one wants to see how jupitarians pee actually everyone was interested but once they saw it they didnt want to see it again around the third week i finally get a look at her schedule its in one of those uglyass trapper keeper things as it turns out bibi is enrolled in my classes hers too shes taking nine at once i didnt think that was allowed bet they make exceptions for jupitarians figuring anyone from another planet is more intelligent than us bibi is pretty smart actually gets perfect scores on the tests even though she says absolutely nothing in class and to top it all off even the boys are into her that guy skippy wont stop hanging around hes a complete dork a gradea loser he stands outside our door like hes the kings guard at night he brings bibi ice cream and popsicles he follows her to dinner and leaves flowers outside our door nasty weedy ones with ants bibi hangs them from the ceiling and the flowers die because theres absolutely no light in the room she wont let me open the blinds not even a crack on account of her condition so now weve got all these ants crawling across our ceiling between brown crusty root systems and skippys become this stalker i find him in my closet behind my shoe rack and dustbuster just playing hideandseek he says and winks hideandseek my ass i yell she doesnt even have a vagina i call my mother and tell her about skippy and the icepacks and the ants my mother tells me to be patient she reminds me about martin luther king jr i tell her she shouldnt send bibi presents anymore she puts something in all my care packages for bibi cookies statuettes from the dollar store soupforthesoul books i tell her bibi doesnt need presents you should see this girls checks the government gives her plenty of money my mother says presents are different bibi doesnt have parents she tells me to be mindful of that i tell my mother no one on jupiter has parents she says that doesnt sound right and i agree i mean a whole planet full of orphans that just seems too sad to be true shes probably lying going for the sympathy vote i could press the issue but i dont i think about martin luther king jr and when bibi comes back i give the roommate chitchat thing another try so who do you have the hots for i ask and she says nobody really im not quite sure how it works for jupitarians since they can selfgerminate she seems asexual never mentions boys i say what about skippy he wants you bad oh him she says as though she hadnt noticed she gets her shower caddy and heads down the hall i stare at the door after shes gone maybe shes bisexual maybe shes gay i wonder if she masturbates when im out of the room it seems like genderless people dont care about anyone but themselves they might but bibi could give two shits about me by the time thanksgiving rolls around im getting pretty sick of my roommate i mean how many times do you have to tell a person put on your shoes before she gets it right theres snow on the ground and shes prancing in it like some leprechaun she walks around in her bare feet leaving these monster frog prints did i mention jupitarians only have three toes its like she needed to show them off youd think she at least would have tried to fit in i think she liked being different everyone was always stopping by our room to see what the space alien was up to i was happy to have a week at home without her but there was no place for her to go and my mother offered our house insisted really said angela if we were dead i would hope someone would be nice enough to take you in for the holidays i guess she was right bibi couldnt very well go back to the moon the least i could do was share my goddamn turkey with the girl my turkey my gravy my family bibi stayed in the guest room and wouldnt you know it she got along great with my mom better than me the two of them bonded like bears my mother showed her how to cook cranberry sauce and corn bread from scratch and of course how to pull the guts out of a turkey bibi was fascinated watched my mother tear the birds insides out of its ass leaving this hollow pink part in the middle bibi couldnt stop staring at it until finally i said its only a turkey gobble gobble bibi didnt answer just looked at me like id threatened to cut off her head and my mother said angela why dont you help your father clean the garage things went on like this for days my mother acting like bibis her new adopted daughter and treating me like chopped meat then thanksgiving day we sit down for dinner and of course my mother makes us hold hands we do this every year even though were a family that doesnt go to church even though were a family that doesnt pray my mother insists we still believe in god she starts out as usual with thank you lord for the food before us then she goes off on this new part says thank you for bringing this space child into our lives may our civilizations be as peaceful as those of the pilgrims and indians i want to say god mom does everything have to be about bibi instead i grab the nicest piece of turkey and dump gravy all over a little extra in case bibi helps herself to more than her fair share but she doesnt she takes some potatoes and squash a little cranberry sauce and corn bread really small portions my father tries to pass her the turkey dont you like meat he asks my mother says bill maybe shes a vegetarian no bibi says its just that the turkey reminds me of my mother i want to ask bibi what the hell she meant at dinner but she goes to bed early and shuts the door the next day my mother takes us to the mall im thinking she feels bad about the turkey thing because she tells us to buy any outfit we want but bibi doesnt want clothes she goes to the cooking store and buys a turkey baster and now im really confused we go to the food court for lunch we get sbarros chow mein and arbys my moms sucking a slushie she gives bibi a sip says tell me about your mother bibi says i never had a mother no one does she died before i was born its been three months and this chick still hasnt explained the no parents situation so i say whats the deal no parents no fathers how exactly do you make babies my mother gives me this look like im being rude what i say you started it bibi swallows the rest of her egg roll asks you wanna see what here my mother says she lifts her shirt and theres this hole where her belly button should be its the size of a nickel but it scoops in and up like the inside of a funnel she does this right in the middle of the food court people turn and stare my mother tells her to pull down her shirt so its like a vagina i say except you put your own pollen up there push it in deep instead of flushing it what a relief my mother says i thought you couldnt have children i can bibi says but i wont anyone who has a baby ends up dead childbirth used to be risky here my mother says thank god for modern medicine no bibi says procreation is suicide babies cant come out the bottom theres no hole to get out they gnaw through your stomach they eat the other organs on their way out i sit there shocked my fries turning to mush on my tongue my god i say why would anyone want to get pregnant they say its wonderful like being on heroin for nine months the best euphoria there is christ almighty i say thats some mad kind of population control i ask her if shes heard of the onechild law in china but she doesnt answer youre in good hands now my mother says and gives her a hug rocks her back and forth in her arms right there in the middle of the food court like shes five years old i just sit and stare at my food as though i could eat after that my mother drops us off at school on sunday tells bibi if she needs anything to call we carry our laundry upstairs under our folded clothes we find notes from my mother on matching stationery taped to bags of hersheys kisses mine says loved having you home so nice to spend time with you and bibi your moms really cool bibi says she props her turkey baster and note up on her dresser yeah i say i guess now that she likes my mom she wants to be friends with me go figure i curl up on my futon with a piece of leftover corn bread so did you ever think of doing it i ask just to see what pregnancys like dont you think you will eventually why would i do that she says dont you think youre missing out you said its like drugs id try that i dont want to die bibi says thats why im here how does your planet feel about stem cell research i ask they dont understand why things should change yeah its kind of the same in america i say stem cell research is a sin better watch out they might throw you out of the country she empties her chocolate kisses into the porcelain bowl my mother gave her i think youll do it i say thats what the turkey basters for right to stick the pollen all the way up she just stares at me with her black eyes bugging out and for a second i think shes going to throw the bowl at my head either that or shes going to cry but she just turns and walks out of the room she didnt come back that night i wasnt sure where she went and frankly i didnt care bibi didnt speak to me for weeks we gave each other the silent treatment and slammed the door a lot i called my mother and told her i wanted to switch rooms she said angela thats not how we deal with our problems i went to the ra and asked how long it would take to get a new room she said i could file a complaint but room changes were rarely approved it looked like bibi and i were stuck with each other at least for six more months i started thinking i should muster up some sort of reconciliation i thought about apologizing maybe shed apologize for being such a bitch i had a plan was going to do it after my last class the monday before finals i swear i was going to but then i get back to my room and bibis in bed with skippy hes straddling her stomach his schlongs way up in her belly shoved up there real good hes riding her like a madman and bibis arching up so her belly keeps hitting his balls i slammed the door behind me and slept in the lounge who did she think she was having sex with a human boy and one from our floor its not that i liked him he was too pimply for me but shed been lying to me all semester pretending she didnt understand my crushes and now this she loses her virginity to skippy she loses her virginity before me i couldnt believe a jupitarian had beaten me to it still i figured id be the bigger person i figured we should talk the next day i get back from ballet and shes sitting at her desk reading chemistry taking pages of notes pretending like nothing happened so i sit on my futon and sigh this huge sigh hoping shell get the gist we need to talk and when that doesnt work i say if youre going to be one of those kinds of girls we need a system she says skippy told me to put a bra on the door i dont have any is that what you mean yeah thats what i mean i say and then so whats the big idea i thought you were genderless were you lying about the selfgermination i cant get pregnant the human way its got to be my own pollen youre not even the right species a girl who cant get pregnant i say the boys are going to love that she shrugs she doesnt even care that she just lost her cherry it doesnt even faze her so did you orgasm all over good ole skippy i ask was he good can jupitarians even get off youre so stupid she says would a species survive if they couldnt orgasm screw you i say i grab my towel and shower caddy and slam the door behind me emily our nextdoor neighbor is just leaving for class god i say that bibi is such a whore i wish shed warn me before she fucks guys in the room emily says really bibi i didnt know she could we were wondering about that yeah i say shes a little bitch didnt she go to your house emily says i thought you were friends not anymore i pound down the hall as hard as i can though flipflops dont make much noise i slam the bathroom door to let the whole floor know bibis a skank i let the hot water wash over my back slut i say under my breath and then a little louder at least im not a slut like you are i say it as though im talking to someone in the opposite shower stall youre such a slut i say again and imagine bibi across from me i say it once more almost shout it youre the biggest slut in the galaxy and i wish youd go back to the moon im not sure if it was skippy who spread the word or emily it might even have been me proclaiming loudly from the shower stall that day whoever it was my bra ended up on the door an awful lot the next month i left a note on her desk that said stay the hell away from my underwear drawer bibi did a different guy nearly every day i saw one of those little black books on her desk she had all the boys on the hall penciled in there were even some names i didnt know she really had turned into a whore i wondered if they paid her or if she did it for free i missed the old bibi the bibi who forgot her shoes the bibi who studied all night the bibi who didnt know jack shit about boys we didnt talk anymore we just came and went as though we didnt know each other i moved my futon into emilys room and slept there most of the time i wondered what would become of bibi i figured her grades would plummet and shed get kicked out of school but when i got back from christmas break her marks were posted to the wall nine as shed completed a whole year of college in four months im not sure how she kept it up the sex and the studies her second semester she upped her course load to ten they even let her into a graduate class like i said if youre not from america they let you get away with that shit then around february she starts looking greener i wonder if she has that seasonal depression thing then one day i get back to my room and bibis jumping all over her bed shes got the music cranked as high as it goes some godawful broadway crap and shes singing i feel pretty oh so pretty and shes wearing this outfit thats half her clothes and half mine with my sparkly panties around her head what the hells going on i say i thought i told you not to touch my stuff she jumps off her bed and dances this little jig she looks so goddamn ridiculous i have to laugh did you find some solution to jupiters baby problem i ask is your research going well no she says im pregnant youre not i say i thought you couldnt well its not like i had proof it was impossible she says i guess it is im pregnant with a halfhuman baby at this she bursts out laughing pollen puffs out her ears in yellow clouds who i say whose baby is it a boys she says a human boys and then shes surrounded by pollen again she swirls it around with her hands can you believe that are you going to keep it i say if you give birth itll kill you right im giving birth to the first halfhuman halfjupitarian baby ever she screams she rips the panties off her head and twirls them in the air cant you get an abortion those are common here theyll get rid of it youll be fine i dont want an abortion she says i want to be eaten alive i didnt know what to say shed turned ten types of crazy it must have been that euphoria she told me about i began to wish i had a normal human roommate i could take to the abortion clinic so things would be better id never had a friend with a lifethreatening illness only grandfathers and uncles and they died there was nothing i could do bibi had lost it her condition was terminal and she didnt even care in the weeks that followed bibi stopped seeing the boys i moved my futon back into our room and we started talking again i became bibis bodyguard shielding her from all the male scum on the floor boys would stop by and say im here for some alien sex id say fuck off asshole and theyd go away by march bibi had given up her studies no more stem cell research instead she starts holing herself up in our room making sculptures out of dining hall silverware she hangs them from the ceiling where the ants used to be and opens the windows to watch the dead flowers blow in the breeze we start having parties in our room every weekend everyone brings beer and fills up our fridge the ra doesnt give a damn because bibi got her through chemistry first semester and she hopes shell get her through physics next fall i call my mother and tell her were getting along great i tell her bibi is the best my mothers glad were back to being friends says she knew wed work it out i dont mention that bibi is pregnant my mother would be disappointed she wouldnt understand finally bibi and i do everything together like roommates should we order pizza at midnight rate the guys on the hall redecorate the room we move the beds against one wall and scatter huge pillows on the floor bibi finds these red christmas lights on sale at the hardware store and hangs them up she turns them on and lies under her swaying spoons pretends shes watching hot liquid hydrogen swirl around jupiter from the moon she says angela come lie with me we can watch jupiter together better enjoy me while you can pretty soon this baby will eat its way out dont talk like that i say like what she dangles her threetoed feet in the air says its okay its only death by april shes really showing shes got this great green hump of a belly draws faces on it with finger paint and calls it skippy junior every day she plans something different she says lets take skippy junior to the zoo lets take skippy junior ice skating lets take skippy junior for parachute lessons i say bibi ive got classes she says im going to be dead in a few months you can study then so we go ice skating and snorkeling and rent lots of porno and drink slushies bibi does this thing with her turkey baster fills it up with slushie and lets it volcano into her mouth half goes in half gets all over which makes the ants come back but this is kind of great just like before when we hated each other and skippy was a stalker back when bibi studied all the time and didnt care about parties or drinking or boys the new bibi is completely different she dances all over the room begs me to go with her to clubs says you gotta teach me that booty bounce thing she puts on a sparkly shirt and lipstick a short skirt and heels she tapes a paper bow tie to her stomach and says skippy juniors ready so thats what we do we go to the only dance club in town freaky willys and i teach her to dance the american way i show her how to grind like a skanky ho we run into skippy at the club hes there with some guys his acne looks a bit better he buys us both drinks coronas all around youve got to give him credit at least he got us good beer then he wants to dance with bibi he seems genuine enough anyhow theres no way he can get sex with her funnel closed up one of those really bouncy songs comes on with the flashing lights and bibi drags skippy to the dance floor and rocks it out i sit at the bar and watch shes picked up the booty bounce no problem she looks kind of sexy gyrating her tiny hips her shoulders bopping with the music in this light she doesnt even look green skippy puts his hand on her back and tries to shake his pelvis too but you can tell hes not the dancing type later he walks us home and bibi invites him in i go to emilys room until he leaves when hes gone i ask so does he want you back is it his baby its nobodys baby she says on jupiter no one belongs to anyone else that was the last time i saw bibi when i woke up she was gone there was a note on my desk that said thanks for teaching me to dance thanks for sharing your family most of her stuff was still there i assume she went back to jupiter but whos to be sure i dont like to think of other possibilities after that there were lots of policemen and school officials who wanted to know where bibi went i told them i didnt know word got out to the papers skippy came by our room and put a bouquet of weedy flowers by the door he said i really loved her i dont know why she had sex with all those other guys i know i said im sure it was your baby i invited him in we sat on bibis bed real close and it felt better that warmth being next to someone who understood we stayed like that for hours shoulder to shoulder not even talking when it got dark we slid under the covers i was wearing those sparkly panties the ones bibi tossed on the floor that first night the ones that were jupiter skippy slid his hand down the front brushed his fingers against what i imagined to be bibis moon i didnt even mind when he aimed his boner at my belly button i guided it lower and he found the right hole what if she comes back he asked shes gone i said and kissed him hard he moved his hips back and forth and buried his head in my neck my eyes locked on the turkey baster on bibis dresser and i tried to imagine that she had never been here that she had never existed that i had gotten here on my own eliot wrote nancy kress not only is the universe stranger than we imagine it is stranger than we can imagine jbs haldane eliot wrote picture your brain as a room the major functions are like furniture each in its own place and you can move from sofa to chair to ottoman or even lie across more than one piece of furniture at the same time memory is like air in the room dispersed everywhere musical ability is a specific accessory like a vase on the mantle anger is a doberman pinscher halfway out of the door from the kitchen algebra just fell down the heat duct love of your sibling is a water spill that evaporated three weeks ago well maybe not accurate eliot thought and hit delete or maybe too accurate for his asshole english class what kind of writing assignment was explain something important using an extended metaphor he closed his school tablet and paced around the room cold cheerless bereftor was that his own fault partly his own fault he admitted eliot prided himself on selfhonesty he could turn up the heat pick up the pizza boxes open the curtains to the may sunshine he did none of these things cold and cheerless matched bereft and there was nothing to do about bereft well one thing he went to the fireplace cold ashes months old and from the mantel plucked the ceramic pig and threw it as hard as he could onto the stone hearth it shattered into pink shards then he left the apartment and caught the bus to the hospital eliots father had been entered into ononeida psychiatric hospital ten days ago for a religious conversion in which he saw the clear image of zeus on a strawberry toaster pastry ononeida named for an indian tribe that had once occupied marthorn city was accustomed to religious visions and carl tremling was a mathematician a group known for being eccentric ordinarily the hospital would not have admitted him at all but dr tremling had reacted to the toaster pastry with some violence flinging furniture out of the apartment window and sobbing that there was dice being played with the universe after all and that the center would not hold a flung endtable imitation queen anne had hit the mailman who was not seriously injured but was considerably perturbed carl tremling was deemed a danger to others and possibly himself a brain scan had failed to find temporal lobe epilepsy the usual cause of religious visions dr tremling had continued to sob and to fling whatever furniture the orderlies were not quick enough to defend also the psychiatrist on intake duty who had recognized both the einstein and yeats quotes was puzzled over the choice of zeus as the toasterpastry image the usual thing was either christ or the virgin mary the commitment papers had been signed by dr tremlings sister a sweet dim easily frightened woman who had never been comfortable with her brilliant brother but who was fond of eliot she was leaving the hospital as her nephew arrived eliot are you alone yes aunt sue in susan tremling fishers mind eliot was perpetually nine instead of sixteen and should not be riding buses alone how is he the same she sighed only they want tohe wants toeliot are you eating enough you look thinner im fine you shouldnt stay in that apartment alone anything could happen please come and stay with uncle ned and me you know wed love to have you and i hate to think of you alone in that big apartment without if eliot didnt stop her she would start her poor motherless lamb speech what does dad want to do what you said they want tohe wants toso what do the doctors want to do she sighed again i wish i had your memory eliot you get it from poor carl that doctor with the mustache he wants to try some new procedure on carl what new procedure i cant recall the name she fumbled in her purse as if the name might be among the tissues and supermarket coupons was it selective memory obliteration neural rerouting yes the very words your memory eliot i swear your mother would have been so proud of eliot grabbed her arm are you going to let them operate are you why eliot youre hurting me he let go im sorry butyou are going to let them operate arent you aunt sue looked at him she had small eyes of no particular color and a little mouth that was pursing and unpursing in distress but she was a tremling into those small eyes came stubbornness an unthinking but resolute stubbornness and yet somehow murky like a muddy pool over bedrock she said gently i couldnt do that aunt sue carl will come to himself eventually eliot hes had spells before you knowwhy just consider that time he shut himself up in my spare room for six days and wouldnt even come out to eat i had to bring him meals on a tray he was working on his big breakthrough on the topography of knots not only would he not eat he wouldnt even wash i had to air that room out for two days afterward and in february but carl came out of that spell and hell come out of this one too you just wait and see its not the same dont you understand his whole mental construct has been turned upside down thats exactly what he said when he came out of my spare room with those knot numbers she said triumphantly knots but even as a boy carl took fits why i remember when he was just eight years old and he found out that somebody named girdle proved there were things you couldnt prove why that doesnt even make common sense to aunt sue you have to sign the papers allowing this operation no i wont eliot you listen to me i went online last night and read about this memory obligation whatever its new and its dangerous because the doctors dont really know what theyre doing yet in one case after the operation a woman didnt even remember who she was or recognize her own children or anything in another case a man could no longer read andget thishe couldnt relearn how to do it either something had just gone missing in his brain as a result of the operation imagine carl unable to read we cant risk eliot was no longer listening hed known aunt sue all his life she wasnt going to budge he barreled down the hall and rattled the door to the ward which was of course locked an orderly wielding a mop peered at him through the reinforced glass and pantomimed pressing the call button yes said the disembodied voice of a nurse eliot recognized it mary i want to see dr tallman oh eliot im glad you came just now your father is quiet and i dont want to see my father i want to see dr tallman hes not here dear ill just buzz you in mary came out of the nurses station to meet him middleaged kind motherly she radiated the kind of brisk competence that eliot admired and had seen so little of in his own disordered household or at least he would have admired it if it werent for the motherliness she saw him not as the intellectual he knew himself to be but rather as the skinny short floppyhaired kid he seemed to be he was smarter than mary smarter than aunt sue smarter than most of the world so why the hell couldnt the world notice that i want to see dr tallman hes not on the ward dear call him im afraid i cant do that eliot you seem upset i am upset isnt my father going to have smonr because my aunt wouldnt sign the papers motherliness gave way to professionalism you know i cant discuss this with you no one would discuss anything with eliot he didnt count the rational world didnt count not in here eliot glared at mary who gazed calmly back he said ill sign them i will youre underage eliot and your father is non compos mentis did you come to visit hes in the day room but if youre going to upset him it might be better if you chose another time to visit eliot bolted past her and ran into the day room his father was not flinging furniture he slumped inert in a chair staring at the tv which showed a rerun of jeopardy eliot groaned his father had published papers in scientific journals developed algorithms for highresolution space imagery had a promising lead on actually solving the riemann hypothesis he did not watch jeopardy this was the antipsychotic drugs not the real carl tremling everything the hospital was doing was just making the situation worse hey dad hey eliot alex trebek said the tendency of an object in motion to remain in motion or an object at rest to remain at rest unless acted upon by an outside force how are you doing just fine but he frowned only i cant quite there was something something there were a lot of somethings there was rational thought and logical progressions and the need to restore a mans proper intellect someone on the tv said what is inertia zeus dr tremling brought out triumphantly who would have believed all at once his face sagged from underneath like a pie crust cooling who would have believed his face crumpled and he clutched eliots sleeve its real eliot its loose in the world and nothing that i thought was true it was a toaster pastry dad three patients slowly swiveled their heads at eliots raised voice he lowered it listen to me please listen to me the doctors want to do a procedure on you called selective memory obliteration neural rerouting it will remove the memory of the the incident from your mind only aunt sue wheres the pig dr tremling said eliot rocked back and forth with frustration even if aunt sue wont sign the papers if you can seem reasonably lucidin compos mentisthen i asked you to bring the pig its broken dr tremling stared at eliot then he threw back his head and howled at the ceiling two orderlies a nurse and four patients sprang to attention dr tremling rose overcoming the inertia of his drugs and picked up his chair his face was a mask of grief it isnt true nothing i believed is true the universezeusdice eliot shouted it was just a fucking toaster pastry i needed that pig he flung the chair at the wall orderlies rushed forward nurse mary grabbed eliot and hustled him out of the room i told you not to upset him i didnt upset him you did by not giving him what he needs do you know how finely balanced a mathematicians brain is how prone to obsessions already and it needs to be clear toyoure refusing to remove a tumor from his brain your father does not have a brain tumor and you need to leave now mary said hustling him down the hallway a male voice said ill take scientific terms for alex its his brain eliot shouted he meant my brain and he knew it and the knowledge made him even angrier mary got him to the door of the ward keyed in a code to unlock it and waved him through as he stalked off she called after him eliot dear do you have enough money for the bus home eliots parents had met at college where both studied mathematics even though eliots mother was not beautiful there were few girls in the graduate math program and she was sought after by every mathematician with enough social skills to approach her including two of the professors her own social skills lacked coherence but something in carl tremling appealed to her she emailed her bewildered mother there is a boy here i think i like hes interested in nothing but algorithms and pigs carl who had grown up in farm country had a theory that pigs were much smarter than other animals and deserved respect fuming on the bus eliot wondered why his father had wanted the ceramic pig did he have a premonition that in its artificial pink wrinkles he might see hermes god of mathematics aphrodite his dead wife how could his mind have so betrayed carl tremling eliot wanted his father back and in his own mind eliots mind was so much like his fathers everybody said so fuck he said aloud which caused a man to glare at him across the bus aisle and a woman to change her seat embarrassed eliot pulled out his school tablet memory he wrote is a bridge between what you are today and what you were for all the days before that all your life you go back and forth across that bridge extending and reinforcing it you add a new strut you hang flower pots on the railing you lay down kitty litter during icy weather you chase away the kids who are smoking pot on top of the pilings and under the roadway then one day a section of the bridge gives way when that happens it is criminal to not repair it an unrepaired bridge is like a deep pothole on a dark road and two metaphors this was not working and it was due tuesday the man across the aisle was still watching him probably thought that eliot was some sort of gangaffiliated punk well no not that not with his build and clothing a crazy then the man thought eliot might be a guntoting cheerleaderloathing shooter who would court death to kill everybody on the bus perhaps because school shooting was now such a risk what with all the metal detectors and guards and lockdown protocols i am not a shooter eliot silently told the man he was a rationalist and an intellectual and he just wanted his father back whole the way he had been before he got off the bus at his aunt sues building the building was depressing because it was so smug it looked as if nothing bad could ever happen here as long as the stoop was swept clean and the curtains were a bright color and the flower boxes were watered nothing bad wanna bet inside his aunts apartment was even worse her decorating style was countrymystic with wreaths of dried flowers and tapestries of unicorns and small ceramic plaques that said things like let a smile be your umbrella aunt sue i have to tell you things i didnt get a chance to say at the hospital please listen to me of course eliot dont i always almost never but he composed himself and arranged his arguments i was online last night too those two cases you mentioned the man who couldnt read again and the woman who didnt recognize her kids were anomalies selective memory obliteration neural rerouting is new yes but it passed clinical trials and fda approval and it has an eightynine percent success rate with a one percent confidence level of the remaining eleven percent twothirds were neither better nor worse after the operation that leaves only threepointeight percent and when you take into account those with only minor no youre not listening i am listening nobody is going to cut into carls brain but he believes he saw a defunct greek god in a toaster pastry eliot is that so bad its not true well its true that carl saw it anyway or he wouldnt be so upset hell come out of whatever spell hes having about it he always does and anyway i dont understand carls reaction would it be so bad to believe this zeusgod is around thats the part thats not true she shrugged are you so sure you know whats true yes eliot shouted mathematics is true physics is true memory can play us false theres a ton of research on that nobody can be sure if their memories are accurate he stopped no longer sure what he was saying aunt sue said calmly well if memory is playing carl false then hes all the more likely to get over it isnt he no it isnti didnt mean wouldnt you like some walnut cake eliot i baked it fresh this morning hopeless they came from two different planets and shethis kind stupid woman who inexplicably shared onequarter of his genesheld the power in a truly rational world that couldnt have been true creamcheese icing she said brightly and caressed his cheek eliot wrote memory is like a corn stalk corn blight can wreck any entire economy starve an entire nation but it responds to science find the bad gene cut it out replace it with a genetically engineered bt gene that fights blight because it allows the use of strong pesticides and voila memory functions again science triumphs possibly the worst writing he had ever done he hit delete his fathers liquor cabinet still held three inches of scotch eliot poured himself two fingers worth so he could sleep the next morning just as he was leaving to catch the bus for school the hospital called the answer his father said is obvious it wasnt obvious to eliot his father sat in the day room out of his bathrobe and dressed in his ordinary baggy khakis and badlypilled sweater dr tremling had shaved he looked just as he once did and eliot would have felt hopeful if he hadnt felt so bewildered or if the new twitch at the corner of his fathers left eye wasnt beating madly and irregularly as a malfunctioning metronome i did see what i thought i saw his father said carefully i know so in a way that although it defies explanation is so incontrovertible that dad eliot said equally carefullyif only that twitch would stop you cant actually know that for certain surely youre aware that all our minds can play tricks on us that not this time dr tremling said simply i saw it and i know it was true not just an aberration of pastry i know too that mathematics the whole rational underpinning of the universe is also true the dichotomy was upsetting me upsetting him eliot glanced around at the mental hospital the orderlies watchful in the corners of the room the barred window his father had always had a gift for understatement which was in part what had made this whole thing so so upsetting what i failed to see dr tremling said was that this is a gift i have just been handed my lifes work i thought the topography of knots was your lifes work it was yes but now my lifes work is to find the rational and mathematical underpinnings for this new phenomenon for zeus in a toaster pastry the twitch beat faster even more irregularly i concede that it is a big job dad there must be a larger consciousness eliot if so it is a physical entity made up of energy and matter must be a physical entity and a physical entity can be described mathematically possibly through a system that does not yet exist possibly based on nonlocal quantum physics eliot managed to say you arent a quantum physicist i can learn twitch twitch twitch do you remember what werner heisenberg said about belief systems what we observe is not nature itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning i need a new method of questioning to lead toward a new mathematics well thats a theyre letting me have my laptop back with controlled wifi access until i go home have they said when that might be possibly in a few more weeks dr tremling beamed twitching eliot tried to beam too he was getting what hed wantedhis father back home working on mathematics onlya new mathematics his father was not godel or einstein or heisenberg he wasnt even an endowed chair eliot burst out before he knew he was going to say anything theres no evidence for any larger consciousness its mystical wishfulfillment a nonrational delusion theres just no evidence im the evidence son i dont think i actually told you what i experienced he leaned closer involuntarily eliot leaned back it was zeus but it was also odin was christ was oh let me think was isis and sedna and bumba and quetzalcoatl it was all of them and none of them because the images were in my mind of course they were where else could they possibly be but heres the thingthe images are unimportant theyre just metaphors and not very good onesarrows pointing to something that has neither image nor words but just is that thing ishow can i explain thisthe world behind the world didnt you ever feel in childhood that all at once you sort of glimpsed a flash of a great mystery underlying everything a bright meaning to it all i know you did because everybody does then we grow up and lose that but its still there bright and shining as solid as as an end table or a pig i saw it and now i know it exists in a way that goes beyond any need to question its existencethe way i know for instance that prime numbers are infinite its the world beyond the world the space filled with shining light the mystery do you see no well thats because you didnt experience it but if i can find the right mathematics thats a better arrow than verbal metaphors can ever be eliot saw in his fathers eyes the gleam of fanaticism dad he cried in pure anguish but dr tremling only put his hand on eliots knee a startlingly rare gesture of affection and said wait son just wait eliot couldnt wait his english assignment was due by third period which began with the logic of high school scheduling at am no late assignments were accepted his tablet on his knees on the crowded bus eliot wrote memory is not a room or a bridge or a corn stalk with blight memory is not a metaphor because nothing is a metaphor metaphors are constructions of a fanciful imagination not reality in reality everything is what it is and that isor certainly should beenough for anybody the little boy sitting next to him said hey man you hit that thing so hard you gonna break it shut up eliot said get fucked the kid answered but eliot already was dr tremling came home three weeks later he was required to see a therapist three times a week aunt sue bustled over cooked for two days straight and stocked the freezer with meals when eliot and his father sat down to eat dr tremlings eye twitched convulsively meals were the only time they met his father chewed absently and spoke little but then that had always been true the rest of the time he stayed in his study working eliot did not ask on what he didnt want to know everything felt suspended eliot went to school took his ap classes expressed scorn for the jocks and goths who teased him felt superior to his teachers read obsessivelyall normal and yet not one day when his father was at a therapy session eliot slid into dr tremlings study and looked at his notebooks and to the extent he could find them amid such sloppy electronic housekeeping his computer files there didnt seem to be much notation and what there was eliot couldnt follow he wasnt a mathematician after all and his father appeared to have invented a new symbol for something a sort of olympic thunderbolt that seemed to have left and righthanded versions eliot groaned and closed the file only once did eliot ask so hows it going dad its difficult dr tremling said no shit have you had any more uh incidents thats irrelevant son i only needed one but his face twitched harder than ever three weeks after he came home dr tremling gave up he hadnt slept for a few nights and his face sagged like a bloodhounds but he was calm when he said to eliot im going to have the operation you are eliots heart leapt and then inexplicably sank why when his father answered with something of his old precision because there is no mathematics of a larger conscious entity on tuesday at eight in the morning dr tallman certified me able to sign my own papers oh for a long terrible moment eliot thought he had nothing more to say but then he managed im sorry about the pig its not important dr tremling said which should have been the first clue on tuesday eliot rose at am and took a cab to the hospital he sat with his father in preop in a vibrantly and mistakenly orange waiting room during the operation and beside his fathers bed in postop dr tremling recovered well and came home a week later he was quiet subdued when the new term started he resumed teaching at the university he read the professional journals weeded the garden fended off his sister nobody mentioned the incident and dr tremling never did either since hospital tests had verified that it was gone from his memory everything back to normal but not really something had gone missing eliot thoughtsome part of his father that though inarticulate had made his eyes shine at a breakthrough in mathematics that had made him love pigs that had led him in passion to fling bad student problem sets and blockhead professional papers across the room as later he would fling furniture something was definitely missing isnt it wonderful that carl is exactly the way he used to be enthused aunt sue modern medicine is just amazing eliot didnt answer her on the way home from school he got off the bus one stop early he ducked into the safeway as if planning to rob it carrying out his purchase more secretively than hed ever carried out the trojans he never got to use in his room he locked the door opened the grocery boxes and spread out their contents on the bed on the dresser on the desk beside his calculus homework on the computer keyboard when there were no other surfaces left on the notveryclean carpet then hoping he stared at the toaster pastries until his head ached and his eyes crossed from strain eliot wrote metaphor is all we have but the assignment had been due weeks ago and his teacher refused to alter his grade scales alastair reynolds the enemy must die nico stands and waits in the long line sweating under the electricyellow dome of the municipal force field they must die near the recruiting station one of the captives has been wheeled out in a cage the reptile is splayed in a harness stretched like a frog on the dissection table a steady stream of soldiersinwaiting leaves the line jabbing an electroprod through the bars of the cage to a chorus of jeers its about the size of a man and surprisingly androform except for its crested lizard head its stubby tail and the brilliant green shimmer of its scales already theyre flaking off black and charred where the prod touches the reptile was squealing to start with but its slumped and unresponsive now nico turns his head away he just wants the line to move ahead so he can sign up obtain his citzenship credits and get out of here the enemy must die they came in from interstellar darkness unprovoked unleashing systematic destruction on unsuspecting human assets they wiped mankind off mars and blasted earths lunar settlements into radioactive craters they pushed the human explorers back into a huddle of defenses around earth now theyve brought the war to cities and towns to the civilian masses now force shields blister earths surface sustained by fusion plants sunk deep into the crust nicos almost forgotten what its like to look up at the stars but the tide is turning beneath the domes factories assemble the ships and weapons to take the war back to the reptiles chinks are opening in the enemys armour all thats needed now are men and women to do earths bidding one of the recruiting sergeants walks the line handing out iced water and candies he stops and chats to the soldierstobe shaking them by the hand patting them on the back hes a thirtymission veteran been twice as far out as the orbit of the moon he lost an arm but the new ones growing back nicely budding out from the stump like a babys trying to punch its way out of him theyll look after you too he says holding out a bottle of water whats the catch nico asks there isnt one the sergeant says we give you citizenship and enough toys to take apart a planet then you go out there and kill as many of those scaly green bastards as you can sounds good to me nico says up in the fortified holdfast of sentinel station somethings different the tech isnt like the equipment nico saw at the recruiting station or in basic training back on earth its heavier nastier capable of doing more damage which would be reassuring if it wasnt for one troubling fact earth has better ships guns and armour than anyone down there has heard aboutbut then so do the reptiles turns out theyre not exactly reptiles either not that nico cares much coldblooded or not they still attacked without provocation the six months of inorbit training at sentinel station are tough half the kids fall by the wayside nicos come through maybe not top of his class but somewhere near it he can handle the powerarmour the tactical weapons hes ready to be shown to his ship its not quite what he was expecting its a long sleek skullgrey shark of a machine that goes fasterthanlight top secret of course says the instructor weve been using it for interstellar intelligence gathering and resourceacquistion how long have we had this the instructor grins before you were born i thought we never had any ambitions beyond mars says nico what about it but the reptiles came in unprovoked they said if we were already out there they haul him out after a couple of days in the coolbox any more of that kind of questioning and hell be sent back home with most of his memories scrubbed so nico decides its not his problem hes got his gun hes got his armour and now hes got his ride who cares who started the damned thing the ftl transport snaps back into normal space around some other star heading for a blue gas giant and an outpost that used to be a moon the place bristles with longrange sensors and the belligerent spines of antiship railguns chokepoint will be nicos home for the next year forget your armour certification your weapons rating says the new instructor a human head sticking out of an upright black lifesupport cylinder now its time to get real a wall slides back to reveal a hall of headless corpses rank on rank of them suspended in green preservative you dont need bodies where youre going you just need brains she says you can collect your bodies on the way back home when youve completed your tour well look after them so they strip nico down to little more than a head and a nervous system and plug whats left into a tiny hyperagile fighter the battle lines are being drawn far beyond conventional ftl now the war against the reptiles will be won and lost in the ndimensional tangle of interconnected wormhole pathways wired into the fighter nico feels like a god with armageddon at his fingertipsnot that hes really got fingertips he doesnt feel much like nico any more he cracks a wry smile at chokepoints new arrivals gawping at the bodies in the tanks his old memories are still in there somewhere but theyre buried under a luminous welter of tactical programming frankly he doesnt miss them theyre not fighting the reptiles any more turns out they were just the organic puppets of an implacable machinebased intelligence the puppetmasters are faster and smarter and their strategic ambitions arent clear but it doesnt concern thingthatwasoncenico after all its not like machines cant die strategic command sends him deeper hes forwarded to an artificial construct actually embedded in the tangle floating on a semistable node like a dark thrombosis nicos past caring where the station lies in relation to real space no one fully human can get this farthe station is staffed by bottled brains and brooding artificial intelligences with a jolt thingthatwasoncenico realises that he doesnt mind their company at least theyve got their priorities right at the station thingthatwasoncenico learns that a new offensive has opened up against the puppetmasters even further into the tangle its harder to reach so again he must be remade his living mind is swamped by tiny machines who build a shining scaffold around the vulnerable architecture of his meat brain the silvery spikes and struts mesh into a fighter no larger than a drum of oil he doesnt think much about his old body back at chokepoint not any more the puppetmasters are just a decoy tactical analysis reveals them to be an intrusion into the wormhole tangle from what can only be described as an adjunct dimension the focus of the military effort shifts again now the organic matter at the core of thingthatwasoncenicos cybernetic mind is totally obsolete he cant place the exact moment when he stopped thinking with meat and started thinking with machinery and hes not even sure it matters now as an organism he was pinned like a squashed moth between two pages in the book of existence as a machine he can be endlessly abstracted simulated unto the seventh simulation encoded and pulsed across the realitygap ready to kill this heor rather itdoes and for a little while there is death and glory up through the reality stack level by level by now its not just machines versus machines its machines mapped into byzantine ndimensional spaces machines as ghosts of machines the terms of engagement have become so abstractso frankly highermathematicalthat the conflict is more like a philosophical dialogue a debate between protagonists who agree on almost everything except the most trifling hairsplitting details and yet it must still be to the deaththe proliferation of one selfreplicating pandimensional class of entities is still at the expense of the other when did it begin where did it begin why such questions simply arent relevant or even answerable anymore all that matters is that there is an adversary and the adversary must be destroyed eventuallyalthough even the notion of times passing is now distinctly mootthe war turns orthogonal the reality stack is itself but one compacted laminate of something larger so the warring entities traverse mindwrenching chasms of metadimensional structure their minds in constant selfevolving flux as the bedrock of reality shifts and squirms beneath them and at last the shape of the enemy becomes clear the enemy is vast the enemy is inexorably slow as its peripheries are mapped it gradually emerges that the enemy is a class of intellect that the machines barely have the tools to recognise let alone understand its organic it is multiform and multivariant it hasnt been engineered or designed its messy and contingent originating from the surface of a structure a highermathematical object its but one of several drifting on geodesic trajectories through what might loosely be termed space arcane fluids slosh around on the surface of this object and the whole thing is gloved in a kind of gas the enemy requires technology not just to sustain itself but to propagate its warlike ambitions triumph over the organic is a cosmic destiny the machines have been pursuing now through countless instantiations but to kill the enemy now without probing deeper into its nature would be both inefficient and unsubtle it would waste machines that could be spared if the enemys weaknesses were better understood and what better way to probe those weaknesses than to create another kind of living thing an army of puppet organisms and send that army into battle the puppets may not win but they will force the adversary to stretch itself to expose aspects of itself now hidden and so they are sent volunteers technicallyalthough the concept of volunteer implies a straightforward altruism difficult to correlate with the workings of the machines multidimensional decisionmaking matrices the flesh is grown in huge hangars full of glowing green vats then shaped into organisms similar but not identical to the enemy into those vast mindless bodies are decanted the thin gruellike remains of compactified machine intellects its not really anything the machines would recognise as intelligence but it gets the job done memories kindle briefly back to life as compactification processes shuffle through ancient data untouched for subjective millenia searching for anything that might offer a strategic advantage among the fleeting sensations the flickering visions one of the machines recalls standing in line under an electricyellow sky waiting for something it hears the crackle of an electroprod smells the black char of burning tissue the machine hesitates for a moment then deletes the memory its new greenscaled puppet body is ready it has work to do the enemy must die about the contributors stephen baxter was born in liverpool england with a background in math and engineering he is the author
