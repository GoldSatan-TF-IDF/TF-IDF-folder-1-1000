them to be compared to the magnitude of their subjectsi have tried to set forth as clearly as i can certain fundamental principles together with their practical application to the life of our time some of these principles were stated more briefly and technically in my larger studies of sex others were therein implied but only to be read between the lines here i have expressed them in simple language and with some detail it is my hope that in this way they may more surely come into the hands of young people youths and girls at the period of adolescence who have been present to my thoughts in all the studies i have written of sex because i was myself of that age when i first vaguely planned them i would prefer to leave to their judgment the question as to whether this book is suitable to be placed in the hands of older people it might only give them pain it is in youth that the questions of mature age can alone be settled if they ever are to be settled and unless we begin to think about adult problems when we are young all our thinking is likely to be in vain there are but few people who are able when youth is over either on the one hand to remould themselves nearer to those facts of nature and of society they failed to perceive or had not the courage to accept when they were young or on the other hand to mould the facts of the exterior world nearer to those of their own true interior world one hesitates to bring home to them too keenly what they have missed in life yet let us remember even for those who have missed most there always remains the fortifying and consoling thought that they may at least help to make the world better for those who come after them and the possibilities of human adjustment easier for others than it has been for themselves they must still remain true to their own traditions we could not wish it to be otherwise the art of making love and the art of being virtuoustwo aspects of the great art of living that are rightly regarded harmonious and not at varianceremain indeed when we cease to misunderstand them essentially the same in all ages and among all peoples yet always and everywhere little modifications become necessary little yet like so many little things immense in their significance and results in this way if we are really alive we flexibly adjust ourselves to the world in which we find ourselves and in so doing simultaneously adjust to ourselves that everchanging world everchanging though its changes are within such narrow limits that it yet remains substantially the same it is with such modification that we

century of the child when however we turn to the books of ellen key who has most largely and sympathetically taken this point of view one asks oneself whether after all the childs century has brought much to the child ellen key points out with truth that even in our century parents may for the most part be divided into two classes those who act as if their children existed only for their benefit and those who act as if they existed only for their childrens benefit the results she adds being alike deplorable for the first group of parents tyrannise over the child seek to destroy its individuality exercise an arbitrary discipline too spasmodic to have any of the good effects of discipline and would model him into a copy of themselves though really she adds it ought to pain them very much to see themselves exactly copied the second group of parents may wish to model their children not after themselves but after their ideals yet they differ chiefly from the first class by their overindulgence by their anxiety to pamper the child by yielding to all his caprices and artificially protecting him from the natural results of those caprices so that instead of learning freedom he has merely acquired selfwill these parents do not indeed tyrannise over their children but they do worse they train their children to be tyrants against these two tendencies of our century ellen key declares her own alpha and omega of the art of education try to leave the child in peace live your own life beautifully nobly temperately and in so living you will sufficiently teach your children to live it is not my purpose here to consider how far this conception of the duty of parents towards children is justified and whether or not peace is the best preparation for a world in which struggle dominates all these questions about education are rather idle there are endless theories of education but no agreement concerning the value of any of them and the whole question of education remains open i am here concerned less with the duty of parents in relation to their children than with the duty of children in relation to their parents and that means that i am not concerned with young children to whom that duty still presents no serious problems since they have not yet developed a personality with selfconscious individual needs certainly the one attitude must condition the other attitude the reaction of children against their parents is the necessary result of the parents action so that we have to pay some attention to the character of parental action we cannot expect to find any coherent or uniform action on the part of parents but there have been at different historical periods different general tendencies in the attitude of parents towards their children thus if we go back four or five centuries in english social history we seem to find a general attitude which scarcely corresponds exactly to either of ellen keys two groups it seems usually to have been compounded of severity and independence children were first strictly compelled to go their parents way and then thrust off to their own way there seems a certain hardness in this method yet it is doubtful whether it can fairly be regarded as more unreasonable than either of the two modern methods deplored by ellen key on the contrary it had points for admiration it was primarily a discipline but it was regarded as any fortifying discipline should be regarded as a preparation for freedom and it is precisely there that the more timid and clinging modern way seems to fail we clearly see the old method at work in the chief source of knowledge concerning old english domestic life the paston letters here we find that at an early age the sons of knights and gentlemen were sent to serve in the houses of other gentlemen it was here that their education really took place an education not in book knowledge but in knowledge of life such education was considered so necessary for a youth that a father who kept his sons at home was regarded as negligent of his duty to his family a knowledge of the world was a necessary part indeed the chief part of a youths training for life the remarkable thing is that this applied also to a large extent to the daughters they realised in those days what is only beginning to be realised in ours that after all women live in the world just as much though differently as men live in the world and that it is quite as necessary for the girl as for the boy to be trained to the meaning of life margaret paston towards the end of the fifteenth century sent her daughter ann to live in the house of a gentleman who a little later found that he could not keep her as he was purposing to decrease the size of his household the mother writes to her son i shall be fain to send for her and with me she shall but lose her time and without she be the better occupied she shall oftentimes move me and put me to great unquietness remember what labour i had with your sister therefore do your best to help her forth as a result it was planned to send her to a relatives house in london this was illustrated in england when women first began to serve on juries the pretext was frequently broughtforward that there are certain kinds of cases and of evidence that do not concern women or that women ought not to hear the pretext would have been more plausible if it had also been argued that there are certain kinds of cases and of evidence that men ought not to hear as a matter of fact whatever frontier there may be in these matters is not of a sexual kind everything that concerns men ultimately concerns women and everything that concerns women ultimately concerns men neither women nor men are entitled to claim dispensation it is evident that in the fifteenth century in england there was a wide prevalence of this method of education which in france a century later was still regarded as desirable by montaigne his reason for it is worth noting children should be educated away from home he remarks in order to acquire hardness for the parents will be too tender to them it is an opinion accepted by all that it is not right to bring up children in their parents laps for natural love softens and relaxes even the wisest montaigne essais bk i ch in old france indeed the conditions seem similar to those in england the great seriocomic novel of antoine de la salle petit jean de saintré shows us in detail the education and the adventures which certainly involved a very early introduction to life of a page in a great house in the fifteenth century we must not take everything in this fine comedy too solemnly but in the fourteenth century book of the knight of the tourlandry we may be sure that we have at its best the then prevailing view of the relation of a father to his tenderly loved daughters of harshness and rigour in the relationship it is not easy to find traces in this lengthy and elaborate book of paternal counsels but it is clear that the father takes seriously the right of a daughter to govern herself and to decide for herself between right and wrong it is his object he tells his girls to enable them to govern themselves in this task he assumes that they are entitled to full knowledge and we feel that he is not instructing them in the mysteries of that knowledge he is taking for granted in the advice he gives and the stories he tells them that his young and small daughters not poor things overburdened with experience already possess the most precise knowledge of the intimate facts of life and that he may tell them without turning a hair the most outrageous incidents of debauchery life already lies naked before them that he assumes he is not imparting knowledge he is giving good counsel if the knight went to an extreme in his assumption of his daughters knowledge modern fathers often go to the opposite and more foolish extreme of assuming in their daughters an ignorance that would be dangerous even if it really existed in a young girls diary translated from the german by eden and cedar paul a work that is highly instructive for parents and ought to be painful for many we find the diarist noting at the age of thirteen that she and a girl friend of about the same age overheard the father of one of themboth well brought up and carefully protected one catholic and the other protestantreferring to those innocent children we did laugh so we and innocent children what our fathers really think of us we innocent at dinner we did not dare look at one another or we should have exploded it need scarcely be added that at the same time they were more innocent than they knew it is clear that this kind of education and this attitude towards children must be regarded as the outcome of the whole mediæval method of life in a state of society where roughness and violence though not as we sometimes assume chronic were yet always liable to be manifested it was necessary for every man and woman to be able to face the crudest facts of the world and to be able to maintain his or her own rights against them the education that best secured that strength and independence was the best education and it necessarily involved an element of hardness we must go back earlier than montaignes day when the conditions were becoming mitigated to see the system working in all its vigour the lady of the day of the early thirteenth century has been well described by luchaire in his scholarly study of french society in the time of philip augustus she was he tells us as indeed she had been in the preceding feudal centuries often what we should nowadays call a virago of violent temperament with vivid passions broken in from childhood to all physical exercises sharing the pleasures and dangers of the knights around her feudal life fertile in surprises and in risks demanded even in women a vigorous temper of soul and body a masculine air and habits also that were almost virile she accompanied her father or her husband to the chase while in wartime if she became a widow or if her husband was away at the crusades she was ready if necessary to direct the defences of the lordship and in peace time she was not afraid of the longest and most dangerous pilgrimages she might even go to the crusades on her own account and if circumstances required conduct a war to come out victoriously we may imagine the robust kind of education required to produce people of this quality but as regards the precise wayin which parents conducted that education we have as luchaire admits little precise knowledge it is for the most part only indirectly by reading between the lines that we glean something as to what it was considered befitting to inculcate in a good household and as what we thus learn is mostly from the writings of churchmen it is doubtless a little onesided thus adam de perseigne an ecclesiastic writes to the countess du perche to advise her how to live in a christian manner he counsels her to abstain from playing games of chance and chess not to take pleasure in the indecent farces of actors and to be moderate in dress then as ever preachers expressed their horror of the ruinous extravagance of women their false hair their rouge and their dresses that were too long or too short they also reprobated their love of flirtation it was however in those days a young girls recognised duty when a knight arrived in the household to exercise the rites of hospitality to disarm him give him his bath and if necessary massage him to help him to go to sleep it is not surprising that the young girl sometimes made love to the knight under these circumstances nor is it surprising that he engaged in an arduous life and trained to disdain feminine attractions often failed to respond it is easy to understand how this state of things gradually became transformed into the considerably different position of parents and child we have known which doubtless attained its climax nearly a century ago feudal conditions with the large households so well adapted to act as seminaries for youth began to decay and as education in such seminaries must have led to frequent mischances both for youths and maidens who enjoyed the opportunities of education there the regret for their disappearance may often have been tempered for parents schools colleges and universities began to spring up and develop for one sex while for the other home life grew more intimate and domestic ties closer montaignes warning against the undue tenderness of a narrow family life no longer seemed reasonable and the family became more selfcentred and more enclosed beneath this and more profoundly influential there was a general softening in social respects and a greater expansiveness of affectional relationships in reality or in seeming within the home compensating it may be the more diffused social feeling within a group which characterised the previous period so was cultivated that undue tenderness deplored by montaigne which we now regard as almost normal in family life and solemnly label if we happen to be psychoanalysts the oedipuscomplex or the electracomplex sexual love is closely related to parental love the tender emotion which is an intimate part of parental love is also an intimate part of sexual love and two emotions which are each closely related to a third emotion cannot fail to become often closely associated to each other with a little thought we might guess beforehand even while still in complete ignorance of the matter that there could not fail to be frequently a sexual tinge in the affection of a father for his daughter of a mother for her son of a son for his mother or a daughter for her father needless to say that does not mean that there is present any physical desire of sex in the narrow sense that would be a perversity and a rare perversity we are here on another plane than that of crude physical desire and are moving within the sphere of the emotions but such emotions are often strong and all the stronger because conscious of their own absolute rectitude and often masked under the shape of duty yet when prolonged beyond the age of childhood they tend to become a clog on development and a hindrance to a wholesome life the child who cherishes such emotion is likely to suffer infantile arrest of development and the parent who is so selfish as to continue to expend such tenderness on a child who has passed the age of childhood or to demand it is guilty of a serious offence against that child that the intimate family life which sometimes resultedespecially when as frequently happened the seeming mutual devotion was also realmight often be regarded as beautiful and almost ideal it has been customary to repeat with an emphasis that in the end has even become nauseous for it was usually overlooked that the selfcentred and enclosed family even when the mutual affection of its members was real enough to bear all examination could scarcely be more than partially beautiful and could never be ideal for the family only represents one aspect however important an aspect of a human beings functions and activities he cannot she cannot be divorced from the life of the social group and a life is beautiful and ideal or the reverse only when we have taken into our consideration the social as well as the family relationship when the family claims to prevent the free association of an adult member of it with the larger social organisation it is claiming that the part is greater than the whole and such a claim cannot fail to be morbid and mischievous the oldworld method of treating children we know has long ago been displaced as containing an element of harsh tyranny but it was not perceived and it seems indeed not even yet to be generally recognised that the system which replaced it and is only now beginning to pass away involved another and more subtle tyranny the more potent because not seemingly harsh parents no longer whipped their children even when grown up or put them in seclusion or exercised physical force upon them after they had passed childhood they felt that that would not be in harmony with thesocial customs of a world in which ancient feudal notions were dead but they merely replaced the external compulsion by an internal compulsion which was much more effective it was based on the moral assumption of claims and duties which were rarely formulated because parents found it quite easy and pleasant to avoid formulating them and children on the rare occasions when they formulated them usually felt a sense of guilt in challenging their validity it was in the nineteenth century that this state of things reached its full development the sons of the family were usually able as they grew up to escape and elude it although they thereby often created an undesirable divorce from the home and often suffered as well as inflicted much pain in tearing themselves loose from the spiritual bondsespecially perhaps in matters of religionwoven by long tradition to bind them to their parents it was on the daughters that the chief stress fell for the working class indeed there was often the possibility of escape into hard labour if only that of marriage but such escape was not possible immediately or at all for a large number during the nineteenth century many had been so carefully enclosed in invisible cages they had been so well drilled in the reticences and the duties and the subserviences that their parents silently demanded of them that we can never know all the tragedies that took place in exceptional cases indeed they gave a sign when they possessed unusual power of intellect or unusual power of character and will they succeeded in breaking loose from their cages or at least in giving expression to themselves this is seen in the stories of nearly all the women eminent in life and literature during the nineteenth century from the days of mary wollstonecraft onwards the brontës almost yet not quite strangled by the fetters placed upon them by their stern and narrowminded father and enabled to attain the full stature of their genius only by that brief sojourn in brussels are representative elizabeth barrett chained to a couch of invalidism under the eyes of an imperiously affectionate father until with robert brownings aid she secretly eloped into the open air of freedom and health and so attained complete literary expression is a typical figure it is only because we recognise that she is a typical figure among the women who attained distinction that we are able to guess at the vast number of mute inglorious elizabeth barretts who were never able to escape by their own efforts and never found a browning to aid them to escape it is sometimes said that those days are long past and that young women in all the countries which we are pleased to called civilised are now emancipated indeed rather too much emancipated critics come forward to complain of their undue freedom of their irreverent familiarity to their parents of their language of their habits but there were critics who said the very same things in almost the same words of the grandmothers of these girls these incompetent critics are as ignorant of the social history of the past as they are of the social significance of the history of the present we read in once a week of sixty years ago th august the very period when the domestic conditions of girls were the most oppressive in the sense here understood that these same critics were about at that time and as shocked as they are now at the young ladies who talk of awful swells and deuced bores who smoke and venture upon free discourse and try to be like men the writer of this anonymous article who was really i judge from internal evidence so distinguished and so serious a woman as harriet martineau duly snubs these critics pointing out that such accusations are at least as old as addison and horace walpole she remarks that there have no doubt been socalled fast young ladies in every age varying their doings and sayings according to the fopperies of the time the question as she pertinently concludes is as indeed it still remains today have we more than the average proportion i do not know nor today do we know but while today as ever before we have a certain proportion of these emancipated girls and while today as perhaps never before we are able to understand that they have an element of reason on their side it would be a mistake to suppose that they are more than exceptions the majority are unable and not even anxious to attain this lighthearted social emancipation for the majority even though they are workers the anciently subtle ties of the home are still as they should be an element of natural piety and also as they should not be clinging fetters which impede individuality and destroy personal initiative we all know so many happy homes beneath whose calm surface this process is working out the parents are deeply attached to their children who still remain children to them even when they are grown up they wish to guide them and mould them and cherish them to protect them from the world to enjoy their society and their aid and they expect that their children shall continue indefinitely to remain children the children on their side remain and always will remain tenderly attached to their parents and it would really pain them to feel that they are harbouring any unwillingness to stay in the home even after they have grown up so long as their parents need their attention it is of course the daughters who are thus expected to remain in the home and who feel this compunction about leaving it it seems to usalthough as we have seen so unlike the attitude of former daysa natural beautiful and rightful feeling on both sidesyet in the result all sorts of evils tend to ensue the parents often take as their moral right the services which should only be accepted if accepted at all as the offering of love and gratitude and even reach a degree of domineering selfishness in which they refuse to believe that their children have any adult rights of their own absorbing and drying up that physical and spiritual lifeblood of their offspring which it is the parents part in nature to feed if the children are willing there is nothing to mitigate this process if they are unwilling the result is often a disastrous conflict their time and energy are not their own their tastes are criticised and so far as possible crushed their political ideas if they have any are treated as pernicious andwhich is often on both sides the most painful of alldifferences in religious belief lead to bitter controversy and humiliating recrimination such differences in outlook between youth and age are natural and inevitable and right the parents themselves though they may have forgotten it often in youth similarly revolted against the cherished doctrines of their own parents it has ever been so the only difference being that today probably the opportunities for variation are greater so it comes about that what james hinton said half a century ago is often true today our happy christian homes are the real dark places of the earth it is evident that the problem of the relation of the child to the parent is still incompletely solved even in what we consider our highest civilisation there is here needed an art in which those who have to exercise it can scarcely possess all the necessary skill and experience among trees and birds and beasts the art is surer because it is exercised unconsciously on the foundation of a large tradition in which failure meant death in the common procreative profusion of those forms of life the frequent death of the young was a matter of little concern but biologically there was never any sacrifice of the offspring to the wellbeing of the parents whenever sacrifice is called for it is the parents who are sacrificed to their offspring in our superior human civilisation in which quantity ever tends to give place to quality the higher value of the individual involves an effort to avoid sacrifice which sometimes proves worse than abortive an avian philosopher would be unlikely to feel called upon to denounce nests as the dark places of the earth and in laying down our human moral laws we have always to be aware of forgetting the fundamental biological relationship of parent and child to which all such moral laws must conform to some wouldbe parents that necessity may seem hard in such a case it is well for them to remember that there is no need to become parents and that we live in an age when it is not difficult to avoid becoming a parent the world is not dying for lack of parents on the contrary we have far too many of themignorant parents silly parents unwilling parents undesirable parentsand those who aspire to the high dignity of creating the future race let them be as few as they willand perhaps at the present time the fewer the bettermust not refuse the responsibilities of that position its pains as well as its joys in our human world as we know the moral duties laid upon usthe duties in which if we fail we become outcasts in our own eyes or in those of others or in bothare of three kinds the duties to oneself the duties to the small circle of those we love and the duties to the larger circle of mankind to which ultimately we belong since out of it we proceed and to it we owe all that we are there are no maxims there is only an art and a difficult art to harmonise duties which must often conflict we have to be true to all the motives that sanctify our lives to that extent george eliots maggie tulliver was undoubtedly right but the renunciation of the self is not the routine solution of every conflict any more than is the absolute failure to renounce in a certain sense the duty towards the self comes before all others because it is the condition on which duties towards others possess any significance and worth in that sense it is true according to the familiar saying of shakespearethough it was only polonius the man of maxims who voiced itthat one cannot be true to others unless one is first true to oneself and that one can know nothing of giving aught that is worthy to give unless one also knows how to take we see that the problem of the place of parents in life after their function of parenthood has been adequately fulfilled a problem which offers no difficulties among most forms of life has been found hard to solve by man at some places and periods it has been considered most merciful to put them to death at others they have been almost or quite deified and allowed to regulate the whole lives of their descendants thus in new caledonia aged parents it is said by mrs hadfield were formerly taken up to a high mountain and left with enough food to last a few days there was at the same time great regard for the aged as also among the hottentots who asked can you see a parent or a relative shaking and freezing under a cold dreary heavy useless old age and not think in pity of them of putting an end to their misery it was generally the opinion of the parents themselves but in some countries the parents have dominated and overawed their children to the time of their natural death and even beyond up to the point of ancestor worship as in china where no man of any age can act for himself in the chief matters of life during his parents lifetime and to some extent in ancient rome whence an influence in this direction which still exists in the laws and customs of france both extremes have proved compatible with a beautifully human life to steer midway between them seems today how ever the wisestcourse there ought to be no reason and under happy conditions there is no reason why the relationship between parent and child as one of mutual affection and care should ever cease to exist but that the relationship should continue to exist as a tie is unnatural and tends to be harmful at a certain stage in the development of the child the physical tie with the parent is severed and the umbilical cord cut at a later stage in development when puberty is attained and adolescence is feeling its way towards a complete adult maturity the spiritual tie must be severed it is absolutely essential that the young spirit should begin to essay its own wings if its energy is not equal to this adventure then it is the part of a truly loving parent to push it over the edge of the nest of course there are dangers and risks but the worst dangers and risks come of the failure to adventure of the refusal to face the tasks of the world and to assume the full function of life all that freud has told of the paralysing and maiming influence of infantile arrest or regression is here profitable to consider in order moreover that the relationship between parents and children may retain its early beauty and love it is essential that it shall adapt itself to adult conditions and the absence of ties so rendered necessary otherwise there is little likelihood of anything but friction and pain on one side or the other and perhaps on both sides varying customs of different peoples in this matter are set forth by westermarck the origin and the development of the moral ideas ch xxv the parents have not only to train their children it is of at least equal importance that they should train themselves it is desirable that children as they grow up should be alive to this necessity and consciously assist in the process since they are in closer touch with a new world of activities to which their more lethargic parents are often blind and deaf for every fresh stage in our lives we need a fresh education and there is no stage for which so little educational preparation is made as that which follows the reproductive period yet at no timeespecially in women who present all the various stages of the sexual life in so emphatic a formwould education be more valuable the great burden of reproduction with all its absorbing responsibilities has suddenly been lifted at the same time the perpetually recurring rhythm of physical sex manifestations so often disturbing in its effect finally ceases with that cessation very often after a brief period of perturbation there is an increase both in physical and mental energy yet too often all that one can see is that a vacuum has been created and that there is nothing to fill it the result is that the motherfor it is most often of the mother that complaint is madedevotes her own new found energies to the neverending task of hampering and crushing her childrens developing energies how many mothers there are who bring to our minds that ancient and almost inspired statement concerning those for whom satan finds some mischief still they are wasting worse than wasting energies that might be profitably applied to all sorts of social service in the world there is nothing that is so much needed as the maternal in politics or in all sorts of nonpolitical channels of social service and none can be better fitted for such service than those who have had an actual experience of motherhood and acquired the varied knowledge that such experience should give there are numberless other ways besides social service in which mothers who have passed the age of forty providing they possess the necessary aptitudes can more profitably apply themselves than in hampering or pampering their adult children it is by wisely cultivating their activities in a larger sphere that women whose chief duties in the narrower domestic sphere are over may better ensure their own happiness and the welfare of others than either by fretting and obstructing or by worrying over their own children who are no longer children it is quite true that the children may go astray even when they have ceased to be children but the time to implant the seeds of virtue the time to convey a knowledge of life was when they were small if it was done well it only remains to exercise faith and trust if it was done ill nothing done later will compensate for it is merely foolish for a mother who could not educate her children when they were small to imagine that she is able to educate them when they are big so it is that the problem of the attitude of the child to its parents circles round again to that of the parents to the child the wise parent realises that childhood is simply a preparation for the free activities of later life that the parents exist in order to equip children for life and not to shelter and protect them from the world into which they must be cast education whatever else it should or should not be must be an inoculation against the poisons of life and an adequate equipment in knowledge and skill for meeting the chances of life beyond that and no doubt in the largest part it is a natural growth and takes place of itselfchapter ii the meaning of purity i we live in a world in which as we nowadays begin to realise we find two antagonistic streams of traditional platitude concerning the question of sexual purity both flowing from the far past the people who embody one of these streams of tradition basing themselves on oldfashioned physiology assume though they may not always assert that the sexual products are excretions to be dealt with summarily like other excretions that is an ancient view and it was accepted by such wise philosophers of old times as montaigne and sir thomas more it had moreover the hearty support of so eminent a theological authority as luther who on this ground preached early marriage to men and women alike it is still a popular view sometimes expressed in the crudest terms and often by people who not following luthers example use it to defend prostitution though they generally exclude women from its operation as a sex to whom it fails to apply and by whom it is not required but on the other hand we have another stream of platitude on this side there is usually little attempt either to deny or to affirm the theory of the opposing party though they would contradict its conclusions their theory if they have one would usually seem to be that sexual activity is a response to stimulation from without or from within so that if there is no stimulation there will be no sexual manifestation they would preach they tell us a strenuous ideal they would set up a wholesome dictate of hygiene the formula put forward on this basis usually runs continence is not only harmless but beneficial it is a formula which in one form or another has received apparently enthusiastic approval in many quarters even from distinguished physicians we need not be surprised a proposition so large and general is not easy to deny and is still more difficult to reverse therefore it proves welcome to the peopleespecially the people occupying public and professional positionswho wish to find the path of least resistance under pressure of a vigorous section of public opinion yet in its vagueness the proposition is a little disingenuous it condescends to no definitions and no qualifications it fails even to make clear how it is to be reconciled with any enthusiastic approval of marriage for if continence is beautiful how can marriage make it cease to be so both these streams of feeling it may be noted sprang from a common source far back in the primitive human world all the emanations of the human body all the spontaneous manifestations of its activities were mysterious and ominous to early man pregnant with terror unless met with immense precautions and surrounded by careful ritual the manifestations of sex were the least intelligible and the most spontaneous therefore the things of sex were those that most lent themselves to feelings of horror and awe of impurity and of purity they seemed so highly charged with magic potency that there were no things that men more sought to avoid yet none to which they were impelled to give more thought the manifold echoes of that primitive conception of sex and all the violent reactions that were thus evolved and eventually bound up with the original impulse compose the streams of tradition that feed our modern world in this matter and determine the ideas of purity that surround us at the present day the crude theory of the sexual impulse held on one side and the ignorant rejection of theory altogether on the other side are beginning to be seen as both alike unjustified we begin to find the grounds for a sounder theory not indeed that the problems of sex which go so deeply into the whole personal and social life can ever be settled exclusively upon physiological grounds but we have done much to prepare even the loftiest building of love when we have attained a clear view of its biological basis the progress of chemicophysiological research during recent years has now brought us to new ground for our building indeed the image might well be changed altogether and it might be said that science has entirely transferred the drama of reproduction to a new stage with new actors therewith the immense emphasis placed on excretion and the inevitable reaction that emphasis aroused both alike disappear the sexual protagonists are no longer at the surface but within the most secret recesses of the organism and they appear to science under the name of hormones or internal secretions always at work within and never themselves condescending to appear at all those products of the sexual glands which in both sexes are cast out of the body and at an immature stage of knowledge appeared to be excretions are of primary reproductive importance but as regards the sexual constitution of the individual they are of far less importance than theinternal secretions of these very same glands it is however by no means only the specifically sexual glands which thus exert a sexual influence within the organism other glands in the brain the throat and the abdomensuch as the thyroid and the adrenalsare also elaborating fermentative secretions to throw into the system their mutual play is so elaborate that it is only beginning to be understood some internal secretions stimulate others inhibit and the same secretions may under different conditions do either this fact is the source of many degrees and varieties of energy and formative power in the organism taken altogether the internal secretions are the forces which build up the mans and womans distinctively sexual constitution the special disposition and growth of hair the relative development of breasts and pelvis the characteristic differences in motor activity the varying emotional desires and needs it is in the complex play of these secretions that we now seek the explanation of all the peculiarities of sexual constitution imperfect or onesided physical and psychic development the various approximations of the male to female bodily and emotional disposition of the female to the male all the numerous gradations that occur naturally as we now see between the complete man and the complete woman when we turn the light of this new conception on to our old ideas of purityto the virtue or the vice accordingly as we may have been pleased to consider it of sexual abstinencewe begin to see that those ideas need radical revision they appear in a new light their whole meaning is changed no doubt it may be said they never had the validity they appeared to possess even when we judge them by the crudest criterion that of practice thus while it is the rule for physicians to proclaim the advantages of sexual continence there is no good reason to believe that they have themselves practised it in any eminent degree a few years ago an inquiry among thirtyfive distinguished physicians chiefly german and russian showed that they were nearly all of opinion that continence is harmless if not beneficial but meirowsky found by inquiry of eightysix physicians of much the same nationalities that only one had himself been sexually abstinent before marriage there seem to be no similar statistics for the englishspeaking countries where there exists a greater modestythough not perhaps notably less need for itin the making of such confessions but if we turn to the allied profession which is strongly on the side of sexual abstinence we find that among theological students as has been shown in the united states while prostitution may be infrequent no temptation is so frequent or so potent and in most cases so irresistible as that to solitary sexual indulgence such is the actual attitude towards the two least ideal forms of sexual practiceas distinguished from mere theoryon the part of the two professions which most definitely pronounce in favour of continence it is necessary however as will now be clearer to set our net more widely we must take into consideration every form and degree of sexual manifestation normal and abnormal gross and ethereal when we do this even cautiously and without going far afield sexual abstinence is found to be singularly elusive rohleder a careful and conscientious investigator has asserted that such abstinence in the true and complete sense is absolutely nonexistent the genuine cases in which sexual phenomena of some kind or other fail to manifest themselves being simply cases of inborn lack of sexual sensibility he met indeed a few people who seemed exceptions to the general rule but on better knowledge he found that he was mistaken and that so far from being absent in these people the sexual instinct was present even in its crudest shapes the activity of sex is an activity that on the physical side is generated by the complex mechanism of the ductless glands and displayed in the whole organism physical and psychic of the individual who cannot abolish that activity although to some extent able to regulate the forms in which it is manifested so that purity cannot be the abolition or even the indefinite suspension of sexual manifestations it must be the wise and beautiful control of them it is becoming clear that the old platitudes can no longer be maintained and that if we wish to improve our morals we must first improve our knowledge ii we have seen that various popular beliefs and conventional assumptions concerning the sexual impulse can no longer be maintained the sexual activities of the organism are not mere responses to stimulation absent if we choose to apply no stimulus never troubling us if we run away from them harmless if we enclose them within a high wall nor do they constitute a mere excretion or a mere appetite which we can control by a crude system of hygiene and dietetics we better understand the psychosexual constitution if we regard the motive power behind it as a dynamic energy produced and maintained by a complex mechanism at certain inner foci of the body and realise that whatever periodic explosive manifestations may take place at the surface the primary motive source lies in the intimate recesses of the organism while the outcome is the whole physical and spiritual energy of our being under those aspects which are most forcibleand most aspiring and even most ethereal this conception we find is now receiving an admirable and beautifully adequate physical basis in the researches of distinguished physiologists in various lands concerning the parts played by the ductless glands of the body in sensitive equilibrium with each other pouring out into the system stimulating and inhibiting hormones which not only confer on the mans or womans body those specific sexual characters which we admire but at the same time impart the special tone and fibre and polarity of masculinity or femininity to the psychic disposition yet even before brownséquards first epochmaking suggestion had set physiologists to search for internal secretions the insight of certain physicians on the medicopsychological side was independently leading towards the same dynamic conception in the middle of the last century anstie an acute london physician more or less vaguely realised the transformations of sexual energy into nervous disease and into artistic energy james hinton whose genius rendered him the precursor of many modern ideas had definitely grasped the dynamic nature of sexual activity and daringly proposed to utilise it not only as a solution of the difficulties of the personal life but for the revolutionary transformation of morality it was the wish to group together all the farflung manifestations of the inner irresistible process of sexual activity that underlay my own conception of autoerotism or the spontaneous erotic impulse which arises from the organism apart from all definite external stimulation to be manifested or it may be transformed in mere solitary physical sex activity in dreams of the night in daydreams in shapes of literature and art in symptoms of nervous disorder such as some forms of hysteria and even in the most exalted phases of mystical devotion since then a more elaborate attempt to develop a similar dynamic conception of sexual activity has been made by freud and the psychoanalysts who have followed him or sometimes diverged have with endless subtlety and courageous thoroughness traced the long and sinuous paths of sexual energy in personality and in life indeed in all the main manifestations of human activity the man who separated the thought of chastity from service and made it revolve round self wrote hinton half a century ago in his unpublished mss betrayed the human race the rule of self he wrote again has two forms selfindulgence and selfvirtue and nature has two weapons against it pain and pleasure a restraint must always be put away when anothers need can be served by putting it away for so is restored to us the force by which life is made how curious it seems the true evil things are our good things our thoughts of duty and goodness and chastity those are the things that need to be altered and put aside these are the barriers to true goodness i foresee the positive denial of all positive morals the removal of all restrictions i feel i do not know what license as we should term it may not truly belong to the perfect state of man when there is no self surely there is no restriction as we see there is none in nature may we not say of marriage as st augustine said of god rather would i not finding find thee than finding not find thee because we like is the sole legitimate and perfect motive of human action if this is what nature affirms then it will be what i believe this dynamic conception of the sexual impulse as a force that under natural conditions may be trusted to build up a new morality obviously belongs to an indefinitely remote future it is a force whose blade is twoedged for while it strikes at unselfishness it also strikes at selfishness and at present we cannot easily conceive a time when there is no self we should be more disposed to regard it as a time when there is much humbug yet for the individual this conception of the constructive power of love retains much enlightenment and inspiration it is important for us to note about this dynamic sexual energy in the constitution that while it is very firmly and organically rooted and quite indestructible it assumes very various shapes on the physical side all the characters of sexual distinction and all the beauties of sexual adornment are wrought by the power furnished by the cooperating furnaces of the glands and so also on the psychic side are emotions and impulses which range from the simplest longings for sensual contact to the most exalted rapture of union with the infinite moreover there is a certain degree of correlation between the physical and the psychic manifestation of sexual energy and to some extent transformation is possible in the embodiment of that energy a vague belief in the transformation of sexual energy has long been widespread it is apparently shown in the idea that continence as an economy in the expenditure of sexual force may be practised to aid the physical and mental development while folklore reveals various sayings in regard to the supposed influence of sexual abstinence in the causation of insanity there is a certain underlying basis of reason in such beliefs though in an unqualified form they cannot be accepted for they take no account of the complexity of the factors involved of the difficulty and often impossibility of effecting any complete transformation either in a desirable or undesirable direction and of the serious conflict which the process often involves the psychoanalysts have helped us here whether or not we accept their elaborate and often shifting conceptions they have emphasised and developed a psychological conception of sexual energy and its transformations before only vaguely apprehended which is now seen to harmonise with the modernphysiological view the old notion that sexual activity is merely a matter of the voluntary exercise or abstinence from exercise of the reproductive functions of adult persons has too long obstructed any clear vision of the fact that sexuality in the wide and deep sense is independent of the developments of puberty this has long been accepted as an occasional and therefore abnormal fact but we have to recognise that it is true almost or quite normally even of early childhood no doubt we must here extend the word sexualityin what may well be considered an illegitimate wayto cover manifestations which in the usual sense are not sexual or are at most called sexual perversions but this extension has a certain justification in view of the fact that these manifestations can be seen to be definitely related to the ordinary adult forms of sexuality however we define it we have to recognise that the child takes the same kind of pleasure in those functions which are natural to his age as the adult is capable of taking in localised sexual functions that he may weave ideas around such functions sometimes cultivate their exercise from love of luxury make them the basis of daydreams which at puberty when the ideals of adult life are ready to capture his sexual energy he begins to grow ashamed of perhaps as applied to the period below puberty it would be more exact to say pseudosexuality matsumato has lately pointed out the significance of the fact that the interstitial testicular tissue essential to the hormonic function of the testes only becomes active at puberty at this stage indeed we reach a crucial point though it has usually been overlooked in the lives of boys and girls more especially those whose heredity may have been a little tainted or their upbringing a little twisted for it is here that the transformation of energy and the resulting possibilities of conflict are wont to enter in the harmoniously developing organism one may say there is at this period a gradual and easy transmutation of the childish pleasurable activities into adult activities accompanied perhaps by a feeling of shame for the earlier feelings though this quickly passes into a forgetfulness which often leads the adult far astray when he attempts to understand the psychic life of the child the childish manifestations it must be remarked are not necessarily unwholesome they probably perform a valuable function and develop budding sexual emotions just as the petals of flowers are developed in pale and contorted shapes beneath the enveloping sheaths but in our human life the transmutation is often not so easy as in flowers normally indeed the adolescent transformations of sex are so urgent and so manifoldnow definite sensual desire now muscular impulses of adventure now emotional aspirations in the sphere of art or religionthat they easily overwhelm and absorb all its vaguer and more twisted manifestations in childhood yet it may happen that by some aberration of internal development or of external influence this conversion of energy may at one point or another fail to be completely effected then some fragment of infantile sexuality survives in rare cases to turn all the adult faculties to its service and become reckless and triumphant in minor and more frequent cases to be subordinated and more or less repressed into the subconscious sphere by voluntary or even involuntary and unconscious effort then we may have conflict which when it works happily exerts a fortifying and ennobling influence on character when more unhappily a disturbing influence which may even lead to conditions of definite nervous disorder the process by which this fundamental sexual energy is elevated from elementary and primitive forms into complex and developed forms is termed sublimation a term originally used for the process of raising by heat a solid substance to the state of vapour which was applied even by such early writers as drayton and davies in a metaphorical and spiritual sense in the sexual sphere sublimation is of vital importance because it comes into question throughout the whole of life and our relation to it must intimately affect our conception of morality the element of athletic asceticism which is a part of all virility and is found evenindeed often in a high degreeamong savages has its main moral justification as one aid to sublimation throughout life sublimation acts by transforming some part at all events of the creative sexual energy from its elementary animal manifestations into more highly individual and social manifestations or at all events into finer forms of sexual activity forms that seem to us more beautiful and satisfy us more widely purity we thus come to see is in one aspect the action of sublimation not abolishing sexual activity but lifting it into forms of which our best judgment may approve may gather the history of the term from the oxford dictionary bodies said davies are transformed to spirit we by sublimation strange and ben jonson in cynthias revels spoke of a being sublimated and refined purchas and jackson early in the same seventeenth century referred to religion as sublimating human nature and jeremy taylor a little later to subliming marriage into a sacrament shaftesbury early in the eighteenth century spoke of human nature being sublimated by a sort of spiritual chemists and welton a little later of alove sublimate and refined while finally and altogether in our modern sense peacock in in his headlong hall referred to that enthusiastic sublimation which is the source of greatness and energy we must not supposeas is too often assumedthat sublimation can be carried out easily completely or even with unmixed advantage if it were so certainly the oldfashioned moralist would be confronted by few difficulties but we have ample reason to believe that it is not so it is with sexual energy well observes freud who yet attaches great importance to sublimation as it is with heat in our machines only a certain proportion can be transformed into work or as it is put by löwenfeld who is not a constructive philosopher but a careful and cautious medical investigator the advantages of sublimation are not received in specially high degree by those who permanently deny to their sexual impulse every natural direct relief the celibate catholic clergy notwithstanding their heroic achievements in individual cases can scarcely be said to display a conspicuous excess of intellectual energy on the whole over the noncelibate protestant clergy or if we compare the english clergy before and after the protestant reformation though the earlier period may reveal more daring and brilliant personages the whole intellectual output of the later church may claim comparison with that of the earlier church there are clearly other factors at work besides sublimation and even sublimation may act most potently not when the sexual activities sink or are driven into a tame and monotonous subordination but rather when they assume a splendid energy which surges into many channels yet sublimation is a very real influence not only in its more unconscious and profound operations but in its more immediate and temporary applications as part of an athletic discipline acting best perhaps when it acts most automatically to utilise the motor energy of the organism in the attainment of any high physical or psychic achievement we have to realise however that these transmutations do not only take place by way of a sublimation of sexual energy but also by way of a degradation of that energy the new form of energy produced that is to say may not be of a beneficial kind it may be of a mischievous kind a form of perversion or disease sexual selfdenial instead of leading to sublimation may lead to nervous disorder when the erotic tension failing to find a natural outlet and not sublimated to higher erotic or nonerotic ends in the real world is transmuted into an unreal dreamland thus undergoing what jung terms introversion while there are also the people already referred to in whom immature childish sexuality persists into an adult stage of development it is no longer altogether in accord with so that conflict with various possible trains of nervous symptoms may result disturbances and conflicts in the emotional sexual field may we know in these and similar ways become transformed into physical symptoms of disorder which can be seen to have a precise symbolic relationship to definite events in the patients emotional history while fits of nervous terror or anxietyneurosis may frequently be regarded as a degradation of thwarted or disturbed sexual energy manifesting its origin by presenting a picture of sexual excitation transposed into a nonsexual shape of an entirely useless or mischievous character thus to sum up we may say that the sexual energy of the organism is a mighty force automatically generated throughout life under healthy conditions that force is transmuted in more or less degree but never entirely into forms that further the development of the individual and the general ends of life these transformations are to some extent automatic to some extent within the control of personal guidance but there are limits to such guidance for the primitive human personality can never be altogether rendered an artificial creature of civilisation when these limits are reached the transmutation of sexual energy may become useless or even dangerous and we fail to attain the exquisite flower of purity iii it may seem that in setting forth the nature of the sexual impulse in the light of modern biology and psychology i have said but little of purity and less of morality yet that is as it should be we must first be content to see how the machine works and watch the wheels go round we must understand before we can pretend to control in the natural world as bacon long ago said we can only command by obeying moreover in this field natures order is far older and more firmly established than our civilised human morality in our arrogance we often assume that morality is the master of nature yet except when it is so elementary or fundamental as to be part of nature it is but a guide and a guide that is only a child so young so capricious that in every age its wayward hand has sought to pull nature in a different direction even only in order to guide we must first see and know we realise that never more than when we observe the distinction which conventional sexmorals so often makes between men and women failing to find in women exactly the same kind of sexual emotions as they find in themselves men have concluded that there are none there at all so man has regarded himself as the sexual animal and woman aseither the passive object of his adoring love or the helpless victim of his degrading lust in either case as a being who unlike man possessed an innocent purity by nature without any need for the trouble of acquiring it of woman as a real human being with sexual needs and sexual responsibilities morality has often known nothing it has been content to preach restraint to man an abstract and meaningless restraint even if it were possible but when we have regard to the actual facts of life we can no longer place virtue in a vacuum women are just as apt as men to be afflicted by the petty jealousies and narrownesses of the crude sexual impulse women just as much as men need the perpetual sublimation of erotic desire into forms of more sincere purity of larger harmony in gaining which ends all the essential ends of morality are alone gained the delicate adjustment of the needs of each sex to the needs of the other sex to the end of what chaucer called fine loving the adjustment of the needs of both sexes to the larger ends of fine living may well furnish a perpetual moral discipline which extends its fortifying influence to men and women alike it is this universality of sexual emotion blending in its own mighty stream as is now realised many other currents of emotion even the parental and the filial and traceable even in childhoodthe wide efflorescence of an energy constantly generated by a vital internal mechanismwhich renders vain all attempts either to suppress or to ignore the problem of sex however immensely urgent we might foolishly imagine such attempts to be even the history of the early christian ascetics in egypt as recorded in the contemporary paradise of palladius illustrates the futility of seeking to quench the unquenchable the flame of fire which is life itself these athletes of the lord were under the best possible conditions for the conquest of lust they had been driven into the solitude of the desert by a genuine deeplyfelt impulse they could regulate their lives as they would and they possessed an almost inconceivable energy of resolution they were prepared to live on herbs even to eat grass and to undertake any labour of selfdenial they were so scrupulous that we hear of a holy man who would even efface a womans footprints in the sand lest a brother might thereby be led into thoughts of evil yet they were perpetually tempted to seductive visions and desires even after a monastic life of forty years and the women seem to have been not less liable to yield to temptation than the men it may be noted that in the most perfect saints there has not always been a complete suppression of the sexual impulse even on the normal plane nor even in some cases the attempt at such complete suppression in the early days of christianity the exercise of chastity was frequently combined with a close and romantic intimacy of affection between the sexes which shocked austere moralists even in the eleventh century we find that the charming and saintly robert of arbrissel founder of the order of fontevrault would often sleep with his nuns notwithstanding the remonstrances of pious friends who thought he was displaying too heroic a manifestation of continence failing to understand that he was effecting a sweet compromise with continence if moreover we consider the rarest and finest of the saints we usually find that in their early lives there was a period of full expansion of the organic activities in which all the natural impulses had full play this was the case with the two greatest and most influential saints of the christian church st augustine and st francis of assisi absolutely unlike as they were in most other respects sublimation we see again and again is limited and the best developments of the spiritual life are not likely to come about by the rigid attempt to obtain a complete transmutation of sexual energy the old notion that any strict attempt to adhere to sexual abstinence is beset by terrible risks insanity and so forth has no foundation at all events where we are concerned with reasonably sound and healthy people but it is a very serious error to suppose that the effort to achieve complete and prolonged sexual abstinence is without any bad results at all physical or psychic either in men or women who are normal and healthy this is now generally recognised everywhere except in the englishspeaking countries where the supposed interests of a prudish morality often lead to a refusal to look facts in the face as professor näcke a careful and cautious physician stated shortly before his death a few years ago the opinion that sexual abstinence has no bad effects is not today held by a single authority on questions of sex the fight is only concerned with the nature and degree of the bad effects which in näckes beliefand he was doubtless rightare never of a gravely serious character yet we have also to remember that not only as we have seen is the effort to achieve complete abstinencewhich we ignorantly term purityfutile since we are concerned with a force which is being constantly generated within the organism but in the effort to achieve it we are abusing a great source of beneficent energy we lose more than half of what we might gain when we cover it up and try to push it back to produce it may be not harmonious activity in the world but merely internal confusion and distortion and perhaps the paralysis of half the souls energy the sexual activities of the organism we cannot too often repeat constitute a mighty source of energy which we can never altogether repress though by wise guidance we may render it an aid not only to personal development and wellbeing butto the moral betterment of the world the attraction of sex according to a superstition which reaches far back into antiquity is a baleful comet pointing to destruction rather than a mighty star to which we may harness our chariot it may certainly be either and which it is likely to become depends largely on our knowledge and our power of selfguidance in old days when as we have seen tradition aided by the most fantastic superstitions insisted on the baleful aspects of sex the whole emphasis was placed against passion since knowledge and selfguidance without which passion is likely to be in fact pernicious were then usually absent the emphasis was needed and when böhme the old mystic declared that the art of living is to harness our fiery energies to the service of the light it has recently been even maintained that he was the solitary pioneer of our modern doctrines but the ages in which illregulated passion exceededages at least full of vitality and energygave place to a more anæmic society today the conditions are changed even reversed moral maxims that were wholesome in feudal days are deadly now we are in no danger of suffering from too much vitality from too much energy in the explosive splendour of our social life we possess moreover knowledge in plenty and selfrestraint in plenty even in excess however wrongly they may sometimes be applied it is passion more passion and fuller that we need the moralist who bans passion is not of our time his place these many years is with the dead for we know what happens in a world when those who ban passion have triumphed when love is suppressed hate takes its place the least regulated orgies of love grow innocent beside the orgies of hate when nations that might well worship one another cut one anothers throats when cruelty and selfrighteousness and lying and injustice and all the powers of destruction rule the human heart the world is devastated the fibre of the whole organism of society grows flaccid and all the ideals of civilisation are debased if the world is not now sick of hate we may be sure it never will be so whatever may happen to the world let us remember that the individual is still left to carry on the tasks of love to do good even in an evil world it is more passion and ever more that we need if we are to undo the work of hate if we are to add to the gaiety and splendour of life to the sum of human achievement to the aspiration of human ecstasy the things that fill men and women with beauty and exhilaration and spur them to actions beyond themselves are the things that are now needed the entire intrinsic purification of the soul it was held by the great spanish jesuit theologian suarez takes place at the moment when provided the soul is of good disposition it sees god he meant after death but for us the saying is symbolic of the living truth it is only in the passion of facing the naked beauty of the world and its naked truth that we can win intrinsic purity not all indeed who look upon the face of god can live it is not well that they should live it is only the metals that can be welded in the fire of passion to finer services that the world needs it would be well that the rest should be lost in those flames that indeed were a world fit to perish wherein the moralist had set up the ignoble maxim safety firstchapter iii the objects of marriage what are the legitimate objects of marriage we know that many people seek to marry for ends that can scarcely be called legitimate that men may marry to obtain a cheap domestic drudge or nurse and that women may marry to be kept when they are tired of keeping themselves these objects in marriage may or may not be moral but in any case they are scarcely its legitimate ends we are here concerned to ascertain those ends of marriage which are legitimate when we take the highest ground as moral and civilised men and women living in an advanced state of society and seeking if we can to advance that state of society still further the primary end of marriage is to beget and bear offspring and to rear them until they are able to take care of themselves on that basis man is at one with all the mammals and most of the birds if indeed we disregard the originally less essential part of this endthat is to say the care and tending of the youngthis end of marriage is not only the primary but usually the sole end of sexual intercourse in the whole mammal world as a natural instinct its achievement involves gratification and wellbeing but this bait of gratification is merely a device of natures and not in itself an end having any useful function at the periods when conception is not possible this is clearly indicated by the fact that among animals the female only experiences sexual desire at the season of impregnation and that desire ceases as soon as impregnation takes place though this is only in a few species true of the male obviously because if his sexual desire and aptitude were confined to so brief a period the chances of the female meeting the right male at the right moment would be too seriously diminished so that the attentive and inquisitive attitude towards the female by the male animalwhich we may often think we see still traceable in the human speciesis not the outcome of lustfulness for personal gratification wantonly to satisfy carnal lusts and appetites like brute beasts as the anglican prayer book incorrectly puts it but implanted by nature for the benefit of the female and the attainment of the primary object of procreation this primary object we may term the animal end of marriage this object remains not only the primary but even the sole end of marriage among the lower races of mankind generally the erotic idea in its deeper sense that is to say the element of love arose very slowly in mankind it is found it is true among some lower races and it appears that some tribes possess a word for the joy of love in a purely psychic sense but even among european races the evolution was late the greek poets except the latest showed little recognition of love as an element of marriage theognis compared marriage with cattlebreeding the romans of the republic took much the same view greeks and romans alike regarded breeding as the one recognisable object of marriage any other object was mere wantonness and had better they thought be carried on outside marriage religion which preserves so many ancient and primitive conceptions of life has consecrated this conception also and christianitythough as i will point out later it has tended to enlarge the conceptionat the outset only offered the choice between celibacy on the one hand and on the other marriage for the production of offspring yet from an early period in human history a secondary function of sexual intercourse had been slowly growing up to become one of the great objects of marriage among animals it may be said and even sometimes in man the sexual impulse when once aroused makes but a short and swift circuit through the brain to reach its consummation but as the brain and its faculties develop powerfully aided indeed by the very difficulties of the sexual life the impulse for sexual union has to traverse ever longer slower more painful paths before it reachesand sometimes it never reachesits ultimate object this means that sex gradually becomes intertwined with all the highest and subtlest human emotions and activities with the refinements of social intercourse with high adventure in every sphere with art with religion the primitive animal instinct having the sole end of procreation becomes on its way to that end the inspiring stimulus to all those psychic energies which in civilisation we count most precious this function is thus we see a byproduct but as we know even in our human factories the byproduct is sometimes more valuable than the product that is so as regards the functional products of human evolution the hand was produced out of the animal forelimb with the primary end of grasping the things we materially need but as a byproduct the hand has developed the function of making and playing the piano and the violin and that secondary functional byproduct of the hand we account even as measured by the rough test of money more precious however less materially necessary than its primary function it is however only in rare and gifted natures that transformed sexual energy becomes of supreme value for its own sake without ever attaining the normal physical outlet for the most part the byproduct accompanies the product throughout thus addinga secondary yet peculiarly sacred and specially human object of marriage to its primary animal object this may be termed the spiritual object of marriage by the term spiritual we are not to understand any mysterious and supernatural qualities it is simply a convenient name in distinction from animal to cover all those higher mental and emotional processes which in human evolution are ever gaining greater power it is needless to enumerate the constituents of this spiritual end of sexual intercourse for everyone is entitled to enumerate them differently and in different order they include not only all that makes love a gracious and beautiful erotic art but the whole element of pleasure in so far as pleasure is more than a mere animal gratification our ancient ascetic traditions often make us blind to the meaning of pleasure we see only its possibilities of evil and not its mightiness for good we forget that as romain rolland says joy is as holy as pain no one has insisted so much on the supreme importance of the element of pleasure in the spiritual ends of sex as james hinton rightly used he declares pleasure is the child of god to be recognised as a mighty storehouse of force and he pointed out the significant fact that in the course of human progress its importance increases rather than diminishes while it is perfectly true that sexual energy may be in large degree arrested and transformed into intellectual and moral forms yet it is also true that pleasure itself and above all sexual pleasure wisely used and not abused may prove the stimulus and liberator of our finest and most exalted activities it is largely this remarkable function of sexual pleasure which is decisive in settling the argument of those who claim that continence is the only alternative to the animal end of marriage that argument ignores the liberating and harmonising influences giving wholesome balance and sanity to the whole organism imparted by a sexual union which is the outcome of the psychic as well as physical needs there is further in the attainment of the spiritual end of marriage much more than the benefit of each individual separately there is that is to say the effect on the union itself for through harmonious sex relationships a deeper spiritual unity is reached than can possibly be derived from continence in or out of marriage and the marriage association becomes an apter instrument in the service of the world apart from any sexual craving the complete spiritual contact of two persons who love each other can only be attained through some act of rare intimacy no act can be quite so intimate as the sexual embrace in its accomplishment for all who have reached a reasonably human degree of development the communion of bodies becomes the communion of souls the outward and visible sign has been the consummation of an inward and spiritual grace i would base all my sex teaching to children and young people on the beauty and sacredness of sex wrote a distinguished woman sex intercourse is the great sacrament of life he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh his own damnation but it may be the most beautiful sacrament between two souls who have no thought of children to many the idea of a sacrament seems merely ecclesiastical but that is a misunderstanding the word sacrament is the ancient roman name of a soldiers oath of military allegiance and the idea in the deeper sense existed long before christianity and has ever been regarded as the physical sign of the closest possible union with some great spiritual reality from our modern standpoint we may say with james hinton that the sexual embrace worthily understood can only be compared with music and with prayer every true lover it has been well said by a woman knows this and the worth of any and every relationship can be judged by its success in reaching or failing to reach this standpoint havelock ellis james hinton a sketch ch iv mrs olive schreiner in a personal letter havelock ellis james hinton p mrs i have mentioned how the churchin part influenced by that clinging to primitive conceptions which always marks religions and in part by its ancient traditions of asceticismtended to insist mainly if not exclusively on the animal object of marriage it sought to reduce sex to a minimum because the pagans magnified sex it banned pleasure because the christians path on earth was the way of the cross and even if theologians accepted the idea of a sacrament of nature they could only allow it to operate when the active interference of the priest was impossible though it must in justice be said that before the council of trent the western church recognised that the sacrament of marriage was effected entirely by the act of the two celebrants themselves and not by the priest gradually however a more reasonable and humane opinion crept into the church intercourse outside the animal end of marriage was indeed a sin but it became merely a venial sin the great influence of st augustine was on the side of allowing much freedom to intercourse outside the aim of procreation at the reformation john à lasco a catholic bishop who became a protestant and settled in england laid it down following various earlier theologians that the object of marriage besides offspring was to serve as a sacrament of consolation to the united couple and that view was more or less accepted by the founders of theprotestant churches it is the generally accepted protestant view today the importance of the spiritual end of intercourse in marriage alike for the higher development of each member of the couple and for the intimacy and stability of their union is still more emphatically set forth by the more advanced thinkers of today it is well set forth by the rev h northcote in his excellent book christianity and sex problems there is something pathetic in the spectacle of those among us who are still only able to recognise the animal end of marriage and who point to the example of the lower animalsamong whom the biological conditions are entirely differentas worthy of our imitation it has taken godor nature if we willunknown millions of years of painful struggle to evolve man and to raise the human species above that helpless bondage to reproduction which marks the lower animals but on these people it has all been wasted they are at the animal stage still they have yet to learn the abc of love a representative of these people in the person of an anglican bishop the bishop of southwark appeared as a witness before the national birthrate commission which a few years ago met in london to investigate the decline of the birthrate he declared that procreation is the sole legitimate object of marriage and that intercourse for any other end was a degrading act of mere selfgratification this declaration had the interesting result of evoking the comments of many members of the commission formed of representative men and women with various standpointsprotestant catholic and otherand it is notable that while not one identified himself with the bishops opinion several decisively opposed that opinion as contrary to the best beliefs of both ancient and modern times as representing a low and not a high moral standpoint and as involving the notion that the whole sexual activity of an individual should be reduced to perhaps two or three effective acts of intercourse in a lifetime such a notion obviously cannot be carried into general practice putting aside the question as to whether it would be desirable and it may be added that it would have the further result of shutting out from the life of love altogether all those persons who for whatever reason feel that it is their duty to refrain from having children at all it is the attitude of a handful of pharisees seeking to thrust the bulk of mankind into hell all this confusion and evil comes of the blindness which cannot know that beyond the primary animal end of propagation in marriage there is a secondary but more exalted spiritual end it is needless to insist how intimately that secondary end of marriage is bound up with the practice of birthcontrol without birthcontrol indeed it could frequently have no existence at all and even at the best seldom be free from disconcerting possibilities fatal to its very essence against these disconcerting possibilities is often placed on the other side the unæsthetic nature of the contraceptives associated with birthcontrol yet it must be remembered they are of a part with the whole of our civilised human life we at no point enter the spiritual save through the material forel has in this connection compared the use of contraceptives to the use of eyeglasses eyeglasses are equally unæsthetic yet they are devices based on nature wherewith to supplement the deficiencies of nature however in themselves unæsthetic for those who need them they make the æsthetic possible eyeglasses and contraceptives alike are a portal to the spiritual world for many who without them would find that world largely a closed book birthcontrol is effecting and promising to effect many functions in our social life by furnishing the means to limit the size of families which would otherwise be excessive it confers the greatest benefit on the family and especially on the mother by rendering easily possible a selection in parentage and the choice of the right time and circumstances for conception it is again the chief key to the eugenic improvement of the race there are many other benefits as is now generally becoming clear which will be derived from the rightly applied practice of birthcontrol to many of us it is not the least of these that birthcontrol effects finally the complete liberation of the spiritual object of marriagechapter iv husbands and wives it has always been common to discuss the psychology of women the psychology of men has usually been passed over whether because it is too simple or too complicated but the marriage question today is much less the wifeproblem than the husbandproblem women in their personal and social activities have been slowly expanding along lines which are now generally accepted but there has been no marked change of responsive character in the activities of men hence a defective adjustment of men and women felt in all sorts of subtle as well as grosser ways most felt when they are husband and wife and sometimes becoming acute it is necessary to make clear that as is here assumed at the outset man and husband are not quite the same thing even when they refer to the same person no doubt that is also true of woman and wife a woman in her quality as woman may be a different kind of person from what she is in her function as wife but in the case of a man the distinction is more marked one may know a man well in the world as a man and not know him at all in his home as a husband not necessarily that he is unfavourably revealed in the latter capacity it is simply that he is different the explanation is not really far to seek a man in the world is in vital response to the influences around him but a husband in the home is playing a part which was created for him long centuries before he was born he is falling into a convention which indeed was moulded to fit many masculine human needs but has become rigidly traditionalised thus the part no longer corresponds accurately to the players nature nor to the circumstances under which it has to be played in the marriage system which has prevailed in our world for several thousand years a certain hierarchy or sacred order in authority has throughout been recognised the family has been regarded as a small state of which the husband and father is head classic paganism and christianity differed on many points but they were completely at one on this the roman system was on a patriarchal basis and continued to be so theoretically even when in practise it came to allow great independence to the wife christianity although it allowed complete spiritual freedom to the individual introduced no fundamentally new theory of the family and indeed reinforced the old theory by regarding the family as a little church of which the husband was the head just as christ is the head of the church st paul repeatedly asserted so the husband is the head of the wife therefore as it was constantly argued during the middle ages a man is bound to rule his wife st augustine the most influential of christian fathers even said that a wife should be proud to consider herself as the servant of her husband his ancilla a word that had in it the suggestion of slave that was the underlying assumption throughout the middle ages for the northern germanic peoples having always been accustomed to wifepurchase before their conversion had found it quite easy to assimilate the christian view protestantism even puritanism with its associations of spiritual revolt so far from modifying the accepted attitude strengthened it for they found authority for all social organisation in the bible and the bible revealed an emphatic predominance of the jewish husband who possessed essential rights to which the wife had no claim milton who had the poets sensitiveness to the loveliness of woman and the lonely mans feeling for the solace of her society was yet firmly assured of the husbands superiority over his wife he has indeed furnished the classical picture of it in adam and eve he for god only she for god in him and to that god she owed subjection even though she might qualify it by sweet reluctant amorous delay this was completely in harmony with the legal position of the wife as a subject she was naturally in subjection she owed her husband the same loyalty as a subject owes the sovereign her disloyalty to him was termed a minor form of treason if she murdered him the crime was legally worse than murder and she rendered herself liable to be burnt we see that all the influences on our civilisation religious and secular southern and northern have combined to mould the underlying bony structure of our family system in such a way that however it may appear softened and disguised on the surface the husband is the head and the wife subject to him we must not be supposed hereby to deny that the wife has had much authority many privileges considerable freedom and in individual cases much opportunity to domineer whatever superiority custom or brute strength may have given the husband there are henpecked husbands it has been remarked even in aboriginal australia it is necessary to avoid the error of those enthusiasts for the emancipation ofwomen who out of their eager faith in the future of women used to describe her past as one of scarcely mitigated servitude and hardship if women had not constantly succeeded in overcoming or eluding the difficulties that beset them in the past it would be foolish to cherish any faith in their future it must moreover be remembered that the very constitution of that ecclesiasticofeudal hierarchy which made the husband supreme over the wife also made the wife jointly with her husband supreme over their children and over their servants the middle ages alike in england and in france as doubtless in christendom generally accepted the rule laid down in gratians decretum the great mediæval textbook of canon law that the husband may chastise his wife temperately for she is of his household but the wife might chastise her daughters and her servants and she sometimes exercised that right in ways that we should nowadays think scarcely temperate if we seek to observe how the system worked some five hundred years ago when it had not yet become as it is today both weakened and disguised we cannot do better than turn to the paston letters the most instructive documents we possess concerning the domestic life of excellent yet fairly average people of the upper middle class in england in the fifteenth century marriage was still frankly and fundamentally as it was in the following century and less frankly later a commercial transaction the wooer when he had a wife in view stated as a matter of course that he proposed to deal in the matter it was quite recognised on both sides that love and courtship must depend on whether the deal came off satisfactorily john paston approached sir thomas brews through a third person with a view to negotiate a marriage with his daughter margery she was willing even eager and while the matter was still uncertain she wrote him a letter on valentines day addressing him as right reverent and worshipful and my right wellbeloved valentine to tell him that it was impossible for her father to offer a larger dowry than he had already promised if that you could be content with that good and my poor person i would be the merriest maiden on ground in his first letterboldly written he says without her knowledge or licensehe addresses her simply as mistress and assures her that i am and will be yours and at your commandment in every wise during my life a few weeks later addressing him as right worshipful master she calls him mine own sweetheart and ends up as she frequently does your servant and bedeswoman some months later a few weeks after marriage she addresses her husband in the correct manner of the time as right reverent and worshipful husband asking him to buy her a gown as she is weary of wearing her present one it is so cumbrous five years later she refers to all the babies and writes in haste right reverent and worshipful sir in my most humble wise i recommend me unto you as lowly as i can etc though she adds in a postscript please you to send for me for i think long since i lay in your arms if we turn to another wife of the paston family a little earlier in the century margaret paston whose husbands name also was john we find the same attitude even more distinctly expressed she always addressed him in her most familiar letters showing affectionate concern for his welfare as right reverent and worshipful husband or right worshipful master it is seldom that he writes to her at all but when he writes the superscription is simply to my mistress paston or my cousin with little greeting at either beginning or end once only with unexampled effusion he writes to her as my own dear sovereign lady and signs himself your true and trusting husband see just the same formulas in the fifteenth century letters of the stonor family stonor letters and papers we camden society though in these letters we seem often to find a lighter and more playful touch than was common among the pastons i may refer here to dr powells learned and well written book with which i was not acquainted when i wrote this chapter english domestic relations columbia university press if we turn to france the relation of the wife to her husband was the same or even more definitely dependent for he occupied the place of father to her as well as of husband and sovereign in this respect carrying on a tradition of roman law she was her husbands wife and subject she signed herself vostre humble obéissante fille et amye if also we turn to the book of the chevalier de la tourlandry in anjou written at the end of the fourteenth century we find a picture of the relations of women to men in marriage comparable to that presented in the paston letters though of a different order this book was as we know written for the instruction of his daughters by a knight who seems to have been a fairly average man of his time in his beliefs and in character as he has been described probably above it a man of the world a christian a parent and a gentleman his book is full of interesting light on the customs and manners of his day though it is mainly a picture of what the writer thought ought to be rather than what always was herein the knight is sagacious and moderate much of his advice is admirably sound for every age he is less concerned with affirming the authority of husbands than with assuring the happiness and wellbeing of his dearly loved daughters but he clearly finds this bound up with the recognition of the authority of the husband and the demands he makes are fairly concordant with the relationships we see established among the pastons the knight abounds in illustrations from lotsdaughters down to his own time for the example or the warning of his daughters the ideal he holds up to them is strictly domestic and in a sense conventional he puts the matter on practical rather than religious or legal grounds and his fundamental assumption is that no woman ought ever to thwart or refuse to obey the ordinance of her lord that is if she is either desirous to be mistress of his affections or to have peace and understanding in the house for very evident reasons submission should begin on her part one would like to know what duties the knight inculcated on husbands but the corresponding book he wrote for the guidance of his sons appears no longer to be extant on the whole the fundamental traditions of our western world concerning the duties of husbands and wives are well summed up in what pollock and maitland term that curious cabinet of antiquities the marriage ritual of the english church here we find that the husband promises to love and cherish the wife but she promises not only to love and cherish but also to obey him though it may be noted this point was not introduced into english marriage rites until the fourteenth century when the wife promised to be buxom which then meant submissive and bonair courteous and kind while in some french and spanish rites it has never been introduced at all but we may take it to be generally implied in the final address to the married couple the priest admonishes the bride that the husband is the head of the wife and that her part is submission in some more ancient and local rituals this point was further driven home and on the delivery of the ring the bride knelt and kissed the bridegrooms right foot in course of time this was modified at all events in france and she simply dropped the ring so that her motion of stooping was regarded as for the purpose of picking it up i note that change for it is significant of the ways in which we modify the traditions of the past not quite abandoning them but pretending that they have other than the fundamental original motives we see just the same thing in the use of the ring which was in the first place a part of the brideprice frequently accompanied by money proof that the wife had been duly purchased it was thus made easy to regard the ring as really a golden fetter that idea soon became offensive and the new idea was originated that the ring was a pledge of affection thus quite early in some countries the husband also wore a wedding ring the marriage order illustrated by the paston letters and the book of the chevalier de la tourlandry before the reformation and the anglican book of common prayer afterwards has never been definitely broken it is a part of our living tradition today but during recent centuries it has been overlaid by the growth of new fashions and sentiments which have softened its hard outlines to the view it has been disguised notably during the eighteenth century by the development of a new feeling of social equality chiefly initiated in france which in an atmosphere of public intercourse largely regulated by women made the ostentatious assertion of the husbands headship over his wife displeasing and even ridiculous then especially in the nineteenth century there began another movement chiefly initiated in england and carried further in america which affected the foundations of the husbands position from beneath this movement consisted in a great number of legislative measures and judicial pronouncements and administrative orderseach small in itself and never coordinatedwhich taken altogether have had a cumulative effect in immensely increasing the rights of the wife independently of her husband or even in opposition to him thus at the present time the husbands authority has been overlaid by new social conventions from above and undermined by new legal regulations from below yet it is important to realise although the husbands domestic throne has been in appearance elegantly recovered and in substance has become wormeaten it still stands and still retains its ancient shape and structure there has never been a french revolution in the home and that revolution itself which modified society so extensively scarcely modified the legal supremacy of the husband at all even in france under the code napoléon and still less anywhere else interwoven with all the new developments and however less obtrusive it may have become the old tradition still continues among us since also the husband is conventionally and in large measure really the economic support of the homethe work of the wife and even actual financial contributions brought by her not being supposed to affect that conventionthis state of things is held to be justified thus when a man enters the home as a husband to seat himself on the antique domestic throne and to play the part assigned to him of old he is involuntarily even unconsciously following an ancient tradition and taking his place in a procession of husbands which began long ages before he was born it thus comes about that a man even after he is married and a husband are two different persons so that his wife who mainly knows him as a husband may be unable to form any just idea of what he is like as a man as a husband he has stepped out of the path that belongs to him in the world and taken on another part which has called out altogether different reactions so he is sometimes a much more admirable person in one of these sphereswhichever it may bethan in the other we must not be surprised if the husbands position has sometimes developed those qualities which from the modernpoint of view are the less admirable in this respect the sovereign husband resembles the sovereign state the sovereign state as it has survived from renaissance days in our modern world may be made up of admirable people yet as a state they are forced into an attitude of helpless egoism which nowadays fails to commend itself to the outside world and the tendency of scientific jurists today is to deal very critically with the old conception of the sovereign state it is so with the husband in the home he was thrust by ancient tradition into a position of sovereignty which impelled him to play a part of helpless egoism he was a celestial body in the home around which all the other inmates were revolving satellites the hours of rising and retiring the times of meals and their nature and substance all the activities of the householdin which he himself takes little or no partare still arranged primarily to suit his work his play and his tastes this is an accepted matter of course and not the result of any violent selfassertion on his part it is equally an accepted matter of course that the wife should be constantly occupied in keeping this little solar system in easy harmonious movement evolving from it if she has the skill the music of the spheres she has no recognised independent personality of her own nor even any right to go away by herself for a little change and recreation any work of her own play of her own tastes of her own must be strictly subordinated if not suppressed altogether in the old days from which our domestic traditions proceed little hardship was thus inflicted on the wife her rights and privileges were indeed far less than those of the modern woman but for that very reason the home offered her a larger field beneath the shelter of her husband the irresponsible wife might exert a maximum of influential activity with a minimum of rights and privileges of her own to many men even today that state of things seems the realisation of an ideal yet to women it seems increasingly less so and of necessity since the cleavage between the position of woman in society and law and the position of the wife in the sacramental bonds of wedlock is daily becoming greater today a woman who possibly for ten years has been leading her own life of independent work earning her own living choosing her own conditions in accordance with her own needs and selecting her own periods of recreation in accordance with her own tastes whether or not this may have included the society of a manfriendsuch a woman suddenly finds on marriage and without any assertion of authority on her husbands part that all the outward circumstances of her life are reversed and all her inner spontaneous movements arrested there may be no signs of this on the surface of her conduct she loves her husband too much to wish to hurt his feelings by explaining the situation and she values domestic peace too much to risk friction by making unexpected claims but beneath the surface there is often a profound discontent and even in women who thought they had gained an insight into life a sense of disillusion everyone knows this who is privileged to catch a glimpse into the hearts of womenoften women of most distinguished intelligence as well as women of quite ordinary naturewho leave a life of spontaneous activity in the world to enter the home while this condition of things is sometimes to be found in the more distinguished minority and in welltodo families it is of course among the great labouring majority that it is most conspicuous mrs will crooks of poplar speaking to a newspaper reporter daily chronicle feb truly remarked at present the average married womans working day is a flagrant contradiction of all tradeunion ideals the poor thing is slaving all the time what she needswhat she longs foris just a little break or change now and again an opportunity to get her mind off her work and its worries if her husbands hours are reduced to eight well that gives her a chance doesnt it the home and the children are after all as much his as hers with his enlarged leisure he will now be able to take a fair share in home duties i suggest that they take it turn and turn aboutone night he goes out and she looks after the house and the children the next night she goes out and he takes charge of things at home she can sometimes go to the cinema sometimes call on friends then say once a week they can both go out together taking the children with them that will be a little change and treat for everybody it is not to be supposed that in this presentation of the situation in the home as it is today visible to those who are privileged to see beneath the surface any accusation is brought against the husband he is no more guilty of an unreasonable conservatism than the wife is guilty of an unreasonable radicalism each of them is the outcome of a tradition the point is that the events of the past hundred years have produced a discrepancy in the two lines of tradition with a resultant lack of harmony independent of the goodwill of either husband or wife olive schreiner in her woman and labour has eloquently set forth the tendency to parasitism which civilisation produces in women they no longer exercise the arts and industries which were theirs in former ages and so they become economically dependent on men losing their energies and aptitudes and becoming like those dull parasitic animals which live as bloodsuckers of their host that picture which was of course never true of all women is nowceasing to be true of any but a negligible minority it presents moreover a parasitism limited to the economic side of life for if the wife has often been a lazy goldsucking parasite on her husband in the world the husband has yet oftener been a helpless serviceabsorbing parasite on his wife in the home there is that is to say not only an economic parasitism with no adequate return for financial support but a still more prevalent domestic parasitism with an absorption of services for which no return would be adequate there are many helpful husbands in the home but there are a larger number who are helpless and have never been trained to be anything else but helpless even by their wives who would often detest a rival in household work and management the average husband enjoys the total effect of his home but is usually unable to contribute any of the details of work and organisation that make it enjoyable he cannot keep it in order and cleanliness and regulated movement he seldom knows how to buy the things that are needed for its upkeep nor how to prepare and cook and present a decent meal he cannot even attend to his own domestic needs it is the wifes consolation that most husbands are not always at home in ministering to the wants of the family the woman has reduced man to a state of considerable dependency on her in all domestic affairs just as she is dependent on him for bodily protection in the course of ages this has gone so far as to foster a peculiar helplessness on the part of the man which manifests itself in a somewhat childlike reliance of the husband on the wife in fact it may be said that the husband is to all intents and purposes incapable of maintaining himself without the aid of a woman this passage will probably seem to many readers to apply quite fairly well to men as they exist today in most of those lands which we consider at the summit of our civilisation yet it was not written of civilisation or of white men but of the bantu tribes of east africa complete negroes who while far from being among the lowest savages belong to a culture which is only just emerging from cannibalism witchcraft and customary bloodshed so close a resemblance between the european husband and the negro husband significantly suggests how remarkable has been the arrest of development in the husbands customary status during a vast period of the worlds history c dundas journal of the anthropological institute vol p hon it is in the considerable group of couples where the husbands work separates him but little from the home that the pressure on the wife is most severe and without the relief and variety secured by his frequent absence she has perhaps led a life of her own before marriage she knows how to be economically independent now they occupy a small dwelling they have maybe one or two small children they can only afford one helper in the work or none at all and in this busy little hive the husband and wife are constantly tumbling over each other it is small wonder if the wife feels a deep discontent beneath her willing ministrations and misses the devotion of the lover in the perpetual claims of the husband but the difficulty is not settled if she persuades him to take a room outside he is devoted to his wife and his home with good reason for the wife makes the home and he is incapable of making a home his new domestic arrangements sink into careless and sordid disorder and he is conscious of profound discomfort his wife soon realises that it is a choice between his return to the home and complete separation most wives never get even as far as this attempt at solution of the difficulty and hide their secret discontent this is the situation which today is becoming intensified and extended on a vast scale the habit and the taste for freedom adventure and economic independence is becoming generated among millions of women who once meekly trod the ancient beaten paths and we must not be so foolish as to suppose that they can suddenly renounce those habits and tastes at the threshold of marriage moreover it is becoming clear to men and to women alike and for the first time that the world can be remoulded and that the claims for better conditions of work for a higher standard of life and for the attainment of leisure which previously had only feebly been put forward may now be asserted drastically we see therefore today a great revolutionary movement mainly on the part of men in the world of labour and we see a corresponding movement however less ostentatious mainly on the part of women in the world of the home it may seem to some that this new movement of upheaval in the sphere of the home is merely destructive timid souls have felt the like in every period of transition and with as little reason just as we realise that the movement now in progress in the world of labour for a higher standard of life and for as it has been termed a larger leisureration represents a wholesome revolt against the crushing conditions of prolonged monotonous workthe most deadening of all workand a real advance towards those ideals of democracy which are still so remote so it is with the movement in the home that also is the claim for a new and fairer allotment of responsibility of larger opportunities for freedom andleisure if in the home the husband is still to be regarded as the capitalist and the wife as the labourer then at all events it has to be recognised that he owes her not only the satisfaction of her physical needs of food and shelter and clothing but the opportunity to satisfy the personal spontaneous claims of her own individual nature just as the readjustment of labour is really only an approach to the long recognised ideals of democracy so the readjustment of the home far from being subversive or revolutionary is merely an approximation to the long recognised ideals of marriage how in practice one may finally ask is this readjustment of the home likely to be carried out in the first place we are justified in believing that in the future home men will no longer be so helpless so domestically parasitic as in the past this change is indeed already coming about it is an inestimable benefit throughout life for a man to have been forcibly lifted out of the routine comforts and feminine services of the oldfashioned home and to be thrown into an alien and solitary environment face to face with nature and the essential domestic human needs in my own case i owe an inestimable debt to the chance that thus flung me into the australian bush in early life and one may note that the great war has had directly and indirectly a remarkable influence in this direction for it not only compelled women to exercise many enlarging and fortifying functions commonly counted as pertaining to men it also compelled men deprived of accustomed feminine services to develop a new independent ability for organising domesticity and that ability even though it is not permanently exercised in rendering domestic services must yet always make clear the nature of domestic problems and tend to prevent the demand for unnecessary domestic services but there is another quite different and more general line along which we may expect this problem to be largely solved that is by the simplification and organisation of domestic life if that process were carried to the full extent that is now becoming possible a large part of the problem before us would be at once solved a great promise for the future of domestic life is held out by the growing adoption of birthcontrol by which the wife and mother is relieved from that burden of unduly frequent and unwanted maternity which in the past so often crushed her vitality and destroyed her freshness but many minor agencies are helpful to supply heat light and motive power even to small households to replace the wasteful extravagant and often inefficient homecookery by meals cooked outside as well as to facilitate the growing social habit of taking meals in spacious public restaurants under more attractive economical and wholesome conditions than can usually be secured within the narrow confines of the home to contract with specially trained workers from outside for all those routines of domestic drudgery which are often so inefficiently and laboriously carried on by the householdworker whether mistress or servant and to seek perpetually by new devices to simplify which often means to beautify all the everyday processes of lifeto effect this in any comprehensive degree is to transform the home from the intolerable burden it is sometimes felt to be into a possible haven of peace and joy the trouble in the past and even today has been not in any difficulty in providing the facilities but in prevailing people to adopt them thus in england even under the stress of the great war there was among the working population a considerable disinclinationfounded on stupid conservatism and a meaningless prideto take advantage of national kitchens and national restaurants notwithstanding the superiority of the meals in quality cheapness and convenience to the workers home meals so that many of these establishments even while still fostered by the government had speedily to close their doors ancient traditions that have now become not only empty but mischievous in these matters still fetter the wife even more than the husband we cannot regulate even the material side of life without cultivating that intelligence in the development of which civilisation so largely consists aspect of the future of domesticity was often set forth by mrs havelock ellis the new horizon in love and this life intelligence and even something more than intelligence is needed along the third line of progress towards the modernised home simplification and organisation can effect nothing in the desired transformation if they merely end in themselves they are only helpful in so far as they economise energy offer a more ample leisure and extend the opportunities for that play of the intellect that liberation of the emotions with accompanying discipline of the primitive instincts which are needed not only for the development of civilisation in general but in particular of the home domineering egotism the assertion of greedy possessive rights are out of place in the modern home they are just as mischievous when exhibited by the wife as by the husband we have seen as we look back the futility in the end of the ancient structure of the home however reasonable it was at the beginning under our different modern social conditions and for women to attempt nowadays to reintroduce the same structure merely reversed would be not only mischievous but silly that spirit of narrow exclusiveness and self centred egoismeven if it were sometimes an égoisme à deux evoked half a century ago the scathing sarcasm of james hinton who never wearied of denouncing the virtuous andhappy homes which he saw as floating blotches of verdure on a sea of filth such outbursts seem extravagant but they were the extravagance of an idealist at the vision which as a physician in touch with realities he had seen beneath the surface of the home it is well to insist on the organisation of the mechanical and material side of life some leaders of women movements feel this so strongly that they insist on nothing else in old days it was conventionally supposed that womens sphere was that of the feelings the result has been that women now often take ostentatious pleasure in washing their hands of feelings and accusing men of sentiment but that wrongly debased word stands for the whole superstructure of life on the basis of material organisation for all the finer and higher parts of our nature for the greater part of civilisation the elaboration of the mechanical side of life by itself may merely serve to speed up the pace of life instead of expanding leisure to pile up the weary burden of luxury and still further to dissipate the energy of life in petty or frivolous channels to bring order into the region of soulless machinery running at random to raise the superstructure of a genuinely human civilisation is not a task which either men or women can afford to fling contemptuously to the opposite sex it concerns them both equally and can only be carried out by both equally working side by side in the most intimate spirit of mutual comprehension confiding trust and the goodwill to conquer the demon of jealousy that dragon which slays love under the pretence of keeping it alive growth of the sentiments remarks an influential psychologist of our own time w mcdougall social the psychology p is of the utmost importance for the character and conduct of individuals and of societies it is the organisation of the affective and conative life in the absence of sentiments our emotional life would be a mere chaos without order consistency or continuity of any kind and all our social relations and conduct being based on the emotions and their impulses would be correspondingly chaotic unpredictable and unstable again our judgments of value and of merit are rooted in our sentiments and our moral principles have the same source for they are formed by our judgments of moral value the destructive effects of the mechanisation of modern life have lately been admirably set forth and with much precise illustration by dr austin freeman social decay and regeneration this task it may finally be added is always an adventure however well organised the foundations of life may be life must always be full of risks we may smile therefore when it is remarked that the future developments of the home are risky birds in the air and fishes in the sea quite as much as our own ancestors on the earth have always found life full of risks it was the greatest risk of all when they insisted on continuing on the old outworn ways and so became extinct if the home is an experiment and a risky experiment one can only say that life is always like that we have to see to it that in this central experiment on which our happiness so largely depends all our finest qualities are mobilised even the smallest homes under the new conditions cannot be built to last with small minds and small hearts indeed the discipline of the home demands not only the best intellectual qualities that are available but often involvesand in men as well as in womena spiritual training fit to make sweeter and more generous saints than any cloister the greater the freedom the more complete the equality of husband and wife the greater the possibilities of discipline and development in view of the rigidities and injustices of the law many couples nowadays dispense with legal marriage and form their own private contract that method has sometimes proved more favourable to the fidelity and permanence of love than external compulsion it assists the husband to remain the lover and it is often the lover more than the husband that the modern woman needs but it has always to be remembered that in the present condition of law and social opinion a slur is cast on the children of such unions no doubt however marriage and the home will undergo modifications which will tend to make these ancient institutions a little more flexible and to permit a greater degree of variation to meet special circumstances we can occupy ourselves with no more essential task whether as regards ourselves or the race than to make more beautiful the house of life for the dwelling of lovechapter v the loverights of women what is the part of woman one is sometimes asked in the sex act must it be the wifes concern in the marital embrace to sacrifice her own wishes from a sense of love and duty towards her husband or is the wife entitled to an equal mutual interest and joy in this act with her husband it seems a simple problem in so fundamental a relationship which goes back to the beginning of sex in the dawn of life it might appear that we could leave nature to decide yet it is not so throughout the history of civilisation wherever we can trace the feelings and ideas which have prevailed on this matter and the resultant conduct the problem has existed often to produce discord conflict and misery the problem still exists today and with as important results as in the past in nature before the arrival of man it can scarcely be said indeed that any difficulty existed it was taken for granted at that time that the female had both the right to her own body and the right to a certain amount of enjoyment in the use of it it often cost the male a serious amount of troublethough he never failed to find it worth whileto explain to her the point where he may be allowed to come in and to persuade her that he can contribute to her enjoyment so it generally is throughout nature before we reach man and though it is not invariably obvious we often find it even among the unlikeliest animals as is well known it is most pronounced among the birds who have in some species carried the erotic artand the faithful devotion which properly accompanied the erotic art as being an essential part of itto the highest point we have here the great natural fact of courtship throughout nature wherever we meet with animals of a high type often indeed when they are of a lowly typeprovided they have not been rendered unnatural by domestication every act of sexual union is preceded by a process of courtship there is a sound physiological reason for this courtship for in the act of wooing and being wooed the psychic excitement gradually generated in the brains of the two partners acts as a stimulant to arouse into full activity the mechanism which ensures sexual union and aids ultimate impregnation such courtship is thus a fundamental natural fact it is as a natural fact that we still find it in full development among a large number of peoples of the lower races whom we are accustomed to regard as more primitive than ourselves new conditions it is true soon enter to complicate the picture presented by savage courtship the economic element of bargaining destined to prove so important comes in at an early stage and among peoples leading a violent life and constantly fighting it has sometimes happened though not always that courtship also has been violent this is not so frequent as was once supposed with better knowledge it was found that the seeming brutality once thought to take the place of courtship among various peoples in a low state of culture was really itself courtship a rough kind of play agreeable to both parties and not depriving the feminine partner of her own freedom of choice this was notably the case as regards socalled marriage by capture while this is sometimes a real capture it is more often a mock capture the lover perhaps pursues the beloved on horseback but she is as fleet and as skilful as he is cannot be captured unless she wishes to be captured and in addition as among the kirghiz she may be armed with a formidable whip so that marriage by capture far from being a hardship imposed on women is largely a concession to their modesty and a gratification of their erotic impulses even when the chief part of the decision rests with masculine force courtship is still not necessarily or usually excluded for the exhibition of force by a loverand this is true for civilised as well as for savage womenis itself a source of pleasurable stimulation and when that is so the essence of courtship may be attained even more successfully by the forceful than by the humble lover the evolution of society however tended to overlay and sometimes even to suppress those fundamental natural tendencies the position of the man as the sole and uncontested head of the family the insistence on paternity and male descent the accompanying economic developments and the tendency to view a woman less as a selfdisposing individual than as an object of barter belonging to her father the consequent rigidity of the marriage bond and the stern insistence on wifely fidelityall these conditions of developing civilisation while still leaving courtship possible diminished its significance and even abolished its necessity moreover on the basis of the social economic and legal developments thus established new moral spiritual and religious forces were slowly generated which worked on these rules of merely exterior order and interiorised them thus giving them power over the souls as well as over the bodies of womenthe result was that directly and indirectly the legal economic and erotic rights of women were all diminished it is with the erotic rights only that we are here concerned no doubt in its erotic aspects as well as in its legal and economic aspects the social order thus established was described and in good faith as beneficial to women and even as maintained in their interests monogamy and the home it was claimed alike existed for the benefit and protection of women it was not so often explained that they greatly benefited and protected men with moreover this additional advantage that while women were absolutely confined to the home men were free to exercise their activities outside the home even with tacit general consent on the erotic side whatever the real benefits and there is no occasion for questioning them of the sexual order thus established it becomes clear that in certain important respects it had an unnatural and repressive influence on the erotic aspect of womans sexual life it fostered the reproductive side of womans sexual life but it rendered difficult for her the satisfaction of the instinct for that courtship which is the natural preliminary of reproductive activity an instinct even more highly developed in the female than in the male and the more insistent because in the order of nature the burden of maternity is preceded by the reward of pleasure but the marriage order which had become established led to the indirect result of banning pleasure in women or at all events in wives it was regarded as too dangerous and even as degrading the women who wanted pleasure were not considered fit for the home but more suited to be devoted to an exclusive life of pleasure which soon turned out to be not their own pleasure but mens a life of pleasure in that sense or in any other sense was not what more than a small minority of women ever desired the desire of women for courtship is not a thing by itself and was not implanted for gratification by itself it is naturally intertwinedand to a much greater degree than the corresponding desire in menwith her deepest personal family and social instincts so that if these are desecrated and lost its charm soon fades the practices and the ideals of this established morality were both due to men and both were so thoroughly fashioned that they subjugated alike the actions and the feelings of women there is no sphere which we regard as so peculiarly womens sphere as that of love yet there is no sphere which in civilisation women have so far had so small a part in regulating their deepest impulsestheir modesty their maternity their devotion their emotional receptivitywere used with no conscious and deliberate machiavellism against themselves to mould a moral world for their habitation which they would not themselves have moulded it is not of modern creation nor by any means due as some have supposed to the asceticism of christianity however much christianity may have reinforced it indeed one may say that in course of time christianity had an influence in weakening it for christianity discovered a new reservoir of tender emotion and such emotion may be transferred and as a matter of fact was transferred from its first religious channel into erotic channels which were thereby deepened and extended and without reference to any design of christianity for the ends we achieve are often by no means those which we set out to accomplish in ancient classic days this moral order was even more severely established than in the middle ages montaigne in the sixteenth century declared that marriage is a devout and religious relationship the pleasures derived from it should be restrained and serious mixed with some severity but in this matter he was not merely expressing the christian standpoint but even more that of paganism and he thoroughly agreed with the old greek moralist that a man should approach his wife prudently and severely for fear of inciting her to lasciviousness he thought that marriage was best arranged by a third party and was inclined to think with the ancients that women are not fitted to make friends of montaigne has elsewhere spoken with insight of womens instinctive knowledge of the art and discipline of love and has pointed out how men have imposed their own ideals and rules of action on women from whom they have demanded opposite and contradictory virtues yet we see he approves of this state of things and never suggests that women have any right to opinions of their own or feelings of their own when the sacred institution of marriage is in question montaigne represents the more exalted aspects of the paganchristian conception of morality in marriage which still largely prevails but that conception lent itself to deductions frankly accepted even by montaigne himself which were by no means exalted i find said montaigne that venus after all is nothing more than the pleasure of discharging our vessels just as nature renders pleasurable the discharges from other parts sir thomas more among catholics and luther among protestants said exactly the same thing in other and even clearer words while untold millions of husbands in christendom down to today whether or not they have had the wit to put their theory into a phrase have regularly put it into practice at all events within the consecrated pale of marriage and treated their wives severely and prudently as convenient utensils for the reception of a natural excretion obviously in this view of marriage sexual activity was regarded as an exclusively masculine function in the exercise ofwhich women had merely a passive part to play any active participation on her side thus seemed unnecessary and even unbefitting finally though only in comparatively modern times disgusting and actually degrading thus acton who was regarded half a century ago as the chief english authority on sexual matters declared that happily for society the supposition that women possess sexual feelings could be put aside as a vile aspersion while another medical authority of the same period stated in regard to the most simple physical sign of healthy sexual emotion that it only happens in lascivious women this final triumph of the masculine ideals and rule of life was however only achieved slowly it was the culmination of an elaborate process of training at the outset men had found it impossible to speak too strongly of the wantonness of women this attitude was pronounced among the ancient greeks and prominent in their dramatists christianity again which ended by making women into the chief pillars of the church began by regarding them as the gate of hell again later when in the middle ages this masculine moral order approached the task of subjugating the barbarians of northern europe men were horrified at the licentiousness of those northern women at whose coldness they are now shocked that indeed was as montaigne had seen the central core of conflict in the rule of life imposed by men on woman men were perpetually striving by ways the most methodical the most subtle the most farreaching to achieve a result in women which when achieved men themselves viewed with dismay they may be said to be moved in this sphere by two passions the passion for virtue and the passion for vice but it so happens that both these streams of passion have to be directed at the same fascinating object woman no doubt nothing is more admirable than the skill with which women have acquired the duplicity necessary to play the two contradictory parts thus imposed upon them but in that requirement the play of their natural reactions tended to become paralysed and the delicate mechanism of their instincts often disturbed they were forbidden except in a few carefully etiquetted forms the free play of courtship without which they could not perform their part in the erotic life with full satisfaction either to themselves or their partners they were reduced to an artificial simulation of coldness or of warmth according to the particular stage of the dominating masculine ideal of woman which their partner chanced to have reached but that is an attitude equally unsatisfactory to themselves and to their lovers even when the latter have not sufficient insight to see through its unreality it is an attitude so unnatural and artificial that it inevitably tends to produce a real coldness which nothing can disguise it is true that women whose instincts are not perverted at the roots do not desire to be cold far from it but to dispel that coldness the right atmosphere is needed and the insight and skill of the right man in the erotic sphere a woman asks nothing better of a man than to be lifted above her coldness to the higher plane where there is reciprocal interest and mutual joy in the act of love therein her silent demand is one with natures for the biological order of the world involves those claims which in the human range are the erotic rights of women the social claims of women their economic claims their political claims have long been before the world women themselves have actively asserted them and they are all in process of realisation the erotic claims of women which are at least as fundamental are not publicly voiced and women themselves would be the last to assert them it is easy to understand why that should be so the natural and acquired qualities of women even the qualities developed in the art of courtship have all been utilised in building up the masculine ideal of sexual morality it is on feminine characteristics that this masculine ideal has been based so that women have been helpless to protest against it moreover even if that were not so to formulate such rights is to raise the question whether there so much as exists anything that can be called erotic rights the right to joy cannot be claimed in the same way as one claims the right to put a voting paper in a ballot box a human beings erotic aptitudes can only be developed where the right atmosphere for them exists and where the attitudes of both persons concerned are in harmonious sympathy that is why the erotic rights of women have been the last of all to be attained yet today we see a change here the change required is it has been said a change of attitude and a resultant change in the atmosphere in which the sexual impulses are manifested it involves no necessary change in the external order of our marriage system for as has already been pointed out it was a coincident and not designed part of that order various recent lines of tendency have converged to produce this change of attitude and of atmosphere in part the men of today are far more ready than the men of former days to look upon women as their comrades in the every day work of the world instead of as beings who were ideally on a level above themselves and practically on a level considerably below themselves in part there is the growing recognition that women have conquered many elementary human rights of which before they were deprived and are more and more taking the position of citizens with the same kinds of duties privileges and responsibilities as men in part also it may be added there is a growing diffusion among educated people of a knowledge of the primary facts of life in the two sexes slowly dissipating and dissolving many foolish andoften mischievous superstitions the result is that as many competent observers have noted the young men of today show a new attitude towards women and towards marriage an attitude of simplicity and frankness a desire for mutual confidence a readiness to discuss difficulties an appeal to understand and to be understood such an attitude which had hitherto been hard to attain at once creates the atmosphere in which alone the free spontaneous erotic activities of women can breathe and live this consummation we have seen may be regarded as the attainment of certain rights the corollary of other rights in the social field which women are slowly achieving as human beings on the same human level as men it opens to women on whom is always laid the chief burden of sex the right to the joy and exaltation of sex to the uplifting of the soul which when the right conditions are fulfilled is the outcome of the intimate approach and union of two human beings yet while we may find convenient so to formulate it we need to remember that that is only a fashion of speech for there are no rights in nature if we take a broader sweep what we may choose to call an erotic right is simply the perfect poise of the conflicting forces of life the rhythmic harmony in which generation is achieved with the highest degree of perfection compatible with the make of the world it is our part to transform natures large conception into our own smaller organic mould not otherwise than the plants to whom we are far back akin who dig their flexible roots deep into the moist and fruitful earth and so are able to lift up glorious heads toward the skychapter vi the playfunction of sex when we hear the sexual functions spoken of we commonly understand the performance of an act which normally tends to the propagation of the race when we see the question of sexual abstinence discussed when the desirability of sexual gratification is asserted or denied when the idea arises of the erotic rights and needs of woman it is always the same act with its physical results that is chiefly in mind such a conception is quite adequate for practical working purposes in the social world it enables us to deal with all our established human institutions in the sphere of sex as the arbitrary assumptions of euclid enable us to traverse the field of elementary geometry but beyond these useful purposes it is inadequate and even inexact the functions of sex on the psychic and erotic side are of far greater extension than any act of procreation they may even exclude it altogether and when we are concerned with the welfare of the individual human being we must enlarge our outlook and deepen our insight there are we know two main functions in the sexual relationship or what in the biological sense we term marriage among civilised human beings the primary physiological function of begetting and bearing offspring and the secondary spiritual function of furthering the higher mental and emotional processes these are the main functions of the sexual impulse and in order to understand any further object of the sexual relationshipor even in order to understand all that is involved in the secondary object of marriagewe must go beyond conscious motives and consider the nature of the sexual impulse physical and psychic as rooted in the human organism the human organism as we know is a machine on which excitations from without streaming through the nerves and brain effect internal work and notably stimulate the glandular system in recent years the glandular system and especially that of the ductless glands has taken on an altogether new significance these ductless glands as we know liberate into the blood what are termed hormones or chemical messengers which have a complex but precise action in exciting and developing all those physical and psychic activities which make up a full life alike on the general side and the reproductive side so that their balanced functions are essential to wholesome and complete existence in a rudimentary form these functions may be traced back to our earliest ancestors who possessed brains in those times the predominant sense for arousing the internal mental and emotional faculties was that of smell the other senses being gradually evolved subsequently and it is significant that the pituitary one of the chief ductless glands active in ourselves today was developed out of the nervous centre for smell in conjunction with the membrane of the mouth the energies of the whole organism were set in action through stimuli arising from the outside world by way of the sense of smell in process of time the mechanism has become immensely elaborated yet its healthy activity is ultimately dependent on a rich and varied action and reaction with the external world it is becoming recognised that the tendency to pluriglandular insufficiency with its resulting lack of organic harmony and equilibrium can be counteracted by the physical and psychic stimuli of intimate contacts with the external world in this action and reaction moreover we cannot distinguish between sexual ends and general ends the activities of the ductless glands and their hormones equally serve both ends in ways that cannot be distinguished the individual metabolism as a distinguished authority in this field has expressed it is the reproductive metabolism thus the establishment of our complete activities as human beings in the world is aided by if not indeed ultimately dependent upon a perpetual and manysided play with our environment w blair bell the sexcomplex p this book is a cautious and precise statement of the present state of knowledge on this subject although some of the authors psychological deductions must be treated with circumspection it is thus that we arrive at the importance of the playfunction and thus also we realise that while it extends beyond the sexual sphere it yet definitely includes that sphere there are at least three different ways of understanding the biological function of play there is the conception of play on which groos has elaborately insisted as education the cat plays with the mouse and is thereby educating itself in the skill necessary to catch mice all our human games are a training in qualities that are required in life and that is why in england we continue to attribute to the duke of wellington the saying that the battle of waterloo was won on the playing fields of eton then there is the conception of play as the utilisation in art of the superfluous energies left unemployed in the practical work of life this enlarging and harmonising function of play while in the lower ranges it may be spent trivially leads in the higher ranges to the production of the most magnificent human achievements but there is yet a third conception of play according to which it exerts a direct internal influencehealthgiving developmental and balancingon the whole organism of the player himself this conception is related to the other two and yet distinct for it is not primarily a definite education in specific kinds of lifeconserving skill although it may involve the acquisition of such skill and it is not concerned with the construction of objective works of art althoughby means of contact in human relationshipit attains the wholesome organic effects which may be indirectly achieved by artistic activities it is in this sense that we are here concerned with what we may perhaps best call the playfunction of sex term seems to have been devised by professor maurice parmelee personality and conduct pp the but it is understood by parmelee in a much vaguer and more extended sense than i have used it as thus understood the playfunction of sex is at once in an inseparable way both physical and psychic it stimulates to wholesome activity all the complex and interrelated systems of the organism at the same time it satisfies the most profound emotional impulses controlling in harmonious poise the various mental instincts along these lines it necessarily tends in the end to go beyond its own sphere and to embrace and introduce into the sphere of sex the other two more objective fields of play that of play as education and that of play as artistic creation it may not be true as was said of old time most of our arts and sciences were invented for loves sake but it is certainly true that in proportion as we truly and wisely exercise the playfunction of sex we are at the same time training our personality on the erotic side and acquiring a mastery of the art of love the longer i live the more i realise the immense importance for the individual of the development through the playfunction of erotic personality and for human society of the acquirement of the art of love at the same time i am ever more astonished at the rarity of erotic personality and the ignorance of the art of love even among those men and women experienced in the exercise of procreation in whom we might most confidently expect to find such development and such art at times one feels hopeless at the thought that civilisation in this supremely intimate field of life has yet achieved so little for until it is generally possible to acquire erotic personality and to master the art of loving the development of the individual man or woman is marred the acquirement of human happiness and harmony remains impossible in entering this field indeed we not only have to gain true knowledge but to cast off false knowledge and above all to purify our hearts from superstitions which have no connection with any kind of existing knowledge we have to cease to regard as admirable the man who regards the accomplishment of the procreative act with the pleasurable relief it affords to himself as the whole code of love we have to treat with contempt the woman who abjectly accepts the act and her own passivity therein as the whole duty of love we have to understand that the art of love has nothing to do with vice and the acquirement of erotic personality nothing to do with sensuality but we have also to realise that the art of love is far from being the attainment of a refined and luxurious selfindulgence and the acquirement of erotic personality of little worth unless it fortifies and enlarges the whole personality in all its aspects now all this is difficult and for some people even painful to root up is a more serious matter than to sow it cannot all be done in a day it is not easy to form a clear picture of the erotic life of the average man in our society to the best informed among us knowledge in this field only comes slowly even when we have decided what may or may not be termed average the sources of approach to this intimate sphere remain few and misleading at the best the women a man loves remain far more illuminating sources of information than the man himself the more one knows about him however the more one isconvinced that quite independently of the place we may feel inclined to afford to him in the scale of virtue his conception of erotic personality his ideas on the art of love if they have any existence at all are of a humble character as to the notion of play in the sphere of sex even if he makes blundering attempts to practice it that is for him something quite low down something to be ashamed of and he would not dream of associating it with anything he has been taught to regard as belonging to the spiritual sphere the conception of divine play is meaningless to him his fundamental ideas his cherished ideals in the erotic sphere seem to be reducible to two he wishes to prove that he is a man and he experiences what seems to him the pride of virility in the successful attainment of that proof he finds in the same act the most satisfactory method of removing sexual tension and in the ensuing relief one of the chief pleasures of life it cannot be said that either of these ideals is absolutely unsound each is part of the truth it is only as a complete statement of the truth that they become pathetically inadequate it is to be noted that both of them are based solely on the physical act of sexual conjunction and that they are both exclusively selfregarding so that they are after all although the nearest approach to the erotic sphere he may be able to find yet still not really erotic for love is not primarily selfregarding it is the intimate harmonious combined playthe play in the wide as well as in the more narrow sense we are here concerned withof two personalities it would not be love if it were primarily selfregarding and the act of intercourse however essential to secure the propagation of the race is only an incident and not an essential in love let us turn to the average woman here the picture must usually be still more unsatisfactory the man at least crude as we may find his two fundamental notions to be has at all events attained mental pride and physical satisfaction the woman often attains neither and since the man by instinct or tradition has maintained a selfregarding attitude that is not surprising the husbandby primitive instinct partly certainly by ancient traditionregards himself as the active partner in matters of love and his own pleasure as legitimately the prime motive for activity his wife consequently falls into the complementary position and regards herself as the passive partner and her pleasure as negligible if not indeed as a thing to be rather ashamed of should she by chance experience it so that while the husband is content with a mere simulacrum and pretence of the erotic life the wife has often had none at all few people realisefew indeed have the knowledge or the opportunity to realisehow much women thus lose alike in the means to fulfill their own lives and in the power to help others a woman has a husband she has marital relationships she has children she has all the usual domestic troublesit seems to the casual observer that she has everything that constitutes a fully developed matron fit to play her proper part in the home and in the world yet with all these experiences which undoubtedly are an important part of life she may yet remain on the emotional sideand as a matter of fact frequently remainsquite virginal as immature as a schoolgirl she has not acquired an erotic personality she has not mastered the art of love with the result that her whole nature remains illdeveloped and unharmonised and that she is incapable of bringing her personalityhaving indeed no achieved personality to bringto bear effectively on the problems of society and the world around her that alone is a great misfortune all the more tragic since under favourable conditions which it should have been natural to attain it might so easily be avoided but there is this further result full of the possibilities of domestic tragedy that the wife so situated however innocent however virtuous may at any time find her virginally sensitive emotional nature fertilised by the touch of some other man than her husband it happens so often a girl who has been carefully guarded in the home preserved from evil companions preserved also from what her friends regarded as the contamination of sexual knowledge a girl of high ideals yet healthy and robust is married to a man of whom she probably has little more than a conventional knowledge yet he may by good chance be the masculine counterpart of herself well brought up without sexual experience and ignorant of all but the elementary facts of sex loyal and honourable prepared to be fitted to be a devoted husband the union seems to be of the happiest kind no one detects that anything is lacking to this perfect marriage in course of time one or more children are born but during all this time the husband has never really made love to his wife he has not even understood what courtship in the intimate sense means love as an art has no existence for him he has loved his wife according to his imperfect knowledge but he has never so much as realised that his knowledge was imperfect she on her side loves her husband she comes in time indeed to have a sort of tender maternal feeling for him possibly she feels a little pleasure in intercourse with him but she has never once been profoundly aroused and she has never once been utterly satisfied the deep fountains of her nature have never been unsealed she has never been fertilised throughout her whole nature by their liberating influence her erotic personality has never been developed then something happens perhaps thehusband is called away it may have been to take part in the great war the wife whatever her tender solicitude for her absent partner feels her solitude and is drawn nearer to friends perhaps her husbands friends some man among them becomes congenial to her there need be no conscious or overt lovemaking on either side and if there were the wifes loyalty might be aroused and the friendship brought to an end lovemaking is not indeed necessary the wifes latent erotic needs while still remaining unconscious have come nearer to the surface now that she has grown mature and that they have been stimulated yet unsatisfied for so long they have unknown to herself become insistent and sensitive to a sympathetic touch the friends may indeed grow into lovers and then some sort of solution by divorce or intrigue scarcely however a desirable kind of solutionbecomes possible but we are here taking the highest ground and assuming that honourable feeling domestic affection or a stern sense of moral duty renders such solution unacceptable in due course the husband returns and then to her utter dismay the wife discovers if she has not discovered it before that during his absence and for the first time in her life she has fallen in love she loyally confesses the situation to her husband for whom her affection and attachment remain the same as before for what has happened to her is the coming of a totally new kind of love and not any change in her old love the situation which arises is one of torturing anxiety for all concerned and it is not less so when all concerned are animated by noble and selfsacrificing impulses the husband in his devotion to his wife may even be willing that her new impulses should be gratified she on her side will not think of yielding to desires which seem both unfair to her husband and opposed to all her moral traditions we are not here concerned to consider the most likely or the most desirable exit from this unfortunate situation the points to note are that it is a situation which today actually occurs that it causes acute unhappiness to at least two people who may be of the finest physical and intellectual type and the noblest character and that it might be avoided if there were at the outset a proper understanding of the married state and of the part which the art of love plays in married happiness and the development of personality a woman may have been married once she may have been married twice she may have had children by both husbands and yet it may not be until she is past the age of thirty and is united to a third man that she attains the development of erotic personality and all that it involves in the full flowering of her whole nature up to then she had to all appearance had all the essential experiences of life yet she had remained spiritually virginal with conventionally prim ideas of life narrow in her sympathies with the finest and noblest functions of her soul helpless and bound at heart unhappy even if not clearly realising that she was unhappy now she has become another person the new liberated forces from within have not only enabled her to become sensitive to the rich complexities of intimate personal relationship they have enlarged and harmonised her realisation of all relationships her new erotic experience has not only stimulated all her energies but her new knowledge has quickened all her sympathies she feels at the same time more mentally alert and she finds that she is more alive than before to the influences of nature and of art moreover as others observe however they may explain it a new beauty has come into her face a new radiancy into her expression a new force into all her activities such is the exquisite flowering of love which some of us who may penetrate beneath the surface of life are now and then privileged to see the sad part of it is that we see it so seldom and then often so late it must not be supposed that there is any direct or speedy way of introducing into life a wider and deeper conception of the erotic playfunction and all that it means for the development of the individual the enrichment of the marriage relationship and the moral harmony of society such a supposition would merely be to vulgarise and to stultify the divine and elusive mystery it is only slowly and indirectly that we can bring about the revolution which in this direction would renew life we may prepare the way for it by undermining and destroying those degrading traditional conceptions which have persisted so long that they are instilled into us almost from birth to work like a virus in the heart and to become almost a disease of the soul to make way for the true and beautiful revelation we can at least seek to cast out those ancient growths which may once have been true and beautiful but now are false and poisonous by casting out from us the conception of love as vile and unclean we shall purify the chambers of our hearts for the reception of love as something unspeakably holy in this matter we may learn a lesson from the psychoanalysts of today without any implication that psychoanalysis is necessarily a desirable or even possible way of attaining the revelation of love the wiser psychoanalysts insist that the process of liberating the individual from outer and inner influences that repress or deform his energies and impulses is effected by removing the inhibitions on the freeplay of his nature it is a process of education in the true sense not of the suppression of natural impulses nor even of the instillation of sound rules and maxims for their control not of the pressing in but of the leading out of the individuals special tendencies it removes inhibitions even inhibitions that were placed upon the individual or that he consciously or unconsciously placed upon himself with the best moralintentions and by so doing it allows a larger and freer and more natively spontaneous morality to come into play it has this influence above all in the sphere of sex where such inhibitions have been most powerfully laid on the native impulses where the natural tendencies have been most surrounded by taboos and terrors most tinged with artificial stains of impurity and degradation derived from alien and antiquated traditions thus the therapeutical experience of the psychoanalysts reinforces the lessons we learn from physiology and psychology and the intimate experiences of life for instance hw frink morbid fears and compulsions ch x see sexual activity we see is not merely a bald propagative act nor when propagation is put aside is it merely the relief of distended vessels it is something more even than the foundation of great social institutions it is the function by which all the finer activities of the organism physical and psychic may be developed and satisfied nothing it has been said is so serious as lustto use the beautiful term which has been degraded into the expression of the lowest forms of sensual pleasureand we have now to add that nothing is so full of play as love play is primarily the instinctive work of the brain but it is brain activity united in the subtlest way to bodily activity in the playfunction of sex two forms of activity physical and psychic are most exquisitely and variously and harmoniously blended we here understand best how it is that the brain organs and the sexual organs are from the physiological standpoint of equal importance and equal dignity thus the adrenal glands among the most influential of all the ductless glands are specially and intimately associated alike with the brain and the sex organs as we rise in the animal series brain and adrenal glands march side by side in developmental increase of size and at the same time sexual activity and adrenal activity equally correspond lovers in their playwhen they have been liberated from the traditions which bound them to the trivial or the gross conception of play in loveare thus moving amongst the highest human activities alike of the body and of the soul they are passing to each other the sacramental chalice of that wine which imparts the deepest joy that men and women can know they are subtly weaving the invisible cords that bind husband and wife together more truly and more firmly than the priest of any church and if in the endas may or may not bethey attain the climax of free and complete union then their human play has become one with that divine play of creation in which old poets fabled that out of the dust of the ground and in his own image some god of chaos once created manchapter vii the individual and the race i the relation of the individual person to the species he belongs to is the most intimate of all relations it is a relation which almost amounts to identity yet it somehow seems so vague so abstract as scarcely to concern us at all it is only lately indeed that there has been formulated even so much as a science to discuss this relationship and the duties which when properly understood it throws upon the individual even yet the word eugenics the name of this science and this art sometimes arouses a smile it seems to stand for a modern fad which the superior person or even the ordinary plebeian democrat may pass by on the other side with his nose raised towards the sky modern the science and art of eugenics certainly seem though the term is ancient and the greeks of classic days as well as their successors today used the word eugeneia for nobility or good birth it was chosen by francis galton less than fifty years ago to express the effort of man to improve his own breed but the thing the term stands for is in reality also far from modern it is indeed ancient and may even be nearly as old as man himself consciously or unconsciously sometimes under pretexts that have disguised his motives even from himself man has always been attempting to improve his own quality or at least to maintain it when he slackens that effort when he allows his attention to be too exclusively drawn to other ends he suffers he becomes decadent he even tends to die out primitive eugenics had seldom anything to do with what we call birthcontrol one must not say that it never had even the mysterious mika operation of so primitive a race as the australians has been supposed to be a method of controlling conception but the usual method even of people highly advanced in culture has been simpler they preferred to see the newborn infant before deciding whether it was likely to prove a credit to its parents or to the human race generally and if it seemed not up to the standard they dealt with it accordingly at one time that was regarded as a cruel and even inhuman method today when the most civilised nations of the world have devoted all their best energies to competitive slaughter we may have learnt to view the matter differently if we can tolerate the wholesale murder and mutilation of the finest specimens of our race in the adult possession of all their aptitudes we cannot easily find anything to disapprove in the merciful disposal of the poorest specimens before they have even attained conscious possession of their senses but in any case and whatever we may ourselves be pleased to think or not to think it is certain that some of the most highly developed peoples of the world have practised infanticide it is equally certain that the practise has not proved destructive to the emotions of humanity and affection even some of the lowest human racesas we commonly estimate themwhile finding it necessary to put aside a certain proportion of their newborn infants expend a degree of love and even indulgence on the children they bring up which is rarely found among socalled civilised nations there is no need however to consider whether or not infanticide is humane we are all agreed that it is altogether unnecessary and that it is seldom that even that incipient form of infanticide called abortion still so popular among us need be resorted to our aim nowso far at all events as mere ideals gois not to destroy life but to preserve it we seek to improve the conditions of life and to render unnecessary the premature death of any human creature that has once drawn breath it is indeed just here that we find a certain clash between the modern view of life and the view of earlier civilisations the ancients were less careful than we claim to be of the individual but they were more careful of the race they cultivated eugenics after their manner though it was a manner which we reprobate we pride ourselves rightly or wrongly on our care for the individual during all the past century we claim to have been strenuously working for an amelioration of the environment which will make life healthier and pleasanter for the individual but in the concentration of our attention on this altogether desirable end which we are still far from having adequately attained we have lost sight of that larger end the wellbeing of the race and the amelioration of life itself not merely of the conditions of life the most we hope is that somehow the improvement of the conditions of the individual will incidentally improve the stock these our practical ideals which have flourished for a century past arose out of the great french revolution and were inspired by the maxim of that revolution as formulated by rousseau that all men are born equal that maxim was overthrown half a century ago the great biological movement of science initiated by darwin showed that it was untenable all men are not born equal everyone agrees about that now but nevertheless the momentum of the earlier movement was so powerfulthat we still go on acting as though all men are and always will be born equal and that we need not trouble ourselves about heredity but only about the environment but this statement must not be left without important qualification thus the ancient greeks as moïssidès has shown in janus not only their philosophers and statesmen but also their women often took the most enlightened interest in eugenics and moreover showed it in practice they were in many respects far in advance of us they clearly realised for instance the need of a proper interval between conceptions not only to ensure the health of women but also the vigour of the offspring it is natural that among every fine race eugenics should be almost an instinct or they would cease to be a fine race it is equally natural that among our modern degenerates eugenics is an unspeakable horror however much as the psychoanalysts would put it they rationalise that horror the way out of this clash of idealswhich has compelled us to hope impossibilities from the environment because we dreaded what seemed the only alternativeis as we know furnished by birthcontrol an unqualified reliance on the environment making it ever easier and easier for the feeblest and most defective to be born and survive could only in the long run lead to the degeneration of the whole race the knowledge of the practice of birthcontrol gives us the mastery of all that the ancients gained by infanticide while yet enabling us to cherish that ideal of the sacredness of human life which we profess to honour so highly the main difficulty is that it demands a degree of scientific precision which the ancients could not possess and might dispense with so long as they were able to decide the eugenic claims of the infant by actual inspection we have to be content to determine not what the infant is but when it be likely to be and that involves a knowledge of the laws of heredity which we are only learning slowly to acquire we may all in our humble ways help to increase that knowledge by giving it greater extension and more precision through the observations we are able to make on our own families to such observations galton attached great importance and strove in various ways to further them detailed records physical and mental beginning from birth are still far from being as common as is desirable although it is obvious that they possess a permanent personal and family private interest in addition to their more public scientific value we do not need and it would indeed be undesirable to emulate in human breeding the achievements of a luther burbank we have no right to attempt to impose on any human creature an exaggerated and onesided development but it is not only our right it is our duty or rather one may say the natural impulse of every rational and humane person to seek that only such children may be born as will be able to go through life with a reasonable prospect that they will not be heavily handicapped by inborn defect or special liability to some incapacitating disease what is called positive eugenicsthe attempt that is to breed special qualitiesmay well be viewed with hesitation but socalled negative eugenicsthe effort to clear all inborn obstacles out of the path of the coming generationdemands our heartiest sympathy and our best cooperation for as galton the founder of modern eugenics wrote towards the end of his life of this new science its first object is to check the birthrate of the unfit instead of allowing them to come into being though doomed in large numbers to perish prematurely we can seldom be absolutely sure what stocks should not propagate and what two stocks should on no account be blended but we can attain reasonable probability and it is on such probabilities in every department of life that we are always called upon to act it is often saidi have said it myselfthat birthcontrol when practised merely as a limitation of the family scarcely suffices to further the eugenic progress of the race if it is not deliberately directed towards the elimination of the worst stocks or the worst possibilities in the blending of stocks it may even tend to diminish the better stocks since it is the better stocks that are least likely to propagate at random this is true if other conditions remain equal it is evident however that the other conditions will not remain equal for no evidence has yet been brought forward to show that birthcontrol even when practised without regard to eugenic considerationsdoubtless the usual rule up to the presenthas produced any degeneration of the race on the contrary the evidence seems to show that it has improved the race the example of holland is often brought forward as evidence in favour of such a tendency of birthcontrol since in that country the widespread practise of birthcontrol has been accompanied by an increase in the health and stature of the people as well as an increase in their numbers to a remarkable degree for the fall in the birthrate has been far more than compensated by the fall in the deathrate while it is said that the average height of the population has increased by four inches it is indeed quite possible to see why although theoretically a random application of birthcontrol cannot affect the germinal possibilities of a community in practise it may improve the somatic conditions under which the germinal elements develop there will probably be a longer interval between the births of the children which has been demonstrated by ewart and others to be an important factor not only in preserving the health of the mother but in increasing the health and size of the child the diminution in the number of the children renders it possible to bestow a greater amount of care on each child moreover the better economic position of the father due to the smaller number ofindividuals he has to support makes it possible for the family to live under improved conditions as regards nourishment hygiene and comfort the observance of birthcontrol is thus a far more effective lever for raising the state of the social environment and improving the conditions of breeding than is direct action on the part of the community in its collective capacity to attain the same end for however energetic such collective action may be in striving to improve general social conditions by municipalising or statesupporting public utilities it can never adequately counterbalance the excessive burden and wasteful expenditure of force placed on a family by undue childproduction it can only palliate them when however we have found reason to believe that even if practised without regard to eugenic considerations birthcontrol may yet act beneficially to promote good breeding we begin to realise how great a power it may possess when consciously and deliberately directed towards that end in eugenics as already pointed out there are two objects that may be aimed at one called positive eugenics that seeks to promote the increase of the best stocks amongst us the other called negative eugenics which seeks to promote the decrease of the worst stocks our knowledge is still too imperfect to enable us to pursue either of these objects with complete certainty this is especially so as regards positive eugenics and since it seems highly undesirable to attempt to breed human beings as we do animals for points when we are in the presence of what seem to us our finest human stocks physically morally and intellectually it is our wisest course just to leave them alone as much as we can the best stocks will probably be also those best able to help themselves and in so doing to help others but that is obviously not so as regards the worst stocks it is therefore fortunate that the aim here seems a little clearer there are still many abnormal conditions of which we cannot say positively that they are injurious to the race and that we should therefore seek to breed them out but there are other conditions so obviously of evil import alike to the subjects themselves and to their descendants that we cannot have any reasonable doubt about them there is for instance epilepsy which is known to be transformed by heredity into various abnormalities dangerous alike to their possessors and to society there are also the pronounced degrees of feeblemindedness which are definitely heritable and not only condemn those who reveal them to a permanent inaptitude for full life but constitute a subtle poison working through the social atmosphere in all directions and lowering the level of civilisation in the community nowhere has this been so thoroughly studied and so clearly proved as in the united states it is only necessary to mention dr cb davenport of the department of experimental evolution at cold spring harbor new york who has carried on so much research in regard to the heredity of epilepsy and other inheritable abnormal conditions and dr goddard of vineland new jersey whose work has illustrated so fully the hereditary relationships of feeblemindedness the united states moreover has seen the development of the system of social fieldwork which has rendered possible a more complete knowledge of family heredity than has ever before been possible on a large scale it is along such lines as these that our knowledge of the eugenic conditions of life will grow adequate and precise enough to form an effective guide to social conduct nature and a due attention to laws of heredity in life will then rank in equal honour to our eyes with nurture or that attention to the environmental conditions of life which we already regard as so important a regard to nurture has led us to spend the greatest care on the preservation not only of the fit but the unfit while meantime it has wisely suggested to us the desirability of segregating or even of sterilising the unfit but the study of nature leads us further and as galton said eugenics rests on bringing no more individuals into the world than can be properly cared for and these only of the best stocks that is to say that the only instrument by which eugenics can be made practically effective in the modern world is birthcontrol it is not scientific research alone nor even the wide popular diffusion of knowledge that will suffice to bring eugenics and birthcontrol singly or in their due combination into the course of our daily lives they need to be embodied in our instinctive impulses galton considered that eugenics must become a factor of religion and be regarded as a sacred and virile creed while ellen key holds that the religions of the past must be superseded by a new religion which will be the awakening of the whole of humanity to a consciousness of the holiness of generation for my own part i scarcely consider that either eugenics or birthcontrol can be regarded as properly a part of religion being of virtue and not of grace they belong more naturally to the sphere of morals but here they certainly need to go far deeper than the mere intelligence of the mind can take them they cannot become guides to conduct until their injunctions have been printed on the fleshy tablets of our hearts the demands of the race must speak from within us in the voice of conscience which we disobey at our peril when that happens with regard to ascertained laws of racial wellbeing we may know that we are truly following even though not in the letter those great spirits like galton with his intellectual vision and ellen key with her inspired enthusiasm who have pointed out new roads for the ennoblement of the race iiit may be well before we go further to look a little more closely into the suspicion and dislike which eugenics still arouses in many worthy oldfashioned people to some extent that attitude is excused not only by the mistakes which in a new and complex science must inevitably be made even by painstaking students but also by the rash and extravagant proposals of irresponsible and eccentric persons claiming without warrant to speak in the name of eugenics two thousand years ago the wild excesses of some early christians furnished an excuse for the ancient world to view christianity with contempt although the extreme absence of such excesses has furnished still better ground for the modern world to maintain the same view today such a work as le haras humain the human studfarm of dr binetsanglé putting forward proposals which whether beneficial or not will certainly find no one to carry them out similarly furnishes an excuse to those who would reject eugenics altogether utopian schemes have their value we should be able to find inspiration in the most modern of them just as we still do in platos immortal republic but in this as in other matters we must exercise a little intelligence we must not confuse the brilliant excursion of some solitary thinker with the wellgrounded proposals of those who are concerned with the sober possibilities of actual life in our own time people who are incapable of exercising a little shrewd commonsense in the affairs of life and are in the habit of emptying out the baby with the bath had better avoid touching the delicate problems connected with practical eugenics there is one prejudice already mentioned due to lack of clear thinking which deserves more special consideration because it is widespread among the socialistic democracy of several countries as well as among social reformers and is directed alike against eugenics and birthcontrol this prejudice is based on the ground that bad economic conditions and an unwholesome environment are the source of all social evils and that a better distribution of wealth or a vast scheme of social welfare is the one thing necessary when that is achieved all other things being added unto us without any further trouble on our part it is certainly impossible to overrate the importance of the economic factor in society or of a good environment and it is true that eugenics alone like birthcontrol alone can effect little if the economic basis of society is unsound but it is equally certain that the economic factor can never in itself suffice for fine living or even as a cureall of social and racial diseases its value is not that it can effect these things but that it furnishes the favourable conditions for effecting them he would be foolish indeed who went to the rich to find the example of good breeding and as is well known it is not with the rich that the future of the race lies the fact is that under any economic system the responsible personal direction of the individual and the family remain equally necessary and no progress is possible so long as the individual casts all responsibility away from himself on to the social group he forms part of the social group after all is merely himself and the likes of himself he is merely shifting the burden from his individual self to his collective self and in so doing he loses more than he gains thus there is always a sound core in that individualism which has been preached so long and practised so energetically especially in englishspeaking lands however great the abuse involved in its excesses it is still in the name of individualism that the most brilliant antagonists of eugenics and of birthcontrol are wont to direct their attacks the counsel of selfcontrol and foresight in procreation the restriction necessary to purify and raise the standard of the race seem to the narrow and shortsighted advocates of a great principle an unwarrantable violation of the sacred rights of their individual liberty they have not yet grasped the elementary fact that the rights of the individual are the rights of all individuals and that individualism itself calls for a limitation of the freedom of the individual that is why even the most uncompromising individualist must recognise an element of altruism call it whatever name you will collectivism socialism communism or merely the vague and longsuffering term democracy one cannot assume individualism for oneself unless one assumes it for the many that is a great truth which goes to the heart of the whole complex problem of eugenics and birthcontrol as perrycoste has well argued biology is altogether against the narrow individualism which seeks to oppose collective individualism for if in accordance with the most careful modern investigations we recognise that heredity is supreme that the qualities we have inherited from our ancestors count for more in our lives than anything we have acquired by our own personal efforts then we have to admit that the capable mans wealth is more the communitys property than his own and similarly the incapable mans poverty is more the communitys concern than his own so that neither the capable nor the incapable are entitled to an unqualified power of freedom and neither likewise are justly liable to be burdened by an unqualified responsibility it is the duty of the community to draw on the powers of the fit and equally its duty to care for the unfit in this way perrycoste whose attitude is that of the rationalist is led by science to a conclusion which is that of the christian we are all members each of the other and still more are we members of those who went before us the generations preceding us have not died to themselves but live in us and we whom they produced live in each other and in those who will come after usthe problems of eugenics and of birthcontrol affect us all in the face of these problems it is the voice of man that speaks inasmuch as ye did it not unto the least of these my brethren ye did it not unto me however firmly we base ourselves on the principles of individualism we are inevitably brought to the fundamental facts of eugenics which if we fail to recognise our individualism becomes of no effect perrycoste politics and science science progress jan fh but it is the same with socialism or by whatever name we chose to call the collectivist activities of the community in social reform socialism also brings us up against the hard rock of eugenic fact which if we neglect it will dash our most beautiful social construction to fragments it is the more necessary to point this out since it is on the socialist and democratic side much more frequently than on the individualist side that we find an indifferent or positively hostile attitude towards eugenic considerations put social conditions on a sound basis the people on this side often say let all receive an adequate economic return for their work and be recognised as having a claim for an adequate share in the products of society and there is no need to worry about the race or about the need for birthcontrol all will go well of itself there is not the slightest ground for any such comfortable belief this has been well shown by dr eden paul himself a socialist and even in sympathy with the extreme left after setting forth the present conditions with our excessive elimination of higher types and undue multiplication of lower types the racial degeneration caused by the faulty and antiselective working of the marriage system in modern capitalist society so that in our existing civilisation unconscious natural selection has largely ceased to work towards the improvement of the human breed he proceeds to consider the possible remedies the frequent impatience of the socialist and social reformers generally with eugenic proposals has a certain degree of justification in the fact that many evils thoughtlessly attributed to inferiority of stock are really due to bad environment but when the environment has been so far improved that all defects due to its badness are removed we shall be face to face without possibility of doubt with bad inheritance as the sole remaining factor in the production of inefficient and antisocial members of the community a socialist community must recognise the right to work and to maintenance of all its members eden paul points out but he adds a community which allowed this right to all defectives without imposing any restrictions in their perpetuation of themselves would deserve all the evils that would fall upon it it is quite clear how intolerable the burden of these evils would be a state that provided an adequate subsistence for all alike the inefficient as well as the efficient would encourage a racial degeneration from excessive multiplication of the unfit far more dangerous even than that of today ability to earn the minimum wage eden paul argues in agreement with hg wells must be the condition of the right to become a parent unless the socialist is a eugenist as well the socialist state will speedily perish from racial degradation in an essay on eugenics birth control and socialism in population and birthcontrol a symposium edited by eden and cedar paul this is here and there beginning to be recognised thus not long ago the hereford war pensions committee resolved not to issue a maternal grant for children born during a prolonged period of treatment allowance such a measure of course fails to meet the situation for it is obvious that when born the children must be cared for but it shows a glimmering recognition of the facts and the people capable of such a recognition will in time come to see that the right way of meeting the situation is not to neglect the children but to prevent their conception mothers clinics for instruction in such prevention are now being established in england through the advocacy of mrs margaret sanger and the actual initiative of dr marie stopes thus it is essential that the eugenist dealing with the hereditary factor of life and the social reformer or socialist dealing with the environmental factor should supplement each others work neither can attain his end without the others help for the eugenist alone cannot overcome the environmental factor even perhaps increases it if he is an individualist in the narrow sense and the socialist alone cannot overcome the bad hereditary factor and will even increase it if he is no more than a socialist the more socialist our state becomes the more essential becomes at the same time the adoption of eugenic practices as a working part of the state socialism and eugenics must go hand in hand perrycoste from his own point of view has independently reached the same conclusions he is not indeed concerned with any socialist community of the future but with the dangerous results which must inevitably follow the already established methods of social reform in our modern civilised states unless they are speedily checked by effective action based on eugenic knowledge if he observes the community is to shoulder half or threequarters of the burden of sustaining those degenerates who through no fault of their own are congenitally incompetent to maintain themselves indecent comfort and is to render the lifepilgrimage of these unfortunates tolerable instead of a dreary nightmare if it is to assume paternal charge of all the tens or hundreds of thousands of children whose parents cannot or will not provide adequately for them and is to guarantee to all such children as much education as they are capable of receiving and a really fair start in life then in sheer selfpreservation the community must insist on and rigidly enforce its absolute claim to secure that no degeneracy or inheritable congenital defects shall persist beyond the present generation of degenerates and that the community of fifty or seventy years hence shall have no incubus of mentally or morally or even physically degenerate membersnone but a few occasional sporadic morbid sports from the normal which it in turn may effectively prevent from handing on their like unless the problem is squarely faced perrycoste concludes national deterioration must increase and a permanently successful collectivist society is inherently impossible we are not now concerned with the details of any policy of eugenics and of birthcontrol which i couple together because although a random birthcontrol by no means involves much if any eugenic progress it is not easy under modern conditions to conceive any practical or effective policy of eugenics except through the instrumentation of birthcontrol we here take it for granted that in this field the slow progress of scientific knowledge must be our guide premature legislation rash and uninstructed action will not lead to progress but are more likely to delay it yet even with imperfect knowledge it is already of the first importance to evoke interest in the great issue here at stake and to do all that we can to arouse the individual conscience of every man and woman to his or her personal responsibility in this matter that is here all taken for granted it seems necessary to consider the political aspect of eugenics because that aspect is frequently invoked and a mans attitude towards this question is frequently determined beforehand by what he considers that individualism or socialism demands we see that when the question is driven home our political attitude makes no difference it is only a shallow individualism it is only a still more shallow socialism which imagines that under modern social conditions the fundamental racial questions can be left to answer themselves iii many years before the great war in all the most civilised countries of the world there were those who raised the cry of racesuicide in america this cry was more especially popularised by the powerful voice of theodore roosevelt but in european countries there were similar voices raised in tones of virtuous indignation to denounce the same crime since the war other voices have been raised in even more highpitched and feverish tones but now they are less weighty and responsible voices since to those who realise that at present there is not food enough to keep the population of the world from starvation it seems hardly compatible with sanity to advocate an increased rate of human production now though it is easy to do so we must not belittle this cry of racesuicide it is not usually accompanied by definite argument but it assumes that birthcontrol is the method of such suicide and that the first and most immediately dangerous result is that ones own nation whichever that may be is placed in a position of alarming military inferiority to other nations as a step towards the final extinction it is useless to deny that it really is a serious matter if there is danger of the speedy disappearance of the human race from the earth by its own voluntary and deliberate action and that within a measurable period of timefor if it were an immeasurable period there would be no occasion for any acute anxiety the last man will perish from the world this is what racesuicide means and we must face the fact squarely it can scarcely be said however that the meaning of racesuicide has actually been squarely faced by those who have most vehemently raised that cry translated into more definite and precise terms this cry means and is intended to mean we want more births that is what it definitely means and sometimes in the minds of those who make this demand it seems also to imply nothing more yet it implies a great number of other things it implies certain strain and probable illhealth on the mothers it implies distress and disorder in the family it implies even if the additional child survives a more acute industrial struggle and it further involves in this case by the stimulus it gives to overpopulation the perpetual menace of militarism and war what however even at the outset more births most distinctly and most unquestionably imply is more deaths it is nowadays so well known that a high birthrate is accompanied by a high deathratethe exceptions are too few to need attentionthat it is unnecessary to adduce further evidence it is only the intoxicated enthusiasts of the racesuicide cry who are able to overlook a fact of which they can hardly be ignorant the model which they hold up for the publics inspiration has on the obverse more births but on the reverse it bears more deaths it would be helpful to the public and might even be wholesome for our enthusiasts own enlightenment if they would occasionally turn the medal round and slightly vary the monotony of their propaganda by changing its formand crying out for more deaths it is a hard thing said johnny dunn for a man that has a house full of children to be left to the mercy of almighty god if however we wish to consider the real significance of the facts without regard for the wild cries of ignorant cranks it is scarcely necessary to point out here that neither the birthrate taken by itself nor the deathrate taken by itself will suffice to give us any measure even of the growth of the population to say nothing of the progress of civilisation or the happiness of humanity it is obvious that we must consider both gains and losses and put one against the other if we wish to ascertain the net result we may roughly get a notion of what that result is by deducting the deathrate from the birthrate and calling the remainder the survivalrate if we are really concerned with the question of the alleged suicide of the race and do not wish to be befooled we must pay little attention to the birthrate for that by itself means nothing we must concentrate on the survivalrate then we may soon convince ourselves not only that the human race is not committing suicide but that not even a single one of the socalled civilised nations of which it is mainly composed is committing suicide quite the contrary every one of them even france where this peculiar suicide is supposed to be most actively at work is yearly increasing in numbers it is interesting to note moreover that the french have been increasing faster that is to say the survivalrate has been higher in recent years just before the war when the birthrate was at its lowest than they were twenty years earlier with a higher birthrate and if we take a wider sweep and consider the growth of the french population towards the end of the eighteenth century we find the birthrate estimated at the very high figure of but the deathrate was nearly as high the average duration of life was only half what it is now so that the survivalrate in france at that time with widely different rates of birth and death was not much unlike it is now the recent french birthrate of and less which automatically causes the racesuicide marionette to dance with rage is producing not far from the same result in growth of the populationwe are not here concerned with the enormous difference in well being and happinessas the extremely high rate of which sends our marionettes leaping to the sky with joy in wartime england in the birthrate sank to yet the deathrate was at and the increase of the population continued the more the human race commits this kind of suicide one is tempted to exclaim the faster it grows it is however in the new worldas in canada australia and new zealandthat we find the most impressive evidence of the real criteria of the growth in population set up for judgment on the racial suicide cranks canadian statistics bring out many points instructive even in their variation here we see not only unusual curves of rise and fall but also pronounced differences due to the special peculiarities of the french population most clearly in the province of quebec but also in some parts of the province of ontario in quebec the birthrate some years ago was and the deathrate both rates high and the survivalrate high at recently the birthrate has risen to and the deathrate fallen to with the result that the survivalrate of is the highest in the world though it must be noted that the high birthrate is not likely to last long since in quebec as elsewhere in the world increasing urbanisation causes a decreasing birthrate in mainly englishspeaking ontario the birthrate is much lower about but the deathrate is also lower about so that the fairly considerable survivalrate of is obtained but we note the highly significant fact that some thirty years or more ago the birthrate was much lower about and yet the survivalrate was almost nearly as high as today the deathrate was then at and nothing could be more instructive as to the real relationship that holds in this matter there has been a great rise in the birthrate and the only result as someone has remarked is a great increase in the population of the graveyards equally instructive is it to compare various cities in this same province living under the same laws and fairly similar social conditions in the report of the registrargeneral of ontario for i find that highest in birthrate of cities in the province stands ottawa with a very considerable french population but first also stands the same city for infant mortality which is three times greater than in some other cities in the province with a low birthrate sault ste marie again with an enormous birthrate stands third for infant mortality canada shows us that even if we regard the crude desire for a large growth of population as reasonableand that is a considerable assumptiona high birthrate is an uncertain prop to rest on canada is an instructive example because we have some ground for believing that the difference between the englishspeaking and frenchspeaking populationsthe greater care of the former in procreation and the more recklessly destructive methods of the latter in attaining the same endsare due to their different attitudes towards the use of methods of birthcontrol what the result of a general use of such methods is we know from the example already mentioned of holland where they are taught officially recognised and in general use not only among the rich but among the poor the result is that the birthrate has been falling slowly and steadily for forty years but the deathratehas also been falling and at a greater rate so that the more the birthrate has fallen the higher has been the rate of increase among the population it is perhaps in australia and new zealand that we find the most satisfactory proofs of the benefits of a falling birthrate in relation to racesuicide the evidence may well appeal to us the more since it is precisely here that the racesuicide fanatic finds freest scope for his wrath he looks gleefully at china with its prolific women at russia with its magnificent birthrate before the war of nearly at roumania with its birthrate of at chile and jamaica with nearly no nonsense about birthcontrol there no shirking by women of the sacred duties of perpetual maternity no immoral notions about claims to happiness and desires for culture and then he turns from those great centres of prosperity and civilisation to australia to new zealand and his voice is choked and tears fill his eyes as he sees the goal of racesuicide nearly in sight and the spectre of the last man rising before him for there is no doubt about it australia and new zealand contain a population which is gradually reaching the highest point yet known of democratic organisation and general social wellbeing and the birthrate has been falling with terrific speed sixtyyears ago in the australian commonwealth it was nearly only forty years ago in new zealand it was now it is only about in both lands yet the survivalrate the actual growth of the population is not so very much less with this low birthrate than it was with the high birthrate for the deathrate has also fallen in both lands to about in new zealand to which is lower than any other country in the world the result is that australia and new zealand where so it is claimed preventives of conception are hawked from door to door instead of being awful examples of racesuicide actually present the highest rate of raceincrease in the world only excepting canada where it is less firmly and less healthily based nearly twice that of great britain and able at the present rate to double itself every years so much for racesuicide the outcry about racesuicide is so far away from the real facts of life that it is not easy to take it seriously however solemn ones natural temperament may be we are concerned with people who arrogantly claim to direct the moral affairs of the world even in the most intimately private matters and who are yet ignorant of the most elementary facts of the world unable to think not even able to count we can only greet them with a smile but this question has nevertheless a genuinely serious aspect and i should be sorry even to touch on the question of birthcontrol in relation to racesuicide without making that serious aspect clear racesuicide we know has no existence not only is the race as a whole increasing in number especially its white branches but even among the separate national groups there is not even one civilised people anywhere in the world that is decreasing in number on the contrary they are all even france increasing at a more or less rapid rate in england and wales for example where the birthrate has steadily fallen during the last forty years from to i disregard the abnormal rates of wartime the population is still increasing and even if the present falls in birthrate and deathrate continue it will for years still go on increasing by an excess of over births a day when we realise that this is merely what goes on in one corner of the world and must be multiplied enormously to represent the whole we shall find it impossible even to conceive the prodigious flow of excess babies which is being constantly poured over the earth if we are capable of realising all the problems which thereby arise we must be forced to ask ourselves is this state of things desirable be ye fruitful and multiply that command was according to the old story delivered to a world inhabited by eight people it has been handed down to a world in which it has long been ridiculously out of place and has become merely the excuse for criminal recklessness among a race which has chosen to forget that the command was qualified by a solemn admonition at the hand of man even at the hand of every mans brother will i require the life of man the high birthrate has meant a vast slaughter of infants it has meant moreover a perpetual oppression of the workers disease starvation and death among the adult population it has meant further a bloodthirsty economic competition militarism warfare it has meant that all civilisation has from time to time become a thin crust over a volcano of revolution and the human race has gone on lightly dancing there striving to forget that ancient warning from a soul of things even deeper than the voice of jehovah at the hand of man will i require the life of man men have recklessly followed the will o the wisp which represented mere multiplication of their inefficient selves as the ideal of progress quantity before quality the notion that in an orgy of universal procreation could consist the highest good of humanity the great war that is scarcely yet merged into an only less warlike peace has brought at least the small compensation that it has led men to look in the face this insane ideal of human progress we see today what has come of it and the further evils yet to come of it are being embodied beneath our eyes so that at last the voice of jehovah has here and there been faintly heard even where nowadays we had grown least accustomed to hear it in the churches it is dr ingethe dean of londons cathedral of st pauls a distinguished churchman and at the same time a foremost champion of eugenics who lately expressed the hope that the world especially the european world would one day realise the advantages of a stationary population such a recognition such an aspiration indicates that a new hope is dawning on the worlds horizon and a higher ideal growing within the human soul the mad competition of the industrial world during the past century with the sordid gloom and wretchedness of it for all who were able to see beneath the surface has shown for ever what comes of the effort to produce a growing population by high birthrates in peacetime the great war of a later day has shown let us hope in an equally decisive manner what comes to a world where men have been for long generations produced so copiously and so cheaply that it is natural to regard them as only fit to sweep off the earth with machine guns and the whole world of todaywith its starving millions struggling in vain to feed themselves with most of its natural beauty swept away by the ravages of man and many of its most exquisite animals finally exterminatedis likely to become merely the monument to an ideal that failed it was time however late in the day for a return to commonsense it was time to realise that the ideal of mere propagation could lead us nowhere but to destruction on that level we cannot compete even with the lowest of organised things not even with the bacteria which in number and in rapidity of multiplication are inconceivable to us all hope abandon ye that enter here is written over the portal of this path of progress this has long been recognised by men of science even anyone with the slightest knowledge of biology professor bateson remarked in a british association presidential address in is aware that a population need not be declining because it is not increasing in normal stable conditions population is stationary major leonard darwin the thoughtful and cautious president of the eugenics education society has lately stated his considered belief population and civilisation economic journal june that increase in numbers means ultimately relative reduction of wealth per head with consequent lowering of the standard of civilisation that it also under existing conditions involves the production of a smaller proportion of men of ability and further a depreciation of our traditions he concludes that whatever element in civilisation we regardwealth or stock or traditionsany increase in the population such as that now taking place will be accompanied by a lowering in the standard of our civilisation there are definite reasons why real progress in the supreme tasks of civilisation can best be made by a more or less stationary population whether the population is large or small and it need scarcely be added that so far as the history of mankind is yet legible the great advances in civilisation have been made by small even very small populations where the population is rapidly growing even if it is growing under the favourable conditions that hardly ever accompany such growth all its energy is absorbed in adjusting its perpetually shifting equilibrium it cannot succeed in securing the right conditions of growth because its growth is never ceasing to demand new conditions the structure of its civilisation never rises above the foundations because these foundations have perpetually to be laid afresh and there is never time to get further it is a process moreover accompanied by unending friction and disorder by strains and stresses of all kinds which are fatal to any full harmonious and democratic civilisation the population question with the endlessly mischievous readjustment it demands must be eliminated before the great house of life can be built up on a strong solid human foundation to lift its soaring pinnacles towards the skies that is what many bitter experiences are beginning to teach us in the future we are likely to be much less concerned about racesuicide though we can never be too concerned about racemurder when we think however of the desirability of a more or less stationary population in order to insure real social progress as distinct from that vain struggle of meaningless movement to and fro which the history of the past reveals we have to be clear in our minds that it may be far from desirable that the present overgrown population of the world should be stationary that might indeed be better than further increase in numbers it would arrest the growth of our present evils it might open the way to methods by which they would be diminished or eliminated but the process would be infinitely difficult and almost infinitely slow as we may easily realise when we consider that with a population even smaller than at present the human race has not only ravished the worlds beauty almost out of existence but so ravaged its own vital spirit that as was found with some consternation during the great war a large proportion of the male population of every country is unfit for military service so often we hear it assumed or even asserted that greatness means quantity so that to look forward to the replacement of the present teeming insignificant human myriads by a rarer and more truly greater race is to be a pessimist oh these optimists to revel in a world which more and more closely resembles all that the poets ever imagined of hell is to be an optimist one wonders how it is that in no brief moment of lucidity it occurs to these peoplethat the lower we descend in the scale of life the greater the quantity in a species and the poorer the quality so that to reach what such people should really regard as the worlds period of supreme greatness in life we must go back to the days before animal life appeared when the earth was merely a teeming mass of bacteria for instance hf osborn the origin and evolution of life chapter iii see today we are often told the majority of human beings belong either to the undesired class or the undesirable class to realise that this is so we are bidden to read the newspapers or to walk along the streets of the citieswhichever they may bewherein dwell the highest products of our civilisation in the better class quarters it is indeed the undesirable class that seems to predominate and in the poor quarters the undesired yet viewing our species as a whole the two classes may be seen to walk hand in hand along the same road and in proportion as our nobler instincts germinate and develop we must doubtless admit that it ought to be our active aim to make that road for both of themsocially though not individuallythe road to destruction to stem the devastating tide of human procreativeness however easy as it may seem in theory is by no means so easy as some think especially as those think who believe that the human race stands on the brink of suicide for there is this about it that we must never forget the majority of those born today die before their time so that by diminishing the production of the unfit as well as by the progressive improvement of the environment that automatically accompanies such diminution we may make an imposing difference in the appearance of the birthrate whilst yet the population goes on increasing rapidly probably even more rapidly than before it needs a most radical and thorough attack on the birthrate before we can make any real impression on the rate of increase of the population to say nothing of its real reduction there is still an arduous road before us true it is that we have two opposing schools of thought which both say that we need not or that we cannot make any difference by our efforts to regulate the earths human population according to one view the development of population together with the necessity for war which is inextricably mixed up with a developing population cannot be effected without as one champion of the doctrine is pleased to put it shattering both the structure of euclidean space and the psychological laws upon which the existence of selfconsciousness and human society are conditional in simpler words populations tend to become too large for their territories so that war ensues and birthcontrol can do nothing because it is doubtful whether a group in the plenitude of vigour and selfconsciousness can deliberately stop its own growth the other school proclaims human impotence on exactly opposite grounds there is not the slightest reason it declares to believe that birthcontrol has had any but a completely negligible influence on population this is a natural process and fertility is automatically adjusted to the deathrate whenever a population reaches a certain stage of civilisation and nervous development its procreativeness quite apart from any effort of the will tends to diminish the seeming effect of birthcontrol is illusory it is nature not human effort which is at work fuller the mechanical basis of war hibbert journal bag shirley murphy some years ago lancet aug argued that the fall of the birthrate as also that of sir the deathrate has been largely effected by natural causes independent of mans action mr g udney yule the fall in the birthrate also believes that birthcontrol counts for little the chief factor being natural fluctuations probably of economic nature recently mr ce pell in his book the law of births and deaths has made a more elaborate and systematic attempt to show that the rise and fall of the birthrate has hitherto been independent of human effort these two opposing councils of despair each proclaiming though in a contrary sense the vanity of human wishes in the matter of procreation might well some may think be left to neutralise each other and evaporate in air but it seems worth while to point out that with proper limitations and qualifications there is an element of truth in each of them while without such limitations and qualifications both are alike obviously absurd and wrongheaded undoubtedly as the one school holds in certain stages of civilisation even at a fairly advanced stage nations tend to break out over their frontiers with resulting war but the period when they reach the plenitude of vigour and selfconsciousness is exactly the period when the birthrate begins to decline and the population deliberately or instinctively controls its own increase that has for instance been the history of france since the great expansion of population roughly associated with the napoleonic epopeewhich doubtless covered a web of causes sanitary political industrial favourable to a real numerical increase of the nationhad died down slowly to the level we witness today similarly with regard to the opposing school we must undoubtedly accept a natural fall in the birthrate with a rising civilisation that has alwaysbeen visible in highly civilised individual couples and it is an easily ascertainable zoological fact that throughout the evolution of life procreativeness has decreased with the increased development of species we may agree that a natural factor comes into the recent fall in the human birthrate but to argue that because a natural decline in birthrate is the essential factor in the slowing down of procreative activity with all higher evolution therefore deliberate birthcontrol counts for nothing since exactly the same result follows when voluntary prevention is adopted and when it is not seems highly absurd we must at least admit that voluntary birthcontrol is an important contributory cause in some sense indeed of supreme importance because it is within mans own power and because man is thus enabled to guide and mould processes of nature which might otherwise work disastrously how disastrously is shown by the history of europe and in a notable degree france during the four or five centuries preceding the end of the eighteenth century when various new influences began to operate during all these centuries there was undoubtedly a very high birthrate yet infant mortality war famine insanitation contagious diseases of many and virulent kinds tended as far as we can see to keep the population almost or quite stationary and so ruinous a method of maintaining a stationary population necessarily used up most of the energy which might otherwise have been available for social progress although the stationary population even thus maintained still placed france at the head of european civilisation the more firmly we believe that the diminution of the population is a natural process the more strenuously surely we ought to guide it so that it shall work without friction and so far as possible tend to eliminate the undesirable stocks of man and preserve the desirable clearly the theory itself calls for much effort since it is obvious that along natural lines the decline if it is the result of high evolution will affect the fit more easily than the unfit the reader may point to the renewal of militarism and imperialism in france since the great war that however has been an artificial product in so far as it exists among the people themselves directly fostered from outside by the policy of england and the united states just as the same spirit in germany before the war in the face of a falling birthrate was artificially fostered from above by a military and imperialistic caste especially mathorez histoire de la formation de la population française vol i les étrangers en see france the fecundity of french families even among the aristocracy till towards the end of the eighteenth century was fabulous in the third quarter of the seventeenth century the average number of children was five in paris but the mortality was extremely high under the age of sixteen mathorez estimates it was per cent and infant mortality was terrible in all classes smallpox being specially fatal then there were the various diseases termed plagues with famine sometimes added while war emigration and religious celibacy all counteracted the excessive fecundity so that from the thirteenth century to the third quarter of the eighteenth the population seems to have been stationary about twentytwo millions then the size of the family fell in paris to and in france generally to while also there were fewer marriages therewith there was an increase of prosperity thus there seems on a wide survey of the matter no reason whatever to quarrel with that conviction which is gradually overspreading all classes of human society in all parts of the world and ever more widely leading to practical action that the welfare of the individual the family the community and the race is bound up with the purposive and deliberate practice of birthcontrol whether we advocate that policy on the ground that we are thereby furthering nature or on the opposite and no doubt equally excellent ground that we are thereby correcting nature along this road as along any other road we shall not reach utopia and since the utopia of every person who possesses one is unique that perhaps need not be regretted we shall not even within any measurable period of time reach a sanely free and human life fit to satisfy quite moderate aspirations the wise birthcontroller will not like the deliciously absurd suffragette of oldtime imagine that birthcontrol for all means a new heaven and a new earth but will rather appreciate the delightful irony of the biblical legend which represented a world with only four people in it yet one of them a murderer still it may be pointed out that was a state of things much better than we can show now the world would count itself happier if during the great war only twentyfive per cent of the population of belligerent lands had been murderers virtually or in fact there is something to be gained and that something is well worth while still whether we like it or not the task of speeding up the decrease of the human population becomes increasingly urgent to many of our undesirables it may seem mere sentiment to trouble about the ravishing of the worlds beauty or the ravaging of the worlds humanity but certain hard facts even today have to be faced the process of mechanical invention continues every day on an ever increasing scale of magnitude now that process however necessary however beneficial involves some of the chief evils of our present phase of what we call civilisation partly because it has deteriorated the quality of all human products and partly because it has enslaved mankind and in so doingdeteriorated also his quality now we cannot abolish machinery because machinery lies in the very essence of life and we ourselves are machines but as the largest part of history shows there is no need whatever for man to become the slave of machinery or even for machinery to injure the quality of his own work rightly used it may improve it the greatest task before civilisation at present is to make machines what they ought to be the slaves instead of the masters of men and if civilisation fails at the task then without doubt it and its makers will go down to a common destruction it is a task inextricably bound up with the task of moulding the human race for which birthcontrol is the elected instrument indeed they are but two aspects of the same task we have to accept the rugged fact that every step to render more nearly perfect the mechanical side of life correspondingly abolishes the need for men thus it is calculated today that whenever in accordance with a growing tendency coal is superseded by oil in industry two men are enabled to do the work of twelve that is merely typical of what is taking place generally in our modern system of civilisation everywhere a small number of men are being enabled to replace a large number of men not to avoid looking ahead we may say that of every twelve millions of our population ten millions will be unwanted let them do something else we cheerfully exclaim but what no doubt there are always art and science infinite in their possibilities for joy and enlightenment infinite also as we know in their possibilities of mischief and shallowness and boredom let it only be true science and great art and one man is better than ten millions to say that is only to echo unconsciously the ancient saying of heraclitus one is ten thousand if he be the best professor em east a distinguished biologist and lately president of the american society of naturalists nature sept has estimated that for all the fall in the birthrate the present rate of increase in the population of the world chiefly of whites who are increasing most rapidly will in the lives of our grandchildren lead to a struggle for existence more terrible than imagination can conceive has been set forth with admirable lucidity and wealth of illustration by dr austin freeman in his social this decay and regeneration already mentioned the vistas that are opened up when we realise the direction in which the human race is travelling may seem to be endless and so in a sense they are man has replaced the gods he once dreamed of he has found that he is himself a god who however realistic he seeks to make his philosophy himself created the world as he sees it and now has even acquired the power of creating himself or rather of recreating himself for he recognises that at present he is rather a poor sort of god so much an inferior god that he is hardly if at all to be distinguished from the lords of hell the divine creative task of man extends into the future far beyond the present and we cannot too often meditate on the words of the wisest and noblest forerunner of that future the whole world still lies before us like a quarry before the masterbuilder who is only then worthy of the name when out of this casual mass of natural material he has embodied with all his best economy adaptability to the end and firmness the image which has arisen in his mind everything outside us is only the means for this constructing process yes i would even dare to say also everything inside us deep within lies the creative force which is able to form what it will and gives us no rest until without us or within us in one or the other way we have finally given it representation the future with all its possibilities is still a future infinitely far away however well it may be to fix our eyes on the constellation towards which our solar system may seem to be moving across the sky meanwhile every welldirected step while it brings us but ever so little nearer to the far goal around which our dreams may play is at once a beautiful process and an invigorating effort and thereby becomes in itself a desirable end it is the little things of life which give us most satisfaction and the smallest things
