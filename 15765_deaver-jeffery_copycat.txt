jeffery deaver copycat hed never revived a cold case in quite this way detective quentin altman rocked back his chair squealing i with the telltale caw of ageing government furniture and i eyed the narrow jittery man sitting across from him go on the cop said so i check out this book from the library just for the fun of it i never do that just read a book for the fun of it i mean never i dont get much time off you know altman hadnt known this but he could certainly have deduced it gordon wallace was the greenville tribunes sole crime reporter and mustve spent sixty seventy hours a week banging out copy to judge by the number of stories appearing under his byline every day and im reading along and what is it youre reading a murder mystery ill get to that im reading along and im irritated the reporter continued because somebodyd circled some passages in a library book altman grunted distractedly he was head of homicide in a burg with a smalltown name but bigcity crime statistics the fiftysomething detective was busy and he didnt have much time for reporters with crackpot theories there were twentytwo folders of current cases on his desk and here wallace was delivering some elliptical message about defaced books i dont pay much attention at first but i go back and reread one of the circled paragraphs it jogs my memory anyway i checked the morgue morgue altman frowned rubbing his wiry red hair which showed not a strand of gray our morgue not yours in the newspaper office all the old stories got it how bout getting to the point i found the articles about the kimberly banning murder altman grew more attentive twentyeightyearold kimberly had been strangled to death a year ago the murder occurred two weeks after a similar killingof a young female grad student the two deaths appeared to be the work of the same person but there were few forensic leads and no motive that anyone could determine the cases prompted a taskforce investigation but eventually the suspects dried up and blew away like maple leaves in october and soon the case grew cold tall and gaunt with tendons and veins rising from his pale skin wallace tried to tone down his intimidating physique and face with brown tweed jackets corduroy slacks and pastel shirts an attempt that was as today completely unsuccessful he asked the cop tfouremember how the whole town was paranoid after the first girl was killed and how everybody was doublelocking their doors and never letting strangers into their houses altman nodded well look at this the reporter pulled latex gloves out of his pocket and put them on why the gloves wallace the man ignored the question and dug a book out of his battered briefcase altman got a look at the title two deaths in a small town hed never heard of it this was published six months before the first killing he opened the book to a yellow postit tab and pushed it forward read those paragraphs the detective pulled on his cvs drugstore glasses and leaned forward the hunter knew that now that hed killed once the town would be more alert than ever its soul would beedgier its collective nerves would be as tense as an animal traps bluesteel spring women would notstroll the streets alone and those who did would be looking around themselves constantly alert for any risk only a fool would let a stranger into her house and the hunter did not enjoy killing fools so on tuesday night he waited until nearly bedtimeeleven pmand then slipped onto maple street there he doused a parked convertibles roof with gasoline and ignited the pungent amber liquid a huge whoosh he hid in the bushes and hypnotized by the tornado of flames and ebony smoke swirling into the night sky above the dying car he waited in ten minutes behemoths of fire trucks roared up the street their wailing sirens drawing people from their homes to find out what the excitement might be among those on the sidewalk was a young demure blonde with a heartshaped face clara steading this was the woman the hunter knew he had to possesspossess completely she was love incarnate amore herself she was beauty she was passion and she was also completely ignorant of her role as the object of his demented desire clara shivered in her bathrobe standing on the sidewalk along with a clutch of chattering neighbors as they watched the firemen extinguish the blaze and offered words of sympathy to the dismayed owner of the car who lived a few doors away finally the onlookers grew bored or repulsed by the bitter smell of the burnt rubber and plastic and they returned to their beds or their latenight snacks or their mindnumbing tv but their vigilance didnt flag the moment they stepped inside every one of them locked their doors and windows carefullyto make certain that the strangler would not wreak his carnage in their homes though in clara steadings case her diligence in securing the deadbolt and chains had a somewhat different effect locking the hunter inside with her jesus altman muttered thats just what happened in the banning case how the perp got inside he set fire to a car a convertible wallace added and then i went back and found another passage thatd been circled when id read it at first i didnt pay any attention but you know what it said it was how the killer had stalked the first victim by pretending to work for the city and trimming the plants in a park across from her apartment this was just how the first victim of the greenville strangler the pretty grad student had been stalked so the killers a copycat altman murmured he used the novel for research which meant that there could be evidence in the book that might lead to the perp fingerprints ink handwriting altman stared at the brooding covera drawing of a mans silhouette peering into the window of a house the detective pulled on his own pair of latex gloves and slipped the book into an evidence envelope he nodded at the reporter and said a heartfelt thanks we havent had a lead on this one in over eight months walking into the office next to histhat of his assistant a young crewcut detective named josh randallhe instructed the man to take the book to the county lab for analysis when he returned wallace was still sitting expectantly in the hard chair across from altmans desk altman wasnt surprised he hadnt left and the quid pro quo the detective asked for your good deed i want an exclusive what else i figured altman didnt mind this in theory cold cases were bad for the departments image and solving cold cases was good for a cops career not to mention that there was still a killer out there hed never liked wallace though who always seemed a little out of control in a spooky way and was as irritating as most crusaders usually are okay youve got an exclusive altman said illkeep you posted he rose and shook the reporters hand waited for him to leave oh im not going anywhere my friend thissan official investigation and it wouldntve been one without me i want to write this one from the inside out tell my readers how a homicide investigation works from your point of view altman argued some more but in the end he gave in he felt he had no choice he said just dont get in my way if you get in the way youre out of here wouldnt think of it he frowned an eerie look into his long toothy face i might even be helpful maybe it was a joke but there was nothing humorous about the delivery he then looked up expectantly at the detective so whadda we do next well youre going to cool your heels im going to review the case file but relax wallace investigations take time sit back take your jacket off enjoy our wonderful coffee wallace glanced at the closet that served as the police stations canteen he rolled his eyes and the ominous tone of earlier was replaced with a laugh funny i didnt know they still made instant the detective winked and ambled down the hall on his aching bones quentin altman hadnt run the greenville strangler case himself hed worked on it somethe whole department had had a piece of the casebut the officer in charge had been bob fletcher a sergeant whod been on the force for years fletcher whod never remarried after his wife left him some years before and was childless had devoted his life to his job after the divorce and seemed to take his inability to solve the strangler case hard the softspoken man had actually given up a senior spot in homicide and transferred to robbery altman was now glad for the sergeants sake that there was a chance to nail the killer whod eluded him altman wandered down to robbery with the news about the book and to see if fletcher knew anything about it the sergeant though was out in the field at the moment and so altman left him a message and then dove into the cluttered and oppressively hot records room he found the strangler files easily the folders sported red stripes on the side a harsh reminder that while this mightve been a cold case it was still very much open returning to his office he sat back sipping the yes disgusting instant coffee and read the file trying to ignore wallaces incessant scribbling on his steno pad the scratchy noise irritatingly audible across the office the events of the murders were well documented the perp had broken into two womens apartments and strangled them thered been no rape sexual molestation or postmortem mutilation neither woman had ever been stalked or threatened by former boyfriends and though kimberly had recently purchased some condoms none of her friends knew that shed been dating the other victim becky winthrop her family said hadnt dated for over a year sergeant fletcher had carried out a bythebook investigation but most killings of this sort without witnesses motive or significant trace found at the scene are not solved without the help of an informantoften a friend or acquaintance of the perp but despite extensive press coverage of the investigation and pleas on tv by the mayor and fletcher no one had come forward with any information about possible suspects an hour later just as he closed the useless file altmans phone rang a forensic lab tech at the county police told him that they had been through the book page by page and found three passages underlined and starred with large asterisks in addition to the two that wallace had found there was a passage about how the killer had put plastic bags around his shoes to prevent leaving footprints and to keep trace evidence from sloughing off at the crime scene altman gave a short laugh the report that hed just read contained a note that the crimescene searchers hadnt been able to figure out why the perp had left no footprints because the goddamn killer had used a goddamn howto book the detective thought bitterly the tech continued next to two of the underscored passages were several handwritten notations one said check this one out important and the other used distractionbrilliant the documents department had blown up images of the handwriting and was prepared to compare these to any samples found elsewhere though until such samples were found they could do nothing more the techs had also checked for any impression evidenceto see if the killer had written something on say a postit note on top of one of the pagesbut found nothing aninhydrin analysis revealed a total of nearly two hundred latent fingerprints on the three pages on which the paragraphs had been underlined unfortunately many of them were old and were only fragments technicians had located a few that were clear enough to be identified and had run them through the fbis automatic fingerprint identification system in west virginia but all the results had come back negative the cover of the book wrapped in printfriendly cellophane yielded close to four hundred prints but they too were mostly smudges and fragments afis had provided no positive ids for these either frustrated altman thanked the technician as cordially as he could and hung up so what was that about wallace asked looking eagerly at the sheet of paper in front of altman which contained both notes on the conversation hed just had and a series of compulsive doodles he explained to the reporter about the forensic results so no leads wallace summarized dramatically and jotted a note the irritated detective wondering why the reporter had actually found it necessary to write this observation down as he gazed at the reporter an idea occurred to altman and he stood up abruptly lets go where your crime scene mine wallace asked scrambling to follow the detective as he strode out the door the library near gordon wallaces apartment where hed checked out the novel was a small branch in the three pines neighborhood of greenville so named because legend had it that three trees in a park here had miraculously survived the fire of which had destroyed the rest of the town it was a nice place populated mostly by businessmen professionals and educators the college was nearby the same school where the first strangler victim had been a student altman followed wallace inside and the reporter found the head of the branch and introduced her to the detective mrs mcgiver was a trim woman dressed in stylish gray she looked more like a senior executive with a hightech company than a librarian the detective explained the connection between the person whod checked out the book and the murders shock registering on the womans face as she realized that the killer was somebody whod been to her library perhaps even someone she knew id like a list of everybody who checked out that book altman had considered the possibility that the killer might not have checked it out but had looked through it here in the library itself but that meant hed have to underline the passages in public and risk drawing the attention of librarians or patrons he concluded that the only safe way for the strangler to do his homework was at home ill see what i can find she said altman had thought that it might take days to pull together this information but mrs mcgiver was back in minutes altman felt his gut churning with excitement as he gazed at the sheets of paper in her hand relishing the sensations of the thrill of the hunt and pleasure at finding a fruitful lead but as he flipped through the sheets he frowned every one of the thirty or so people checking outtwo deaths had done so recentlywithin the last six months they needed the names of those whod checked it out before the killings a year ago actually i need to see the list before july tenth of last year he explained oh but we dont have records that far back normally we would but about six months ago our computer was vandalized vandalized she nodded frowning somebody poured battery acid or something into the hard drive ruined it and destroyed all our records backup too somebody from your department handled the case i dont remember who wallace said i didnt hear about it they never found who did it it was very troubling but more of an inconvenience than anything imagine if hed decided to destroy the books themselves altman caught wallaces eye dead end he muttered angrily then he asked the librarian how trout the names of everybody who had a library card then were their names in the computer too prior to six months ago theyre gone too im sorry forcing a smile onto his face he thanked the librarian and walked to the doorway but he stopped so suddenly that wallace nearly slammed into his back what the reporter asked altman ignored him and returned to the desk calling as he did mrs mcgiver hold up there drawing stares and a couple of harshshhhhs from readers i need to find out where somebody lives ill try but youre the policemandont you have ways of doing that in this case i have a feeling youd be a better cop than me the author of two deaths in a small town andrew m carter lived in hampton station near albany about two hours away from greenville mrs mcgivers copy of whos who in contemporary mystery writing didnt include addresses or phone numbers but altman called the felonies division of the albany police department and they tracked down carters address and number altmans theory was that carter mightve gotten a fan letter from the killer since one notation called a passage brilliant and the other appeared to be a reminder to do more research on the topic it was possible that the killer had written to carter to praise him or to ask for more information if there was such a letter the county forensic handwriting expert could easily link the notation with the fan who if they were luckymight have signed his real name and included his address mentally crossing his fingers he placed a call to the author a woman answered hello im detective altman with the greenville police department he said id like to speak to andrew carter im his wife she said hes not available the matteroffact tone in her voice suggested that this was her kneejerk response to all such calls when will he be available this is about the murders isnt it thats right maam do you have a suspect i cant really go into that but i would like to talk to your husband a hesitation the thing is her voice lowered and altman suspected that her unavailable husband was in a nearby room he hasnt been well im sorry altman said is it serious you bet its serious she said angrily when andy heard that the killer mightve used his book as a model for the crimes he got very depressed he cut himself off from everybody he stopped writing she hesitated he stopped everything he just gave up mustve been real difficult mrs carter altman said sympathetically i told him it was just a coincidencethose women getting killed like he wrote in the book just a weird coincidence but the reporters and well everybody friends neighbors they kept yammering on and on about how andy was to blame altman supposed she wasnt going to like the fact that hed found proof that her husbands book had indeed been the model for the killings she continued hes been getting better lately anything about the case could set him back i do understand that maam but you have to see my situation weve got a possibility of catching the killer and your husband could be real helpful the sound on the other end of the line grew muffled and altman could hear her talking to someone else altman wasnt surprised when she said my husband just got back ill put him on hello came a soft uneasy voice thiss andy carter altman identified himself are you the policeman i talked to last year me no that mightve been the case detective sergeant bob fletcher right that was the name so fletcher had talked to the author last year there was no reference in the case file to it and he supposed that carter hadnt provided any helpful information maybe now after this much time had passed hed be more cooperative though altman soon found that wasnt the case he reiterated to carter what hed told his wife and the man said immediately i cant help you and frankly i dont want to thiss been the worst year of my life i appreciate that sir but that killers still free and but i dont know anything i mean whatcould i possibly tell you that we have a sample of the killers handwritingwe found some of his notes in a copy of your book and wed like to compare it to any letters from fans you mightve received there was a long pause finally the author whispered so he did use my book as a model im afraid he did mr carter altman heard nothing for a moment then a cryptic noise maybe a sigh or maybe the man was crying softly sir are you all right the author cleared his throat im sorry i cant help you i just itd be too much for me altman often told young officers under him that a detectives most important trait is persistence he said in an even voice youre the only one who can help us trace the book back to him he destroyed the library computer so we dont have the names of who checked your book out theres no match on the fingerprints either i want to catch this man real bad and i suspect you do too mr carter dont you now there was no response finally the faint voice continued do you know that strangers sent me clippings about the killings perfect strangers hundreds of them they blamed me they called my book a blueprint for murder i had to go into the hospital for a month afterwards i was so depressed i caused those murders dont you understand that altman looked up at wallace and shook his head the reporter gestured for the phone altman figured why not mr carter theres a person here im going to put on the line id like him to have a word with you who he handed the receiver over and sat back listening to theonesided conversation hello mr carter the reporters gaunt frame hunched over the phone and he gripped the receiver in astonishingly long strong fingers you dont know me my name is gordon wallace im a fan of your booki loved it im the one who found the circled passages no im not with them im a reporter for the tribune here in greenville i got that i understand that my colleagues step over a lot of lines but i dont operate that way and i know youre reluctant to get involved here im sure youve been through a tough time but i just want to say one thing im no great novelist like youim just a hack journalistbut i am a writer and if i have any important belief in my life its in the freedom to write whatever moves us now no please mr carter let me finish i heard that you basically stopped writing after the murders well you and your talent were as much a victim of those crimes as those women were you exercised your godgiven right to express yourself and a terrible accident happened thats how id look at this madman an act of god a couple of people got killed and you were injured because of that you cant do anything about those women but you can help yourself and your family to move on and theres something else to consider youre in a position to make sure nobody else ever gets hurt by this guy again altman lifted an impressed eyebrow at the moving sales pitch wallace fell silent and glancing at the detective shrugged he held the receiver to his ear for a moment listening finally he nodded and glanced at altman he wants to talk to you altman took the phone yessir what exactly would you want me to do came the tentative voice through the phone all i need is for you to look through your fan mail see if you can find anything suspicious any fans who mightve written something about these passages in the book he told carter which ones had been circled and then added andlook for any letters from people who asked about how you researched the murders particularly from people within say a hundred miles or so of greenville carter protested ive got thousands of letters itd take a couple of days to go through them all thats fine well follow up on other leads as best we can but i have one more request sir whats that can we get those letters in person you want me to come to greenville yessir i do silence the detective persisted depending on what we find it could be real helpful to have you here the cityll pay for the mileage and a room if you stay overnight sir carter said slowly theres not enough money in the universe to get me to come to greenville altman took a breath to set out his argument though before he could speak the man continued but ill come anyway altman started to tell the author how much he appreciated the help but after a moment he realized that the man had hung up and he was listening to dead air andy clark turned out not to resemble either a sinister artist or a glitzy celebrity but rather any one of the hundreds of white middleaged businessmen that populated this region of the northeast thick graying hair neatly trimmed a slight paunch much slighter than altmans own thanks to the cops fondness for his wifes casseroles his outfit wasnt an armpatch sports jacket or any other authorial garb but an ll bean windbreaker polo shirt and corduroy slacks it had been two days since altman had spoken to carter the man now stood uneasily in the detectives office taking the coffee that josh randall offered and nodding greetings to the cops and to gordon wallace he slipped off his windbreaker tossing it on an unoccupied chair the mans only moment of consternation in this initial meeting was when he glanced at the top of altmans desk and blinked as he saw the case file that was headed banning kimberly homicide abrief look of dismay filled his face altman was grateful that hed had the foresight to slip the crimescene photos of the victims body to the bottom of the folder they made small talk for a minute or two and then altman nodded at a large white envelope in the authors hand you find something helpful helpful carter asked rubbing his red eyes i dont know youll have to decide that he handed the envelope to the detective oh i wore gloves when i handled them not fancy ones like yours playtex my wifes from the kitchen good thinking altman opened the envelope and donning his own gloves pulled out what mustve been about fifty or so sheets i looked through the emails from fans too carter said but i didnt find anything that seemed suspicious emails wouldnt help them anyway altman was after a handwriting comparison the ones on top carter continued nodding at the correspondence seemed to be from the most how do i put it the most intense fans the detective led the men into the department conference room and spread the letters out on the table randall joined them some of them were typed or printed out from a computer some were written in cursive some in block letters they were on many different types and sizes of paper and in many colors of ink or pencil crayons too for half an hour they looked over the letters altman finally divided them into two piles one he explained was of letters from fans who were as carter had said intense these notes were eerie nonsensical angry or disturbingly personal come to see us in sioux city if your in town and the wife and me will treat you to our special full body massage out side on the deck behind our trailer ick said josh randall yep definitely icky altman thought but he set that pile aside and explained that they were the discards thosere your typical wackos and i dont think theyre half dangerous its the other ones im worried about he nodded at the second pile theyre reasonable and calm and cautious just like the strangler see hes an organized offender calculating and smart hes not going to give anything away by ranting if he has any questions hes going to ask them politely and carefullyhell want some detail but not too much thatd arouse suspicion altman gathered up this stackabout ten lettersplaced them in an evidence envelope and handed them to the young detective over to the county lab stat a man stuck his head in the door bob fletcher the evenkeeled sergeant introduced himself to carter we never met but i spoke to you on the phone last year about the case i remember they shook hands fletcher nodded at altman smiling ruefully hes a better cop than me i never thought that the killer mightve tried to write you the sergeant it turned out had contacted carter not about fan mail but to ask if the author had based the story on any previous true crimes thinking there might be a connection between them and the strangler murders it had been a good thought but carter had explained that the plot fortwo deaths was a product of his imagination the sergeants eyes took in the stack of letters any luck he asked well have to see what the lab finds altman then nodded toward the author but i have to say that mr carter heres been a huge help wed be stymied for sure it wasnt for him appraising carter carefully fletcher said i have to admit i never got a chance to read your book but i always wanted to meet you an honesttogod famous author dont think ive ever shook ones hand before carter gave an embarrassed laughnot very famous to look at my sales figures well all i know is my girlfriend read your book and she said it was the best thriller shed read in years carter said i appreciate that is she around town i could autograph her copy oh fletcher said well were not going out anymore she left the area but thanks for the offer he headed back to robbery there was now nothing to do but wait for the lab results to come back so wallace suggested coffee at starbucks the men wandered down the street ordered and sat sipping the drinks as wallace pumped carter for information about breaking into fiction writing and altman simply enjoyed the feel of the hot sun on his face the mens recess ended abruptly though fifteen minutes later when altmans phone rang detective came the enthusiastic voice of his youthful assistant weve got a match the handwriting in one of mr carters fan letters matches the notes in the book the inks the same too there were markers in it the detective said please tell me theres a name and address on the letter you bet there is howard desmonds his name and his place is over in warwick a small town fifteen minutes from the sites of both of the greenville stranglers attacks the detective told his assistant to pull together as much information on desmond as he could he snapped the phone shut and grinning announced weve found him weve got our copycat but as it turned out they didnt have him at all single fortytwoyearold howard desmond a veterinary technician had skipped town six months before leaving in a huge hurry one day in april hed called his landlord and announced that he was moving hed left virtually overnight abandoning everything in the apartment but his valuables there was no forwarding address altman had hoped to go through whatever hed left behind but the landlord explained that hed sold everything to make up for the lost rent what didnt sell hed thrown out altman spoke to the vet in whose clinic desmond had worked and the doctors report was similar to the landlords in april desmond had called and quit his job effective immediately saying only that he was moving to oregon to take care of his elderly grandmother he never called back with a forwarding address for his last check as he said he would the vet described desmond as quiet and affectionate to the animals in his care but with little patience for people altman contacted the authorities in oregon and found no record of any howard desmond in the dmv files or on the property or incometax rolls a bit more digging revealed that all of desmonds grandparentshis parents toohad died years before the story about the move to oregon was apparently a complete lie the few relatives the detective could track down confirmed that hed just disappeared and they didnt know where he might be they echoed his bosss assessment describing the man as intelligent but a recluse one whosignificantlyloved to read and often lost himself in novels appropriately for a killer who took his homicidal inspiration from a book whatd his letter to andy say wallace asked with an okaying nod from altman randall handed it to the reporter who then summarized out loud he asks how mr carter did the research for his book what were the sources he used how did he learn about the most efficient way a murderer would kill someone and hes curious about the mental makeup of a killer why did some people find it easy to kill while others couldnt possibly hurt anyone altman shook his head no clue as to where he mightve gone well get his name into ncic and vicap but hell he could be anywhere south america europe singapore since bob fletchers robbery division wouldve handled the vandalism at the greenville librarys three pines branch which they now knew desmond was responsible for altman sent randall to ask the sergeant if hed found any leads that would be helpful the other men found themselves staring at desmonds fan letter as if it were a corpse at a wake silence surrounding them trying to guess where the killer mightve gone altman glanced up and noticed that andy carter was frowning as he gazed at a large map of greenville county up on the wall the author nodded to himself slowly and then said had a thought go on desmond rented his place right yep well he had a decent job he wasnt a youngster and he was single he had tove had some money why would he rent houses arent that expensive in greenville altman shrugged i dont know what do you make of that my wife and i used to go up to the adirondacks in the summer we looked into buying a place awhile ago but we couldnt afford to own two houses so we ended up renting the detective nodded so youre thinking that one reason a man would rent his main residence was if he owned a house somewhere else a summer house or something just a thought but you checked the county registrar he didnt own any property wallace pointed out to altman but we didnt check other counties the detective replied a vacation place might not be nearby he grabbed his phone and in less than five minutes they had their answer howard desmond did indeed own a house elsewhereon the shore of lake muskegon sixty miles from greenville tucked away into the backwater piney wilderness good thought the detective said to carter thanks you think hes hiding out there wallace asked doubt it altman said hes not stupid i were him id vanish for a couple of years till everybodyd forgotten about the case and i thought it was safe to come back to the area but there could be some leads there to where he did go maybe airline receipts or something josh randall returned to report that sergeant bob fletcher had no helpful information in the library vandalism case but altman said doesnt matter weve got a better lead suit up josh whatre we doing were going for a ride in the country what else on a nice fall day like this lake muskegon is a large but shallow body of water bordered by willow tall grass and ugly pine altman didnt know the place well hed brought his family here for a couple of picnics over the years and he and bob fletcher had come to the lake once on a halfhearted fishing expedition of which altman had only vague memories gray drizzly weather and a nearly empty creel at the end of the day as he and randall drove north through the increasingly deserted landscape he briefed the young man now im ninetynine percent sure desmonds not here but what were going to do first is clear the housei mean closet by closetand then i want you stationed in the front to keep an eye out while i look for evidence okay sure boss they passed desmonds overgrown driveway and pulled off the road then eased into a stand of thick forsythia together the men cautiously made their way down the weedy drive toward the vacation house a dignified term for the tiny shabby cottage sitting in a threefoothigh sea of grass and brush a path had been beaten through the foliagesomebody had been here recentlybut it might not have been desmond altman had been a teenager once himself and knew that nothing attracts adolescent attention like a deserted house they drew their weapons and altman pounded on the door calling police open up silence he hesitated a moment adjusted the grip on his gun and kicked the door in filled with cheap dustcovered furniture buzzing with stuporous fall flies the place appeared completely deserted they checked the four small rooms carefully and found no sign of desmond outside they glanced in the window of the garage and saw that it was empty then altman sent randall to the front of the driveway to hide in the bushes and report anybodys approach he then returned to the house and began to search wondering just how hot the cold case was about to become two hundred yards before the driveway that led to howard desmonds cottage a battered tenyearold toyota pulled onto the shoulder of route and then into the woods out of sight of any drivers along the road a man got out and satisfied that his car was well hidden squinted into the forest getting his bearings he noticed the line of the brown lake to his left and figured the vacation house was in the tenoclock position ahead of him through dense underbrush like this it would take him about fifteen minutes to get to the place he estimated thatd make the time pretty tight hed have to move as quickly as he could and still keep the noise to a minimum the man started forward but then stopped suddenly and patted his pocket hed been in such a hurry to get to the house he couldnt remember if hed taken what he wanted from the glove compartment but yes he had it with him hunched over and picking his way carefully to avoid stepping on noisy branches gordon wallace continued on toward the cabin where he hoped detective altman was lost in police work and would be utterly oblivious to his furtive approach the search of the house revealed virtually nothing that would indicate that desmond had been here recentlyor where the man might now be altman found some bills and canceled checks but the address on them was desmonds apartment in warwick he decided to check the garage thinking he might come across something helpful that the killer had tossed out of the car and forgotten aboutdirections or a map maybe he found something far more interesting in the decrepit building though howard desmond himself that is to say his corpse the moment altman opened the oldfashioned double doors of the garage he detected the smell of decaying flesh he knew where it had to be coming from a large coal bin in the back steeling himself he flipped up the lid inside were the mostly skeletal remains of a man about six feet tall lying on his back fully clothed hed been dead about six monthsjust around the time desmond disappeared altman recalled dna would tell for certain if this was the killer but altman discovered the mans wallet in his hip pocket and sure enough the drivers license inside was desmonds there wasnt enough face left to be sure but the thatch of hair on the corpses skull and the mans height were the same as indicated on the license he looked briefly through the bin again and found nothing else that would identify the body or whod killed him though he did find the apparent murder weapona stained oldfashioned military bayonet lifting it out with a kleenex he set the weapon on a workbench so what the hell was going on somebody had murdered the strangler who and why but then altman did one of the things he did bestlet his mind run free too many detectives get an idea into their heads and cant see past their initial conclusions altman though always fought against this tendency and he now asked himself but what if desmond wasnt the strangler they knew for certain that he was the one whod underlined the passages in the librarys copy of two deaths in a small town but what if hed done so after the killings the letter desmond had written to carter was undated maybelike gordon wallace hed read the book after the murders and been struck by the similarity hed started to investigate the crime himself and the strangler had found out and murdered him but then who was the killer like gordon wallace altman felt another little tap in his farranging mind as fragments of facts lined up for him to considerfacts that all had to do with the reporter for instance wallace was physically imposing abrasive temperamental at times he could be threatening scary he was obsessed with crime and he knew police and forensic procedures better than most cops which also meant that he knew how to anticipate investigators moves hed sure blustered his way right into the middle of the reopened case just the other day altman reflected wallace owned a motorola police scanner and wouldve been able to listen in on calls about the victims his apartment was a few blocks from the college where the first victim was killed the detective considered lets say that desmond had read the passages become suspicious and circled them then made a few phone calls to find out more about the case he mightve called wallace who as the tribunes crime reporter would be a logical source for more information desmond had met with the reporter whod then killed him and hid the body here impossible why would he have brought the book to the polices attention then and why would he have killed the two women in the first place what was his motive but altman refused to dismiss the notion of wallaces involvement so quickly he bent down into the shabby impromptu crypt again to search it more carefully trying to unearth answers to those difficult questions gordon wallace caught a glimpse of altman in the garage the reporter had crept up to a spot only thirty feet away and was hiding behind a bush the detective wasnt paying any attention to who might be outside apparently relying on josh randall to alert him to intruders the young detective was at the head of the driveway a good two hundred feet away his back to the garage breathing heavily in the heat the reporter started through the grass in a crouch he stopped beside the building and glanced quickly into the side window noting that altman was standing over a coal bin in the rear of the garage squinting at something in his hand perfect wallace thought and reaching into his pocket eased to the open doorway where his aim would be completely unobstructed the detective had found some papers in desmonds pocket and was staring at one in particular a business card trying to figure it out when he heard the snap of a twig behind him and alarmed turned a silhouette of a figure was standing in the doorway he seemed to be holding his hands at chest level blinded by the glare altman gasped whore a huge flash filled the room the detective stumbled backward groping for his pistol damn came a voice he recognized altman squinted against the backlighting wallace you goddamn son of a bitch what the hellre you doing here the reporter scowled and held up the camera in his hand looking just as unhappy as altman i was trying to get a candid of you on the job but you turned around you ruined it i ruined it youve got no business being here i told you not to get in the way you cant im not in the way the man snapped im nowhere near you how can i be in the way thiss a crime scene well thats why i want the pictures he said petulantly then he frowned whats that smell the camera sagged and the reporter started to breathe in shallow gasps he looked queasy its desmond somebody murdered him hes in the coal bin murdered him so hes not the killer altman lifted his radio and barked to randall weve got visitors back here what were in the garage the young officer showed up a moment later trotting fast a disdainful look at wallace where the hell did you come from howd you let him get past altman snapped not his fault the reporter said shivering at the smell i parked up the road how bout we get some fresh air angry altman took perverse pleasure in the reporters discomfort ioughta throw you in jail wallace held his breath and started for the coal bin raising the camera dont even think about it altman growled and pulled the reporter away who did it randall asked nodding at the body altman didnt share that for a moment hed actually suspected wallace himself just before the photoop incident hed found a stunning clue as to who desmondsand the two womenskiller actually was he held up a business card i found this on the body on the card was written detective sergeant robert fletcher greenville police department bob randall whispered in shock i dont want to believe it altman muttered slowly but back at the office he didnt let on he even knew about desmond let alone that theyd met at some point true he didnt say a word and he continued nodding at the bayonet doesnt that look like one of his does yeah randall said bob fletcher collected world war ii memorabilia and weapons the wickedlooking blade was similar to several in his collection altmans heart pounded furiously at the betrayal he now understood what had happened fletcher bobbled the case intentionallybecause he was the killerprobably destroying any evidence that led to him a loner a history of short difficult relationships obsessed with the military and hunting hed lied to them about not reading two deaths and had used it as a model to kill those women thenafter the killingsdesmond happened to read the book too underlined the passages and being a good citizen contacted case officer fletcher who was none other than the killer himself the sergeant murdered him dumped the body here and then destroyed the librarys computer and never made any effort to pursue the vandalism investigation altman then had another thought he turned suddenly to the reporter where was fletcher when you left the office did you see him at the station the detectives hand strayed to his pistol as he looked around the tall grass wondering if the sergeant now intended to kill them as well he was in the conference room with andy carter no altman realized that they werent the only ones at risk the author was a witness tooand a potential victim of fletchers altman grabbed his cell phone and called the central dispatcher he asked for carter hes not here sir the woman said what it was getting late so he decided to get a hotel room for the night which ones he staying at i think its the sutton inn you have the number i do sure but hes not there right now where is he he went out to dinner i dont know where but if you need to get in touch with him you can call bob fletchers phone they were going together twenty minutes from town driving at ninety altman tried again to call fletcher but the sergeant wasnt answering there wasnt much altman could do except try to reason with the sergeant have him give himself up plead with him not to kill carter too he prayed that the cop hadnt already done so another try still no answer heskidded the squad car through the intersection at route nearly sideswiping one of the ubiquitous dairy tankers in these parts okay that was exciting randall whispered removing his sweaty palm from the dashboard as the trucks horn brayed in angry protest behind them altman was about to call fletchers phone again when a voice clattered over the cars radio all units reports of shots fired on route onetwentyeight just west of ralphs grocery repeat shots fired all units respond you think thats them were three minutes away were about to find out altman pushed the accelerator to the floor and they broke into threedigit speed after a brief harrowing ride the squad car crested a hill randall called breathlessly look altman could see bob fletchers police interceptor half on half off the road he skidded to a stop nearby and the two officers jumped out wallaces carwhich had been hitching an illegal ride on their light bar and sirenbraked to a stop fifty feet behind them and the reporter too jumped out ignoring the detectives shout to stay down altman felt randall grip his arm the young officer was pointing at the shoulder about fifty feet away in the dim light they could just make out the form of andrew carter lying facedown in the dust oh no they werent in time the sergeant had added the author to the list of his victims look out for fletcher he whispered to a spooked josh randall hes around here someplace and we know hes armed altman ran toward the authors body as he did he happened to glance to his left and gasped there was bob fletcher on the ground holding a shotgun he shouted to randall look out and dropped flat but as he swung the gun toward fletcher he noted that the sergeant wasnt moving the detective hit the man with his flashlight beam fletchers eyes were glazed over and there were two bullet holes in his chest wallace was crouching over carter the reporter called hes alive the detective rose pulled the scattergun out of fletchers lifeless hands and trotted over to the author the mans face was bloody and streaked with dirt his clothes torn lying on the ground nearby was a black revolver the sort that fletcher had carried are you shot carter winced and blinked andy are you shot in response the author shook his head no but i think i broke my arm i cant feel anything in my fingers theres an ambulance on its way just stay where you are dont try to get up my leg man it hurts just stay still andy dont move tellme what happened gasping carter said fletcher said lets go to dinner we took his car he said if i didnt mind he had to make a stop on the way to the restaurant and he turned down this road then he was talking and he said it was funny this road reminded him of that scene in my book where the hunters waiting for one of the victims ah right carter continued he said he hadnt read it he lied to us that meant he had to be the strangler and he was taking me someplace to kill me carter coughed and laid his head back on the ground a moment later he continued when he slowed down to turn into that side road i grabbed his pistol and jumped out of the car i thought i could run into the forest and hide but i hurt myself landing and couldnt get up fletcher stopped and got the shotgun out of the trunk he came after me and i fired a couple of timesand then passed out he looked at the body up the road he whispered i didnt want to kill him i didnt have any choice over a crest in the road altman could see flashing lights and hear sirens growing steadily louder as randall ran toward them gesturing wildly altman collected the weapons he glanced at bob fletchers body murdering howard desmond and trying to murder andy carterwell those had been to cover up his original crimes but what had been the sergeants motive for killing the two women in greenville last year maybe the anger at being left by his wife had boiled over maybe hed had a secret affair with one of the victims which had turned sour and hed decided to stage her death as a random act of violence and maybe altman reflected unlike in a mystery novel theyd never know what had driven the man to step over the edge into the dark world of the killers hed once hunted the doctors kept andrew carter in the hospital overnight though it seemed that the flying leap from the caras dramatic and frightening as it probably seemed to himhadnt caused any serious damage the next morning he checked out of greenville memorial and stopped by the police department to say goodbye to altman and randall and to sign a formal statement about the events of the previous night got the latest from forensics altman said and explained that fletchers prints were all over the bayonet and thata search of the sergeants house revealed several itemsstockings and lingerie that had been taken from the homes of the victims leaving no doubt that fletcher was the greenville strangler most people in town certainly everyone in the police department were shocked at this news but quentin altman had to admit that one of the things hed learned in his twentyplus years of being a cop was that you never really knew what was in anybodys heart but your own he chatted with the author for a few moments but their conversation quickly became merely the superficial exchange between two men whose sole reason for contact no longer existed and carter finally looked at his watch saying that hed better be going altman walked him outside they were leaving the police station when gordon wallace loped up to them hot off the presses he handed a copy of thetribune to carter on the front page was wallaces story about the solving of the greenville strangler case keep that wallace saida souvenir thanking him carter folded the paper up slipped it under his arm and walked to his car altman observed that the author seemed in somewhat better spirits than when hed arrived the melancholy remained in his eyes but the detective sensed that hed found a bit of inner peace by coming to greenville to the site of the terrible killings that he felt responsible for and perhaps making this difficult trip and risking his own life to help bring the killer to justice would ultimately prove to be a godsend unlike many people touched by tragedy carter had had the rare chance to revisit the past and personally confront the demons of guilt that threatened to destroy his life just before the man climbed into his toyota altman called out oh one thing andyhows that book of yours end do the police ever find the hunter carter caught himself as he was about to answer he gave a grin you know detective if you want to find that out im afraid youre just going to have to buy yourself a copy he dropped into the front seat fired the car up and pulled into the street offering a brief wave goodbye at two am the next morning andrew carter slipped out of bed where hed lain wideawake for the past three hours he glanced at the quiescent form of his sleeping wife and went to his closet where he found and pulled on an old pair of faded jeans sneakers and a boston university sweatshirthis goodluck writing clothes which he hadnt donned in well over a year he walked down the hall to his office and went inside turning on the light sitting at his desk he clicked on his computer and stared at the screen for a long moment then suddenly he began to write his keyboarding was clumsy at first his fingers jabbing two keys at once or missing the intended one altogether still as the hours passed his skill as a typist returned and soon the words were pouring from his mind onto the screen flawlessly and fast by the time the sky began to glow with pinkgray light and a birds cellphone trill sounded from the crisp holly bush outside his window hed finished the story completelythirtynine doublespaced pages he moved the cursor to the top of the document thought about an appropriate title and typed copycat then andy carter sat back in his comfortable chair and carefully read his work from start to finish the story opened with a reporter finding a suspense novel that contained several underlined passages which were strikingly similar to two reallife murders that had occurred a year earlier the reporter takes the book to a detective who concludes that the man who circled the paragraphs is the perpetrator a copycat inspired by the novel to kill reviving the case the detective enlists the aid of the novels author who reluctantly agrees to help and brings the police some fan letters one of which leads to the suspected killer but when the police track the suspect to his summer home they find that hes been murdered he wasnt the killer at all and had presumably circled the passages only because he too like the reporter was struck by the similarity between the novel and the reallife crimes then the detective gets a big shock on the fans body he finds clues that prove that a sergeant on the town police force is the real killer the author who happens to be with this very officer at that moment manages to wrestle the sergeants gun away and shoot him in selfdefense case closed or so it seems but andy carter hadnt ended the story there he added yet another twist readers learn at the very end that the sergeant was innocent the real strangler had set him up as a fall guy and who was the strangler none other than the author himself racked by writers block after his first novel was published unable to follow it up with another the man had descended into madness desperate and demented he came to believe that he might jumpstart his writing by actually reenacting scenes from his novel so he stalked and strangled two women just as his fictional villain had done the murders hadnt revived his ability to write however and he slumped further into depression and then even more troubling he heard from the fanwhod grown suspicious about the similarities between certain passages in the novel and the real crimes the author had no choice he met with the fan and killed him too hiding the body in the mans lakeside summer cottage he covered up the disappearance by pretending to be the fan and phoning the mans boss and landlord to say that he was leaving town unexpectedly the author now believed he was safe but his contentment didnt last enter the reporter whod found the underlined passages and the investigation started anew when he was asked to help the police the author knew he had to give them a scapegoat so he agreed to meet with the police but in fact hed arrived in town a day early he broke into the police sergeants house planted some incriminating evidence from the first murders and stole one of the cops bayonets and his business card these he planted on the body of the fan at the lake house the next day he showed up at the police station with the fan letter that led ultimately to the cottage where the detective found the leads to the sergeant meanwhile the author alone with the unsuspecting cop grabbed his gun and shot him later claiming selfdefense in the final scene the author returned home to try to resume his writing having literally gotten away with murder carter now finished reading the story his heart thumping hard with pride and excitement true it needed polishing but considering that he hadnt written a word for more than a year it was a glorious accomplishment he was a writer once again the only problem was that he couldnt publish the story he couldnt show it to a living soul not even his wife for the simple reason that it wasnt fiction every word was true andy carter himself was the homicidal author still he thought as he erased the entire story from his computer publishing it didnt matter one bit the important thing was that by writing it hed managed to kill his writers block as ruthlessly and efficiently as hed murdered bob fletcher and howard desmond and the two women in greenville and he knew too how to make sure that the block never rose from the dead from now on hed give up fiction and pursue what hed realized he was destined to write true crime what a perfect solution this was hed never want for ideas again tv news magazines and the papers would provide dozens of story leads he could choose from and he reflected walking downstairs to make a pot of coffee if it turned out that there were no crimes that particularly interested him well andy carter knew that he was fully capable of taking matters into his own hands and whipping up a bit of inspiration all by himself
