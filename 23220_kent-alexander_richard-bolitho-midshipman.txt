alexander kent richard bolitho midshipman bolitho a ship of the line although only noon the clouds which scudded busily above portsmouth harbour made it seem closer to evening for several days a stiff easterly wind had turned the crowded anchorage into angry crisscrossing patterns of whitecaps and an attendant drizzle gave each buffeted ship and the stout walls of the harbour defences a glistening metallic sheen on portsmouth point itself solid and uncompromising stood the blue posts inn like inns and hostelries in every busy seaport it had been added to and altered over the years but still retained an appearance of a sailors haunt in fact it was used more by young midshipmen than any other seafarers who came and went with the tides and because of this it held an atmosphere all of its own lowbeamed noisy and not particularly clean it had seen more than one wouldbe admiral pass through its scarred doors on this particular day in midoctober richard bolitho sat wedged in a corner of one of the long rooms half listening to the babble of voices around him the clatter of plates and tankards and the hiss of rain against the small windows the air was heavy with mixed aromas food and ale tobacco and tar and each time the street doors opened to a chorus of curses and complaints the keener tang of salt from the waiting ships bolitho stretched his legs and sighed after the long and broken coach journey from his home in falmouth and a large portion of rabbit pie which was one of the blue posts favourite dishes for the young gentlemen he was feeling drowsy he glanced curiously at the other midshipmen nearby some were very young children no more than twelve years old at the most he smiled despite his normal reserve when he had joined his first ship as midshipman he too had been twelve only by thinking back to that time could he appreciate how he had altered how the navy had changed him he had been exactly like one of the boys along the table from him frightened awed by the noise and outward hostility of a manofwar yet somehow determined not to show it and always imagining that everyone else was entirely unimpressed by his surroundings and that had been four years ago it was stijl difficult to accept four years in which he had matured and moulded to the ship around him at first he had believed he would never be able to learn all that was asked and demanded of him the bewildering complex of rigging and shrouds the miles of cordage of every shape and length which made a ship move and obey sail drill and gun drill up aloft on dizzily swaying yards in rain and sleet or on days when it was so hot he had almost fainted and dropped to the deck far below he had learned to understand the unwritten laws of the world between decks the loyalties and rules which made everyday life possible in the overcrowded turbulent existence of a kings ship he had not only survived he had come through it better than he had thought possible but not without some bruises and a few tears to mark his journey now on this dismal october day he was joining his second ship the seventyfourgun gorgon which lay somewhere at anchor in the solent he saw a small midshipman wolfing down a huge portion of boiled pork and smiled grimly he would live to regret it it would be a long and lively pull in a boat through this wind he thought suddenly of his home in cornwall the great greystone house below pendennis castle where he and his brother and two sisters had grown up together and where for that matter the bolitho family had been living for generations it had been different from what he had expected from what he had dreamed about as he had endured storm and heat alike for one thing only his mother and sisters had been there to greet him his father who commanded a ship similar to the one he was joining had been away in indian waters his older brother hugh was senior midshipman in a frigate in the mediterranean the house had seemed quiet and very still after a ship of the line his new appointment had been delivered on his sixteenth birthday to proceed with all despatch to his britannic majestys ship gorgon at spithead which under the command of captain beves conway was recommissioning for duty in the kings name his mother had tried to hide her dismay his sisters had laughed and cried as the fancy took them when he had made his way to board the falmouth coach he had seen the farm workers nod to him as he had passed but no show of surprise for many many years bolithos had left the grey house to join one ship or another some of them had never returned and now it was all beginning again for richard bolitho he had vowed that there were mistakes he would never repeat some lessons he would remember above all else a midshipman was neither fish nor fowl he stood between the lieutenants and the true backbone of any vessel the warrant officers at one end of the ship aloof and unreachable like some sort of god was the captain above around and beyond the overcrowded midshipmens berth were the ships company seamen and marines volunteers and pressed men alike packed together between decks yet at all times separated by status and experience harsh discipline was the rule rather than the exception danger and death from working the ship in all weathers were too commonplace to mention when landsmen saw a kings ship working clear of the shore her yards alive with sailors and freshly set sails when they heard the bang of gunsalutes the lusty voices of those at the capstan joining in a welltried shanty they knew nothing of that other world within the deep hull which was probably just as well anyone sitting here bolitho came out of his thoughts and looked up another midshipman fairhaired and blueeyed was smiling at him the newcomer added martyn dancer im joining the gorgon the landlord pointed you out to me bolitho introduced himself and moved along the bench not your first ship dancer smiled sadly almost i was in the flagship until she went into dock aly experience amounts to three months and two days he saw bolithos expression t started late my father was unwilling to let me go to sea he shrugged but i had my way in the end bolitho liked what he saw dancer had certainly begun his sea career late he was about his own age and had the quiet cultured voice of a good family a town family he decided dancer was saying i have heard that we are sailing for west africa but then bolitho grinned it is as good a rumour as any i heard it too it will be better than beating back over for nine years id have thought the french would be at us again by now if only to get their canadian possessions back bolitho turned as two crippled seamen approached the landlord who was watching one of his girls ladling stew into pewter pots no real war for nine years it was true enough and yet there were still other conflicts around the world which never stopped uprisings and piracy colonies fighting their new masters they had claimed as many victims as any line of battle the landlord said harshly be off with you i want no beggars here one of the sailors his right arm amputated almost to the shoulder retorted angrily im no bloody beggar i was in the old marlborough seventyfour with rearadmiral rodney there was complete silence in the long room and bolitho saw that several of the younger midshipmen were staring at the two cripples with something like horror the second man exclaimed anxiously leave it be ted the devil will give us nothin dancer said give them all they need he dropped his eyes confused and angry i will pay bolitho looked at him sharing his concern his shame that was well said martyn he touched his sleeve impetuously i am glad we are joining together they both looked up as a shadow fell between them and one of the smoky lanterns the onearmed man was staring at them his face very grim he said quietly thank you young gentlemen he thrust out his hand good luck go with you i reckon im seeing two captains he moved away as one of the serving girls carried two steaming pots of food to a side table adding for the rooms benefit some of you take heed of this day a lesson for you the landlord thrust his large bulk towards the midshipmen as the buzz of conversation slowly returned til take your damn money nowv he glared at dancer and after that bolitho said calmly after that landlord you will bring two glasses of brandy for us he watched the mans mounting fury gauging the moment as he would the fall of a ninepound shot i would mind your manners if i were you my friend here is fortunately in good humour but his father owns most of the land around this point the landlord swallowed hard but god bless you sir i was only teasing ill bring the brandy at once the best i have and i trust you will allow me to pay for it he hurried away his face suddenly worried dancer said incredulously but my father is a tea merchant in the city of london i doubt if he has ever seen portsmouth point in his life he shook his head i think i shall have to sharpen my wits if i am to keep pace with you richard bolitho smiled gravely dick if you dont mind as they were sipping their brandy the street door was flung wide open this time it did not close framed in the entrance was a lieutenant in a streaming tarpaulin coat his cocked hat sodden from spray and rain he barked all midshipmen for the gorgon to muster at the sallyport at once there is a party of men outside to take your chests to the boat he strode to the fire and snatched a goblet of brandy from the landlord its blowing like hell outside he held his reddened hands above the blaze god help us as an afterthought he added who is the senior amongst you bolitho saw the anxious exchange of glances the way that the snug contentment had given way to something like panic he said i think i am sir richard bolitho the lieutenant eyed him suspiciously so be it march em to the sallyport and report to the boats coxn i will be along shortly he raised his voice and when i get there i want every mothers son of you ready to leave see the smallest midshipman said desperately i think im going to be sick somebody laughed but the lieutenant roared youre going to be sick sirl say sir when you address an officer damn you the landlords wife watched the untidy cluster of midshipmen hurrying towards the rain yewm a bit hard on em mr hope sir the lieutenant grinned we all had to go through it mdear anyway the captains difficult enough as it is what with one thing and tother if im adrift with the new midshipmen then ill be in for a broadside outside on the wet cobbles bolitho watched some seamen loading the black chests into an assortment of barrows burly and tanned they looked like experienced sailors and he guessed that the captain was taking no chances by allowing less reliable members of his company ashore in case they deserted in weeks even days he would know these men and many more he would not fall into the old traps as in his other ship he knew now that trust was something you had to earn not a gift which went with the uniform he nodded to the senior hand we will move off directly the man grinned at him not the first time for you then sir bolitho fell in step beside dancer or the last at the sallyport they found the boats coxswain sheltering behind the wall beyond it the solent heaved and broke to endless ranks of cruising wavecrests and against the leaden sky the few gulls looked like white spindrift the coxswain touched his hat i suggest you get em all aboard sir theres quite a tide runnin an the first lieutenant wants the boat to do another trip afore the dog watches he dropped his voice ts name is mr verling sir be warned es a mite rough on some young gennlemen likes em to try their ands at everythin e does he chuckled unfeelingly gawd look at em ell ave em for breakfast bolitho snapped and i you if you dont stop gossiping dancer stared at him as the man hurried away bolitho said ive met his sort before martyn the next minute hed be asking permission to go off for a quick tot of rum he grinned i think the lieutenant back there would be displeased never mind the formidable mr verling the officer in question appeared by the wall his eyes somewhat glassy into the boat lively there dancer said quietly i think maybe my father was right bolitho waited for the others to clamber down the slippery ladder towards the pitching longboat im not sorry to go back to sea and he was surprised to find that he meant it the journey from the sallyportto the anchored twodecker took the best part of an hour during the trip in the madly leaping longboat the midshipmen who managed to survive being violently sick had plenty of time to study their new home as she grew larger and taller through the relentless rain bolitho had made it his business to learn something about his next appointment seventyfours as these sturdy twodeckers were nicknamed made up the bulk of the fleet in any big sea battle they were always predominant in the line where the fighting was hardest and yet he knew from experience and what he had heard old sailors say that each one was as different from the other as salt from molasses while the oarsmen pulled the boat over each angry crest he kept his attention on the ship seeing the towering masts and crossed yards the shining black and buff hull with its lines of closed gunports the scarlet ensign at her high stern and the jack at her bows making patches of colour against the background of grey sea and sky the oarsmen were getting tired from their hard efforts and it took the repeated stroke from the coxswain and several threats from the redfaced lieutenant to keep them working in unison around and under the long bowsprit and jibboom beneath which the brightly gilded figurehead seemed to stare down at the silent midshipmen with something like hatred it was a splendid if frightening example of a woodcarvers art the gorgons figurehead was a mass of writhing serpents the face below set in a fierce glare the eyes very large and edged with red paint to give an added effect of menace and then panting and scrabbling they were being pushed hauled and bundled unceremoniously up the ships side so that when they arrived on the broad quarterdeck it seemed almost sheltered and calm by comparison bolitho said she looks smart enough martyn he ran his eyes quickly along the neat lines of the quarterdeck ninepounders their black barrels gleaming in the rain the trucks freshly painted every piece of tackle neat and carefully stowed seamen were working aloft on the yards and along the gangways on either beam which joined quarterdeck to forecastle beneath the gangways at the same regular intervals were the upper deck batteries of eighteenpounders while on the deck below them were the ships main armament of powerful thirtytwo pounders when required gorgon could and would speak with loud authority the lieutenant shouted over here the midshipmen hurried to obey some fearful and already lost others wary and careful to watch what was required of them in a moment you will go to your quarters the lieutenant had to raise his voice above the hiss of rain the persistent din of wind through rigging and furled sails i just want to tell you that you are now appointed to one of the finest ships in his majestys navy one with high standards and no tolerance of laggards there are twelve midshipmen all told aboard gorgon including yourselves so the mothers boys had best work doubly hard to avoid trouble you will be given postings to gundecks and other parts of ship until you are able to work with the people without making a poor example to them bolitho turned as some men hurried past under the control of a toughlooking boatswains mate fresh from the land by the cut of them he thought taken from debtors prisons and from the assize courts where but for the need of men for the fleet they would be held until transportation to the american colonies the navys appetite for men was never satisfied and with the country at peace it was even harder to supply its needs as he watched the hurrying party of men bolitho thought it hardly made sense of what the lieutenant had just said not only the midshipmen were new and untrained many of the ships company were little better as he slitted his eyes against the rain he found time to marvel at the way a ship like this could swallow such a force of human beings gorgon he knew contained a company of some six hundred officers seamen and marines in her fat seventeenhundredton hull and yet to look along her upper deck it was hard to see more than thirty or so at any one time ton bolitho turned as the lieutenants voice cut into his thoughts i hope i am not boring you bolitho replied i am sorry sir i will be watching you the lieutenant stiffened as another officer approached from the poop bolitho guessed the newcomer to be the first lieutenant mr verling was tall and thin with an expression so dour that he could have been a judge about to pass sentence of death rather than offering welcome to some new officers he had a protruding beaked nose which thrust from beneath his cocked hat as if to seek out some new crime in his ship and his eyes as they wandered along the swaying line of midshipmen were devoid of pity or warmth he said i am the senior in this ship even his tone was clipped with all the compassion honed out of it whilst on board you will attend to your various duties at all times you will become so involved with your training and preparation for examination as lieutenants that you will eventually put it before all else and any sort of leisure will be seen even by you as both selfish and pointless he nodded to the other officer mr hope is the fifth lieutenant and will be keeping an eye on you until you are settled in your allocated watches mr turnbull the master will of course expect a high standard in navigational studies and the general working of the ship at sea his gimlet eyes fastened on the smallest figure at the end of the line the one who had been violently sick in the longboat and who looked as if he was about to repeat it and what is jour name eden ssir age the word was like a knife cut ttwelve ssir hope said he has a stutter sir even his earlier belligerence had faded in the presence of his superior has he indeed i am certain the boatswain will take care of that before he reaches thirteen years if he lasts that long verling seemed to tire of the encounter dismiss them mr hope we will weigh tomorrow if the wind stays with us there is much to do he strode away without another glance hope said wearily mr grenfell will take you below grenfell it turned out was the senior midshipman a thickset unsmiling young man of about seventeen he relaxed as soon as hope had disappeared he said follow me mr hope is a fair man but he is worried about his promotion bolitho smiled in a ship of the line promotion was always difficult especially without a war to thin the ranks as fifth lieutenant hope had only one officer junior to himself in the wardroom and unless the lieutenants above him were promoted sent into other ships or killed he was hard put to find advancement dancer whispered in the flagship we had a sixth lieutenant who was so desperate that he learned to play the flute merely because the admirals wife liked it they fell silent as they followed the senior midshipman down the first companion ladder to the deck below and the deck below that the deeper they went into the hull the more confined it seemed to become they were surrounded by shadowy figures faceless and unreal in the halfdarkness their heads bowed beneath deck beams and the carefully slung equipment for each tethered cannon the smells too seemed to rise to meet them salt beef and tar bilge and packed humanity while all around them the massive hull creaked and groaned like a live thing the deckhead lanterns spiralling and throwing shapes across the great timbers and seamen alike as in part of a vast painting the midshipmens berth was on the orlop deck beneath the lower gundeck and indeed lower than the waterline itself it had no light other than from the hatches and the swaying lanterns grenfell said offhandedly this is it we share it with the senior masters mates he grimaced towards a whitepainted screen although they choose to stay aloof from us bolitho looked at his companions without difficulty he could imagine what they were feeling he could recall how he had endured the first hours how he would have given anything for a friendly word when it was most needed he said it looks fine better than my last ship the boy called eden asked really grenfell smiled its what you make it he swung round as a diminutive figure scrambled past the screen door this is your servant his name is starr but he doesnt say much just tell him what you need and ill arrange it with the purser starr was even younger than eden probably about ten and small for his age he had the pinched features of a child from the slums and his arms were so thin they were like sticks bolitho asked quietly where are you from the boy eyed him warily newcastle sir me dad was a miner there he was killed in a fall his voice was toneless as if he was speaking of another world til damn well killjcu if you treat my shirts like this one bolitho turned as another midshipman flushed from the wind and rain strode beneath the low beams with grenfell he was obviously one of the ships three midshipmen remaining from the last commission and like grenfell too still awaiting the chance to sit an examination for lieutenant he was in ill humour and had the sullen good looks of one bred to authority grenfell said easy samuel the new boys are with us the other one seemed to realize he was surrounded with awkward looking newcomers and snapped im samuel marrack signals midshipman and captains messenger dancer said it sounds important marrack stared at him it is and when you appear before our illustrious captain it is best to do it in a clean shirt he lashed out at the small servant with his hat and added so remember that in future you hound he threw himself on to a chest get me some wine im as dry as dust bolitho sat down beside dancer and watched the others opening and shutting their chests like blind men he had hoped to be appointed to a frigate like his brother free of the fleets heavy authority able to cover great distances in a third of the time it would take the ponderous gorgon and with all the possibilities of adventure he had so often dreamed of but gorgon was his new home and he would have to make the best of her for as long as the navy dictated a ship of the line outward bound all hands all hands aloft to reef topsis like the insistent voice in a nightmare the order was piped and repeated along the gorgons decks until the ship quivered to the thud of feet as the watch below dashed to their stations to be mustered bolitho shook dancer roughly by the shoulder until he almost fell from his hammock come on martyn were shortening sail again he waited as dancer dragged on his shoes and coat and then together they ran for the nearest ladder three no nearly four days it had gone on like this from the moment the seventyfour had weighed anchor and started her passage downchannel towards the atlantic it had been an endless turmoil of resetting sails of dragging weary bodies up the shrouds to the vibrating yards and all the while harried and driven by the first lieutenants voice from the quarterdeck even that had been part of the nightmare for to make his orders heard above the roar of sea and wind verling had had to use his speaking trumpet making his sharp voice a ceaseless goad for the gasping midshipmen for the new hands it was always worse of course a midshipman had very little status in a kings ship the common seaman had none at all bolitho knew that to allow any break in discipline at a moment like changing a ships tack in a heavy wind could be disastrous but he was sickened to see unnecessary violence used on a man who was perhaps too terrified by working high above the deck to understand what was required of him it was no different from the last time not yet dawn but there was a paler hint of grey showing itself in the low clouds and precious little else to light a way to the shrouds lieutenants fretted impatiently as petty officers and masters mates checked their lists of names at the foot of each mast the marines clumped aft to the mizzen braces their boots skidding on wet planking and by the quarterdeck rail the first lieutenant bobbed and pointed waving his speaking trumpet to emphasize some point or other bolitho peered aft to the big double wheel four helmsmen were clinging to the spokes so that he guessed there was still a big swell running to test the thrust of sails and rudder beside them he could see old turnbull the sailing master shapeless in his heavy coat his fists like red crabs as he gestured to his quartermaster quite alone by the weather nettings was the captain he was wrapped in a long boatcloak but his hair blew in the wind while he peered up at the reefed topsails which with the jib were the only canvas they were able to carry in such a gale bolitho had got no nearer than this to his captain since he had come aboard in the distance he looked very cool and dignified apparently untouched by the confusion of hurrying seamen and bawling petty officers dancer gritted his teeth god im near frozen lieutenant hope who was responsible for the foremast yelled take em aloft mr bolitho and i want the time cut by minutes before im satisfied a whistle shrilled and it all started again the nimblefooted topmen racing each other up the ratlines while the new hands and less confident followed behind them pursued by threats and not a few blows from the petty officers rattans to hurry them along and above it all verlings voice distorted and inhuman through his trumpet controlling and steering everyone another pull on the weather forebrace mr tregorren theres a man in your division who needs starting damn your eyes sir two more hands aft to the mizzen braces he never stopped up those rough shaking ratlines and around the futtock shrouds hanging out and down above the hull and creaming sea below clinging with fingers and toes to keep from falling then breathless on to the foretop with men already scrambling further still to the topsail yard swarming out on either beam like monkeys clawing and fisting the thick half frozen canvas to control it to take in another reef while each billowing section did its best to knock the men from their perches and hurl them aside curses and sobs men swearing terrible oaths as fingernails were torn out by the rough heavyweather canvas or they fought off their more frightened companions who clung to them for support bolitho gripped a backstay and watched the scene on the other masts it was almost done and the ship was answering to the lesser thrust in her sails far below foreshortened like dwarfs he saw the quarterdeck officers and the afterguard who were securing their halliards and braces still by the weather side the captain was watching the yards was he worried bolitho wondered he certainly did not look it secure mr hope verling could not resist adding you seem to have some cripples in your division i suggest extra sail drill in the forenoon bolitho and dancer slid to the deck on a backstay to find mr hope fuming again god damn it i shall swing for that one hope recovered himself and added and for you too if you dont drive the people harder as hope strode aft bolitho said his bark is worse than his bite come on martyn let us see what young starr has saved us for breakfast there is no point in climbing into a hammock now they will call the hands directly they found a reedy severelooking man in a plain blue coat waiting in the midshipmens berth when they hurried breathlessly into its damp security bolitho already knew his name was henry scroggs the captains clerk who messed with their neighbours the masters mates scroggs snapped bolitho is it not he did not wait for an answer report to the captain mr marrack has injured his arm and mr grenfell has the morning watch he waited his face impassive well sir jump to it if you wish to draw breath again bolitho stared at him recalling what marrack had said about clean shirts conscious of his own dishevelled appearance dancer offered here let me help you get dressed the clerk snapped no time next to grenfell and marrack you are senior bolitho the captain is very definite about such matters he swayed as the ship tilted steeply and sent the sea boiling loudly over the upper deck i suggest you make a move bolitho reached for his hat and said ruefully very well then ducking beneath the low deckbeams he made his way aft bolitho stood breathing hard outside a whitepainted screen door beneath the poop after the crowded quarters between decks the shadowy figures of the seamen returning from the work on the yards it seemed very quiet beside the door standing rigidly in a pool of light from a deckhead lantern a marine sentry regarded him coldly before calling signal midshipman sir i he further emphasized the introduction by banging the butt of his musket smartly on the deck the door opened and bolitho saw the captains servant beckoning him urgently holding the door open just sufficiently to allow him to enter like a footman in a fine house who is not sure of an unwelcome visitor if you would wait ere pause sir bolitho waited it was a fine lobby which opened on to the captains dining room and which ran the whole breadth of the hull glass tinkled quietly in a large mahogany cabinet while above the long polished table a circular tray of bottles and decanters swung evenly to the ships motion the deck was covered in canvas wellpainted in black and white squares and the ninepounder cannon on either side of the cabin were discreetly hidden under chintz covers the door in a further screen opened and the servant said this way sir he was watching bolitho with something like despair the great cabin bolitho stood just inside the door his cocked hat wedged beneath one arm as he stared at the broad expanse of his captains domain the cabin was splendid and made further so by the huge stern windows which were so streaked with salt and dappled spray that in the grey dawn light they looked like those of a cathedral captain beves conway was sitting at a large desk leafing slowly through a sheaf of papers a mug of something hot was steaming by his elbow and as the lantern above the desk swung this way and that bolitho saw that he was already dressed in a clean shirt and breeches and his blue coat with its broad white lapels was laid carefully on a bench seat his hat and boatcloak nearby there was nothing about the mans face or appearance to suggest he had just returned from the deck and the bitter wind he looked up and studied bolitho without expression the captain said name bolitho sir his voice sounded different in the broad cabin yes the captain half turned as his clerk entered the cabin by another small door in the lamplight and the angled glow from the stern windows beves conway had an alert intelligent profile but his eyes were hard and gave nothing away he was speaking curtly to scroggs his tone clipped matter of fact about things which bolitho could only guess at he glanced to one side and saw himself for the first time in a long giltframed mirror no wonder the cabin servant had looked worried richard bolitho was tall for his years tall and slim with hair so black that it made his tanned features seem pale in his seagoing coat one which he had bought eighteen months earlier and had all but grown out of he looked more like a vagrant than a kings officer he realized with a start that the captain was speaking to him well mr midshipman er bolitho due to unforeseen circumstances it seems i must rely on your skills to assist my clerk until mr marrack is recovered from his er injury he regarded him calmly what duties have you in my command lower gundeck sir and with mr hopes division for sail drill neither of those require that you should look like a dandy mr er bolitho but in my ship i need all my officers to set a perfect example no matter what duty they are performing as a junior officer you will be ready for anything in this command you lead you set an example and wherever this ship takes you you will not only represent the navy joa will be the jfeayl i understand sir bolitho tried again we had been aloft to shorten sail sir and yes the captain gave what might have been a wry smile i gave that order i had been on deck for several hours before i decided it was really necessary he pulled a slim gold watch from his breeches return to your berth on the orlop and put yourself to rights i want you aft again in ten minutes he closed the watch with a snap precisely they were the shortest ten minutes in bolithos memory helped by starr and midshipman dancer and hindered by the luckless eden who chose the moment to be sick again he eventually found his way aft to confront the same sentry by the door but to discover the great cabin already busy with visitors lieutenants with questions or reports on storm damage the master who from what bolitho could gather was either for or against the possible promotion of one of his mates major dewar of the ships marines his jowls as scarlet as his uniform even the purser mr poland a veritable weasel of a man appeared to be calling on the captain and it was only dawn the clerk led bolitho unceremoniously to a small desk by the streaming quarter windows outside through the thick glass he saw the dull grey sea the long streaks of breaking foam on every crest a cluster of gulls dipped and wheeled around the gorgons high counter obviously expecting something to be flung overboard by the cook bolitho felt his stomach contract they would be unlucky he thought between them the cook and the miserly purser left few scraps for gulls he heard the captain discussing fresh water with laidlaw the surgeon and something about scouring the empty casks to make them purer for a long voyage the surgeon was a tiredlooking man with deep hooded eyes and a permanent stoop too long in small ships or too long bent over his luckless victims bolitho could only guess he was saying its a bad bit of coast there sir the captain replied tersely i know that damn it i did not choose to take this ship and all her people to the west coast of africa just to test your ability at curing ills the clerk leaned over the little desk he had a dank smell like unwashed bedding he said dourly you can begin by copying these orders for the captain five of each nice and clear with a firm hand or youll be in trouble bolitho waited for scroggs to shuffle away and then cocked his ear towards the little group around the captain while he had been struggling into one his clean shirts and a fresh neckcloth he had discovered that his first awe at meeting the captain had begun to shift to resentment conway had dismissed his reason for being improperly dressed as unimportant even trivial in its place he had presented his own image that of the captain always on call tireless and never without a solution for anything but now as he listened to conway s calm unhurried voice the mention of some four thousand miles to be sailed the most profitable courses to be used food fresh water and above all the training and efficiency of the company he could only marvel in this cabin which for a few moments he had regarded as the height of luxury the captain fought his own private battles he could share his anxieties with nobody could divide his responsibility not at all bolitho shivered the great cabin could become a prison for any man who lost his way in doubt he recalled his own childhood when he had visited his fathers ship on those rare and privileged occasions when she had anchored at falmouth how different it had been his fathers officers smiling and friendly some almost subservient in his presence rather different from his later introduction as a midshipman when lieutenants had appeared bad tempered and intolerant scroggs was at his side again take this message to the boatswain and come back immediately he thrust a folded piece of paper into his hand bolitho picked up his hat and hurried past the big desk he was almost through the screen door when the captains voice halted him in his tracks what did you say your name was bolitho sir very well be off with you and mark what i said conway looked down at his papers and waited for the door to close when he glanced up again at the surgeon he said shortly no better way to inform the people of what we are about than to let a new midshipman overhear the surgeon regarded him gravely i think i know that boys family sir his grandfather was with wolfe at quebec really conway was already studying the next paper the surgeon added softly he was a rearadmiral sir but conway was elsewhere in his thoughts his features set in a small frown the surgeon sighed captains were quite unreachable the city of athens southwest and then south day in day out with barely a pause from backbreaking work while the gorgon thrust her heavy bulk clear of the english channel and headed down towards the notorious bay of biscay bolitho and his new companions drew closer together as if to use their combined strength against the ship and the sea he had heard turnbull the master say that the weather was as bad as he could recall for the time of year and for someone who had seen some thirty winters in the navy it was a statement to be taken seriously especially now that bolitho had lost his temporary work in the great cabin when marrack had returned to duty after injuring his arm in the first storm bolitho had joined dancer at the foremast whenever the call to make or shorten sail had been piped if he found a moment to consider his progress in his new ship which was not often bolitho thought more of his physical than his mental state he was always hungry and every muscle and bone seemed to ache from constant climbs aloft or the other demands of gun drill on the lower batteries of thirtytwopounders when the sea and wind moderated and gorgon headed south under almost a full set of canvas the ships company went to quarters to learn exercise and sweat blood over the heavy and cumbersome tiers of guns on the lower deck it was made doubly difficult by the lieutenant in charge grenfell the senior midshipman had already warned bolitho about him and as long days ran into longer weeks while the ship pushed her beakhead between the madeiran islands and the coast of morocco all invisible even to the masthead lookouts the name of mr piers tregorren the fourth lieutenant and the master of gorgons twentyeight heaviest cannon took on new importance the fourth lieutenant was a massive figure with the swarthy skin and lank hair more suitable to spaniard or gypsy than a sea officer the beams of the shadowy gundeck were so low that tregorren had to duck and rise between them as he strode forward or aft to supervise the practice loading and runningout of each weapon big belligerent and impatient he was a hard man to serve even dancer who was usually so busy keeping out of trouble that he saved his strength for eating and sleeping had noticed that tregorren seemed to have taken a dislike to bolitho it was strange bolitho thought for tregorren was a fellow cornishman and usually that was one bond which survived even the cuts and bruises of discipline because of this animosity bolitho had received three lots of extra duty and on another occasion had been sent to the foremast crosstrees in a savage wind until ordered by the officer of the watch to descend harsh unfair it certainly was but the punishment brought other sides of shiplife into the open young eden produced a pot of honey which his mother had given him and which he had been saving for some suitable occasion torn jehan the gunner a really unsympathetic warrant officer who messed beyond the screen and rarely deigned to speak with lowly midshipmen brought a large mug of brandy from his private stock to restore some life to bolithos frozen body the endless unrelenting training on sail and gun took other tolls too before they had even passed gibraltar two men were lost overboard and another died after falling from the mainyard and breaking his back on an eighteenpounder he was buried at a brief but to the new men moving ceremony his corpse sewn in a hammock and dropped overboard weighted with roundshot while the gorgon titled steeply to a brisk northeasterly further strains showed themselves like cracks in metal arguments broke out amongst the seamen some trivial some less so a man turned on a boatswains mate who had ordered him aloft for the third time in a watch to splice some worn rigging and was consequently taken aft to be awarded punishment bolitho had seen his first flogging at the age of twelve and a half he had never grown used to it but he knew what to expect the newer and younger midshipmen did not first came the pipe all hands lay aft to witness punishment next the rigging of a grating on one of the gangways while the marines trooped athwartships across the poop their scarlet coats and white crossbelts very clear against the dull overcast sky the ships company seemed to swell out of every hatchway and hiding place until the decks shrouds and even the boat tier were crammed with silently watching figures and then the little procession wended its way to the rigged grating hoggett the boatswain and his two mates beedle the unsmiling masteratarms bunn the ships corporal with the prisoner and laidlaw the surgeon bringing up the rear on the quarterdeck its pale planking dappled with droplets of spume and spray the officers and warrant officers took their places in order of seniority and importance by the lee side the midshipmen all twelve of them made two short ranks on their own the prisoner was stripped and then seized up on the grating his muscled back pale against the scrubbed wood his face hidden as he listened to the captains austere voice as he read the relevant articles of war before finishing with two dozen mr hoggett and so between the staccato roll of a solitary marine drummer boy who kept his eyes fixed on the mainyard above his head throughout the flogging the punishment was carried out the boatswains mate who actually used the catoninetails was not a brutal man by nature but he was powerfully built and had an arm like the branch of an oak also he was well aware that to show leniency would probably invite his changing places with the luckless offender after eight strokes the seamans back was a mass of blood after a dozen it was barely recognizable as human and so it went on the roll of the drum and the immediate crack of the lash across the naked back the youngest midshipman eden fainted and the second youngest a palefaced youth called knibb burst into tears while the rest and not a few of the watching seamen were stifffaced with horror after what seemed like an age hoggett called hoarsely two dozen sir bolitho made himself breathe in and out very slowly as he watched the man being cut down from the grating his back was torn as if mauled by some beast the skin quite black from the force and weight of the lash at no time had he cried out and for a moment bolitho imagined he had died under punishment but the surgeon looked up at the quarterdeck as he prised the leather strap from between the mans teeth and reported hes fainted sir then he beckoned his assistants to carry the man below to the sickbay the blood was swabbed from the deck the grating removed and as the drummer and two other young marines with fifes struck up a lively jig the company slowly returned to normal life once again bolitho glanced quickly at the captain he was expressionless his fingers tapping a little tattoo on his swordhilt as if in time with the jig dancer exclaimed fiercely what a foul way to treat a man the old sailing master overheard him and rumbled wait till youve seen a flogging round th fleet mlad then you will have something to puke on and yet when the hands went for their midmeal of salt beef and ironhard biscuits washed down with a pint of coarse red wine bolitho heard no word of complaint or anger from anyone it seemed that as in his last ship the rule of the lower deck was that if you got caught you were punished the fault was being found out this acceptance was even showing itself in the midshipmens berth the first anxiety and awe at not knowing what to do and when to do it had given way to a new unity a toughness which had touched even eden food and comfort were paramount and the uncertainty of the voyage what they were being ordered to do took on less importance the small compartment which nestled against the ships curved side had become their home the space between the white screen door and their heavy chests an area where they ate their crude meals shared their confidences and fears and learned from one another with each succeeding day apart from the sighting of a few murky islands and two distant ships gorgon seemed to have the ocean to herself daily the midshipmen gathered aft for instruction in navigation under turnbulls watchful eye the sun and the stars took on new meaning to some of them while to the older ones the reality of promotion to lieutenant seemed not so distant and improbable after a particularly bad gun drill with the thirtytwopounders dancer said angrily that man tregorren has the devil in him little eden surprised all of them by saying he has the ggout if that is the ddevil martyn they all stared at him as he added in his thin piping voice my ffather is an apothecary in bbristol he is often ccalled to ttreat such cases he nodded firmly mr tregorren ttakes too much bbrandy for his own ggood with this new knowledge at their disposal they were able to watch the fourth lieutenants behaviour with more interest tregorren would lurch beneath the low deck beams his shadow crossing the gunports like a massive spectre while at each great cannon the crew would wait for the order to load and run out to train or elevate as the lieutenant ordered each gun weighed three tons and had a crew of fifteen hands to control it and its opposite number on the other side of the deck every man had to know exactly what to do and to keep doing it no matter what as tregorren had shouted on many occasions ill make you bleed a bit but its nothing to what an enemy will do so move yourselves bolitho was sitting at the slung table in the midshipmens berth a candle flickering in an old oyster shell to add some light to that which filtered from a nearby companionway and writing a letter to his mother he had no idea when if ever she would read it but it gave him comfort to retain a link with his home from what he had gathered from his privileged position of aiding turnbull with the navigation lessons and his daily scrutiny of the masters charts he knew that the first part of their passage was almost over four thousand miles the captain had said and as he had studied the wavering lines of the charts the daily positions fixed by shooting the sun and the usual calculations on speed and course he knew all the old excitement of an approaching landfall six weeks since weighing anchor at spithead changing tack and constantly reducing or making sail the ships track wavered over the charts like an injured beetle a speedy frigate would have covered the distance and been on her way back to england long since he thought bitterly he paused his pen in midair as he heard muffled shouts from two decks above he doused the glim and carefully placed it in the chest and laid the unfinished letter under his next clean shirt he reached the upper deck and climbed swiftly to the larboard gangway where dancer and grenfell were clinging to the nettings peering towards the glittering horizon bolitho asked is it land no dick a ship dancer grinned at him his face tanned and alert in the bright sunshine it was hard to remember the rain and bitter cold bolitho thought the sea was as blue as the sky and the crisp wind lacking in bite or menace high above the decks the topsails and topgallants shone like pale shells while the masthead pendant licked out towards the larboard bow like a long scarlet lance deck thar they all peered up at the tiny black shape of the masthead lookout she baint answerin sir it was then bolitho realized that this was no ordinary encounter the captain was by the quarterdeck rail arms folded his face in shadow arid nearby midshipman marrack and his signalling party were watching their halliards and the bright hoist of flags at the mainyard what ship bolitho craned over the nettings and felt the spray touching his face and lips from the wash below then he saw the other vessel a blackhulled barquentine her sails in disarray against the blinding horizon her masts swaying steeply in the swell bolitho moved further aft and heard mr hope who had the watch exclaim by god sir if he dont answer our signal he must be up to no good i say verling turned towards him his beaky nose displaying his scorn if he wanted mr hope he could fly with the wind and leave us far astern within the hour aye sir hope sounded downcast the captain ignored both of them he said pass the word to the gunner if you please to run out a bow chaser and fire one ball as near as he can theyre either drunk or asleep over there but the solitary crash of a forward ninepounder brought nothing more than a rush of seamen from below decks in the gorgon herself the idling barquentine continued to drift her forward sails almost aback her big foreandaft canvas on main and mizzen shivering in a heat haze the captain snapped shorten sail and heaveto mr verling and send away the quarter boat i am uneasy about this one calls shrilled and twittered along the maindeck and within minutes of the captains order gorgon was going about swinging her heavy hull round into the wind with every sail and shroud quivering and banging in confusion dancer went aft to join bolitho beneath the hammock nettings dyou think he stopped as bolitho whispered keep quiet and stay here bolitho watched the boatswain mustering a boats crew on the opposite side of the deck with gorgon hoveto and groaning into the wind hoggett the boatswain was preparing the quarter boat to be hauled from astern and manhandled alongside the captain was speaking to verling his words lost in the sullen boom of flapping canvas then the first lieutenant turned abruptly his nose swinging across the quarterdeck like a swivel gun pass the word mr tregorren lay aft to take boarding party away his nose continued to move as his order was yelled forward along the maindeck tou two midshipmen arm yourselves and accompany the fourth lieutenant bolitho touched his hat aye aye sir he nudged dancer i knew he would pick the nearest dancer grinned the excitement bright in his eyes its good to be doing something different down by the entry port the hastily assembled oarsmen and armed seamen crowded above the blue water their eyes outboard towards the other vessel which had drifted almost abeam and now lay about half a mile distant mr hope called i can read her name sir he sounded cautious after verlings earlier sarcasm shes the city of athens he was swaying back and forth in the uncomfortable swell a big telescope held to his eye no sign of life aboard lieutenant tregorren arrived at the entry port his frame seeming larger and more forceful without the lowbeamed gundeck to restrain it his eyes flashed across his boarding party he said bluntly let no man loose off a pistol or musket by error be ready for anything his gaze settled on bolitho and he added as for you he broke off as the captains voice called from the quarterdeck rail man your boat mr tregorren his eyes were like glass in the bright glare if its fever aboard i want no part of it do what you can and be lively with it bolitho watched him gravely he did not know the captain other than at a distance or seeing him at work with his officers and yet he was almost certain that captain conway was on edge anxious enough to speak severely to one of his lieutenants in front of the people he flushed as the cold eyes settled on him you the captain half lifted one hand what is your name again bolitho sir it was strange that nobody ever seemed to remember a midshipmans name well bolitho when you have quite finished your daydream or composing a poem for your doxy id be grateful if you would enter the boat several seamen lounging at the gangway chuckled and tregorren rasped angrily if i thought you were trying to show me up he gave bolitho a thrust with his palm til deal with you later once in the quarter boat one of gorgons twentyeightfoot cutters the captains mood tregorrens hostility and the discomfort of six weeks at sea were pushed from bolithos mind crowded in the sternsheets amongst the extra men and weapons with tregorrens great shadow swaying over the labouring oars he turned and glanced quickly astern how huge and invulnerable gorgon appeared from a lowhulled boat standing above her rippling reflection her masts and yards stark and black against the sky she looked a symbol of sea power he could tell from dancers expression that he shared his excitement he looked leaner than when they had met at the blue posts but tougher and more confident tregorren snapped give the fellow a hail he was standing upright in the boat oblivious to the lively motion as it lifted and sliced over the wavecrests the bowman cupped his hands ship ahoy his voice seemed to echo back like an acknowledgement dancer whispered what dyou reckon dick bolitho shook his head not sure he watched the barquentines masts lifting above the sweating oarsmen the way the booms on her main and mizzen creaked and shook without purpose way nough the oars stilled and the bowman hurled a grapnel high over the vessels bulwark tregorren snapped easy now he stood staring up at the bulwark uncertain or as if he still expected somebody to appear then boarders away the boatswain had chosen only experienced hands and within seconds they were all up and over the sundried bulwark and clustered close together beneath the batlike sails tregorren said mr dancer take the forrard hatch he gestured to a boatswains mate the one who had carried out the flogging thorne you make certain that the main hatch is secure surprisingly he drew a pistol from his belt and cocked it carefully mr bolitho and you two will come aft to the poop with me bolitho glanced at his friend who gave a quick shrug before taking his own men to the forward hatch nobody was smiling now it was like a phantom ship deserted and neglected her crew spirited away he looked towards the gorgon but even she seemed further away her protection less certain tregorren said harshly this bloody ship stinks he stood above a companionway his head on one side as he peered down into darkness anyone below but there was no sound other than sea noises and the dismal creak of the unattended wheel tregorren looked at bolitho down you go he seized his wrist and added fiercely well attend to your pistol damn you bolitho drew the heavy weapon from his belt and stared at it the lieutenant said and dont turn your back as you go down the ladder bolitho slid over the coaming and paused to allow his eyes to become used to the gloom between decks once below the poop he heard other shipboard sounds and he had to tell himself they were quite normal the sluice of water against the hull the creak and clatter of loose gear he could smell candlegrease and damp air the more rancid stenches of bilge and stale food he heard a man yell from above nothing forrard sir and relaxed very slightly on the planks above muffled but recognizable tregorren was moving this way and that probably wondering what to do next but he remembered tregorrens haste to send him below first and without aid if he was concerned about this strange deserted vessel he was certainly indifferent to his midshipmans safety he pushed open a small cabin door and stooped to enter it was so low beneath the deck beams that he had to shuffle in the darkness like a hunchback his hands groping to stop the ship from throwing him off balance his fingers touched a lantern before his face it was icecold at that moment a tiny hatch was flung open overhead and a previously concealed skylight wrenched aside framed in the blinding glare tregorrens massive head peered down at him what the hell are you doing mr bolitho he fell silent and when bolitho turned to follow his stare he saw why sprawled in one corner of the cabin was a man or all there was left of him he had received a terrible head wound from cutlass or axe and had taken several more thrusts in chest and side in the shaft of sunlight his gaze seemed to be slitted against the brightness his eyes terrified as they fixed on bolitho tregorren said at length god almighty then as bolitho remained stockstill beside the corpse he added roughly on deck with you in the bright sunlight again bolitho found that his hands were shaking badly although when he looked at them they seemed as before tregorren ordered put a hand on the wheel thorne mr dancer take your men to the main hold and search it the rest of you begin to take in these damned sails he turned as dancer called gorgons under way again sir yes the lieutenant was frowning with the effort of thinking shell be dropping down within hailing distance by that time i want some answers it was like putting together parts of a torn and dismembered book dancers search of the barquen tines main hold revealed that she had been carrying spirits mostly rum but the hold apart from a few broken and upended casks was empty by the starboard rail on the poop and again on the compass box they found dried blood and the burn marks from discharged pistols the solitary corpse in the cabin must have been the vessels master running below to arm himself to save some valuables or merely to hide it was not clear what was certain was that he had been brutally murdered bolitho heard tregorren say to the boatswains mate mustve been a mutiny and the devils made off after killing the loyal seamen but both of the barquentines boats were still hoisted inboard and secured then when gorgons great pyramid of sails was running slowly across the vessels quarter heather one of dancers party discovered something else just aft of the main hold a ball had smashed into the timbers and when the hull dipped across a deep trough it was possible to see where it had struck the outside of the ship by leaning out from the shrouds bolitho saw it shining from its jagged socket like a malevolent black eye tregorren said heavily must have been a pirate of some sort put a shot into her when she failed to heaveto and then boarded her he ticked off the points on his spatulate fingers then butchered the hands and pitched em overboard there are sharks aplenty hereabouts then they swayed out the cargo to their own ship and cast off he looked round irritably as dancer asked but why not seize the ship too sir i was coming to that he replied angrily but he did not explain further instead he cupped his hands and began to bellow some of his news towards the gorgon across the narrowing stretch of water bolitho heard verlings voice through his speaking trumpet continue the search and remain under our lee that was probably to give the captain time to examine his own logs and documents about local shipping the city of athens was obviously not a new vessel and was probably familiar on the rum trade from the west indies bolitho shivered imagining himself alone and suddenly faced with a rush of savage stabbing boarders tregorren said shortly down aft again he strode to the companion with bolitho at his heels even though he knew what he would see it was still a shock bolitho tried not to look at the dead mans face as tregorren after a brief hesitation began to search his pockets the city of athens log and charts had vanished probably overboard but in a corner of the littered cabin almost hidden under a bunk tregorren found a canvas envelope it was empty but had the vessels agents name in martinique clearly printed on it it was better than nothing the lieutenant righted an upended chair and sat on it heavily his head still almost brushing the deck beams he remained in the same position for several minutes staring at the corpse his face dark with concentration bolitho said i believe there was a third vessel sir that the attackers or pirates saw her sail and decided to make a run for it knowing that this one would attract first attention for an instant he thought tregorren had not heard then the lieutenant said softly when i require aid from you mr bolitho i will ask for it he looked up his eyes in shadow you may be a postcaptains son and the grandson of a flag officer but to me you are a midshipman less than nothing in my book i im sorry bolitho felt himself tense with anger i meant no offence oh yes i know your family tregorrens chest was lifting with exertion and suppressed fury ive seen the fine house the tablets on the church wall well had no safe background to help me and by god ill see you get no favours in my ship understood he swung away controlling his voice with obvious effort now tell someone to cast down a line and haul that corpse on deck then have em clean up the cabin it stinks like a gallowstip down here he touched the leg of his chair there was dried blood on it black in the filtered sunlight almost to himself he muttered probably yesterday otherwise the rats would have found their way in here he jammed on his saltstained hat and ducked out of the cabin later while bolitho and dancer waited by the bulwark and watched the lieutenant being pulled across to gorgons side to make his report bolitho told his friend something of what had happened between them dancer eyed him sadly til wager he intends to put your ideas to the captain dick it would be just like him bolitho touched his arm recalling tregorrens last words before he had dropped into the boat keep steerage way until told what to do and send a good lookout aloft he had pointed at the corpse by the wheel and throw that overboard its how some of youll end up i shouldnt wonder bolitho looked now at the empty space where the unknown man had lain callous and senseless he said tve a few more ideas yet he smiled trying to forget his anger at least i know why he dislikes me dancer followed his mood remember that poor cripple in the blue posts dick he gestured around the deck and at the handful of seamen he said we would both be captains and by god we have a ship of our own already clear for action the gorgons wardroom situated directly below the captains great cabin and which was approximately the same size was packed with figures from bulkhead to stern windows it was lined with small whitepainted cabins and used as a home and diningspace by the lieutenants the master the marine officers and laidlaw the surgeon but in the pink glow of sunset through the stern windows and beneath several spiralling lanterns the wardroom was filled with almost everyone above the rank of petty officer except those needed to work the ship bolitho and dancer found themselves a space on the larboard side by an open window and looked round hopefully for some refreshments but if the wardroom was required to donate its space for a conference it was not apparently inclined to make its guests welcome for most of the day while gorgon and her small consort had ghosted along under reduced canvas bolitho and dancer had fretted and speculated about what was going to happen and what their part would be a boat had eventually been sent for them to rejoin gorgon the boatswains mate thome saying with as much sarcasm as he dared i think i can manage to take charge till you young gennlemen get back sir he had served ten years with the fleet now as they waited with the other midshipmen ignored by the lieutenants and marine officers bolitho and his friend watched the screen door by the trunk of the mizzen mast which pinioned the ship from poop to keel it was like being in a theatre waiting for the principal actor to appear or for an assize judge to take his place and begin a trial bolitho glanced around the wardroom not for the first time different again from the spacious cabin overhead it was nevertheless a palace after the midshipmens berth and gunroom even the little cabin doors which left the occupants barely more room than a cupboard suggested privacy and something personal a table and some good chairs were scattered amongst the standing figures and not jammed together against the curved and often dripping side of the orlop he turned and leaned over the sill seeing the froth from the rudder very pink in the sunset the million dancing mirrors which streamed down from the horizon it was hard to think of murder and danger a man being hacked to death in the trim barquentine which sailed under gorgons lee another two years and he would share a wardroom like this bolitho thought one more step up the ladder he heard feet shuffling around him and dancers quick here they come verling entered first holding the screen door aside so that captain beves conway could move aft without taking his hands from behind his back when he reached the table conway said they may sit down if they wish bolitho watched him fascinated hemmed in by his lieutenants the warrant officers and midshipmen he still managed to appear quite removed from all of them he was wearing a wellpressed blue coat its white lapels and gilt buttons as fresh as from any london tailor breeches and stockings equally clean and neat and his hair was tied to the nape of his neck with a fresh twist of ribbon most of the midshipmen saved their ribbons for special occasions bolitho for instance had his long black hair tied above his collar with a piece of codline verling said briefly pay attention the captain wishes to address you the wardroom seemed to be holding its breath so that the sigh of sea and wind the irregular creak of the rudderhead beneath the stern windows intruded forcefully and bolitho marvelled at the fact that they had sailed all four thousand miles without any real knowledge of why they were doing it the captain said quietly i have brought you all here together to save time you will return to your messes or your divisions when i have finished and tell the people what we are about in your own way far better than a fine speech from the quarterdeck i think he cleared his throat and looked at their expectant faces my orders were to bring this ship to the west coast of africa and carry out a patrol and if necessary land seamen and marines to further those orders in the last few years there has been a growing menace of piracy along these shores and many fine ships have been fired on or have disappeared he was speaking without emotion or excitement and bolitho wondered how such outward calm was possible all these miles with many more yet to sail with the health and management of a raw company to deal with the uncertainties of what he might find at the end of each voyage it could not be so easy to command as he had imagined conway added information came to the admiralty some months ago that some of these pirates had made their base on the coast of senegal for a moment his eyes settled on the untidy cluster of midshipmen which now lies less than thirty miles to leerd mr turnbull assures me the ruddyfaced sailing master smiled grimly and nodded near as dammit sir so be it the brief touch of humour had gone it is my duty to discover this hiding place and my intention is then to destroy it and punish all responsible for these crimes bolitho shivered despite the oppressive heat in the wardroom remembering the withered corpses of some captured pirates dangling in irons outside his own town of falmouth the captain said wryly naturally their lordships in all their wisdom chose a seventyfour for the task the master and several of the older men nodded and grinned as he continued a ship too deephulled to work close inshore and too slow to catch a pirate vessel on the high seas however we do now have the barquentine which mr tregorren has now put into fair shape for use in the kings name several heads turned to peer at the massive lieutenant as conway added he has informed me of his observations concerning the vessels fate and has suggested that the attackers may have been frightened off by the appearance of another ship as it was likely this happened yesterday it may have been our topgallants which the pirates saw if it was near this time and allowing for wind and current the city of athens may well have been cloaked in dusk while we still held the sunset as we do now he shrugged as if tired of speculation be that as it may they robbed a peaceful merchantman and no doubt threw the crew to the sharks or so terrified the survivors that they will hang with their captors when we take them as take them we must verling took the hint and asked questions dewar the major of marines asked bluntly what sort of opposition may we expect sir the captain eyed him for several seconds there is a small island off the coast which was first discovered about four hundred years ago and which has been occupied by the dutch the french even ourselves for most of the time it is well sited for defence from the shore about a mile or so out in sharkinfested waters he paused his eyes impatient well hope the fifth lieutenant asked lamely why from the shore sir surprisingly captain conway offered a small smile a good question mr hope i am glad someone was paying attention he ignored hopes flush of pleasure and tregorrens scowl the reason is simple the island has always been used for gathering slaves for sale and shipment to the americas he sensed the sudden uneasiness amongst his officers and snapped it is a foul trade but not illegal the slavers assemble their victims for the captivery and any who do not measure up to the traders needs are disposed of to the sharks this convenience also prevents friends or relations from saving the wretches from a living hell elsewhere major dewar eyed his marine lieutenant and muttered fiercely by god well show em eh i dont care a fig about slavery one way or tother but any pirate is vermin as far as im concerned dancer said softly my father has often said that slavery and piracy go hand in hand the one section preys on the other or they work together against authority when it suits them little eden murmured excitedly wait ttill they see the gorgon ccoming for them eh he rubbed his hands jjust you wwait verling barked silence there the captain glanced around the wardroom we will lieto and then close the land tomorrow it is a dangerous coastline and i have no desire to leave the keel on some reef or other our new consort will lead the approach and landing parties will be detailed at first light he moved towards the door carry on mr verling the first lieutenant waited for the door to shut and said return to your messes he sought out a masters mate mr ivey you are to take charge of the city of athens for the night i suggest you call away a boat immediately dancer sighed tregorren steals your ideas dick and now theyve taken our first command he grinned but i think i feel a mite safer in this fat old lady eden grinned i can ssmell ffood he hurried from the wardroom his feet guided by his stomach we may as well go too dick they both turned as tregorrens voice followed them to the gundeck belay that ive work for you two get aloft to the fore tgansl yard and examine the splicing those lazy devils were supposed to be doing there while we were aboard the prize he regarded them calmly not too dark for you is it or too dangerous mebbee dancer opened his mouth to answer but bolitho said aye aye sir the lieutenant called after them no skimping now on the darkening gangway by the weather shrouds bolitho said quietly i wonder if im always to be cursed by a fear of heights they stood looking up at the black crisscross of rigging the braced foretopsail yard and the one above it deep pink in the dying light which had already gone from the decks below dancer said til go dick hell never know bolitho smiled grimly hell know martyn it would be just what he wanted he removed his coat and hat and wedged them under a rack of boarding pikes lets be about it then at least it will give us an appetite aft by the big double wheel the helmsmen watched the flickering compass light and eased the spokes very slightly their bare feet planted on the deck as if they were part of it the officer of the watch moved restlessly along the weather side glancing occasionally to the opposite beam where the barquentines solitary lantern made a small glow on the seas face from beneath the poop captain conway strode past the wheel his hands behind him his body angled to the deck the senior helmsman nudged his mate and called steady as she goes sir soueast by south the captain nodded and waited for the lieutenant on watch to hurry discreetly to the lee side and leave him the privacy he needed for his nightly walk up and down the weather side his shoes tapping on the smooth planking once he paused to glance through the mainmast rigging to two shadowy figures high up on the foretopgallant yard like birds on a perch but he soon forgot them as he continued pacing and thinking of tomorrow on this particular morning all hands were called early from their hammocks to an even hastier meal of oatmeal gruel and toasted ships biscuit washed down with a tankard of ale as one elderly seaman commented gloomily to get such a good fillup this early means the capns expectin trouble then as the first hint of dawn showed itself in the eastern sky and the cooks doused the galley fires the pipe came from aft hands to quarters hands to quarters and clear for action urged on by the frenzied tattoo of the drummer boys as they beat to quarters from the poop by the additional shouts and threats from warrant officers and senior hands alike gorgons company went into one more drill one which they had practised and practised until their limbs had ached through sleet and boiling sun alike until they knew where every man each piece of equipment every line and halliard should be when the ship was called to action some of the seasoned men took greater care this time perhaps they expected that todays drill meant more than it showed others and the very young like eden went to their stations like excited children unquenched even by curses from exasperated lieutenants and threats from their companions down on the lower gundeck bolitho felt his own heart beating faster than usual in the neardarkness of the lowbeamed deck he could see seamen ducking and clambering around each great thirtytwopounder heard their bare feet grating on the sand which some ships boys had sprinkled liberally around the decks to stop them slipping or falling during the drill some light filtered down from the companion on the upper deck and he was able to see the gun crews checking their gear and casting off the breechings to check the training tackles and test their handspikes high overhead they could hear the muffled squeal of blocks as nets were rigged above the deck and its guns to protect the men underneath from falling spars and broken rigging how many times had they done it over the four thousand miles he felt men hurrying past guided by the boatswains thick voice screens were still being torn down chests tables and unwanted clutter being taken below to the orlop tregorrens voice boomed in the gloom lively you scum its taken far too long already on the lower gundeck apart from the mass of seamen needed to work the double battery of thirtytwopounders were two lieutenants tregorren being in charge and mr wellesley the ships junior lieutenant his assistant and four midshipmen the latter were evenly placed along the various divisions of guns and were supposed to relay orders fire independently if need be and carry messages to the quarterdeck bolitho and dancer shared the larboard side and a sulky youth named pearce and little eden had the starboard battery halfway along the deck tregorren stood with his back to the mainmast trunk arms folded his head bent down to peer along his domain nearby a marine sentry stood by the companion ladder as did others at every hatch so that in the event of battle he could prevent the less brave from running below to hide wellesley the sixth lieutenant hurried down the larboard side his sword flapping against his thigh as he paused by each gun captain just long enough to hear the man snap ready sir at last it was all still and only the gentle heave of the deck the regular creak of tackles as the guns tugged or nudged to the ships roll broke the silence bolitho could smell the tension the men around him the hull deeper still under his feet he tried not to think of the midshipmens berth on the orlop the after cockpit as it was called which too had been transformed there now would be the surgeon and his assistants lanterns lit instruments gleaming in the open cases just as they had done it to captain conways orders on countless occasions tregorren yelled mr wellesley what kept you the sixth lieutenant scuttled towards him and almost went sprawling across a ringbolt he gasped lower battery cleared for action sir on the deck above they heard a whistle and someone calling cleared for action sir tregorren swore savagely beaten us again damn them he added harshly mr eden pass the word at the double eden returned his breath wheezing as he reported the first lieutenants compliments sir and the ship cleared for action in twelve minutes he hesitated but but what the boy gulped it took us longer than anyone else sir more orders were being piped the calls of the boatswains mates shrilling like birds on a norfolk fen open ports bolitho leaned forward to restrain one of the gun crews it was stiflingly hot between decks but he knew that every port should open as one here and on the deck above as the port lids were hoisted upward he felt the cooler air fanning around him saw the men nearest him take on personality and meaning their bodies stripped to the waist and shining faintly in the strange dawn light he glanced aft and saw dancer give him a quick wave during the morning watch gorgon had altered course slightly and was now steering eastsoutheast the wind having shifted to the north and held there the hull tilted and felt steady and with the wind coming across the larboard quarter bolithos section of guns was pointing high and free from spray he saw the lively whitecaps some strange fish leaping like birds along the ships wash and keeping level with their slow approach by leaning out and around a gun muzzle he saw a darker shape on the water and guessed it to be the city of athens he tried to guess what was happening on deck the prize vessel was obviously leaving her station downwind of her protector and was beating across their line of advance to place herself between gorgon and the land wherever that was a young seaman asked can you see the land sir he was a goodlooking youth who had come from devon to join the ship during the night watches and the sweating drill at this same gun he had explained that all his family had worked for their local squire a hard man and one taken with abusing the daughters of his tenant farmers and labourers that was all he had confided but bolitho guessed it likely that he had given the squire a beating and then run to join a ship any ship to escape punishment bolitho replied very near id say fairweather i can see some seabirds now coming out to take a look at us i shouldnt wonder silence on the gundeck tregorrens anger seemed to spread itself to officers and seamen alike someone gave a yelp of pain as a gun captain used a ropes end and from right aft wellesley s rather ineffectual voice called take that mans name i say nobody knew what man or to whom the order was directed and bolitho guessed that the lieutenant was merely trying to avoid tregorrens tongue it was strange how cut off from the rest of the ship it felt more light was painting the sea in black and yellow patterns but the horizon and sky were still as one the square gunport cut in the ships massive oak side was like a picture bolitho thought but as the light strengthened and spilled down the long barrel of the thirtytwopounder they all seemed to become part of it colour stood out now inside the gundeck the dark red paint which was used on the ships side and much of the deck beneath them showed itself for the first time it was there to disguise the blood of dead and wounded men everyone knew that bolitho glanced down the sloping deck to the opposite side those open gunports were still in darkness broken here and there by some leaping feathers of spray or a crest breaking close to the hull he looked towards tregorren who was speaking quietly with jehan the gunner silent in his felt slippers which he always wore to prevent striking sparks when he was working in his beloved magazine he vanished down the nearest ladder by the marine sentry and bolitho wondered if dancer was thinking of the fact that the most dangerous mass of gunpowder in time of action was directly beneath his feet there was something like a sigh as the first sheen of sunlight filtered across the water and through each open port bolitho leaned on the guns breech and watched it transform the horizon into something real and solid the land fairweather asked excitedly be that africa the gun captain showed his uneven teeth dont matter to you where it be lad just attend to old freda ere and keep er fed no matter what thats all you need to know a midshipman pattered down from the next deck and sought out tregorren mr verlings compliments sir it was a midshipman named knibb a boy as small and as young as eden but for a months difference and we will not be loading just yet tregorren snapped whats happening then knibb blinked around him seeking out his friends the masthead has reported sighting two vessels at anchor around the point sir his confidence was growing aided by the knowledge that every shadowy figure was listening to him trying to discover what was going on in that other world above our captain has ordered the barquentine to make more sail and investigate sir the gun captain beside bolitho was explaining to his crew i know these ere waters lads reefs an shoals everywhere our capnll ave two good leadsmen in the chains bnow takin regular soundins feelin our way inshore bolitho did not hear them he was thinking of the deserted barquentine the dead man in her cabin he wondered if tregorrens obvious illhumour was because he had not been given command of the city of athens the third lieutenant tregorrens immediate superior had been sent instead and was assisted by grenfell the senior midshipman if all went well this little piece of extra responsibility would see the midshipman well on his way to promotion bolitho was glad for him if envious of his freedom grenfell had done all he could to make him and the awkward newcomers in his midst welcome it was not unusual for midshipmen in grenfells place to act like little tyrants two ships at anchor knibb had said pirates or slavers both would get a shock when gorgon made her entrance feet tramped dully overhead and bolitho heard the squeak of blocks as once again the yards were trimmed the sails reset while the ship altered course he moved inboard and rested his hands on the great capstan which was used for hoisting heavy spars or boats to their allotted positions and listened to tregorrens harsh voice as he spoke to wellesley and midshipman pearce beyond them the open ports were more sharply defined and for a moment bolitho thought that the light was playing tricks on him the land was probing out to greet them which was impossible for he could see it on his own side he recalled suddenly what the captain had said about an island this must be it with the ship steering into a great arrowhead of water between it and the mainland the anchored ships must be right ahead and invisible to both gundecks tregorren was saying look theres a fort of sorts on the island must be as old as bloody moses he chuckled wait till you cast your eyes on some of these black lasses theyre beautiful like he got no further bolitho had seen what looked like a dolphin skipping across the lively inshore current and then he heard the far off boom of an explosion the line of breaking crests vanished and there was a chorus of shouts and curses as a great ball slammed down hard alongside the hull the old gun captain shouted with disbelief the devils ave fired on us be god the whole ship came alive to confused orders and the blare of a marines trumpet tackles squeaked and gun trucks began to move overhead and then came the cry all guns load and prepare to run out starboard battery will engage first tregorren stared at the messengers breeches very white on the companion ladder apparently unable to believe what he had heard then with a grunt he bellowed all load stand by on the starboard battery the seaman called fairweather followed bolitho to the opposite side as with sudden haste the barebacked figures began to ram home their bulky cartridges and wads while each gun captain selected a ball from the garlands feeling it testing its shape and even finish before allowing it to be rammed and wadded into his waiting gun hand by hand shot up and every eye was on the burly lieutenant all loaded sir run out they threw themselves on to the tackles and hauled the lumbering guns to the open ports each truck squealing and protesting like a hog going to market the guns remained in deep shadow along the starboard side but the ancient fortress as it showed itself to each breathless crew was clear to see its rough walls were like gold in the frail light its shape merging with the rocks which supported it above the ramparts bolitho saw several dark smudges which he took for an instant to be hovering clouds of mosquitoes he heard a seaman mutter between his teeth them devils is heatin shot sir they got furnaces goin right the way along tregorren snarled til flog the next man to speak but he sounded anxious as well he might bolitho thought his father had told him often enough what heated shot could do to a tinderdry hull with all its tophamper of tarred rigging and canvas a voice yelled stand by to starboard maximum elevation and fire on the uproll a petty officer jabbed a seaman on the shoulder so that he jumped as if he had been shot wind yer neckcloth round yer ears man less you want to be deaf all yer life he winked at bolitho the warning had probably been for his benefit but even midshipmen were allowed some respect stand by the ship tilted to wind and rudder and by each gun its captain was crouching inboard his eye along every black muzzle towards the sky and the fortress fire change of fortune with the order to open fire being yelled from deck to deck each gun captain thrust his slowmatch to the vent and jumped aside a split second and yet to bolitho who stood between a pair of thirtytwopounders it seemed like an age a longdrawnout moment when everything was crystalclear and unmoving as in a painting the barebacked seamen crouching at tackles or holding handspikes individual gun captains grimfaced and concentrating only on their own ports and aim and through each square port the sunlighton the fortress the sky very pale without even a puff of cloud and then everything changed the lower gundeck exploded to the thunder of cannon fire the hull and timbers bucking as if caught beneath an avalanche gun by gun crashed inboard on its tackles its crew running to sponge out to ram home a charge and another gleaming ball taken by the wind the dense clouds of smoke drifted away from the hull shutting out the fortress masking the sky in brown fog tregorren was yelling stop your vents sponge out load but his voice seemed to be coming through a curtain the first broadside having rendered eardrums and minds almost senseless but the effect of firing the starboard battery was plain to see the first nervousness was gone instead there was a sort of wildness as gun crews peered at each other grinned and gestured like children it was not just another drill it was real and they were firing in earnest run out once more the trucks squeaked on the deck the crews hurling themselves on their tackles to be first through the open ports bolitho heard wellesley say excitedly theyll pipe another tune now by heaven tregorren rasped whoever they may be dammit in the pause as each crew peered along the angled muzzles bolitho heard the clatter of movement from the deck above gorgon must make a brave sight if there was anyone to care he thought under shortened sail no doubt her guns bared to the early sunlight she must be heading close inshore he did not even know who had fired on the ship or why and he was surprised to discover that it did not seem to matter in these brief minutes the men around him the ship around all of them had become one stand by as you bear the suspense was breathstopping fire again the hull shook like a mad thing the planking jarring under the feet as the guns crashed inboard their smoke belching like a curtain beyond the ports eden was cheering despite several angry glances from tregorren and some of the seamen were actually laughing dancer called i hope they can see what we are about on the quarterdeck we could be shooting at the sky he winced as something jarred against the hull followed immediately by a chorus of shouts from overhead bolitho nodded towards him it was a direct hit they whoever they were had struck back somewhere a pump began to clatter and he guessed that a heated ball must have penetrated the timbers and water was needed to quench it before the wood took light a seaman near him gestured towards the deckhead give they lazy dogs summat to do eh but nobody laughed and bolitho saw wellesley rubbing his chin in quick nervous movements as if he was unable to believe that someone should dare to fire at a kings ship all loaded sir a messenger appeared on the companion ladder his voice shrill we are going about sir prepare to engage with the larboard side he vanished fairweather peered at bolitho his teeth white in the eddying smoke wem hitting em proper eh sir giving tother guns a chance the gun captain darted a quick glance at the breechings and snapped theyve got us beat were runnin away you soft fool bolitho saw the amazement on fairweathers face and felt the gun captains blunt words moving to the other men nearby tregorren strode past his head dipping between the massive beams stand to your guns prepare to run out he paused and glared at bolitho what th hell are you staring at were coming about sir he kept his voice steady aware that there was more gunfire from the far distance whoever commanded the fortress had plenty of artillery what a masterly appraisal mr bolitho tregorren gripped a deckhead beam as gorgon began to tilt steeply the sea lifting towards the open ports as she swung heavily into the wind was the din of battle too much for you no sir he met his hostility and added i think we may have been too close inshore that fortress has our exact range men who seconds earlier had been hurrying to the opposite side paused to watch the towering bulk of the lieutenant and the slim midshipman angled to the deck their arms at their sides like antagonists meeting for a duel wellesley said nervously the captain knows best tregorren stared at him do you have to explain to a midshipman he looked from one to the other now stand to your guns but the order to fire the larboard was not given instead there was a long and uncertain silence broken only by the occasional movement of seamen on the upper deck the twitter of calls as the hands went to braces and halliards for altering course the gun captain near bolitho said darkly told you capns standin out to sea just as well if you asks me during the long and tiring gun drills bolitho had never found time to consider how cutoff this deck could become now as seamen and their officers stood or lounged beside the ports he felt a growing sense of apprehension and uncertainty he could tell from the slant of the sun that the ship was heading away from the land but apart from that there was nothing to break the frustrating sense of being quite apart from the world above secure guns the messengers white breeches caught the filtered sunlight on the ladder all officers lay aft if you please sir bolitho said to dancer i think the captain has been worried all along martyn dancer looked at him grimly but surely he would not run from a damned pirate better than be left swimming without a ship eh bolitho tried to cheer him up i know which id rather have but if the lower gundeck was remote and as before the quarterdeck was not bolitho stood blinking in the harsh glare seeing the two great holes in the main topsail a streak of scarlet on the planking to mark where a man had fallen or died he stared over the rail and saw the land shimmering in a blinding haze already the island and its fortress had merged with the mainland and the anchored ships quite lost from sight around the same point which they had so confidently rounded a few hours earlier of the barquentine there was no sign at all dancer asked anxiously where is the city of athens do you think little eden said shes sstanding off tto keep an eye on the ddevils dancer nodded bit of luck getting hold of her they fell silent as verling dismissed the hands from the quarterdeck ninepounders and beckoned the other officers to close around him he appeared as irritable as ever bolitho thought his beaky nose checking who was present and who was yet to arrive captain conway crossed from the weather side and stood by the quarterdeck rail looking down at the eighteenpounders below him their crews checking their equipment and refilling the shot garlands there was a rank smell of powder in the air of heated metal and charred wood verling said all present sir the captain turned and regarded them thoughtfully his back against the rail his palms resting on the polished wood we are standing offshore and will anchor further along the coast as you know we were fired on and fired on with a confidence i dislike he spoke calmly and unhurriedly with less emotion than when he had awarded a flogging the enemy is well prepared and our bombardment such as it was made no impression but i had to be certain to gain some knowledge of what we are against bolitho could tell from the expressions of some of those nearby who had been on the upper deck throughout the biief engagement that there was something more to come captain conway continued in the same tone some months ago it was reported that one of our brigs a new vessel which was employed in these waters was overdue and therefore presumed lost there had been some foul weather and several merchantmen were also wrecked he glanced up at the masthead pendant his eyes shining in the glare when we rounded the point this morning the city of athens was well in the lead the lookouts reported sighting two vessels at anchor there may have been more under the islands protection his voice hardened for the first time but one of them was the missing brig his majestys ship sandpiper of fourteen guns because of her the city of athens must have imagined that all was well that sandpipers captain had already done our work for us dancer gave a gasp as he added the brig was the bait which we but for our prize would have taken we would have laid under the guns of the fortress and without the speed and agility to beat clear would have been destroyed as it was the barquentine was hit several times i doubt if any of her people survived there was absolute silence bolitho was remembering the din on the lower gundeck the importance and excitement they had all felt he recalled the unsmiling face of midshipman grenfell a face which had hidden a warmer and kinder nature than many imagined and it had all happened without a word being passed from the quarterdeck it would have changed nothing could have done nothing to help and yet the captain added slowly when we took the city of athens mr tregorren suggested that the pirates made off upon sighting another vessel it now seems very possible that the other sail was ours and the reasons for the pirates haste was that he did not want to be seen for what he is a captured british manowar imagine gentleman what havoc he may have been wreaking in our countrys name he spat out the words like poison no master of any peaceful vessel would challenge a ship so obviously british and in the kings service that is not piracy it is coldblooded murder mr verling nodded it would be simple sir whoever commands these scum has a sharp mind to attend him the captain did not seem to hear some of our prize crew may have survived he glanced down at the dried blood by his feet we may never know however our next task is to seize the brig and discover all we can of what is happening bolitho looked at the others seize the brig just like that a cuttingout operation must be done tonight no moon and the weather favours us at present the marines will provide a distraction but i want that vessel retaken the shame she has been made to endure and promote wiped out he turned as the surgeon appeared on the ladder well the lookout died sir laidlaws hooded eyes were expressionless broke his back i see the captain turned to the silent officers the lookout was the one who first sighted sandpiper the balls which passed close above us from the battery ashore must have thrown him to the deck bolitho watched the surgeon for some sign knowing he was remembering that same lookout was the man who had been flogged the captain licked his lips it was very hot on the quarterdeck with the worst of the day yet to come he said mr verling will give you your instructions there will be two boats for the cuttingout more would lessen our chances he walked away adding carry on verling watched him go two lieutenants and three midshipmen will take charge of the attack he eyed tregorren coldly you will command take only trained hands this is no work for ploughmen eden whispered what does it mmean dick he looked very small beside the others the sulky midshipman named pearce said we board the brig in the darkness and cut em down before they return the compliment he added harshly poor john grenfell we grew up together in the same town verling said return to your duties the hands can fall out from quarters and secure keep em busy i want no bleating and sobbing for what has happened they began to break up each man wrapped in his own thoughts on the suddenness of death tregorren said thirty men will be needed he hesitated as midshipman pearce called id like to volunteer sir tregorren regarded him calmly mr grenfell was a friend of yours i had forgotten a pity that bolitho watched him sickened despite all that had happened even the sudden likelihood of his own injury or death tregorren still found delight in taunting the grimfaced pearce the lieutenant said abruptly request denied his eyes settled on eden tou will be one of the lucky midshipmen he smiled as eden paled a real chance to prove yourself bolitho said he is the youngest sir some of us have had more experience and he faltered seeing the trap opening tregorren shook one finger i forgot about that too that our mr bolitho is always afraid that someone else will steal his thunder deny him of honour so that his highandmighty family might frown a bit that is a lie sir and unfair tregorren shrugged ts it no matter you are also going and the clever mr dancer he put his huge hands on his hips and looked at each in turn the first lieutenant said only trained hands should be detailed but we need experienced midshipmen for handling the ship on a cuttingout raid we only require the right number he took out his pocket watch i want the full party mustered in an hour mr hope will be my subordinate report to him when you are ready dancer said bitterly better hope than wellesley he is as weak as watered milk they walked along the weather gangway thinking of grenfell and the others who had been lost in the shattered barquentine eden said fiercely i im nnot afraid rreally im not he looked at them wretchedly his eyes filling his face its just that i ddont want to go with mr ttregorren hhell be the ddeath of us all dancer looked down at him and tried to smile well be with you torn it may not be too bad he turned suddenly to bolitho what is it like dick youve done this sort of thing before bolitho stared across the nettings towards the misty hump of land and the glittering expanse of water its quick everything depends on surprise he did not look at them what could he say tell them of the fearful cries and curses of men fighting with cutlasses and knives with axes and pikes of the touch of an enemy the feel of his breath and his hatred it was not like a sea fight with the enemyjust another ship it was people flesh and blood dancer said quietly i can tell from your silence let us hope we are lucky down on the orlop they found pearce and two other midshipmen restoring the chests and wellused chairs to their proper places the surgeons mates having removed their instruments and medicines as soon as the secure was piped in its place against one of gorgons great frames was grenfells chest his best hat and dirk hanging above it pearce said he always said hed never rate lieutenant he never will now bolitho looked round as midshipman marrack entered impeccable as ever in a clean shirt marrack said shortly leave his gear alone there may still be a chance he threw his coat on a chair and added you should have seen her go the city of athens never stood a chance she was actually shortening sail to close the brig when the fortress battery took her he stared at nothing she took fire and then turned turtle i saw some of our people swimming then the sharks came he could not go on dancer looked at bolitho i remember reading something about the sandpiper marrack said one thing is certain our captain will never allow a kings ship to remain in enemy hands no matter what it costs to recover her he reached into his chest and took out a leather case take my pistols dick theyre better than any others aboard my father gave them to me he turned away as if annoyed at showing a softer side to his nature see what confidence i have in you the small servant scuttled into the berth beg pardon sirs but the fourth lieutenant is lookin for you and yellin murder that tregorren dancer was unusually bitter i agree with little torn here the damned bully is too full of himself for my liking they made for the companion ladder and only then realized that eden was still by the side he was staring at grenfells chest and his dirk which swung easily to the ships movements bolitho said gently come on torn theres a lot to be done before sunset to himself he added and after face to face easy there watch your stroke hope the gorgons fifth lieutenant hissed in the darkness craning forward from the sternsheets as if to seek out the noise bolitho crouched beside him and turned to peer astern only an occasional feather of white spray or a trailing glow of phosphorescence around the oars betrayed the position of the other cutter it was very dark and after the cloudless day surprisingly cold which was just as well he thought for they had come a long way the boats had been lowered and manned before dusk and while gorgon made more sail and went about to leave them to their own resources they had settled down to a long steady pull towards the slab of headland when darkness had arrived it had been sudden like the fall of a curtain and bolitho found himself wondering what was going on in the lieutenants mind it was a far cry indeed from the time when he had thrown open the door of the blue posts at portsmouth and bellowed at the midshipmen he remembered what grenfell had said then about hopes worries of promotion the memory saddened him grenfell was dead and hope would indeed be moving up a place when the captain chose to accept that the lieutenant who had been in charge of the city of athens was also killed eden was leaning against him his head lowered almost to the gunwale bolitho said quietly still a way to go yet torn it was an eerie sensation the cutter thrusting jerkily across the inshore currents the oars rising and falling on either beam like pale bones their usual noise muffled by rags and thick layers of grease ahead of the boat there was a darker wedge to show the division between sea and sky and bolitho thought he could smell the earth sense its nearness in the bows bent over the stem and a viciouslooking swivel gun was a leadsman his boats lead and line sounding the way above sandbars and hidden rocks turnbull the master had explained to the two lieutenants that it was best to creep right inshore so that once around the headland they would liesomewhere between the beach and the anchored ships it had all sounded so easy not now as a man caught his foot in a cutlass and set it clattering across the bottomboards and hope snarled god rogers ill have you beaten senseless if you make another sound bolitho looked at his profile a shadow against the oars spray alongside a lieutenant a man who knew that tregorren was following close astern depending on his ability to lead the way thirty men for a pressgang or for manning a couple of heavy guns it was ample for taking a ship against odds and without surprise it was disaster a strong eddy pushed the hull aside so that the coxswain had to use his strength at the tiller to bring it back on course the air felt different again and the sea across the larboard beam looked livelier bolitho ventured we are round the headland sir hope swung on him and then said yes youd know of course you must have grown up with rocks like these in cornwall he seemed to be studying him in the darkness but a long pull yet bolitho hesitated unwilling to break the little contact between them will the marines attack the battery sir some mad scheme like that hope wiped his face as spray lanced into the boat the captain will tack as close as he dares to the seaward end of the island and pretend to attempt a landing plenty of noise major dewar will be good at that hes got plenty to say in the wardroom the whisper came back along the oarsmen vessel at anchor on th starboard bow sir hope nodded steer a point or so to larboard he twisted round to make sure the other boat was following that must be the first of em the brig is anchored beyond her a couple of cables yet someone groaned more worried apparently at the prospect of pulling a heavy oar for another four hundred yards than the possible closeness of death watch out the bowman dropped his lead and line and seized a boathook the oars went into momentary confusion as something large and black like a sleeping whale loomed over the cutter banging into the blades and making what seemed like a tremendous noise eden murmured shakily its ppart of the bbarquentine dick yes bolitho could smell the charred timbers could even recognise a part of the city of athens taffrail before it lurched away into the darkness the unexpected appearance of part of the wreck had quite an effect on the seamen there was something like a low growl and tired though they were the oarsmen started putting an extra power into their stroke hope said softly these are seasoned hands bolitho they have been in gorgon together for a long while and had plenty of friends aboard the prize he stiffened as the sweeping masts and yards of an anchored vessel passed slowly abeam there she goes nary a damn sound bolitho peered at the darkened ship moored alongside the gorgon she would look dwarfed out here and from the cutter she appeared enormous hope was thinking aloud small frigate most likely not english too much rake on her masts he sounded completely absorbed this devil has gathered quite a fleet it seems ease the stroke the coxswain whispered fiercely here comes tother one hope rose to his feet steadying himself on bolithos shoulder bolitho could feel the power of his grip could imagine his anxieties at this moment hope said if only i could look at my watch the coxswain grinned might as well send the devils a signal sir aye hope sighed lets pray that major dewar and his bullocks are punctual he peered over the gunwale watching the swirl of the current testing the wind against his face he seemed satisfied easy all the oars rose dripping from the water and stayed motionless the cutter moving steadily ahead in complete silence bolitho saw the anchored brig for the first time swinging sternon her gilded cabin windows showing more brightly than the lower hull as she pivoted very slowly away from the land he could just make out her two masts and furled sails the blacker angles of her shrouds before they too merged with the night bolitho tried to put himself in the place of those aboard they had fought and captured the barquentine robbed her holds and killed her crew at the sight of a large manofwar they had sheered off and come back here to count their gains gorgons appearance offshore would have caused a lot of speculation but under the guns of the old fortress they would have felt secure enough the fortress had been here for a few hundred years the captain had said it had changed hands several times by treaty or because of a trading agreement but had never been taken by force just a few men at those carefully sited guns some heated shot and the rest was easy even if captain conway had commanded several small agile ships and ten times as many men the fortress would still have held the key to victory and in time of peace it was doubtful if either the admiralty or the men of parliament would be prepared to condone a fullscale siege on this tiny pinprick of africa with all the losses entailed equally they would expect captain conway to do something to recapture the brig for a beginning a shaft of silver ran up the brigs foremast shrouds and hope snapped the anchor watch in the bows checking the cable the lanterns beam died away just as quickly the drift of the current was taking the cutter crabwise towards the brigs counter hope must have realized there was no more time left he said quietly boat your oars stand by bowman the oars rumbled across the thwarts but bolitho knew from experience that the noise which seemed deafening on the cool breeze would be nothing to a man up on the brigs forecastle eden whispered whats mr ttregorren going to do bolitho could feel his spine chilling under the tension he heard hope drawing his sword very carefully from its scabbard crouching to peer up at the brigs poop as it rose steadily above the boat he replied once we have boarded her he will attack from the bows cut the cable and hope snapped ready lads there was a sudden explosion which seemed to come from far out to sea a dull red glow spread and glittered on the water making each part of the swell shine like silk another explosion and still another hope exclaimed dewars marines have started already he staggered and all but fell as the cutter ground into the brigs quarter and the bowman hurled his grapnel up and over the rail at em lads hopes voice after the stealth and the suspense was like a thunderclap come on scrambling and yelling like madmen they swarmed up the side and open gunports in a solid mass of bodies someone encountered a loosely rigged boarding net but even as voices shouted with alarm from below the net was severed and with hope and his coxswain in the lead they swept on to the unfamiliar deck it was like a scene from an inferno the british seamen charging across the deck their faces and wild eyes revealed in the reflected red flashes and the exploding charges at the end of the island two figures ran from the forecastle and a pistol cracked out from a companionway a seaman fell sobbing another jabbed down one of the running figures with his cutlass and hacked him across the neck as he fell for good measure more shots now the balls slamming into the planking or hissing away over the sea the brigs crew were crowding through the two main hatches and a ragged volley of pistol and musket fire cut down several of hopes men the lieutenant yelled bring the swivel from the cutter he caught a man who was hurled aside by a musket ball and lowered him roughly to the deck adding between gasps where is that bloody tregorren the forepart of the brig now seemed full of men pale and crouching darting between familiar objects to take cover and fire on the retreating boarding party hope said desperately if we cant get to grips were done for with a pistol in his left hand his curved hanger in the other he shouted close quarters lads then he charged along the deck and threw himself amongst the nearest marksmen shouts of surprise gave way to screams and yells as hope fired his pistol into a mans chest and slashed another with his hanger cursing and cheering the remaining boarders followed him striking out at anything which moved bolitho fired both of marracks pistols into the crowd and thrust them into his belt he drew his own hanger and parried away a pike which plunged towards him like a spear despite all the danger and terror he found he was able to remember his first boarding attack a lieutenant had taken away his midshipmans dirk and had said scornfully thats only fit for playing games you need a mans weapon for this kind of work he thought of grenfells dirk hanging in the gorgon he had left his behind too a face loomed above him the man screaming like a fiend although in what language bolitho could not tell he felt a violent blow on the side of his head and saw the mans arm going up his sword pale against the black sky bolitho twisted his body round and struck upwards with the hanger he felt the pain of the blow lance up his arm saw the man and sword fall into the gasping struggling figures as if swallowed up he heard a shrill cry and saw eden groping on the deck while above him a figure swung a musket like a club a pistol exploded revealing the mans glaring eyes his fierce concentration giving way to a distorted mask of agony as a pistol ball flung him down bolitho dragged eden to his feet hacking out at a running figure but feeling the blade slice through the air hope shouted swivel gun he gestured to the little rail across the poop lively there fall back they needed no bidding parrying and slashing dragging the wounded as best they could the survivors fought their way aft to the poop hope bellowed down lads he thrust at a charging man with his hanger even as the coxswain put a match to the swivel gun which he had mounted on the rail the man cut down by hopes sword must have been carrying a loaded pistol for as the swivel let out a savage bang and sent a packed charge of canister shot into the advancing shadows the pistol hit the deck and fired even though its owner was dead the ball struck the lieutenant in the shoulder and he fell beside the smoking swivel without a sound as their ears recovered from the swivels vicious detonation bolitho heard the cries and screams of men caught in the deadly canister no wonder old seamen called a swivel the daisycutter then from right forward in the beakhead he heard the familiar harsh tones of lieutenant tregorren the sudden rush of feet and the cheers of the other boats crew it was more than enough for the brigs company sharks or not they were leaping overboard ignoring the yells and curses of their comrades who were too badly hurt to follow tregorren strode aft pausing merely to bring a belaying pin down on the skull of someone trying to climb on to the main chains he peered at the men by the rail take care of mr hope the belaying pin pointed and gestured like an obscene fist two men on the wheel mr dancer pass the word to cut the cable he rocked back on his heels his eyes searching amongst the rigging hands aloft and loose topsls come along jump about my children if you dont want to run ashore bolitho knelt beside the wounded lieutenant feeling his pain his strength ebbing away he said that was a brave thing you did sir hope said between his teeth nothing else i could do he tried to pat bolithos arm youll know what i mean one day tregorren towered above them mr eden take charge of this officer he faced bolitho so youre still with us eh he shrugged well get aloft and chase those laggards the brig was already heeling in the offshore breeze her hastily released topsails flapping and cracking like musket fire as she tilted free of her severed cable put up your helm several shots whimpered overhead fired by whom nobody knew loose the headsls tregorren seemed everywhere lay her on the starboard tack bolitho clung to the shrouds and stared abeam where a fire was still burning fiercely to show where the marines had created a diversion tiny lanterns moved this way and that and he realized they were on the other vessel which had already changed her bearing considerably after the long pull around the headland the apprehension and fear the actual cuttingout had taken less than twenty minutes it seemed incredible and as he paused to think of the nearness of death he felt the sweat like icerime on his spine he slid down a backstay and found tregorren bellowing orders down the after companion dancer ran across the deck and said god i was worried for you i thought we were never going to engage he turned as a man yelled sir theres a whole lot of british seamen battened down ere tregorren snapped see to them no doubt they are some of the brigs own company he caught the mans arm but prisoners sick or bloody well dying i want em up here on deck he lowered his face to the compass box hold her steady quartermaster as close to the wind as you can i want no mauling from that battery aye aye sir the men at the wheel eased the spokes deftly full an bye sir west by south bolitho watched the figures emerging from the main hatch even in the darkness he could sense their disbelief as they were helped and pushed on to the open deck one man lurched aft and touched his forehead starkie sir masters mate of the sandpiper he swayed and would have fallen but for bolitho tregorren was watching the released seamen his chin sunk on his neckcloth you the senior aye sir capn wade and the other officers were killed he dropped his eyes we have been in hell sir possibly tregorren strode to the foot of the mainmast and squinted up at the flapping topsail get some of those hands to work and set the spanker and then the foresl i want to get some searoom he turned and added shortly well mr starkie you can take charge aft as you are the best qualified he looked him slowly up and down as if his eyes could pierce the darkness although it would seem you are less so for defending one of his majestys ships eh he hurried away shouting for dancer and thrusting through the dazed seamen like a plough the masters mate consulted the compass and the set of the topsail and said harshly he had no cause to speak like that we had no chance he looked at bolitho and added you fought well back there some of these devils were laughing at what they would do if your ship tried to force home an attack but who are they starkie let out a great sigh pirates corsairs call em what you will but i swear i have seen none worse and i have been at sea all my years bolitho saw two men carrying lieutenant hope to the companion and prayed he would be strong enough to survive several seamen had died and it was a miracle there were not more to be buried starkie said they kept us aboard to crew the poor sandpiper like galley slaves we were beaten and treated like scum they had only enough hands for the guns but enough to keep us cowed i can tell you eden had joined them any midshipmen wwere there starkie looked at him for several seconds two only two mr murray died in the attack mr flowers he was about your age well they killed him later he turned away now leave me be i dont want to think about it tregorren came aft again he sounded almost jovial as he called she answers well mr starkie a fine little vessel fourteen guns too i see eden said mr sstarkie says that the pirates are the worst hes sseen sir tregorren was still studying the brig his head cocked as the sails shuddered and banged before the rudder brought the ship back on course again indeed indeed well the other pirate vessel has weighed he faced starkie and where would she be going dyou reckon starkie shrugged they have another rendezvous to the north of here capn wade was searching for it when we were attacked i see tregorren walked aft to the taffrail be first light in an hour or so we will be able to signal gorgon put a good man aloft as lookout we may be able to catch that one and give him a nice dance at the end of a halter he swung angrily on eden well what arejyow gaping at i hear you were useless during the attack weeping for your mother were you nobody to protect you bolitho said easy sir some of the people are listening and damn you for your impertinence tregorrens mood had changed like a savage squall til have no more of it bolitho stood his ground mr eden was knocked down during the boarding sir he could feel his caution dropping away his future already in ruins but he was sick of tregorrens sarcasm and brutality towards those unable to fight back we were you recall outnumbered sir we had been expecting some support tregorren stared at him as if suffering a seizure are you suggesting he tugged at his neckcloth are you daring to suggest that i was late in boarding he leaned forward his face inches from bolithos well are you i was saying that mr eden did well sir he had lost his weapon and he is twelve years old sir they faced each other oblivious to everything about them then tregorren nodded very slowly so be it mr bolitho you will join the masthead lookout until i say differently when we return to the ship i intend to have you put under arrest for gross insubordination he nodded again see how the family likes that eh bolitho felt his heart pumping against his ribs like a hammer he had to repeat over and over in his mind he wants me to strike him he wants me to strike him it would make tregorrens actions complete and for bolitho final is that all sir he barely recognized his own voice aye the lieutenant swung away his sudden move making the mesmerized spectators scatter like rabbits tor the present dancer walked to the main shrouds with him and said hotly that was a foul thing to say i felt like knocking him to the deck dick so did i bolitho swung himself on to the ratlines and stared up at the mainyard and he knew it dancer said awkwardly never mind we took the brig that must count for something with captain conway it is all we have he started to climb be off martyn or hell have you all aback too when you have finished mr dancer the voice searched him out from the shadows be so good as to find a cook and have the galley fire lit these people look like scarecrows and i cant abide filth dancer called at once sir he looked up at the black shrouds but bolitho had already vanished mr starkies story richard bolitho clung to a stay and watched the sky brightening reluctantly across the horizon little more than a grey blur but in hours it would be almost too hot to think he felt the mast shiver and vibrate as the sandpiper responded eagerly to her bulging sails he wondered how the wounded were getting on if lieutenant hope was better or giving way to his injury a few figures were just visible on the brigs narrow poop and below the mainmast he thought he could smell food from the galley and felt his stomach contract painfully he could not remember when he had last eaten and found himself hating tregorren for keeping him aloft without relief the lieutenant had been right about one thing when the news reached the bolitho home in falmouth it would have lost the unfairness and hostility of the moment it would be seen only as tregorren intended that bolitho had acted badly and with insubordination against a superior officer he heard heavy breathing and saw dancer hauling himself up to the crosstrees beside him he said youd better watch out martyn dancer shook his head its all right dick mr starkie sent me hes worried about our lieutenant bolitho looked at him mr hope is he worse he is as before dancer clutched at a stay as the brig heeled violently in a sudden gust it is tregorren who is causing the concern he grinned although i must say i cant muster much grief bolitho reached out and stretched his cramped limbs he was aching from exposure and felt clammy with salt spray dancer added mr starkie thinks that he has a fever they slid down to the deck together and found the masters mate by the wheel with the helmsmen starkie said abruptly itll be dawn soon i cant understand it hes like a man possessed down there i dunno what well do if we run into more trouble he looked away his voice brittle i cant take being a prisoner again not after what weve suffered and thats gods truth bolitho replied well go to him he touched dancers arm but im no surgeon in the tiny cabin where sandpipers last captain had enjoyed his privacy and suffered his anxieties they found tregorren slumped across a table his face buried in his arms the cabin stank of spirits or coarse wine and as the brig lifted and plunged across the broken water bolitho heard glass rolling about beneath the cot and in the glare of a solitary lantern saw that there were many such bottles in a rack against the bulkhead dancer murmured grimly mr tregorren has surely found his heaven bolitho leaned over the table til try and rouse him you keep clear he seized the lieutenants shoulders and heaved him backwards over the chair he had been expecting to see a man the worse for drink dancer exclaimed in gods name dick he looks like death tregorren had a terrible pallor and more so because his normally ruddy complexion was patchy grey and when his eyes flickered open very slowly he seemed quite dazed like someone suffering extreme shock he started to speak but his speech was so thick he had to clear his throat with a series of loud retches bolitho asked are you ill sir he saw dancer try to hide a grin and added hastily mr starkie was worried for you was he tregorren tried to stand but fell back in the chair with a terrible groan get that bottle his fingers were like claws as he seized the bottle and took a long desperate swallow i dont know whats happening he was speaking in a vague slurred voice cant control my body he retched and tried to rise again must get to the heads bolitho and dancer hauled him to his feet and for a few moments the three of them swayed and reeled to the motion as if in a weird dance dancer muttered hes done it this time what our old doctor would call the bloody flux the man is coming apart as they lurched through the bulkhead door bolitho saw eden watching from another small cabin where hope had been since being carried below give a hand here torn we have to get him to the heads eden said brightly he looks tterrible to be sure when they reached the deck the air was like wine after the overpowering stench in the cabin starkie hurried from the wheel is it fever then eden piped hhe has the ggout mr starkie i have been ssaying sso all along he hhas been taking medicine to ease the pain but i ssuspect has over indulged they all stared at the diminutive midshipman who had suddenly emerged as their only source of medical knowledge well whatll we do starkie sounded lost eden regarded the sagging groaning figure and replied when he ggets bback to the ship the ssurgeon will ttake care of him theres nnothing we can ddo he grimaced sserve him right be that as it may starkie watched dancer clinging to the lieutenants coat to stop him from falling clean across the bulwark were going to need him shortly dancer stared at him i dont see that we can signal gorgon and the captain will know what to do starkie regarded him bleakly youve not noticed the wind has shifted to the noreast itd take your ship all day to beat up to this position that is even if your capn knows whats happening dancer persisted then what is to stop us from running down on her starkie said im only a mastj rs mate and one right glad to be safe and free age in but i know the navy and i know captains sandpiper is well placed to head off the enemy or at least follow her to her hiding place he shrugged but without an officer im not so sure you get no reward for empty heroics and thats for certain in any navy they looked at eden as he said in a small voice were not going to the gorgon bolitho noticed that he had even lost his stammer in his anxiety he said quietly come over here torn he took the boys arm and asked calmly what did you do to mr tregorren eden stared at the deck his hands moving in agitation i knew he was ttrying to ttreat himself by pputting medicine in his wwine i ssaw it on a flask in his ccabin vin antim like my ffather uses in mmatters of ggout he added wretchedly so i pput a large mmeasure in one of his bbottles he must have ddrunk all of it and a full bbottle of bbrandy as well bolitho stared at him you might have killed him bbut i thought we were rejoining the shship you see i just wwanted him to ssuffer for all the things he ssaid to you and to mme he shook his head fand now you ssay well not be joining gorgon rright away bolitho breathed out slowly so it seems dancer steadied the lieutenant as he staggered away from the bulwark get some men to help this officer to the cabin bolitho said what now i wonder as if in answer he heard the lookout yell deck there sail on the lee bow they ran to the nettings but the sea to leeward was still in deep shadow starkie said bitterly so the devils downwind of us he stands between us and safety how well dyou know this coast bolithos question seemed to come out all on its own good enough starkie peered at the compass as if to gather his thoughts its a bad one to try and outpace a frigate bolitho thought of the gorgon to the south of their position maybe the captain did not even know they had cut out the sandpiper and believed she had fled with the frigate starkie was saying wed been searching for pirates for months and capn wade got some information from a genoese trader that there was one such vessel in these waters at the time the capn thought there was only a small ship and probably not much of a craft at that but this pirate is no fool believe me they say he is halffrench and halfenglish but one thing is certain hes thrown in his lot with some algerine corsairs who have come from the mediterranean to prey on slavers and honest traders alike bolitho looked at dancer and asked softly are there many of them enough they were shorthanded when they took sandpiper but new men are joining their ranks every day it doesnt matter what race or country they come from im told that if they swear allegiance to islam they can be anything they like the frigate was spanish before they took her off oran and she is commanded by this jean gauvin a madman if ever i saw one and without fear the corsair who forced some senegalese traders to open the fortress for him is rais haddam he put our officers to death slowly and in front of our people it was terrible to see and hear it nobody spoke and as bolitho watched starkies tanned features he could see him reliving the horror as if it had just happened we anchored just off the fortress it was a fine day and the people were in high spirits and why not for we were going home in a month more or so the frigate lay near us wearing spanish colours the fortress too was flying a trading company flag he gave a shudder i suppose capn wade should have known or suspected but he was only a lieutenant no moren twentythree we lowered the boats and went ashore to meet the governor of the island instead we were surrounded and the fortress battery put down a few balls around the sandpiper just to let the watch know they had no chance after the killing and the torture was over this algerine corsair rais haddam spoke to the rest of us told us that if we worked the ship for him we might be spared he looked away gauvin was there too and when one of the midshipmen tried to protest it was gauvin who ordered him to be killed they burned him alive on the foreshore dancer whispered my god aye starkie stared past him into the shadows haddam has gathered the scum of the earth to his banner bolitho nodded rais haddam i have heard my father and his friends speak of him he has raided the algerian coast for years and is now looking elsewhere for his corsairs he glanced at the paling sky i never expected to meet up with him starkie said bitterly there is no time left to prepare a defence bolitho looked at their faces sensing despair and defeat dancer was too new to the navy to know anything different starkie was still too stunned by his captivity to offer advice bolitho said quietly then we must prepare an attack he thought of tregorren filled with pain and drink because of eden s ruse of hope barely breathing a musket ball in his shoulder of their seamen some bewildered at their sudden releases and others quite exhausted from the savage fighting on this same deck starkie exclaimed gauvins ship mounts twentyfour guns to our fourteen little squeakers no dancer asked when sandpiper was used to seize the barquentine what happened to her crew over the side starkie looked grimfaced gutted like pigs bolitho said so much for the bad side now what can we do against gauvin he walked to the weather side feeling the spray pattering across his face and hands hell know that gorgon is to the southrd dancer had joined him and will expect us to try and rejoin her bolitho glanced at starkie wondering if his memory could be trusted if we come about mr starkie how close could we weather the headland starkies eyes widened with alarm back to that damned island ymean towards it there is a difference its dangerous you should know that if you rounded the headland under oars there are reefs aplenty many not even marked on the charts bolitho said half to himself off cornwall there are some islands called the scillies a bristol trader was being chased by a french privateer in the last war the traders master had no chance of outpacing the enemy but he knew his islands well he sailed right across one reef and the frenchie followed him ripped out his keel there were none saved starkie stared at him with amazement you want to steer a course through the reef is that what youre asking me to do a weak ray of sunlight lanced across the upper in rigging and made the topgallant yard glitter like a crucifix do we have a choice bolitho watched him gravely captivity and possibly death to make another example or the word hung in the air starkie nodded firmly well probably die anyway but god its a chance id rather take he rubbed his rough hands together i suggest we call the hands and shorten sail to come about if the wind goes against us well end up on a lee shore he chuckled suddenly dropping the years from his lined face by god mr whatever your name is id hate to serve under you when youre a capn my nerves would give out afore long bolitho smiled sadly as more light opened up the deck to display the dull stains where men had fought and died the jagged splinters left by the swivel gun he looked at eden see how mr hope is try and get him to take some brandy he saw the boy flinch not mr tregorrens bottle if you please as eden started for the companion he added and try to find a flag i want this pirate to recognize sandpiper under her rightful colours today dancer watched him in silence then he said to starkie i have never seen such a mood in him he means to fight its no deception the masters mate walked to the lee rail and spat on to the creaming wash well mlad when gauvin sees the flag thatll do it right enough its not a sight hes very fond of eden reappeared carrying a roll of bunting found one dick hidden under the bbrandy bbottles in the cabin how are the lieutenants starkie spoke sharply perhaps still hoping that someone else would appear to take over responsibility eden pouted mmr hope is breathing a little better mr tregorren is in a filthy sstate starkie sighed very well pipe the hands to the braces no point in delaying things any more bolitho gripped the poop rail and watched the seamen hurrying to braces and halliards their movements jerky as if they were still shocked and uncertain it was like a dream of pirates and brave young men fighting their countrys enemies but it was fast becoming a nightmare only the first part was right he thought a little brig a demoralized company and some boys to lead them he thought of his father and of captain conway gravefaced and confident behind their guns and their seamanship he said run up the colpurs mr eden even the formality surprised him then stand by to come about across the reef sousoueast sir full an bye bolitho gripped the hammock nettings and watched the sandpiper dip her lee bulwark steeply towards the sea spray and drifting foam dashed across the deck and when he glanced up at the main yard he saw it was bending like a huge bow as the seamen worked to set more sail starkie remarked hoarsely the winds freshening a bit he shaded his eyes to peer at the masthead pendant but its holding steady from the noreast he added grimly so far bolitho hardly heard him he was watching the brigs efforts as she lifted and smashed down on to each successive line of whitecaps from the moment they had brought the ship about and turned her gilded figurehead towards the land again he had sensed the change around him even the sandpipers original hands many showing festering cuts and cruel injuries from their captivity were shouting to each other doing all they could to set every stitch of canvas short of tearing the masts t out of her only when they looked aft did they falter perhaps bolitho thought they still expected to see their young captain at the rail as if by hoping they could hold their memories at bay dancer shouted above the din of canvas and windshes flying dick he nodded seeing the bows dip into a steepsided roller and hurl the spray high over the beakhead in a solid white sheet aye he looked across the quarter can you see the frigate he gripped dancers arm there she is and shes making more sail as the gloom of the night retreated slowly towards the open sea he saw the topsails and topgallants of the other ship changing shape as she too changed tack and came endon in pursuit he pointed to the flag above his head making a bright patch against the washedout sky mr starkie was right it seems our enemy is roused starkie walked up to the weather side his body leaning against the decks steep angle im holding her as close to the wind as i dare bring her up another point and shell not answer bolitho took a glass from a rack by the compass box and trained it towards the land as he steadied it through the maze of shrouds and vibrating halliards he saw the faces of some of the seamen loom towards him and wondered what they were thinking as the brig headed for the shore to the place where their pain and humiliation had begun then he saw the headland jutting out in a welter of breakers like the prow of a roman galley how different it had looked from the cutter all that while ago he had to shake himself to realize it was only yesterday the sea looked rougher and driven by the gusty wind was surging amongst a necklace of rocks as if to beckon them all to destruction there was a dull bang and when he swung aft towards the frigate he saw a smear of smoke moving rapidly with the wind starkie said just a sighting shot shes too lively to hit us at this range bolitho did not reply he was watching the frigates great foresail writhing and puffing in disorder as her captain brought her up into the wind she was almost in irons when the foresail filled and hardened again the lee gunports heeling down until they were awash dancer said shes worked across our stern dick yes she intends to take the wind gage from us he still kept his eyes on the frigate until they watered painfully but it means she will stand the closer inshore when we pass the headland dancer stared at him can we really get through starkie heard him and called youll be asking if we can walk on water next he seized the wheel and added his own strength to the helmsmens watch your head damn you another bang this time bolitho saw the white feathers of spray kicking across each line of waves as the ball skipped past their stern he looked at the sandpipers sixpounders very t suitable for hitandrun attacks on enemy merchant men or for running down pirates and smugglers for taking on a frigate they were useless send another good lookout aloft martyn he staggered as the deck shook violently in a sudden trough the gorgon may be in sight but there was no sign of the big seventyfour just the pursuing frigate and the first view of the island on the far side of the bay as before it looked pale and strangely tranquil in the early sunlight and it was hard to accept all that had happened there starkie had said earlier that the island was even now packed with wretched slaves men and young girls who had been gathered by the traders from all parts of africa and before long many of them would be sailing west to the americas and the indies if they were lucky they might end their days in comfortable captivity rather like dependent servants those less fortunate would eke out their lives like animals when their usefulness was over their strength used up they would be discarded bolitho had heard it said that slave ships like the oared galleys of spain could be traced at sea by their terrible smell the stench of bodies crammed together unable to move incapable of making even the simplest comfort for themselves bang a ball hissed overhead and slapped through the foretopsail like an iron fist closer starkie had his thumbs in his belt his eyes fixed on the frigate hes overhauling us more quickly now deck there breakers on the lee bow starkie ran to the rail and snatched a glass aye thats em the first line of reefs he glared aft at the helmsmen let her fall off a point the wheel creaked and brought a protest of flapping canvas from the topgallants sou by east sir steady as you go bolitho could tell from the worsening motion the way every spar and sail seemed to be quivering in protest that they were entering shallower water and crossing a fierce undertow starkie said better shorten sail bolitho looked at him his voice almost pleading if we do hell take us before hes in any danger the masters mate eyed him impassively as you say eden scrambled through the canting companion his eyes frightened as he peered astern for the enemy mr hope is ccalling for yyou dick he ducked as the frigates bowchaser hurled a shot close abeam throwing a waterspout high into the air like a surfacing whale bolitho nodded til go to him call me if anything happens starkie was peering through his telescope at the nearest line of breakers by allowing his ship to fall downwind just a trifle he had brought the bowsprit and tapering jib boom almost in line with the telltale surf he said over his shoulder dont worry youll know bolitho groped his way from the companion ladder and entered the small hutchlike cabin hope was sprawling in a cot his eyes very bright as bolitho bent over him ive heard that the fourth lieutenant is unwell his face was ashen damn him why did he hold off his attack he was rambling vaguely my shoulder oh god theyll lop off my arm when we get to the ship the pain and the despair seemed to steady him are you managing bolitho forced a smile we have a good masters mate on deck sir mr dancer and i are trying to look like veterans another dull bang penetrated the humid cabin and bolitho felt the hull tremble as a ball slammed down hard alongside too close hope gasped you cannot fight a frigate would you have me strike sir he shut his eyes and groaned with pain i dont know i only understand that i should be helping you doing something instead bolitho watched his desperation with new understanding hope the fifth lieutenant had been closer to him than the other officers he always pretended not to show his concern for the midshipmen under his charge displayed an outer skin of hardness which had been taken as brutal on some occasions but his constant presence amongst them had proved that some of his unsympathetic criticism had been both necessary and beneficial as he had remarked more than once this ship needs officers not children and now he was lying there broken and helpless bolitho said quietly i will come for advice whenever i can sir one hand moved out of the bloodstained cot and gripped his thank you hope was barely able to focus his eyes god be with you below there it was dancers voice the frigates running out her starboard guns im coming bolitho ran for the ladder thinking of hope of all of them in the short time he had been below the sunlight had broken from the land and changed the sea into an endless array of leaping wavecrests starkie shouted winds backed a piece nothing much but the frigates going to make a run for us i reckon bojitho took a glass from a seaman and trained it over the nettings the frigate was barely a mile off the larboard quarter sails braced hard roundto hold the wind her starboard guns showing above the churning wash along her side like black teeth he saw her outline alter slightly as she came up a point or so to windward the sunlight lancing on weapons and telescopes and on the large black flag at her mainmast truck he could even distinguish her name painted on weatherworn scrollwork beneath her beakhead pegaso probably the original name she had carried under the spanish flag shes fired a stabbing line of orange tongues belched from her gunports the untimed broadside whipping past sandpipers stern and a few moaning above the poop bolitho said alter course mr starkie two points to windward if you can starkie opened his mouth to protest and changed his mind he watched some barely concealed rocks dashing past the starboard side well clear but it meant they were committed amongst the sprawling reefs like a fly in a web man the braces there let go and haul dancer hurried to lend a hand heave lads above the plunging hull every shroud and sail seemed to be booming and creaking in disorder as the bows crept round and then steadied on the next spit of land another ragged broadside the balls skipping harmlessly astern and bringing a feeble cheer from a watching seaman who did not realize the peril he was in bolitho shouted get the best gun captain martyn lively soueast by south sir the helmsman sounded dazed very well starkie turned momentarily to watch as a grizzled old seaman in patched trousers and a check shirt ran aft and knuckled his forehead taylor zur well taylor i want you to pick your two most reliable crews and man the aftermost sixpounders starboard side taylor blinked at the midshipman probably thinking bolitho was at last going mad the enemy after all was on the opposite side bolitho was speaking quickly his mind blank to everything but the frigate and sandpipers bearing from her he tried to remember everything he had learned or had had beaten into him from the age of twelve until this day doubleshotted i know its a risk but i want you to hit the frigates bows when i give the word taylor nodded slowly aye zur he gestured with a tarred thumb ci fathom yer meanin zur he ambled away bawling out names and examining two sixpounders by the poop as he did so bolitho looked at starkie his eyes level i want to wear ship and pass out through the rtef again the frigates bound to follow he will have all the advantage with the wind under his coattails he saw starkie nodding grimly for just a few moments we will have him under our guns he smiled the effort freezing his lips such as they are hell not be expecting us to turn and fight not now starkie stared beyond the bows like a man seeking a way out i think i know a passage its not much he made a sweeping movement with his fist im not sure about the depth a few fathoms no more if im any judge thuds and bangs told bolitho that taylor and his men were almost ready a sudden roar of cannon fire made him realize that the frigate was still determined to cripple sandpiper and then bring her to close action aloud he murmured not this time my friend starkie lowered his telescope as the frigates iron shrieked overhead and brought down several lengths of broken rigging and a few blocks the hull gave a violent jerk and bolitho knew they had taken their first direct hit he looked at starkie as the latter called ready when you are he wiped his forehead with his wrist he was streaming with sweat man the braces stand by to wear ship bolitho nodded to the two gun crews run out he gripped his hands behind him until the force of his hold steadied him he knew dancer was staring as were several of the men at the braces and halliards perhaps they were trying to see their own fate in his face he heard the old gun captain say dont yew forget lads as we goes about well be to leerd of that bugger but itll give your guns a better chance as we eels over like there was a brief lull in the wind so that just for an instant the sounds of sea and canvas faded through his racing thoughts bolitho heard another sound that of tregorren groaning like a bull in agony the madness of it the very hopelessness of their position made the lieutenants discomfort all the more unreal he shook himself back to the present tut up your helm wear ship leaning drunkenly with the wind her beakhead lifting and smashing down in a welter of crisscrossing waves sandpiper began to respond to canvas and rudder the noise was indescribable so that when the pegaso fired a solitary shot from a bowchaser the sound was almost lost in the thundering boom of sails the protest of blocks and bartaut rigging bolitho saw that the men at the weather braces were hauling with such effort that their bodies were angled back almost to the deck itself others ran to aid their companions at halliards and aloft on the yards as they creaked round still further the sails hardening and swelling like armour to the winds thrust bolitho tried not to look for the reefs or at starkie who had climbed into the shrouds to gauge better their progress towards the breaking surf weakened by the pegasos haphazard shots through the upper rigging more pieces of severed hemp fell unheeded to the deck and across the rigid shoulders of taylor the old gun captain round and still further round the masts and yards creaking violently as the brig wheeled on to the opposite tack the sea sluicing up and over the lee bulwark which minutes earlier had been towards the enemy bang a ball sliced across the heaving water and slammed savagely into the hull making several men cry out with alarm get some hands on the pumps bolitho heard himself yelling orders but felt like an onlooker detached from all that was happening icecold he watched the enemy swinging around and across the stern or so it appeared from sandpipers violent alteration of course jvbw his voice was lost in the din and he shouted with sudden urgency as you bear fire he had seen the pegasos big foresail starting to angle round as her captain decided to change tack and follow the brig he knew taylor was crouching behind one of the guns but could not look at him he heard the hiss of his slowmatch and started with shock as the gun banged out across the water he saw the pegasos foresail pucker and a large hole appear as if by magic explored and strained by the wind and by the sudden alteration of course the hole spread out in every direction ripping the sail to fragments starkie yelled hes still coming round sir a lookouts voice cut across bolithos thoughts like a saw breakers to larboard sir but all he could think of was failure the doubleshotted gun had destroyed a sail but under full canvas it could make no difference now once through the reef and it was strange that he had no doubts now starkie could do it the pirate would overhaul and board them taylor loped to the second gun his face creased in concentration fierce gestures with his tarred thumb got a handspike moving here a tug on a gun tackle there he crouched down his eyes like slits as he wheezed easy now come on my little one the match went home and with a grating crash the gun hurled itself inboard smoke eddying back through the port like choking fog bolitho watched mesmerized it took an age in fact only seconds and then as the carefully aimed shot lifted and dropped across the frigates bows he saw the bulging jib and staysail tear from top to bottom like old rags the effect was instantaneous caught in the middle of changing tack her sails already in confusion the pegaso wallowed heavily in a deep trough her gunports buried in the sea as she continued to answer the rudder bolitho heard shouts from the lee side and ran to the nettings his throat like dust as he saw a greenshouldered rock scudding past the sandpipers side barely yards clear in those split seconds he saw the worn shape of the rock and some tiny black fish which had managed to remain motionless despite the wind and current sheltering behind the reef which could tear out a ships keel like the string from an orange he darted a glance at dancer he looked very pale and wildeyed his face and chest soaked with spray as he leaned out to watch the enemys progress the pegaso seemed to stagger as if taken by an opposite squall then as she tilted upright her main topgallant mast cracked over and fell straight down to the deck a tangle of rigging and canvas trailing between the shrouds like weed starkie yelled incredulously see that she hit a reef he was croaking with excitement and awe she struck by god bolitho could not tear his eyes away the frigate must have smashed hard against a rock shoulder even as she lost power from her forward sails in the middle of a tack just a few yards had made all the difference and he could picture the confusion on deck the rush of men below to seek out the extent of the damage it had been enough to bring down a topgallant mast and she must be leaking badly he thought and yet the frigate was still coming on and as he watched his eyes aching in the glare he saw a bowchaser shoot out an orange tongue and felt the ball shriek past him and crash into the forecastle like a giants axe broken rigging and whirling splinters were hurled everywhere and he saw three seamen smashed against the bulwark their cries lost in the wind but their convulsions marked by spreading patterns of blood another ball ripped against the hull and ricocheted away over the sea the deck bucking as if tiying to throw the seamen from their feet bolitho yelled attend the wounded tell mr eden to put them below he thought suddenly of eden s father in his little surgery attending to people with gout and stomach trouble what would he think if he could see his twelveyearold son trying to drag a gasping seaman to the companion hatch every foot of the way marked in pain and blood dancer said despairingly the frigates closing to board us he did not even flinch as a ball whipped above the poop leaving another hole in the pockmarked sails after all we did bolitho looked at him and those nearby the fight the pathetic determination were going rapidly and who could blame them the pegaso had matched their every move in spite of being surprised she was through the reef and he could see the glitter of waving cutlasses as some of the men ran from the guns in readiness to board he recalled starkies description of what had happened to sandpipers officers the torture and the final agony of their deaths he drew his hanger and yelled stand to starboard side he saw them turn to stare at him incredulously their eyes dull with despair bolitho jumped to the weather shrouds and waved his hanger at the pegaso theyll not take us without a fight little cameos stood out from the main picture a man taking out a knife and honing it back and forth across his hand his eyes on the frigate another crossing the deck to face a man who was probably his best his only friend nothing said just an expression which told far more than words eden by the cornpanion hatch his face like chalk and a mans blood already drying on his shirt like his own would soon do dancer his hair golden in the sunlight his chin lifted as he picked up a cutlass and leaned on it bolitho saw his other hand gripping into his breeches like a claw pinching the flesh to shock him from his fear a man wounded in the attack on the brig was propped against a sixpounder his legs in bandages but his fingers busy as he loaded pistols and passed them to the others something like a baying howl came from the pegasos crowded deck as she edged closer abeam the shadows of her masts and yards reaching across the water as if to snare the brig and engulf her bolitho blinked and dashed the sweat from his eyes as he stared at one of the frigates open gunports a man then another was clambering out and around the black muzzles and from other ports he saw figures emerging like rats from a sewer starkie exclaimed theyre trying to abandon sir he seized his arm and propelled him to the nettings will you look at that bolitho stood at his side and said nothing more and more men were leaping from the gunports and being carried away like shavings on a millrace gauvin the pegasos fanatical captain must have put guards on every hatch and as his ship charged in hopeless maddened pursuit he would have known that the hull damage was fatal starkie watched the frigates bow wave falling away as the great weight of inrushing water slowed her down the sudden pandemonium on the upper deck as everyone at last realized what was happening he said harshly here put on your coat he even helped bolitho into it and tugged the collar with its white patches into position he pointed to the pegaso which was starting to head away the inrush of water playing havoc with the rudders puny efforts i want him to see you and i pray to god hell suffer for what he did when bolitho looked at him he added i want him to know he was beaten by a midshipman a boyl bolitho turned away his ears filled with the sounds of a ship destroying itself as under full sail she continued to slew round across the glittering crests he heard guns coming loose from tackles and smashing into the opposite side and spars falling trapping the stampeding men under masses of black rigging and canvas he heard himself say shorten sail martyn call all hands he felt men touching his shoulders others ran towards him grinning and waving not a few were weeping deck there everyone had forgotten thelonely man at the masthead sail on th starboard bow sir the merest pause and then tis th gorgon bolitho waved his hand to the masthead and turned to watch the pirate frigate heeling over the sea around her filled with flotsam and thrashing bobbing heads out of the suns path across the heaving swell he also saw a sudden flicker of movement the knifeedged fins of sharks closing in around the sinking ship it was over a mile to the nearest beach it was t doubtful if anyone would reach it he raised a telescope to look for the gorgon his eyes misty as he saw her fat black and buff hull her towering pyramid of canvas rounding the next headland in another second he thought he would break be unable to hide his emotion from those about him a great voice bellowed what the hell is going on lieutenant tregorren was standing half through the companion hatch and with his blotchy grey face his hair matted with wine and worse he looked for all the world like a corpse emerging from a tomb bolitho felt the relief flooding through him like madness he wanted to laugh and cry all at once and tregorrens wild appearance the realization that he had been completely helpless throughout the fight broke down all reserves he replied in a shaking voice i am sorry we disturbed you sir tregorren faced him and tried to focus a pair of angry red eyes disturb aye sir but we have been fighting a battle starkie said calmly fetch mr eden i fear the lieutenant is going to be ill again without honour captain beves conway stood by an open stern window and held one hand to his eyes to protect them from the fierce reflected glare through the windows of his cabin the recaptured brig rolled untidily in the swell her tan sails barely moving as she idled above her own reflection within a few hours of sandpipers hazardous dash through the reef and the complete destruction of the frigate the wind had dropped to a mere breath leaving the heavy gorgon and her small consort almost becalmed like a pale yellow smear along the horizon twisting and wavering in heathaze the shore was still visible but could have been anywhere conway turned slowly and studied the group by the bulkhead tregorren massive and redeyed his body swaying to the heavy motion his face still the colour of ashes the three midshipmen and the masters mate t mr starkie standing slighly apart verling the first lieutenant was also present his nose disapproving as the captains servant filled glasses of madeira for the crumpled and dishevelled visitors the captain took a beautifully cut glass from a tray and held it to the filtered sunlight your health gentlemen he regarded each of them in turn i do not have to say how gratified i am that sandpiper is again with the fleet he turned to listen to the distant tap of hammers across the water as work continued to put right the damage from pegasos cannon fire eventually i will be sending her to report to the admiral at gibraltar with my despatches his gaze rested momentarily on tregorren to cut out a vessel at anchor is never easy to do it and to find the extra agility and skill to run an enemy frigate to ground is worthy of their lordships attention tregorren stared at some point above the captains shoulder thank you sir the captains eyes moved to the midshipmen to have survived all this will give you scope for putting the experience to work both for your own advancement and for the navy in general bolitho darted a quick glance at tregorren the man was still staring at the deckhead and he looked close to another violent attack of vomiting the captain said in the same matteroffact tone at first light while you were entering the reefs i was searching to the southrd quite by chance we came on a heavy dhow loaded to the gunwales with black ivory starkie exclaimed slaves sir the captain regarded him coldly slaves he gestured with his glass i put a boarding party into the vessel and she is now anchored around the next headland he gave a thin smile the slaves i put ashore although i know not if i have done them a favour the smile vanished we have wasted too much time and lost too many good men it would take an army to lay siege to the island and even then it is doubtful how the attack would go he paused as the marine sentry beyond the door shouted surgeon sir the servant hurried to open the door as laidlaw entered wiping his hands carefully on a scrap of cloth yes the captain sounded sharp you wished to know sir mr hope is sleeping i took out the ball and although i doubt if hell ever be rid of discomfort hell not lose an arm bolitho looked at dancer and eden and smiled it was something the rest was over part of a nightmare which even tregorrens failure to admit that he had had no hand in the final action could not spoil he glanced at starkie who was studying tregorren with something like hatred the captain added at dusk provided the wind returns which mr turnbull assures me will we will make contact with our new prize at dawn i intend to send sandpiper to chase the dhow towards the fortress gorgon will of course supply full support bolitho swallowed another glass of madeira barely realizing that the cabin servant had refilled it more than once his stomach was quite empty and the wine was making him feel lightheaded and dizzy one fact stood out the captain had no intention of giving in to the pirates who occupied the island by retaking sandpiper they had added another arm to their reach and the watchers on the fortresss battery would have been able to see quite clearly how the brig had lured their one major vessel on to the reefs verling snapped understood bolitho exclaimed theyll think were chasing a cargo of slaves and be too busy firing at sandpiper to watch the dhow sir the captain looked at him and then glanced across at tregorren what djoa think mr tregorren the lieutenant seemed to come out of a trance yes sir that is the captain nodded quite he walked aft again and studied the brig for some time mr starkie will return to his ship and be prepared to assist whichever officers i appoint to take charge and to sail eventually with my despatches he swung round his eyes hard in the light had i thought that you had any part in losing sandpiper in the first place by negligence or lack of courage i can assure you that you would not be here now and your chances of advancement would have been smashed he smiled the effort making him older rather than the opposite you did very well mr starkie i only wish i could keep you in my cornmand but i think that when you reach higher authority your efforts will be better rewarded he nodded carry on gentlemen they left the cabin in a daze the captain already in conference with verling and the surgeon bolitho shook starkies rough hand and exclaimed tm glad for you but for your skill and accepting an idea which to most people would have seemed quite mad we would not be here at all starkie studied him gravely as if searching for something he could not understand but for you id still be in irons and awaiting death he turned as tregorren strode to the companion ladder on his way down to the wardroom i wanted to speak out starkies eyes were bitter but as you said nothing i thought it best to hold my peace he is without honour eden stammered its nnot rright ddick hhell get the ccredit he was almost weeping he jjust stood ththere and ttook it all dancer smiled i think the captain knows more than hes prepared to admit i watched him he is balancing the value of the victory against damaging it with envy and shame he grinned at eden and midshipmen who go round trying to poison their betters bolitho nodded i agree now let us go and eat anything even a ships rat will do for me they turned towards the companion ladder and froze a figure in an illfitting uniform that of a lieutenant blocked their way he said nothing to do eh midshipmen are not what they were in my day they crowded round him and bolitho said john grenfell we thought you dead grenfell gripped his hand his face very grim when city of athens was destroyed some of us managed to find safety on drifting spars we hauled them together like a little raft not knowing what was happening he dropped his gaze most of our people were killed the lucky ones in the cannon fire the rest when the sharks tore amongst us the third lieutenant oh so many old faces were slashed to fragments before our eyes he shrugged as if to free himself of the memory but we drifted ashore and as we made our way along the coast there as large as life was the ship standing in to the beach and dewars bullocks with a dhow full of screaming slaves an arab crew and two portuguese merchants who were so terrified that i think they believed their end had come he plucked at his borrowed coat so i have been made acting sixth lieutenant it will do no harm when my examination is called he looked into the distance but i got the chance at a price i would dearly repay if it were possible bolitho said quietly butjyom are safe starkie yawned i could sleep for a year he grinned at grenfell sir grenfell walked with them to the ladder i suggest you all get some rest i have a feeling it will be all the hotter tomorrow in more ways than one mr turnbulls knowledge of weather did not desert him by the time the first dog watch had run its course both vessels were under way again their sails filling to the breeze an hour later the wind had steadied to a fresh northerly and when the hands were assembled aft the air was like a tonic after the sweaty furnace between decks the lieutenants and marine officers were by the poop ladder watching the captain who was conferring with verling and the sailing master petty officers moved amongst the assembled seamen checking their muster lists and calling out names while from the lower gundeck bolitho could hear the screech of a grindstone as the gunners mates attended to the sharpening of cutlasses and boarding axes the very sound made him shiver as it always had a lookout bawled deck there vessel at anchor off the larboard bow dancer had been peering across at sandpipers sails they were creamy in the fading light and there was nothing visible of the shot holes and patches dallas the second lieutenant had taken charge of her for the attack a man bolitho knew nothing of and had barely heard utter more than a few necessary orders since he had joined the ship but the captains choice showed that he trusted dallas for the task it also suggested he was not entirely satisfied with tregorrens part in the cuttingout when bolitho had seen starkie over the side to be taken back to the brig the masters mate had stared aft towards the captains slowly pacing figure he had grinned its how you gets to be a postcaptain young feller knowing them things all midshipmen lay aft to the quarterdeck they hurried along the gangway and found verling waiting by the lee nettings one foot tapping with impatience three of you will be required for the attack he scowled as marrack made to speak not you you will be needed for the signal party his cold eyes rested on bolitho as you have just returned to your proper duties with us i cannot order you to take part either mr pearce he turned to the sulky looking midshipman from the lower gundeck and bolitho glanced at dancer who gave the briefest nod he called mr dancer and i would like to volunteer sir we sailed very close to the island it might be of some use verling smiled wryly now that mr grenfell has placed his foot on the bottom rung of promotion you three apart from mr marrack are the oldest so i suppose id better allow you to go eden stepped smartly from the rank of midshipmen ssir id like to vvolunteer too veiling glared down at him dont you stutter at me you urchin get back in line and hold your noise eden retreated beaten before he had started verling nodded apparently satisfied boats will be lowered as soon as we heaveto all the marines and sixty seamen will transfer to that floating hell yonder dancer whispered the captain is sending everyone he can spare verling rasped after the raid should you be spared mr dancer you will be awarded five days extra duty be silent the captain walked aft towards the poop as if on a stroll ashore he paused and asked evenly all well mr verling aye sir the captain glanced at the three midshipmen who stood where they had been called be vigilant he looked at his first lieutenant mr verling will command the attack so he will expect your best support as will i he leaned forward seeking out eden s small shape you er mr er will probably be useful assisting the surgeon in your new and er surprising capacity neither he nor verling gave even the hint of a smile it was almost dark by the time the transfer of men and weapons had been completed even before they reached the large dhow bolitho could smell the stench of slavery once on board it was almost overpowering as the seamen and t marines clambered below stooping beneath the crude deck beams and slithering on filth and t broken manacles major dewars corporals were spaced at intervals along the hull to lead or push the new arrivals into the proper places where they would remain until the actual moment of attack it was as well eden had been j left behind bolitho thought this stench and the cramped journey would have made him as sick as a dog several swivel guns were swayed up from the longboats and mounted on the bulwarks and aft by the high poop there was a smell of rum in the air too and bolitho guessed that the captain had thought it prudent to give the attackers something to sustain them bolitho and the other two midshipmen made their way aft to the poop to report that all the extra seamen and marines were crammed below like pork in a barrel in the halfdarkness the marines crossbelts stood out very white their coats merging with the background hoggett the gorgons leatherlunged boatswain was in charge of the dhows sails and steering and bolitho heard one seaman mutter unkindly ed be right at ome on a blessed slaver e would verling snapped break out the anchor and get this vessel under way mr hoggett perhaps the wind will take the stench out of her he turned as another shadowy figure climbed to the poop all ready mr tregorren dancer said so hes coming too damn him anchors aweigh sir bolitho watched the two seamen using the great sweep oar which stood in place of wheel or tiller the strange lateen sails creaked up the masts the sailors slipping and cursing with unfamiliar and to them crude rigging verling had brought a small boats compass and handed it to the boatswain we will take our time stand well offshore id rather not finish the attack like that frigate ended her life eh mr tregorren it must have been quite a moment tregorren sounded as if his breathing was hurting him he replied thickly it was sir verling dropped the matter mr pearce show the lantern to gorgon bolitho saw the light blink briefly as pearce lifted the shutter captain conway would know they had started in the small glow from the compass bolitho saw verlings beaky profile and was suddenly glad he was in command he wondered what tregorren would say to him when next they spoke if he would continue his deception or admit that he was not responsible for pegasos destruction verlings voice bit into his thoughts if you have nothing to do i suggest you sleep until you are called otherwise i will discover a task t of some enormity for you even in this vessel hidden by the deepening darkness bolitho grinned t broadly aye aye sir thank you sir he settled down against an ancient bronze cannon and rested his chin on his knees dancer joined him and together they stared up at the tiny pale stars against which the dhows great sails showed like wings here we go again martyn dancer sighed but we kept together thats the main thing a name to remember winds backed again sir the boatswains hoarse voice made bolitho nudge dancer with his elbow and rouse him he saw verling and tregorren consulting the compass and when he looked up at the ragged mainmast pendant he saw it was lifting and whipping to a new thrust of wind the sky was paler and as he struggled to his feet he felt every muscle throbbing with cramp verling commented flatly we will beat clear of the headland nevertheless his arm shot out black against the sky there i can see surf below the point the arm darted round you midshipmen get below and rouse the people my compliments to major dewar and tell him we will pass very close inshore i want no marine or seaman on deck who has not been so ordered a block squeaked and bolitho saw a large flag jerking up to the foremost lateen sail in daylight it would be seen as a black one similar to that worn by the pegaso he shivered despite his excitement l come on martyn wed better hurry s he retched and covered his mouth with his sleeve t as he plunged down into the fatbellied hold in the r glitter of a solitary lantern the crowded seamen and marines could have been another slave cargo the realization came like an icecold shock if this attack failed the survivors would end as no better i than the poor wretches released by captain conway although the corsair rais haddam recruited many white mercenaries to man his ships and expand his grip across the trade routes he had little love or respect for them if half of what was said of him was true it was more than likely he would keep captured british seamen to replace those very same slaves dewar listened to his message and grunted bout time im aching like a sick cow dancer coughed and gasped i am glad we were on deck sir the marines exchanged glances and dewar said spoiled young devils it is the discomfort i object to the smell is no worse than any field of battle he grinned at dancers nausea especially after a few days when the crows have been at work eh he stood up ducking under the beams marines standto sarnt halse inspect the weapons bolitho returned to the poop and found to his surprise that it was already bright enough to see the land drifting abeam the dancing spray amongst some angrylooking rocks dancer murmured a lee shore if the first lieutenant had taken an hour longer wed have been hard put to beat clear sir i can see someone on the point verling raised a telescope yes hes gone from view now probably a lookout of some kind he wont get across to the island but the cosair may have a sort of signalling arrangement he was thinking aloud the wind made the great sails bang noisily and the poorlymade rigging looked as if it might tear apart at any second but it must be stronger than it appeared bolitho decided he watched hoggett supervising the helmsmen the easy way the dhow turned to starboard to let the nearest rocks slip past the quarter with a bare twenty feet to spare the dhow handled well he smiled tightly so it should arab sailors were using them long before ships like gorgon were even dreamed of pearce said theres the fortress he grimaced god it looks a mite larger from this side it was still shrouded in gloom with only the upper tower and battery catching the first feeble light there was a sharp bang and for an instant bolitho imagined the fortress had seen through captain conways ruse and could not restrain the gunners from firing he ducked as a ball whipped high overhead and threw a fanlike waterspout amongst the rocks sandpiper sir a seaman almost prodded verling in his excitement to point across the larboard beam she fired verling lowered his glass and studied him coldly thank you i did not imagine it was an act of t god s another shot banged out and this time the ball smashed down across the bows in direct line with r their approach verling gave a thin smile let her fall off mr hoggett i know mr dallas has an excellent gun captain with him in sandpiper but well not take too many chances the dhow tilted steeply as the helmsmen brought t her further round towards the island i fire the er sternchaser l verling stood aside as some seamen who had been working on one of the old bronze cannons plunged a slowmatch into the pitted touchhole and jumped clear the ancient bronze barrel was almost worn out but the resonant bang was far louder than anyone had expected verling said that should do it if we fire it again i fear it will explode in our midst bolitho saw the brig for the first time closehauled on a converging tack she was heeling well over to the wind her sails merged into one pale pyramid in the dawn light he saw the flash of another gun and winced as the ball pounded close to the waterline dousing seamen and crouching marines in falling spray verling remarked angrily mr dallas is too good an actor a few more like that and i will have to take him to task he smiled at the boatswain later of course hes worried dancer peered through the bulwark ive never heard him make jokes before listen verling held up his hand a trumpet weve roused them at last he became serious divide up the people mr tregorren you know what to do there is some kind of jetty on the eastern side right beneath the fortress i am told it is where the traders bring the slaves and from whence they ferry them to seagoing vessels he placed his hat on the deck and glanced quickly at the others around him remove any items of uniform which might be recognized and keep out of sight as much as possible pass the word to the marines to stand fast and wait for the order jvo matter what the brig was closing fast several of her snappy sixpounders loosingoff shot some of which fell dangerously near to the dhow a great boom shattered the air and seconds later bolitho saw a waterspout shoot skywards just beyond sandpipers bowsprit her sails were in disarray as lieutenant dallas brought her even closer running up his ensign to the gaff as if to further infuriate the enemy several more flashes lit the battery wall and the splashes although as big as the first were haphazard and nowhere near the brig bolitho supposed that the gun crews were still halfasleep or could not believe that a vessel so frail one which had already been seized below these same cannon would dare press any nearer he bit his lip as another heavy ball passed between t the brigs two masts it was a miracle that neither s was hit but he saw several lengths of cut rigging t drifting in the wind like jungle creeper r one direct hit in a vital spot was all the battery needed to render the sandpiper helpless at least long i enough for her to drive ashore and be taken verlings voice was right in his ear dont keep staring at sandpiper keep your eyes and mind ahead we could be quite wrong about the entrance mr starkies memory may have played i tricks on him bolitho darted a quick glance at verling without his hat to balance it the nose looked even beakier and larger he saw something else on his face determination anxiety both were there but also a kind of recklessness bolitho looked away he had seen a similar expression on the face of a highwayman as he had been driven to the gibbet sunlight felt its way gingerly over the land and played across the fortress walls there were several heads peering from the weathered embrasures and then bolitho saw what appeared to be a flagstaff poking out of the ground at the foot of the furthest wall verling had already seen it the entrance he turned to hoggett that must be a mast just inside another dhow most likely he wiped his narrow face with the back of his arm steer for it tregorren hurried aft hard put to hide his great bulk beneath the litter of spare sails and fishing gear which covered the slavers filthy deck from side to side all ready sir he saw bolitho and met his gaze without blinking defiance it was difficult to see any emotion in the man even his colour was returning and bolitho wondered what would happen if he found time to take more drink before the attack sandpipers going about sir shes going to try another attack bolitho held his breath as two balls fell on either side of the brigs sleek hull as with sails flapping and banging she turned across the winds eye for another attempt to head off the dhow he saw the first sunlight shining on weapons above the battery wall and imagined the defenders jeering at the brigs retreat small she might be and recaptured from them was a hard fact to swallow but she was still a symbol of power of the worlds greatest navy and now against their massive cannon she was as helpless as a sick horse there are men on the jetty sir pearce was in the bows kneeling beside one of the swivels theyre watching us bolitho saw hoggetts weatherbeaten face harden the next minutes were vital if the pirates suspected what was happening the guns would soon be firing down on them at this range there was no escape and in a few more moments the island would lie between them and safety he felt his stomach rumbling noisily and glanced quickly at dancer his friend was breathing very quickly and jumped as bolitho gripped his shoulder and pulled him down to the deck s bolitho tried to smile if they see your fair hair theyll know we are not likely to be friendly l he turned as verling snapped well said i should have thought of that myself he turned away already thinking far ahead of the slowmoving dhow the guns were firing again but the sound was muffled for the brig was hidden now by the fortress nearer and nearer bolitho tried to lick his lips as the top of the main fortress showed itself above the bulwark where he lay did the enemy recognize the l dhow had she been here before he glanced up at verling who was standing with his arms folded beside the helmsmen one of the latter was a negro of whom there were several in gorgons company it would make the little group seem genuine he thought and verling certainly looked every inch a slaver take in the mainsl sunlight flooded into the deck as the mass of patched canvas and leather lashings came tumbling into the hull there were a dozen or more figures at the end of the jetty motionless with only their long white robes lifting to the wind as the dhow edged round the crumbling stonework beyond the jetty there was a high cavelike entrance directly below the main wall several small vessels were moored there and the largest one a dhow very like their prize was tied up at the outer end unable to dip her masts beneath the curved archway thirty feet twenty then a man yelled something and a figure ran to the steps to peer down at the dhow with sudden alarm verling called tightly tut her alongside theyre on to us then he tore his sword from its scabbard and was leaping longlegged from the poop before hoggetts men had begun to lever their great oar everything seemed to happen at once from the bows and the bulwark the swivel guns were bared and fired at extreme angle into the men on the jetty those in the front fell kicking and screaming before a torrent of canister shot and others caught on the end of the wall were cut down by the swivel on the poop bolitho found his legs were taking him after the lieutenant although he did not remember moving from the bulwark seamen surged from the hatches cheering and yelling as they hurled themselves over the side and began to run for the entrance muskets banged from the wall and a few seamen fell before they had gone twenty yards but shock and surprise were taking effect perhaps the defenders had grown complacent and careless too long treated to the spectacle of terrified beaten slaves being driven up this same jetty the charging mob of seamen the lethal glitter of cutlass blades and axes held some of them spellbound so that when the gorgons men swept amongst them they were cut down where they stood follow me gorgonsv verlings voice needed no trumpet at em as they ran haphazardly beneath the archway and past some smaller boats there was a rattle of musket s fire from the fortress itself as at long last the defenders were made to realize what was happening r gasping and cursing their legs apart chests heaving painfully the attacking sailors were slowly y compressed by two adjoining walls their advance steadily reduced as more and more men came from the wall above bolitho locked swords with a great giant who mouthed and screamed with every savage slash of his heavy blade he felt something slide against his i ribs and heard the seaman fairweather gasp f take that then the touch had been fairweathers pike which was almost dragged from his grasp as the pirate toppled shrieking over the side of the stairs but other seamen were falling bolitho could feel his shoes catching on sprawled limbs as he lurched shoulder to shoulder with dancer and hoggett their arms aching their swords and hangers as heavy as lead someone pitched sideways and was trampled underfoot bolitho only got one glance it was midshipman pearce his eyes already dull and without recognition as blood ran from his mouth sobbing half blind with sweat bolitho drove his swordhilt against a mans head who was trying to strike at a wounded seaman as he lurched away he turned his blade felt his balance steady on one foot and then drove it under the pirates armpit verling was yelling standfast lads there was blood on his neck and chest and he was almost separated from the bulk of his men by slashing screaming pirates bolitho turned as dancer let out a cry and dropped amongst the others he had slipped on some blood and as he fell his hanger clattered away out of reach he rolled over staring wideeyed as a robed figure ran at him with a raised scimitar bolitho tried to cut a man down to reach him but was in turn knocked aside as tregorren charged through the mob like a bull and slashed the pirate across the face opening it from ear to chin then above the cries and clash of steel bolitho heard the blare of a trumpet followed instantly by major dewars thick familiar tones marines advance bolitho dragged his friend away from the interlocked figures holding him clear of thrusting blades his mind cringing from noise and hate verlings reckless attack had been for one thing only to lure down the bulk of the pirates from the wall to defend the entrance from the dhows crew what it must have been like for the marines crouching in the hold hearing their messmates and friends being butchered while they waited for the signal to advance bolitho could barely imagine but they were coming now their scarlet coats and white crossbelts shone in the sunlight as if on parade and as verling waved his sword to call his seamen back from the stairs major dewar bellowed front rank fire the musket balls swept through the packed bodies on the stairs and as the marines paused to reload s their ramrods rising and falling as one the next rank marched through them knelt took aim and fired f it was more than enough the defenders broke and stampeded through the entrance y dewar lifted his sword fix bayonets marines charged yelling like madmen his men forgot their discipline and lunged for the entrance huzza huzzat the seamen breathless and bleeding lowered their weapons as the marines i charged past dancer said lets get george out of the way together they dragged pearces spreadeagled body into the shadow of the wall he was staring straight up at the sky the shock of death frozen on his face hoggett was shouting through ere sir he gestured at some great ironstudded doors its full of slaves bolitho stood up shakily and took a firmer grip on his curved hanger he caught tregorrens eye and the lieutenant asked curtly you all right he replied shakily aye sir tregorren nodded right take some hands and follow the marines he paused as a sound like distant thunder rolled across the bay and against the headland then came the crash of iron the clatter of falling stonework verling wrapped a rag around one bloodied wrist and tightened the knot with his teeth gorgon has arrived it was all he said again and again the seventyfour poured a broadside into the island fortress the bombardment made little difference to the defences but attacked and harried from within by the jubilant marines and with two shipsofwar sailing unhampered below the wall it was enough major dewar appeared at the top of the steps his hat gone a deep cut above one eye but he was able to grin as he reported that the defence had crumbled to prove his words the black flag above the battery floated down like a dying bird and was replaced to wild cheering by one of the ships ensigns their minds still shocked by the savage fighting they climbed the steps to the high ramparts where the unmanned guns pointed impotently across the blue water there were dead and dying everywhere and too many red coats sprawled amongst the rest bolitho and dancer stood on the wall and watched the ships far below the little brig was already quivering in the early haze but gorgon was clearcut and splendid as she tacked ponderously towards the island her depleted topmen shortening sail but pausing to wave and shout towards the figures on the wall their cheers lost in distance it was very quiet and when bolitho looked at dancer he saw there were tears cutting through the grime on his cheeks bolitho said easy martyn i was thinking of george pearce how it was t nearly me and you s bolitho turned to watch as gorgons great anchor plummeted into the placid water r he said quietly i know but we are alive and must be grateful i ver lings shadow merged with theirs god blast your eyes he glared at the pair of j them do you think i can do everything on my own he looked past them at the ship and gave a tired smile but i know how you feel the strain dropped from his sharp features like a shadow i never l thought id live to see that old lady again he swung away already barking orders bolitho watched him gravely well it shows you never really know a man they pushed themselves from the wall as wearily obediently the seamen and marines began to muster beneath the flag when verling spoke again to the assembled men his tone was as usual smarten yourselves up remember this and remember it well you are gorgons it is a reputation hard to live by for the briefest instant his glance fell on bolitho often easy to die for now clap the prisoners in irons and attend to our wounded after that he looked up and beyond the gentlyflapping flag as if surprised to be able to see either we will take care of those who were less fortunate by evening most of the wounded had been ferried across to the anchored gorgon the dead were buried on the island beneath the wall where bolitho heard an old seaman say as he leaned on his spade i reckon this placell be fought over again an again these poor lads will get the best view of it next time as shadow hid the scars of gordons bombardment dancer and bolitho stood side by side on the larboard gangway watching the last rays holding on to the drooping flag above the battery despite a careful search they had found no trace of rais haddam perhaps he had escaped or had never been in the fortress at all the pirates would say nothing about him or betray his whereabouts they were more frightened of haddam than they were of their captors the latter offered only death by hanging it would all have to be sorted out by captain conway bolitho thought wearily his eyelids drooping the slaves to be ferried ashore the battery spiked and thrown into the sea so many things a step fell on the deck behind them and they turned lurching upright as the captain paused to speak he was impeccably dressed the same as if nothing had happened and none had died he examined them impassively the first lieutenant informs me that you all did very well i am glad to know it his gaze shifted slightly mr bolitho he told me that you in particular acted with the finest qualities of a kings officer i shall mention as much in my report to the admiral he nodded curtly and strode aft towards the poop dancer turned his smile fading as he saw bolitho bent over the nettings his shoulders shaking uncontrollably but bolitho faced him again gripping his friendst arm to reassure him between gasps he managed to explain things lt have changed martyn the captain remembered my name
