jo clayton shadowkill prolog shadith woke in the hold of a ship she was lying on a pallet canvas something like that naked half frozen sometime before while she was out shed been beaten raped brutally she was torn septic she could feel the heat of the infections the blood oozing from the wounds she lay in filth and stench she hadnt been catheterized just left where they threw her shed been fed watered there were tubes taped to her face running into her nose they wanted her alive but broken they who ginny she shifted position slightly felt feces squishing under her when she had her stomach in order she looked around stasis pods dozens of them hundreds all around her she reached the lifesparks in those pods were dim most of them she couldnt recognize but rohant was there nearest her azram tolmant nezrakam kinefray tejnar ginny ginny she looked more closely at the strangers picked up a faintly familiar smell connected it to one of those clients shed watched glide past her when she was in that corridor ginny and his clients prisoners whats happening here prisoners or passengers ginny wouldnt tolerate stasistime i know him this isnt his ship he wouldnt go anywhere on someone elses ship i know him prisoner it has to be prisoner who never mind time for that later her hands were fettered but she had a little play in the filament that joined the cuffs her feet were free she rolled off the pallet used her feet to push it aside then drew herself up so her hands were close to her nose she pulled the tubes free it was painful sickening but she got them out she used the water tube to wash herself it took a long time but she managed to get her body reasonably clean she was cold half frozen the chill from the metal she lay on struck up through her flesh into her bones but she was clean using her feet she got the pallet turned over the bottom side was filthy and stained but hospital hygienic compared to the mess shed been lying in she clamped her teeth on the water tube used her feet and knees to find the food drip and maneuver it into her mouth then she slid the pallet over and stretched out on it it was warmer and softer than the floor not much but enough she sucked on the food tube and began to feel almost human kikun she thought suddenly i didnt touch him or rose dead or what she went painstakingly around the hold once more touching each of the lifesparks they were all there except lissorn who was dead ginny was there his clients and this time she located ajeri the pilot all there but kikun and autumn rose he slipped them clever little lizard took rose with him i hope unless shes as dead as lissorn hell come after us i know it yes all right they mean to break me any way they can let them try she lay and listened using the ears and eyes of spiders and other small vermin she lay and thought slowly carefully she began building the place that could not be touched slowly carefully she withdrew herself within the place pulling memory and everything else vital to who she was inside the armor shed built to protect herself from the interrogators that waited for her mindwipe waited for her where her memories would be evoked then unreeled and dissolved a competent tech could strip a mind clean in a few hours yet leave the organic machine intact the basic intelligence unmarredor mostly soready for reprogramming and resale come come see the fine bargain one flesh machine female fresh from the used body shop she hid from the probe and dreamed another life for herself leaving it for them to find yes you creeps youve got the body but thats all youll get break me will you you can try then you watch your asses theyre mine she set the waketrigger kikun see kikun and know again then she closed the last gap in the wall of the place and slept chase autumn rose and kikun break free and start the long trek after the fiends whove taken their friends a faint sting then pain autumn rose came swimming out of fog into a prickly awareness that she was in deep shit and there wasnt much she could do about it a hand dropped on her mouth her eyes cleared and she saw kikuns face shining orange eyes ringed with white he was in a panic but controlling it he brought his head down near hers whispered can you walk despite his caution the whisper hit the walls and the vaulted ceiling and came back to her as muted clicks and hollow oos melding uncomfortably with the scrape of his boots the clatter of something against metal her face went hot and tight shed stunned her own foot trying to get a guard it was such a stupid thing she didnt bother answering him just concentrated on seeing if she could move her toes her boots knocked against the hard floor covering her pants leg brushed heavily over the thick black cloth of the robe she wore the sounds multiplied by that goertaflcht echo chamber startling her giving her an adrenal jolt that helped clear some of the fug from her head right foot fine left leg below the knee might as well be a block of wood she bent her left knee sighed with relief as long as she had the knee the rest didnt matter she pushed his hand off her mouth cant run races she muttered at him but i can get it going what not now he straightened stepped back stumbled over the body of a dead guard caught himself shivering at the noises his feet made she rolled onto her knees thrust her hand at him help me he eased his shoulder under her arm and pushed up smallboned and shorter than rose with the racy leanness of a garden lizard he didnt look as if he could lift an undersize cat but she came off that floor so much faster than she expected she nearly went over on her face he got her limping along as fast as she could manage and guided her through the guards bodies across the anteroom and into the shiny tartedup corridor beyond she helped as much as she could what shed seen before she went down was coming back to her giving her cramps in her stomach and a powerful urge to get the hell out of there stun rifle held with deceptive casualness under his right arm where he could get it up and working in half a breath the merc strolled toward them now friends you know better the rooms not ready yet just turn yourself around and come back tomorrow shadith yelled and shot him the dyslaerors shot before her yell died out and the other mercs went down an alarm started yelping the instant shadow yelled azram got his arms around one of the metal benches and charged the opening getting there before the metal doors could slide shut he dropped the bench on the slide tracks and went plunging through as the doors kept trying to shut whining and slamming repeatedly at the bench shadow jumped the dead and went running after him lissorn went screaming past her tearing off his cowl clawing out of the robe hed forgotten everything but ginny autumn rose swore and ran after him went down as she tripped over a dead guard stayed down as the rest of the dyslaerors stepped over her rohant roared his own rage as he got stuck in the gradually narrowing space between the doors as they beat at and crushed the bench between them he freed himself and plunged inside rose rolled onto her knees a hand grabbed her ankle she twisted around shot along her leg swore again as she hit her foot as well as the guard she pushed up went limping to the door she crawled over the bench swung herself inside her leg dead from the knee down lissorn was racing toward ginny stunner forgotten claws out he was only a few steps away but the man wasnt moving he stood watching unperturbed near the front rank of the pulochairs it seemed to autumn rose he was more interested in the degree of his attackers rage than in any danger to himself directing his own death ginny seyirshis last and best no he raised a hand four cutters flashed from overlooks hit lissorn in midstride for an instant the dyslaeror was a black core in the furnace where the beams met then they winked out and there was nothing left not even dust rohant roared his great voice filling that room he lifted the stun pistol the other dyslaerors spread in a broad arc converging on ginny shadow stood at the edge of the bidfloor staring at ginny he turned nodded at her started to lift a hand autumn rose shivered touched her head a hand closed on her arm small warm pulled at her no she couldnt move oppression her head her head things moving slow ly slooow ly slooow lyyy blackness nothing she remembered and understood null vibratorthey must have triggered it when they went charging in or ginny had nullfield she bit her lip her head wasnt working right field must be operating still on low power to keep the lid clamped down kikun the null hadnt affected him odd whats happening whos doing this ginny he went down i saw him go down that means diddly he killed lissorn whyd he kill lissorn if the corridor was empty she was surprised at first then annoyed at herself kikun wouldnt be taking her along here crippled up like she was in her head and leg if the way wasnt clear clear for now but not for long there was a powerful urgency in him he was almost carrying her shayss damn my heads not working she couldnt seem to concentrate on anything mind skittering about hibbity dibbity he hauled her out onto the gallery dragged her a few feet along it and pushed through ragged draperies into a room thick with rat droppings and cobwebs and the kind of smell you get down an alley on any skidder road egya cillhaiya rose missuk shai gavan cillahai she stared at him the syllables sliding off as if her brain were waxed to a high gloss and impermeable slid off and fell deadechoes were paralyzed in here like everything else in this catafalque of a room he hissed and shook her dyslaer he breathed you know it oh she forced herself to concentrate say again she stumbled over the dyslaer words repeated them say again we have to have a ship rose we have to get out of here she rubbed at her head the stench was hideous every breath gave her stomach spasms and her knee was hurting more by the minute she shifted her stunned leg moving eased it a little think rose think shadow she was too far in his eyes glazed over i had to leave her if were taken theres no one to follow follow who does it matter she brushed at a bit of dusty cobweb clinging to her hand shuddered as she saw the desiccated corpses of half a dozen spiders she loathed spiders therere the capture ships out beyond the limit we could call one in no she heard the anguish in his voice and didnt press im fogged kuna i dont know whats happening dont you understand i dont know i dont know anything his slitted nostrils fluttered the muscles of his face worked under the soft loose skin im following voices no its not im not listen to me we have to get out of here the panic was beginning to break through his control klar s klar kuna calm down let me see she looked at her robe it was filthy with dust and thick soft webs but those would shake off well enough the privacy fields in their cowls were gonefrom the burns on her neck which were starting to hurt like bites from the devil the null must have shorted hers out when she went down they could pull the cowls forward and avoid lighted areas it might be enough you have your tools she shook her head of course you have or you couldnt ve popped me awake any idea where the nearest shuttleport is vision or whatever well run with it he dropped to a squat closed his eyes pressed his hands hard against them she went to the door stood beside it listening heavy silence not even the scratch and scrabble of vermin she could hear her own heart beating could hear kikuns toorapid breathing then a sound like a door closing a clang of metal against metal footsteps someone talking word fragments scattered nothing she could make out a hand closed round her arm she started swallowed a yelp i see it he whispered at her the see hissing against her ear she flinched she didnt much like snakes lets go he said pushed past the torn curtains and scurried off along the gallery rose grimaced limped after him catching up with him when he stopped at a gate into the pneumotube system he reached for the caller she caught at his arm wait she said what about alarms if there are there are he pulled loose tapped the square you want to walk a thousand kays nothing closer he made a small irritated hiss but didnt say anything she tried a grin small to match his hiss be kind lil liz and consider it the nulleffect kikun took her on a twisting roundabout route across the gutted worldship between pneumotubes he tugged her along faster and faster ignoring her protests tossing her over his shoulder when her left knee threatened to fold on her lifting her over nulledout holers lying where they fell when the vibrators went off pushing her into murky stenchfilled side ways when the sounds of men walking broke the eerie stillness she never saw them she had a feeling of soft secret doings all around her in the dust and decay but she saw none of it only the sprawled bodies of the holers there were no alarms going off nothing whoevers doing this thinks hes bagged the place she said aloud kikun hissed again and she shut up all right youre right lil liz shayss damn i feel like im drunk and i didnt even have the fun of getting there kikun propped her against a wall almost there rose you wait here till i check it out he whispered and glided rapidly away vanishing into the murk of the dusty long unused sideway she slid down until she was sitting on the crumbling mat kikun gone from her mind the moment he turned the corner as the colored lighttubes painted a patchwork of bright transparent shadows on her and the newly oiled floor around her she shook her head trying to shake the fog out it didnt work just made her dizzy she hauled up the robe then her trouser leg and began massaging the muscles from knee to ankle riding in the cars had eased up on her knee some but her leg wouldnt be right till she got time in an ottodoc her flesh felt like clay cold and unresilient as if it belonged to someone else z toyff got to get out of here rose ah she scrambled onto her feet struck out kikun caught her arm stopped her rose she looked up at him and remembered shayss damn kuna dont do that to me sorry rose i forgot she sputtered the laugh startled out of her it echoed back along the narrow curving corridor and made her angry at herself slips like that could get them all killed its all right rose theres no one around to hear he pulled her onto her feet got his shoulder under her arm no guards no nothing lets go op shuffleshuffle the locks inner door gaped open the cracks around it clogged with ancient crud kikun lifted autumn rose over the rim helped her negotiate the crumpled flooring as they moved toward a heavy metal plug with three tube caps lined in a row across it he hauled her to the one on the left end cycled it open and tossed her in as she passed from the argrav field into the something gravity of the tube she lost traction caught hold of a tugline and began hauling herself along the tube behind her she heard the soft whine as the cap irised shut then the line jerked repeatedly as kikun started after her she eased into the pilots seat with a sigh of relief picked her leg up and set it in place and with automatic skill locked the crashweb about her having forgotten him again she twitched as kikun slid into the coseat one of these days youll give someone a heart attack kuna oh no you seeing any snags ahead nothing focused be careful but move as fast as you can right a red light flashed in front of her the instant she cut loose from the tube alarm she said somebody noticed she was working as she spoke swinging the shuttle about sending it toward the gaping outer door of the lock or maybe its automatic she said with a little luck the port was near the top of the worldship where the shuttles could jump in and out without getting tangled in the web of tubes linking the central mass with the ring of much smaller derelicts autumn rose booted the shuttle into a reckless arc over that ring came down to the central plane and darted for the skeletal marina that ginny had provided for his bidders she circled the marina put it between her and koulsnakkos hole then pooted along behind the ships looking them over for size and conformation talking absently as she kept her eyes fixed on the scanner we want a small ship one that doesnt take a big crew two reasons we couldnt handle a big un and a small crews probably in the hole not lying about to make misery for us and we should get one that can put down onplanet so we dont have to depend on landers who knows where well end up so a small hot ship none of these no no ah theres one that might do if we cant find ah red lights gone out dont know whether thats good or bad ah ah yes dont think we can do better than that one she centered the small sleek yacht in the screen enlarged the image what do you think kuna he shivered do it somethings stepping on my shadow rose breathing down my neck hurry right autumn rose took the shuttle closer nosed it around until it hung beside the yacht lock nuzzling against lock well now it gets hard be helpful if i had one of digbys trick boxes but i dont so we go with what we have let me see she began playing with the sensor pad stopping occasionally to watch the screen nothing happened she muttered to herself and went back to work kikun closed his eyes his face went slack idiotic after a minute his fingers began tapping a complex rhythm and a moment after that he produced a singing dronemelody to go with the rhythm rose swung around stared at him then swore and touched on the recorder his hand went still for a moment it lay on the arm of the coseat like a discarded bit of weed then he began again went through the whole sequence a second time he stopped the tapping and the droning worked his fingers opened his eyes thats it what never mind i know what it is aburr uchitels aubade i doubt theres a soul in settled space who hasnt had it played at him in some lift or another why it came to me oh shayss damn we need the singer mm maybe not you know anything about music dinhast nothing beyond oh well lets see she fed the recording into the shuttles tiny brain cast it at the ship nothing happened shayss clicking tongue against palate she listened to the recording again if its not the tune maybe hes playing games with intervals she went to work on the recording running it through such permutations as the simpleminded shuttle brain would allow matching the results against what she knew about keypsych and the parameters of amateur efforts along that line she had a feeling it was amateur any passkey twitched from such a collection of staleisms as uchitels aubade had to belong to a mindset far removed from the life views of the math techs she knew the ones who made a profession of locking things away she came up with a run that was so familiar it was almost comic she tried it no hes a hair smarter than that or she whichever shayss damn i wish i had she glanced at kikun who lay inert eyes staring at things shed never seeand didnt particularly want to no help there she pulled the possibles onto the screen frowned at them glanced at her ringchron time was passing right the complicated one fussy canon of a kind stupid kind goerta brite let this work she cast the new recording at the ship and wiped the sweat off her face as the lock hummed open and an ottodocker caught hold of the tiny shuttle eased it toward the gap wake up kuna my liz were in kikun drifted about the bridge touching things sniffing at them occasionally standing with his eyes closed swaying a little humming softly under his breath rose glanced up from the control pad she was studying frowned at the screen hey look at this something strange was emerging from the top of the worldship a blob of glowing white fog wobbled out of the lock separated from it and floated pulsing and flickering above it a black speck arced over the blob cast a line at it and began towing it toward the marina as it drew closer she saw dark objects floating in the plasm bodies hundreds of them weird kikun ambled over stood behind her his hands on the back of her chair yes he said i see what is it i dont know never saw anything like that never heard of it either he leaned closer to her she could feel his breath against her neck shadows in there alive oh we have to follow that can you on your own i dont know for a while maybe he moved away she swung the chair around scowled at him hed gone across the room and was sitting crosslegged on the carpet his back against the woodpaneled wall his eyes were closed but he felt her watching and cracked them to look at her be ready he said she snorted turned back to the control bank sweet ship as nearly idiotproof as anything shed come across the previous owner must have liked to pilot himself now and then maybe when he was going places he didnt want people to know about like here she disengaged the tethers walked the ship on pressors from its slot with a wary eye on the blob she eased the ship along behind the others tethered in that row until she was drifting at the sunside of the tieup fingers crossed that the ship the tow wanted was down the other end yes yes that big sucker z toyff they came prepared for a hefty cargo whoever followed by two smaller ships the large transport moved free of the marina sucked in the blob as soon as it was clear then the three ships hung together without moving or giving any sign of life for ten minutes twenty thirty abruptly they shot up arcing high over the marina heading for the sun so what does one do now digby digby wish i could call you no well play this out first theres no time no time autumn rose waited until they dropped out of sight then went after them hanging far enough back so they wouldnt spot her kikun sang to himself hed found a clipboard somewhere and was slapping at it drumming himself into the hunt trance getting the spirit hound ready to go snuffling on the trail of the ships running ahead of them a flare behind them she read the monitors not the sun must be koulsnakkos blowing bastards set it to go nova she shivered goerta brite for kunas visions the ships ahead hit the limit and dropped into the insplit with kikuns song and his drumming filling the bridge around her she dropped after them prisoner ginny in chains two men came through double doors walked toward a workstation on a dais its screens were retracted the sensor pads shrouded in plastic covers their footsteps echoed hollowly on the black and white squares of the marble floor it was an immense domed chamber and they were alone in it there were other workstations smaller and less complex ranked around the walls over fifty stations closed down now hooded and silent chairs empty this was a holiday a rest day for everyone but them the one with the manacles on his wrists and the leg irons was a little man with thinning graybrown hair combed across a bald spot a forgettable face and eyes like dead leaves ginbiryol seyirshi prisoner and not liking itthough he didnt let his anger surface his hands hung at his sides relaxed loosely curled as he stepped onto the dais and stood beside the lefthand seat waiting with an appearance of mild interest for something to happen the other was an omphalite muffled in heavy black robes with a cowl shadowing his face a big man twice ginnys size there was arrogance in the set of his shoulders in the boom of his distorted and deepened voice he set a hand on ginnys shoulder pushed him down into the seat and closed more fetters over his arms and legs the omphalite settled himself before the operations console brought a screen humming up and spreading before them waved a gloved hand at the image that appeared when he tapped a sensor at the center of the board there she is your ah nemesis the contempt and mockery in those words ate at ginny but he gave no outward sign of this a young woman with matte brown skin and hair a mass of bronze springs sat in a narrow cell staring into the lens on one cheek she had an outline of a hawk acidetched into her skin an elegant brownline drawing she looked tired and fearful her eyes were red and still teary though shed stopped crying she was twisting her hands together repeating the same motions over and over it was almost three years since ginny had first seen her shed looked about fourteen then despite the stresses and strains of the time since she seemed hardly older though she had to be nineteen or twenty bone structure he thought and that baby skin and playing the child he didnt believe any of what he was seeing hed learned better kill her the omphalite snorted shes nothing he said a front for that sauroid a pawn that creature was the real source of her socalled powers ginny turned his head stared a moment at the shadow under the cowl the black jut of the voice distorter you are a fool he thought but he didnt say it he went back to gazing at the girl no profit in killing a strong young thing like that the omphalite went on shes due for mindwiping tomorrow then well put her into a labor levy and sell her services such as they are he paused contemplated the image we thought about training her as a courtesan but she didnt catch the fancy of anyone here and shes not pretty enough to be worth the trouble strong back and clever hands thats her forte just recently we acquired a contract labor company bolodo neyuregg ltd it was forced out of business because a ring of execs were caught dealing in outright slavery caught hnh foolishness he clasped his gloved hands over the solid curve of his belly we have reorganized the company and gotten it reinstated with helvetia its proving a very profitable addition to our portfolio and a useful dump for products our interrogators have finished with contempt crept back into his voice since youre so nervous about that chocho well flake her mindwipe for you watching her drool youll see you can forget about her and concentrate on your work he touched another sensor and the scene shifted a dyslaeror was prowling about a cell his fury almost tangible rohant the ciocan magnificent beast isnt he the omphalite flashed images of other dyslaerors onto the screen ending with the dark glowering tolmant arent they all along with the four we captured during the attack on betalli these are the first dyslaera weve managed to lay our hands on interesting creatures dangerous which makes them all the more valuable rohant the ciocan he and his woman run voallts korlach you know we want that business very profitable excellent reputation access to places we havent been able to touch you understand he grunted stubborn beasts we tried the probe on two of the younger ones one of thems dead the other mights well be vegetable they seem to have some twists in their heads our savants havent seen before perverse one almost feels its deliberate which reminds me our chief savant will be visiting you in a day or two give him everything you know about the dyslaera hnh theyd make magnificent guards very decorative and maybe even effective assassins perhaps think what we could charge for them if we could guarantee conditioning and control we can start with these but well have to have more of them we need to know how to avoid stirring up that cohesiveness and bloodymindedness they show when one of theirs is attacked or perhaps we could learn to transfer that loyalty to us thatd be good he tapped the sensor again thats a tracer op called samhol bohz hes a native of ekchuatihash interesting world ive sent a small expedition to see what we can pick up there this obsession of yours seyirshi its proving immensely valuable to us we acquired bohz in that attack on betalli he was leading it works for something called excavations limited the proprietor of which is one digby nolastname noplanetoforigin digby my chief interrogator thinks the names a pun shows the way the blitsors mind works something he thought up when he started his business odd man if you can call him a man these days tied to his kephalos with more fibers than a paem bud to ves parent stays in his nest never goes out except by holo cant get at him which is the point i suppose hes beginning to be a nuisance but we have to leave him be until we have more data were thinking of programming bohz and sending him back to scavenge for us maybe maybe not depends on what we can wring out of him here whatever theres always the labor levy one way or another hell make us a profit we have expenses you know we cant afford to waste anything besides recycling is a virtue yes talking about profits he began pulling up images of the rest of the prisoners commenting on each some were to be milked of everything they owned and killed those with positions of power in their home spheres would be given blackmail poisons tailored parasites or other addictions according to the assessment of the savants and interrogators and sent home to work for omphalos a few would be sold to their competitorsthrough convoluted cutouts to keep omphalos clean these were stacked in stasis pods theyd been kept unconscious so they wouldnt have any notion of who had collected them except you seyirshi if any of that lot came across you say a year from now i wouldnt give odds how long youd last he droned on until he reached the end of the images we should harvest several billions by the time weve finished with this to say nothing of an exponential increase of influence in a number of sectors a successful operation wouldnt you say seyirshi most commendable ah yes now one last thing certainly you would prefer to avoid the probe its so easy to slip and apply just that little extra pressure that does so much damage he tapped a sensor and retracted the wristcuffs that locked ginnys arms to the chair so much simpler and safer if you give us the location entry codes and totals in your various accounts then authorize the transfer of these funds as we direct ginny seyirshi turned to stare at him then without a word he began entering the data dyslaera rohant he lay on a hard cold cot in a room filled with white glare he was aware of everything but felt nothing directly no sensation no emotion reached him through the fugue state the dyslaera called nincsothran which had wrapped around him the moment his body was seriously threatened stop the drip now boss questionman he thought cracking his whip over his crew if he could have felt anything it would have been a musty smugness dyslaera werent so easy to tame as all that weve done worse to each other than you can dream of worm you can kill me but you will not bend me touching him here there places he could see places he couldnt see sensors and probes testing testing readings the same as with the other dyslaerors adjusted for age and physical condition fugue state sensitivity to invasive techniques almost nonexistent no pain response response to the adzterpine is anomalous even in terms of the reactions of the other dyslaerors the voice went on a dull monotone listing with little elaboration the tics and tots of his body when it stopped it was several moments before he realized the silence and when he did the silence was filled again with the booming voice hmm each of them seems to be wired differently right i want a sample series from him and the others you know the regimen one caveat this one has to be kept alive and intact order of the grand chom who also requires us to circumvent that fugue state before hes too old for ananiles i want the samples analyzed and the report on my screen in three days he lay on the hard cold cot while techs worked over him faceless men in heavy silver bodysuits their eyes obscured behind magnaviewers their hands shielded by the translucent film of silvaskin nothing bothered him he didnt care what they did he just wanted them to get done with it and let him go back to planning his escape nincsothran protected him and at the same time narrowed his focus drastically everything he did every thought that flickered across his mind dealt with escape he could wait with a terrible patience for the slightest of openings and explode into action the moment it showed there was nothing yet this lot were careless around him they werent fighters not any kind of combat types if he could get at them they were dead and he was gone but their machines were sleepless and ubiquitous not subject to lapses of attention if the crack came it would be in the interface between man and machine it would come he waited fishing kikun and his gods spirit hound put his head down and snuffled at the traces but it was no good the white threads issuing from the only ship left in view were dissolving like smoke blown by the wind he struggled to run faster the ship faded vanished spirit hound whimpered and whined and dug at the nothingness he ran on and through he cast about ran this way ran that kikun hound heard the name turned his head the fine white threads that ran behind him were raveling on the point of breaking and dissipating leaving him stranded kikun the name pulsed along the threads their white brightened thickened they twitched at him tried to pull him back kikun the twitch was harder spirit hound hesitated he wanted to go forward but there was no more forward to go into he turned and ran back along the threads kikun opened his eyes stared blankly at the heartshaped face hanging over him autumn rose he was weary so weary it was almost too much effort to breathe kikun she lifted his hand let it fall goerta brite she went away came back with a cup of broth gathering him up bracing him against her knee she began feeding him the broth sip by sip slipping in an occasional bite of hipropaste when she was finished with that she straightened his cramped arms and legs and tucked a pillow under his head then she went off again came back with a mug of hot tea and a drinking tube she set the mug beside his head helped him with the tube you feel like talking he sucked at the tea let the cleansing warmth trickle through him as he considered the question why did you call me back didnt want you killing yourself just as well id lost them whats happening right now were driftingpointed the same way your last turn took us where are we the callidara pseudocluster whats that a very busy place nearly a thousand systems less than a lightyear apart two hundred of them inhabited mostly colonized from other places only ten of them have native pops kephalos tells me we have to go carefully sometimes the insplit round here is so busy its fabric shakes kikun sucked at the tea frowning that doesnt sound right omphalos wouldnt want close and inquisitive neighbors well its where you brought us omphalos tlee he flattened his hands on the floor tried to push up but his arms had no strength in them help me up no need to go rushing about i have to purge the ship before we go near any of those worlds purge pull her flags we stole her remember i dont purge her the first port we hit zap straight to jail ah how long will that take i dont know depends on what system the po used previous owner that is dont worry i will get it digby sees that his ops know a lot of things most powers say they shouldnt you comfortable there or would you rather go lie down in one of the staterooms ill stay here right she got to her feet first i find me a nice little planet with no people on it one with air i can breathe so i can get the outside clean too then i suppose id better call in and see what digby has to say nothing much is going to be happening for a while so you might as well get some sleep it was a nameless little world a pretty world with nothing more than its looks to recommend it the usual range of metals no large deposits no moons there were a lot of lakes but no great uninterrupted stretches of water in an area with hundreds of other worlds much like it it had been scanned a few times but mostly ignored and it was close byonly a day off autumn rose set the ship down in the middle of a temperate longgrass prairie in the northern hemisphere choosing a flat barren area near a large lake and one of the streams feeding into it kikun wandered aimlessly about the ship as autumn rose settled to work he stood behind her watching her play with the kephalos until she swung around and snarled at him i loathe people looking over my shoulder havent you got something you can do kikun shrugged his narrow shoulders ambled to the coseat turned on the scanners so he could look out over the land around the ship tall grass stretched to the horizon nodding in the wind green and silver moire silk fading to a washedout blue in the distance there were scattered interruptions of a darker stiffer green where trees grew along a stream or deep in a wash a few kilometers off an immense herd of horned beasts grazed leaving a strip of shorn land half a kay wide as they passed on overhead a number of feathered fliers were black specks against the iceblue of the sky kikun was hatched on a tallgrass prairie much like this one so much like it he might almost be looking across his septs home range he sat gazing at the scene and aching with a separation anguish hed been too busy to feel since lissorn rescued him from the stake and brought him away strange places strange peoples nothing to remind him until now kikun do you mind the image vanished the screen went gray i need the kephalos full attention for this she scowled at the console then at him its going to take forever as it is barakaly lak dar thats the po of our chariot he had a mind like a snake with hiccups why dont you take some lunch and a stunner and go for a walk or something kikun rode the lift to the ground and stepped onto patchy grass the lightness of his body startled him autumn rose hadnt warned him about the lower g moving was a little like walking in water without the resistance of water a very peculiar feeling he held tightly to the rail of the lift and sucked in a long breath as he listened to the faint susurrus of the grass that sound ah that sound it was an ache in the heart a wound the morning sun was warm on his face but the air was nippy it smelled of pollen and grass of fish and weed mud and decay something dead a long way off added a faint pungency to the mix it wasnt exactly his homesmell but near enough to evoke a stream of memories he closed his eyes and let them flow over him the good and the bad for the past three years hed been caught up in ginny seyirshis plots no time to stop and think no urge to let go and drown in memory now there was time too much time he panted and his fringed ears trembled his eyes flooded with tear gel he leaned against the railing head down remembering remembering remembering until the spasm was finished then he sighed and scrubbed away the gel after shrugging out of the backpack he left it on the lift floor and walked cautiously across creamcolored sand to water blue as shattered sapphire he squatted beside the tender wavelets that lapped at the sand and scooped up a handful of the water lissorn would have scolded him until his ears rang one does not eat and drink promiscuously on strange worlds bad things can happen to ones insides he smiled at the memory tasted the water it was fresh and cold with a clean green flavor he spread his fingers and let the rest of the liquid run away there was a spiky weed growing a short way out in the lake balancing on one hand he stretched over broke off a branch sniffed at it bit into it not much taste but a good crunchy texture he squatted and chewed until all he had left was a wad of strings which he spat out he scooped up more water swished it around to clean his mouth spat that out also he knew well enough what he was risking but a certain recklessness drove him on a recklessness that was his by godright and a plague on his comfort more than once he got to his feet ran along the beach restless nervous while the day got colder instead of warmer the wind rose the sky was a pale pale blue almost white empty now except for a few high rattails of cloud that merely emphasized the blankness of the blue his bare foot touched a length of driftwood bleached almost white by water wind and sun wood he stared down at the section of branch for a long moment then bent and picked it up yes fire ill build me a fire four fires fires to send a tocebai home yes driven by a new urgency he strode along the sand gathering pieces of wood small enough to carry as soon as he had an armload he took it to a long narrow spit where the feeder creek entered the lake dumped it and went back to hunt for more when he had the wood he needed he went into the prairie and gathered grasses he settled on the sand and began smoothing and knotting the grasses into a sacred mat his fingers twisting and pulling in a pattern so familiar he didnt have to think what he was doing on dunyadzi he would have whistled an ancient sindi while he worked the music gathering his forces and feeding power into the grass here he was empty there was no music in him and the grass felt dead in dead fingers he went on knotting anyway not so long ago when shadow had hinted for a readingshe wanted reassurance before they hit koulsnakkos hole and went for ginnyhe couldnt answer her gaagi wouldnt come he told her he wasnt worried it had happened before his gods going off somewhere and leaving him to himself theyd always come back this time felt different voices had come to him in the hole but they were chilly whispers as alien as this alien wind he was bereft yes good word the right word his gods were his tie to his homeearth and the personification of his several talents he needed those god images and they had to be real ghosts conjured by his imagination were worthless as guides he knotted and wove and wondered if hed been too long away from dunyadzi if hed worn his gods thin and finally to nothing at all if that was true he didnt know what hed do what hed be the thought frightened him he wove the ends into the mat spread it on the sand and went to stand at the lakes edge watching the waves leap and sparkle in the wind nothing came to him the water was alien it rejected him the sand beneath his feet rejected him the wind would not speak to him he went back into the ship collected food offerings brought them to the mat using the gathered driftwood he built four small fires east west north south he put the mat at the midpoint between them and sat on it his shadow going out before him to touch the western fire he used the play of flames to ease himself into the godtrance where he could call them gaagi the raven ellasxe the lynx jadiigevas the antelopedeer xumady the otter spashats the bear laellenox the grandmother ghost gemla the mask that was himself he called them urgently his need for them in every syllable of those potent names especially he called to gaagi ravenwhofliesbefore raven who had marked his path for him over and over since he was hatched raven who spoke with a clarity and brevity that could be more deceptive and more confusing than the deliberate smokiness of laellenox the grandmother who delighted in leading him her grandson into situations that made him scramble to stay alive who always said see what you learned you wouldnt vekiki listen to your gramma and youll never be sorry that wasnt true it wasnt even close to true grammas advice itd taught him how miserable he was when he was having his tail twisted by someone stronger or smarter than him she told him that was the lesson but he figured there were easier ways of learning it xumady scolded him each time he fell for her soconvincing arguments but otter wasnt much better he was the comic grumbler the joker who took nothing too seriously he was also sneaky and murderous with no limits to what hed do to survive what hed tweak and trick kikun into doing spashats was the dreamer the ethicist big and black and powerful never seen quite clearly the bear who smacked xumady down when otter got too outrageous he called them and they came but they were not the powerful mythic figures he saw most times only cartoons animation cells translucent flat no force to them they came and stared at him and were silent one by one they retreated until only gemla mask was left hanging before him a silent summons to return home not now he told mask speaking in the mind not yet you see you see i need her you see mask hung there smoke wreathing about it mingling with the white lines chalked across the black ground it was silent enigmatic then it was gone recognizing the need gaagi was there suddenly returned fluttering black wings a male dinhast painted black his head halfbird halfdinhast the webs between arms and legs glittering with black scales on the inside black feathers on the outside transparent and cartoonish but there gaagi turned to show his backside and kikun saw the threads spinning from him delicate white threads thin as roses head hairs knotted and twisted bunched into torturous tangles going back and back until they touched a sphere floating in darkness dunyadzi immensely far away gaagi showing him that theyd come so far he was almost unraveled reminding kikun as mask had reminded him that if he went much farther stayed much longer away he would rip himself loose from what nurtured him gaagi turned again and pointed kikun followed the finger and saw a patch of darkness a pattern of stars spread across it one of them redlighted the target star he stared until the pattern was burned into memory along with whatever characteristics he could pick out of the image of each star and the sense he had of distances and directions when he looked round again the fires were down to red flickers over black coals and gaagi was gone he had three griefs now one was gone from his heart he had his gods again the second grief was lessened he wasnt helpless any longer and shadow was no longer wholly lost in a little while rose would have the ship ready and theyd go after her the third grief remained and there was no curing it lissorn was dead and gone but there were services he could do for his friend things he had to do lissorns tocebaihed left it to wander without direction that was bad the better and stronger the living the more dangerous his ghost the more harm it could do to the living lissorns tocebai his heartsoul had to be summoned prepared and guided to hozzhadayaka the garden of the blessed it was time now was the proper time kikun rebuilt the fires then settled himself on the sacred mat and remembered lissorn the sun shining through a slit in heavy clouds turning lissorns short silky fur to molten gold lissorns laughter as his tiny golden daughter came running to him still uncertain on her stubby feet as he tossed her into the air caught her and ticked her under her chin as he brought her to kikun saying this is my friend hes funny lissorn roaring into the circle of chanting daiviga dawadai alone acting against training that said dont get involved with locals armed only with a stunner and a knife that knife ah that knife it was a young sword that looked small in lissorns big hand its blade red with firelight but not yet with blood lissorn scattering the little daiviga males tipping them onto their tailfeathers destroying the dawadai circle lissorn kicking the fogga bundles from under kikuns feet sparks flying like shooting stars roaring again as the daivavig gathered themselves against him warbling their killchants laying the daivavig out one by one until they broke and ran into the scrub lissorn slashing kikun loose and tossing him over his shoulder when he saw kikuns swollen broken feet lissorn running with him irresistible and powerful kikun went again to the lakes edge this worlds water would not speak to him but it would clean him that was waters nature he knelt in the water and yielded once more to the flow of memory lissorn facing off that mob with a redlining stunner the charge in it exhausted by the last daivig hed flattened the rest of them running from him just in time all he had left was the knife lissorns body shaking as he laughed while he ran taking a huge pleasure in what hed done lissorn in his fathers arms sobbing his baby daughter dead killed by ginnys surrogates torn apart by the bomb in the korlach courtyard lissorn running at ginny silent this time caution forgotten in his rage lissorn caught by four cutter beams gone to ash in an instant kikun knelt and gazed with glazed eyes out across the lake until lissorn stood solid and shining in his minds eye then he stripped naked waded out farther knelt and began scrubbing himself with handfuls of sand and singing the ritual chant except for the lightness of the lesser gravitywhich contributed strongly to the sense that he was inside a dreamhe might have been on the shore of plibajatsi toh the sacred lake in the middle of his homegrass ah de an po to ah he chanted ritual words words so ancient their meaning was a blur in the mind hu ha apho hae la ceh emo boya can o to encee eh he shifted to a song celebrating his friend there came a man pace by pace across the grass he wore a lion face and lion eyes the sun caressed him as she watched him pass lissorn the shining man kikun slid beneath the surface his body was dense heavy even here the water would not hold him up unless he swam hard and steadily he undulated himself washing off the last grains of sand then got to his feet and walked out of the lake singing as he walked there came a man bold and hot into the shadowsea he wore a lion face and lion eyes the shadows could not touch him he put out his lion hand and lifted me lissorn the shining man the wind was sharp as knives cutting to the bone he ignored it ah de an po ta ah he chanted hu ha a ho hae la ceh e mo boya can o to encee eh he set out the food from the ship fine small things the ottochef had made for him fruits and meats and pastry miniatures in small paper dishes when he was finished he ate a morsel from each dish then folded them up and brought them to the west fire he set them in the flames sang as the white paper turned black and the pale bluegray smoke also blackened with the burning food he took two straight hard pieces of wood and sat again on the mat he struck them together got a satisfyingly solid and musical tunk from them then beat a rhythm from the wood em canta na he goh na ma khol he chanted ma gya a bat ta we drink from different rivers now o friend your heartsoul dances on a dry plateau i am wet with life there is nothing i can share with you my friend your heartsoul is a lion dancing while it waits loudly your voice calls me to come to show the way you leap past the moon you run among the stars you rush to me crying out my feet will not cease running bring me rest i hear you my friend i draw the labyrinth in the sand the spiral of your life my friend run the spiral find rest in the center i draw the double spiral to help you on your way mind your feet my friend look neither to the right nor to the left go quickly and delight in what lies before you hozzhadayaka lies before you garden of the blessed may shizhehoyu father of all bless you my friend go quickly and do not keep remembering your brothers or your sisters do not keep remembering me go your way my friend kikun felt his spirit go out of him mask his other self mask danced in circles with lissorn a bit of ash wreathed in smoke lissorn ran beside him golden lion mane rippling tail rippling at first they ran the labyrinth together then lissorn drew ahead mask slowed and slowed again when lissorn was gone mask melted into air and was also gone kikun curled up on the firewarmed mat and slept dyslaera struggling to survive and get away azram wrinkled his nose achcha fray you stink kinefray kicked at the door yelled after the departing techs bottoss jogin zrafej he kicked the door again shambled over and dropped onto the plank bed beside his cousin whats happening azram looked round the cell scratched a claw through the scabby moss growing on the stone gunk keeps growing havent had you out torture by boredom thats what it is whatd zrafej do to you this time samples of every liquid ive got in my body ive got more holes in my hide than a sandsponge rest and stress he yawned stretched wonder how come zrafej they keep us together i managed to get a word with oh ssst what those bottoss zrafej they shit ticks every place we go azram extruded his claws clicked them against the chains holding the bed to the wall yeh so whats the prob fray anything you going to tell me zrafej already saw oh yeh well i got a word with tolmant zrafej had him in for some the same tests i was getting so he said i was the first of us hed seen since the hole so i was just wondering how come zrafej keeping us together dont know dont care any idea where we are or whos got us na they wear those masks and stuff and they make sure we dont get a look outside none of us you and tolmant had yself quite a chat yah setup you think its all a setup here yah kinefray jumped to his feet began prowling restlessly about back and forth all the time the same way nothing just walls stupid stone walls then the lab tube lights cages stress booths tables like what we do only this time its for people not animals azram scratched at the stubble on his chin animals he said thats it then getting ready to put the collar on us got to know the beast before you can control it or use it or hunt it savant entered a note into his data pad one forgets theyre intelligent with all that hair and claws savant stopped and looked over his shoulder at the two young dyslaera intelligent its debatable savant snorted less so than yours if thats the way you interpret evidence oooohoooh who got out on the wrong side today you want a cup of kaff maybe later after i get through all these damn reports what do those techs think we are memory machines the boy said it ill give him that got to know the beast before you can control it prisoner ginny bows his head and plots revenge another room ripely elaborate designed to be disturbing it was a long thin rectangle with a door in one of the narrow ends and a semicircular dais at the other with five throne chairs on the platform a guard in gray led ginbiryol seyirshi in and ordered him to stand within a black circle inlaid in the white stone of the floor with a double spiral black on white inside it the floor was translucent lit from beneath the only other illumination was a cone of white light shining onto that circled spiral from a single spotlamp dropped from the high dome black basalt walls were carved over every inch in deep relief nude bodies winding in and out across it none of them larger than a mans thumbhere an orgy there a harrowing of hell in another place skeletons in a dance of death or crawling like maggots over heap on heap of skulls crawling as ginny shuffled in beside his escort he found the walls lumpy and unpleasant as he got farther into the room and saw them more clearly the tiny writhing figures made him feel itchy as if his own skin were crawling and pustulous it didnt help that he himself was unclean after hed done what they wanted the omphalites had shoved him into a filthy fetid box and left him there for five days left him to contemplate his helplessness and their power logic said he should be rewarded for compliance and encouraged to continue his cooperation they were using arbitrariness and illogic as a method of breaking him to harness it was stupid if they did manage to reduce him to a puppet theyd destroy what made him valuable to them he had found it easier and more effective to select his tools to fit the task he might manipulate their weaknesses and strengths to make them do what he wanted but he didnt try to alter them the failure with the girl was no mark against this system he understood that failure now it came from a lack of preparation he had seized on what seemed like the ladys gift without giving himself time to study the girl and get to know her ignorance had defeated him he would not let that happen again his jumpsuit was creased and stained though he had managed to keep from soiling it with his wastes lice and other smalllives crawled through his hair and in the crevices of his bodyhe was convinced they were deliberately introduced into his stinkbox to help erode his selfesteem he ached all over from the unnatural positions hed had to maintain he was dizzy from hunger and shaking from weariness but he had control over himself still and he meant to do whatever he must to stay alive he stood on the spiral and waited for one of the five to speak to him his shoulders were rounded his eyes watery and blinking in that blinding light wisps of his thin brown hair stood up in spikes a dull halo about his smudgy little face the five men sitting on the throne chairs were bulky in their heavy robes their faces lost in the shadow of their cowls their blackgloved fingers were weighted with massive silver rings one or two on each finger and two on the thumbs the gems in those rings were the only touches of color in the whole room shimmering red green and blue with every movement of the hands the man in the center leaned forward ginbiryol seyirshi he said voice distorted and amplified i am the gran chom of mimishay seyirshi said nothing just hunched his shoulders a bit more and bowed his head you will be pleased to hear that we wish you to continue your work within certain bounds of course omphalos will choose your targets and control your sales you will be given considerable creative freedom but your budgets and methods must be approved by this council the omphalite stopped waited for a response seyirshi stared at the floor rage shook him but he took care not to show it when he had control of his voice and veins he said what are my options the chom touched fingertip to fingertip you have none unless you consider death hah a viable option a soft chuckle turned sinister by the distorter seyirshi stiffened his face what stupid pretentious nonsense he thought i could do better with ninetenths of my brain shut down to speak frankly seyirshi you have too much potential for us to kill you outright but youre also much too dangerous to turn loose you have an obsessive vindictiveness that overwhelms your reason and leads you to do things no sane man would contemplate that flaw in your makeup has cost you your freedom and your wealth dont let it cost you your life you we wont drop into a labor levy you can work for us or well turn you into fishbait if i am to do a halfway adequate job i need my ship and my pilot sorry cant do that your ship was destroyed when the hole went nova your pilot happened to be aboard at the time unfortunate but there it is we will provide what support you needtransport technicians equipment he shrugged drawing a muted rasp from his robe as fold rubbed on fold seyirshi shivered he didnt want to but he couldnt help it his energy levels were low and this was something he hadnt expected talk about stupid for a moment he didnt believe them it was braindead to waste so wantonly the rich lodes of information in his kephalos to say nothing of ajeri and her skills and her memory it was doubly humiliating to be brought so low by such men as this he thought again and knew it was true his ship was gone why else would they question him about his accounts he had done a little test on them given them less than half and nothing about tahai tolla where he had his xanadu and his complete records and a considerable horde of portable wealth they took the truncated report as truth and the whole truth one look in his kephalos by a halfway competent decoder would have made a liar of him the ship yes ajeri no she was in the hole when omphalos took it nowhere near the ship she might be dead but if she was they killed her here his stomach knotted but he was cold cold and calm watch them note their weaknesses study them like you have studied your target worlds already he had a growing list of soft spots they prioritized wrongly put selfservice above all else including the projects most important to them they were willfully blind to the realities of emotional response threat coercion pain these things contained their own rot short term they seemed to work in the end they failed blind spot how many times had he used that blind mindset to crack a world apart sooner or later he would crack the house of omphalos the sooner the better and this business with the dyslaerors tchah they saw claws and teeth and told themselves here were beasts not men dyslaera history and culture meant nothing to them blind spot they worked from abstractions born out of theory developed more from what they desired than from careful and detailed observation theory and their desires told them that threats would drive him him ginbiryol seyirshi blind oh blind from the moment he achieved selfawareness there was one thing ginny had refused to permit no one gave him orders several times he had been where he was now a prisoner with no options he had fought free and destroyed utterly those who had attempted to control him these fatheads thought so long as he could keep making his flakes he would let them give the orders set the goals they thought he did the productions solely for the money they brought him they did not see that he would fight to the death before he would let them pollute his vision before he would wear the bridle they had fashioned for him blind blind blind the chom set a thumb ring into a socket on the arm of his chair and a screen rose in front of the wall to ginnys left a twist of the ring and a world was suddenly there turning against a thick background of stars bol mutiar the omphalite said on the edge of the callidara pseudocluster there are two small moons you cant see them now theyre on the far side no bigger than asteroids not good for much but spy platforms warm water world very little land area mostly small islands and island chains low in metals no shells or pearls jungle rain forests the woods low grade spongy not worth bothering with savant tetrayd continue the omphalite at the left end of the arc took up the tale bol mutiar was found and settled by a bunch of rabbity cousins in the first diaspora and promptly lost again when the settlers went back to prestone savagery found in this century by a drug prospector who came across it when she was nosing through the cluster fringes she hacked about some found a few bulbs she thought could lead to something nothing important nothing to interest the pharmaceuticals and she got out alive which is more than most the others did the ones that came after her he settled into a morose silence as the chom fiddled with the sensor board and the image shifted to a fat yellow tuber with a tangle of vine growing from the top savant tierce the chom said the next man over started talking doesnt look like much does it the locals call it tung akar it apparently grows everywhere equator to arctic the pandaithats what they call themselves they eat it at least once a day throughout the year it has aaah changed them one outcome of that change was the fact that bringing that plant offworld cost us fifty lives he sat back laced his gloved fingers across his middle ginny blinked at the image interested despite his preoccupations why bother the chom spoke something very odd has happened on bol mutiar involving that tuber according to a researcher on university who acquired one of those tubers somehow it has mutagens laced through it along with some complex organics that match nothing hes seen before in the millennium since the world was first settled that plant has reshaped a ragtag bunch of scourings from a dozen different races and cultures into genetic homogeneity its a lowtech world and likely to stay that way no continents just a lot of islands and island chains you saw that no flight waterships are powered by wind and sail everything they own is handmade no factories no machines no printing presses but he paused for effect then said slowly impressively ideas even information diffuse throughout all the islands in less than a month remember the only way to get ideas or information from island to island is by written message or mouth to ear this is not telepathy thats been investigated not a wiggle on any of the most sensitive detects available to a university scholar which brings up the second aspect of interest to us the scholar im talking about made this world his project and has spent thirty some years studying the people and the rest of it he had no trouble from the locals or the livestock on the other hand he touched the sensor panel again and images began to pulse and shift flashes of squat brown people of white sand and blue water of sailing canoes and fish with hyperdeveloped fins of plants and beasts and birds savant deuce the omphalite at the right end of the arc leaned forward we obtained a viewing of his reports and we determined to send a team in there were amazing possibilities im sure you can see a number of them without half trying the team leader was one of our best propagandists he had a light hand a quick and clever mind he had operated on a score of worlds without missing a beat he put down on one of the larger islands and opened communications with the locals six days later he was dead everyone on the team was dead except the lander pilot and he was so shaky he had the devil of a time getting the bodies offworld and he breathed his last the minute the lander was securely docked savant prime except for the direction of the sound and the different body postures there was so little difference between the men seyirshi had a hard time understanding why the chom bothered to introduce the speakers the voice distorters smothered individual tones and even to some degree different rhythmsor the omphalites made a practice of suppressing such differences when talking to outsiders ginny noted all this and set it aside for later consideration at the moment it seemed neither a weakness nor a strength merely a peculiarity of this aggregation of individuals naturally the ships crew sealed the bodies into an isolation chamber savant prime said then they brought them back here our best researchers found nothing organically wrong with the men only a slightly lower than usual residue of chemical and electrical energy he fell silent turned his head toward the chom images on the screen bodies and more bodies there is no blood nothing but the emptiness of the flesh to show that these men are very dead indeed we were annoyed the chom said we sent a larger force filtors an island rushes toward them as the pov shifts rapidly downward a cloud of dust smoke tongues of fire chaotic snaps of death and destruction they set up a security dome filtered the air didnt go outside unarmored they erased the pandai on that island except for a few saved out to be questioned these they kept in a sterile cell sealed off from everything them included you know the procedures half a dozen bewildered pandai four square brown men two women one young and pretty enough in a chunky way one an old hag with snag teeth and coarse white hair and everything drooping at first they seem confused and uncertain then terrified then they huddle together pressing against each other the locals were dead in less than an hour they just sat down closed their eyes and died the filtors cremated them burned out the cell more pandai showed up didnt do anything just squatted in a circle staring at the dome men with heads shaved and blue markings on their faces the pov sweeps around the circle hesitating a little at each so each impassive face is clearly visible someone from the dome begins shooting five pandai fall over the rifle explodes in the hands of the shooter five new pandai take the places of the dead the filtors started dying the shields went down instruments and weapons had their charges drained without warning or the weapons exploded killing anyone who happened to be about the dome was rotting about the filtors they were rotting too team leader gathered his men and got offworld just barely got off he wanted to drop a hellburner on the place but the ships captain shoved him and the remnant of his force into isolation later the captain had to put them all in restraints then drop them into stasis pods when they continued to deteriorate physically and mentally they were all dead when time came to remove them again with nothing to show why pov moves from pod to pod showing bloated rotblackened corpses whoever can control that force mp i leave to your imagination the possibilities unfortunately there seems to be no way to exploit the pandai without losing men and materiel we want you to devise a way we can handle them and their weapon turn them around so we can live down there and take control of that world they put ginbiryol seyirshi in an austere cell that was a combination office and apartment and gave him a novice to run errands just let me know what you need send him a wave of his hand at the young omphalite for me if theres any difficulty the chom told him im sure you understand the limits on what youll get you can have as much freedom as is prudent outside of that name it and most likely you can have it we collected the researcher from university as soon as we became interested in bol mutiar the chom said and all his records youll find them here he tapped the bezel of a thumb ring against the canister of flakes hed placed on the workstation desk no you cant talk to him there was a regrettable accident with the probe and we had to dispose of him i put a treat in there for your spare time the distorter did little to hide the smirk in his voice ginny ignored it a pinprick a nothing his eye was fixed elsewhere while the girl was in the hold the chom said we kept her under observation a mosaic from those flakes is in the can labeled as such along with the record of her interrogation and the mindwiping session enjoy my little friend ginbiryol seyirshi settled to a brood over the flake player and the canister he had no intention of going anywhere near bol mutiar all he wanted was access to a ship but he went carefully through the data the omphalites provided made copious notes they were watching him they knew theyd broken him bought him he could feel the watchers preening themselves and despising him he wanted to keep that complacency pristine bol mutiar a dull planet if he had been looking for a target world for one of his productions he would have dismissed this place it was monochrome no individuals only nodules on an invisible root system no drama no passion just rot and there was nothing aesthetically satisfying about rot ten days later when he finished the notes he had found nothing to change his mind he leaned back contented with what he had done not enough data in their files they would have to send him out send him with his tools yes nineteen days through the insplit it was not much but if he could not get control of the ship in that time with that much materiel at hand he deserved whatever this lot threw at him his contentment soured as he watched mutiar hanging against the spray of stars what omphalos was forcing on him was a wretched perversion of his art when he destroyed worlds or societies he was simply taking them to their ends in an act of creation that made those ends more profoundly important more coherent and meaningful what he did had nothing to do with control or oppression no he set free he sanctified there was a purity in death there was none in tyranny yes omphalos had given him the subject of his next production but it was not the one they thought it was a delightful irony savior of the universe the deathmaster dancing to the rescue of life he smiled pleased with the wordplay he thought about shadith he wanted her in this he needed her she was a focus of destructive forces a vortex that tore apart whatever she knocked against yes he knew her now he could pull her strings and twist her dance of destruction to his profit the dance of rot and nihilation he looked through the flakes ignored the mindwiping session he wasnt interested in that found the one that recorded her interrogation and slipped it into the player he stared astounded it was a lie from start to finish he played it again matching her statements with his memory of things she had said and done things he had seen in the eyes he had focused on her a logical coherent convincing lie even her body language lied she played the terrified child better than she had with him he looked closer yes because she was not playing she believed and that belief was so strong it colored everything that happened she fooled the interrogators and she fooled the probe because she had fooled herself formidable he played the flake a third time trying to see how she did it stopping it again and again to examine face and body he saw nothing somehow without the help of psychmachines or drugs she had constructed another personality with another history and sealed off everything of the old formidable indeed he replaced that flake with the first of the mosaic flakes and watched the snippets recorded there from her time in the ships hold the fools had left her conscious for at least a month they had made her sick and filthy and they had ground her helplessness into heras they had done with himmeaning to make her an easier victim and as they had done with him they had completely misread her he watched shadith come awake watched her struggle to clean herself and fight off cold fear sickness she lay blankfaced after that staring at nothing he knew what she was doing by bitter experience he knew she was mindriding using ships vermin to hunt out everything she could discover about her captors she was listening to crewmen and captain sucking in data and storing it against future use and she was planning what the omphalites saw as near catatonia he recognized as the intense activity of a brain he had learned to respect he tapped his tongue against his teeth when he saw her face change suddenly her mouth dropped open her eyes rolled back in her head she was concentrating so intently she looked idiotic she is doing it he thought she is doing it right in front of me her face changed again slackening as if the energy had drained out of her she stopped caring for herself two days later she went deeply unconscious alarm bells rang the omphalites scooped her up ran her though the ottodoc and dropped her in stasis for the rest of the trip he sighed and removed the flake she must have included a trigger to resurface the hidden memories when the danger was past he spent a few moments wondering what the trigger was then let it go it was not important he went through the interrogation sequences one last time spectator to a superlative performance such a deadly dangerous child and omphalos has no notion of it none at all find her yes trigger that memory yes set her at omphalos yessss and kill her when its over before she kills me yes they are dropping her into contract labor where they already think i am warped about her let them think it keep picking at them make them so tired of my agitations they tell me what i need to know he ejected that flake and began sketching possible avenues of attack on the pandai of bol mutiar he was smiling as he worked miralysdigby miralys prowled about while digby floated languorously in his bubble pretending to be exhausted by her energy he was in a puckish mood and the room reflected this every time she turned around the place had changed on her so she was threading her way through prickly columns of colored light or tripping over a newly materialized piece of furniture or a plant in a pot or something so esoteric it was only marginally recognizable the third time that she bruised her shin she hissed laid her ears back and stood glaring around until she found what she thought was a chair she kicked at it scuffing the toe of her boot solid but when she lowered herself to the seat the chair melted under her dropping her into a sprawl on the floor she growled straightened herself up folded her legs and sat where she was it was safer that way he wasnt likely to melt the floor under her why dont you grow up fool he chuckled the pickups taking the breathy sound and playing it around the room youre beautiful when youre angry toerfeles she snorted then smiled reluctantly all right so i feel a bit better now whats this about digby you didnt ask me here to pat my shoulder and listen to my sorrows two pieces of information not much in themselves either of them but suggestive with exaggerated grace he swung round in his bubble until he was sitting crosslegged like miralys one of my ops his black eyes sparked with laughter a character named woensdag one of frittaggas more successful offspring if you accent the off his lids drooped again and he sighed by some odd coincidences which i wont bother describing happened across one of seyirshis customers he looked blank a moment listening to voices inside his head a type called olom myndigget were reasonably sure he was at koulsnakkos for the auction hes home now curiously unsinged for someone whos been through a nova burn woensdag couldnt hang about but ive sent another op in see what she can find out considering the ships that left before the burn and

theres to see hmm ill give it a week right right digby closed his eyes and watched her stride out vigor back and purpose in the forward set of her ears he followed her until shed left the building then let his visualization drift he liked miralys and had grieved to see her so poorly that was changed now much better his mouth twitched his eyelids fluttered as he shifted his attention and plunged deep into his ties doing his own devious investigations through the city networks and the planetaries shadith in shadows no memory and a new name stench unclean bodies packed in a small bare room with icy breezes wandering everywhere where what am i doing here who am i who am i who am i she curled up knees against chest thumb in mouth eyes squeezed shut her head hurt who am i who who am i who am i who women were talking beside her around her women and girls she was afraid of hearing what she didnt want to hear and tried not to listen but she heard them anyway their voices were like the odors of their bodies inescapable where is this place what girna or something like aghirnamirr so you so smart so what you doin here so whats it like this aghawatsis cold as hoobis hell thats what diggin in

opened her eyes a big solid woman with warm brown eyes and a friendly smile was bending over her vendage she said and was startled by her own voiceshed forgotten what she sounded like a singers voice she thought who am i she closed her eyes again but didnt resist as the woman took her hands and hauled her up hey you want honesty i shouldve said meat market us child the locals they look us over and choose who gets which head throbbing stomach queasy she clung to the warm strong hand she heard what the woman was saying but it was hard to understand how the words applied to her she shivered hai

two and one and two and here we are the water was cool on her face the dizziness retreated the sink was clean white the towels and washcloths hanging there were clean with a faint sweet smell they were old and threadbare but clean this surprised her though she couldnt think why why should she expect filth then she remembered the smell she woke up to the smell that was coming off her as well as wafting past her how long since we had water for bathing why one more why to add to the list forming up in her mind she held her arms out and submitted passively to the scrubcloth and the cold water somewhere there were answers i must have know them once what happened the panic was still there but distanter somehow maybe it was having someone take care of her like a mother do i have a mother do i have friends she shook her head impatient with herself she wanted to do something but there was nothing in her head or outside it to get a hold on except tinoopa irritating letting other people do for her irritated her must be something from before something that survived whatever or whoever it was took her memories from her the room they were in was as clean as the sink scrubbed until the walls and the floor were silky white with the stoning theyd gotten it was a crude structure thrown together from roughhewn planks cut green so there were cracks where theyd split or warped apart harsh sunlight and a cold dry wind was coming through those cracks the wind eddying about the prisoners why did she think of them and herself as prisoners she shivered i spose they figure anyone who gets sick in here isnt worth putting to work tinoopa wrung the scrubcloth out draped it over a bar pulled loose a towel and began rubbing her dry you be careful round the local men she said some of these types go for anything with a hole in it one good thing youre not pretty she chuckled pushed the hair off the face she was drying dont worry bout that luv pretty fades fast cool head does you better hmm my name the whole thing tinoopa juhfeyn of fuyogeeyur on shimmaroh she hung up the towel and inspected her handiwork you starting to look like you maybe gonna live convict she added cheerfully me i mean thief good at it too though you couldnt tell it from what you seeing now luck took a walk on me cop stuck his fat nose where he had no business being and caught me wrong place wrong time they give me the choosing between life in a shimmaroh jail or ten years contract labor and dont show my face again a weel a weel seeing what those jails are like wasnt much of a choice done five years already five to go miss my kids she wiped her hands along her sides looked round the crowded room havent had a word from them a weel a weel no way they could find me six girls and a boy talk about spoiled that lad still my jaos fond of his ol mum and her comfortable flow of chat cut off and her brown eyes twinkled shrewdly well he wouldnt thank me for running on about him whats your name child shed been listening with pleasure but that question hit her like a brick in the face she crumpled and started crying i dont know she got out i cant remember anything i dont know tinoopa caught hold of her face long strong fingers on one side long strong thumb on the other she turned the face to the light pushed back the thick springy hair at the temples flipping aside longer hair to expose patches of new growth where her head had been shaved mindwipe s no wonder you such a mess now i do ask myself what you been up to luv you dont look old enough to be that dangerous well never you mind dont matter what it was you just start looking ahead she let go and stepped back you going to need a name you let me give you one please tinoopa set her hands on her hips and chewed on her lip elegant bit of work on your face left cheek yes thats right tinoopa nodded as she reached up drew her fingers across her cheek etched into the skin looks like must ve hurt like hell but who did it is one real artist hawk hmm cant call you hawk you not big enough kizra thats a little un where i come from what they call sparrowhawk in interlingue kizra you like that yes thank you ill be kizra all right come over here kizra let me do something about that hair looks like you got knots in it been there for years talking all the time she nudged kizra to a corner of the room took a piece of comb from a pocket in her coverall and began working on what was left of kizras tightcurled hair dyslaera exercise and illusion azram stepped from the dark tunnel stood blinking it was an open pen maybe twenty meters on the short sides thirtyfive or forty on the long ones tall thin watchtowers with bulbous tops growing from the outer two corners the walls were at least three stories high covered on the inside with ceramic so slick even the dust wouldnt cling pale green ugly green an insult to the eyes vomit kinefray said and pushed past him eestee azri look at that he started running across the gritty cement in the endwall to the north there was a spigot about waist high it was dripping into a skim of scummy water in the shallow sump beneath it they stripped and scrubbed each other cold water on a cold dayat first they were shivering then their blood was steaming they splashed water at each other started chasing each other bouncing off the wall wrestling the door slammed open tolmant stumbled out azram saw him pushed kinefray off and sat up staring tolmant seemed disoriented his eyes were wild his ears tight to his head a line of drool crawled from the corner of his mouth nezrakan came from the tunnel caught hold of his uncle eased him across the pen and got him seated with his back against the wall his knees up he moved tolmants arms onto his knees brought his head down so it rested on his forearm he touched his fingertips a moment on the graysprinkled fur between his uncles ears then he straightened crossed to azram and kinefray how you two doing kinefray scratched at the stubble on his chin im full of holes and azris bored to stone he pointed with his mouth at tolmant whats nezrakan started to answer was interrupted by a shriek of rage he wheeled started running tejnor screamed again swung round and started back into the tunnel cables whipped from the wall caught him by the legs and torso and slammed him against the ceramic an augmented voice boomed from one of the towers dont move you a pellet ricocheted from the concrete near nezrakans foot next one moves an earll get it shot off one of the novice wards who escorted them about came from the tunnel still trying to pull his robe to some kind of order tejnor had clawed him good when he broke loose after hed gotten a look at tolmant he undid the belt to his robe straightened it out slapped it a few times against the concrete the belt was six leather straps all of them studded with burrs of steel he proceeded to beat the shit out of tejnor interesting close call there if the ward had kept up the whipping about two seconds more theyd have been on him shot or not savant sniffed you ever smell one of them when hes angry or frightened bsheeeh savant sent the cursor to the opening sequences began replaying the events theres that reflex again you hit my kin you hit me if we can isolate and do the right alterations on the triggers we just might be able to convert that loyalty to us shadith in shadows the shed door opened light blew in cold bluewhite light that broke the murky twilight inside wiped it out making everything clear pristine it even seemed to submerge the smells of sweat and stale urine issuing from the women eyes tearing at the sudden brightness kizra followed close behind tinoopa as the big woman marched out then scurried around and walked beside her glancing repeatedly and surreptitiously up at her like all the women kizra included tinoopa wore a grubby gray coverall it didnt flatter her wideshouldered bighipped body she had beautiful skin soft and smooth a dark amber her black hair was thick and coarse she wore it in heavy braids wound about her head she had a handsome strong face bold cheekbones and a decided chin heavy dark brows over eyes that kizra had seen friendly and laughing they went stony when the door opened kizra found herself believing that this was not only the motherly creature whod tended her but a practiced and successful predator the women were herded along an alley between massive stone and timber buildings and into a large pen where a number of other women were already waiting about a hundred of them she stayed close to tinoopa clinging to her as the only certainty in a world that kept dissolving on her she tried to be casual about it the depth of her need frightened her she couldnt give in to it that was another thing that came popping out of what she couldnt remember there was something inside her that said however frightened you are however needy hide it dont let them see you whimper the beaten dirt floor was packed hard as rock by generations of feet how many labor cadres had walked through here to what end the walls were three meters tall made of planks like the walls of the but with cracks and knotholes and warped places the wind came through in much the same way no color anywhere nothing but gray the unpainted wood was weathered to a soft dull gray the fine clay soil was a grayish tan the women were all in gray and fair with lightcolored hair from ash blonde to dirt brown all but one that one had hair so furiously red it seemed to pull in the meager sunlight and burn with it red hair kizra tried to see her face but the woman had her back turned red hair red she looked away angry and disturbed because there were things in her head she couldnt get at there were other more obvious problems about the look of the women in here she frowned at her hands brown hands darker than the dirt she was standing on dark as tinoopa she looked from them to the pale pink women all around herand was suddenly afraid a walkway with a threebar railing ran along the top of the west wall with doors opening onto it from the building behind a man came from one of those doors he stood looking down at them a moment then away over their heads his nostrils flaring the wind blew his hair sideways long hair straight and fine so blond it was almost white he wore black wool and black leather and carried a heavy pellet rifle cradled in the crook of his arm he shifted the rifle banged the butt against the top rail and began talking raising his voice so he could be heard above the whine of the wind irrkuyon of the families of aghirnamirr will be coming here to look at you they will select from you he fumbled at his belt held up a short metal rod the name of it popped into kizras head laser marker language ive forgotten everything else why do i remember words he thumbed it on moved it about a round red circle flicked from woman to woman when you are chosen thus he dropped the marker touched a womans arm with the dot move here the dot swept to the door theyd come through when the door opens go out a guard will take you to the holding room he went away again a few minutes later a woman came out the same door she was tall and lean with prominent cheekbones and a large mouth her hair was drawn tightly back from her face and covered by a wide band of black cloth the little that was visible was as pale as the mans her brows were almost white and her skin was colorless she wore a heavy gray jacket fitted close to her body and a long full gray skirt she was visibly pregnant five months or six and her face was pinched stern her hands were bare large hands strong hands she gripped the rail tensely as her light eyes moved over the women in the pen kizra read her anger and her dislike for this business felt also the grinding weariness that she was struggling against after a minute she realized what she was doing and was startled by it a talent she thought yes is that why the man returned stood beside the woman he gave her the marker and waited her mouth tightened but she said nothing she lifted the rod flicked it on the red dot landed on tinoopas arm for a moment tinoopa didnt move the man stirred impatiently scowled at her tinoopa sighed patted kizras shoulder and walked toward the door her head high her shoulders straight light as a dancer despite her size kizra folded her arms across her breasts trying to hug reality to her as she felt it start to trickle away then the red dot landed on her arm breaking over a crease in her sleeve with a relief that nearly turned her legs to jelly she hurried after tinoopa the big woman grinned held out her hand as kizra came into the waiting room thought so anyone thatd pick me shed pick you noticed the rest huh they pretty much of a type yes easy to figure the sort of nakaweeks settled this world huh minute i saw ol whitehair up there i had me a baaad feeling maybe shimmarohs jail wouldve been better a weel a weel theres no going back when the irrkuy woman had her quota a set of guards herded the chosen women from the holdingroom into a dusty mudbrick courtyard with a scant layer of gravel over brittle hardpan white dust stirred and fell back with each twist of the sluggish breeze and filmed every surface in the place near the massive gate there were three vehicles parked in echelontwo landrovers and a huge boxtruck the rovers were heavily armored and one was topheavy with what amounted to a gunstation on its roof all three had pneumatic tires made from some polymer that had come out a mottled purple fortunately grayed down by the omnipresent dust kizra stared at them in surprise she hadnt expected to see wheeled vehiclesand gulped as the thought finished forming itself and seized hold of it eagerly and nearly cried out when it slipped away from her it was a fragment from the past which had been scraped out of her but only a fragment a dislocated bit with no connections she could trace her eyes stung but with fierce determination she refused to cry the guards herded them to the back of the boxtruck and sent them up two cleated planks into the dustfilled cavity there were cartons and bales packed around the sides with a thick layer of straw laid down in the middle a strip of canvas laid over the straw up near the front a pallid light struggled through the grayishwhite crud that covered two small windows they were doublepaned with wire mesh embedded in the thick glass one window starred about a small hole tinoopa stood with her hands on her hips the rest of the women eddying around her as they hunted out places to sit she ignored them and continued her leisurely inspection she saw the hole in the glass and snorted looka that kiz she snapped thumb against finger pointed at the window pellet this thing been through the wars for sure and thats where we going right back into it huh she looked over her shoulder the guards were standing around the back of the truck talking in low tones a weel a weel they dont look much worried she shrugged strode to a section of canvas next to a bulging clothwrapped bale dropped easily down come on kiz no use gawking about pick you a place she got her back comfortable and settled herself to sleep kizra heard her breathing slow and deepen and she envied her she crossed her arms on her knees leaned on them and stared past the other women at the pallid scene out the back end of the truck a thin small woman went poking about the edge of the straw blankets whatcha know could be thiss bettern we think her voice came out a basso bellow eeda have one she tossed a folded blanket to another woman who might have been her twin but probably wasnt then she started tossing blankets to anyone agile enough to catch one kizra snagged one of them shook it out and tossed it over tinoopa plucked another out of the air and wrapped it around her own shoulders she drew her legs up pulled the blanket over them the guards stopped talking the pregnant woman walked past moving with an angry impatience despite the fatigue and pain in her face she made a quick gesture and passed out of sight the guards closed the back flaps and chunked in the lockpins the box was suddenly stuffy and full of smells from the women and the goods sealed in with them tinoopa snored kizra gritted her teeth her coverall was too short in the body and cut into her whenever she moved and the armholes were in the wrong place and chafed at her skin helpful as tinoopa had been her easy acceptance of this situation was almost as irritating as the miserable coverall there was a muted roar rough as an old wino clearing his throat the box began to shudder the roar smoothed out a little there was a grinding sound and the truck lurched forward wherever they were going they were on their way kizra slipped into a panic the uncertainty of her future and the unknowability of her past merged into a black hole that dropped over her choking her she started breathing faster her body shook the woman next to her patted her hand no so bad she said in interlingue spiced with a small lilt and a slurring of the sibilants hard work and bad food she shrugged so so you healty you live okay she squealed as the truck jounced over a deep pothole and threw her hard against kizra when the vehicle returned to its usual sway and lurch she resettled herself and went on talking as if nothing had happened me bertem these she waved her hand at the two women huddling close to her my cusinas luacha n sabato the three of them were very much alike with light brown hair cut short and waxed into spikes cheerful monkey faces tiny agile threefingered hands don worry chickee we been at this awhile we know what we call you the skinny woman was sitting across from them her legs drawn up her arms draped loosely over bony knees she leaned forward and grinned at kizra thats right kiz she said me im jassy thats m sister eeda our ma and gramma was contract too we been cross the known and back ant lost nothin but time your first she dont know tinoopa said some gleek mindwiped her and dumped her kizra started then clamped her mouth shut annoyed at tinoopa for going off on her that way and the minute she woke up broadcasting kizras business to everyone mindwipe yeehhah jassys eyes opened wide and she stared at kizra with increased respect though she asked no more questions berts got it she said you dont wanna worry kid i dont say its somethin youd choose had you your druthers but you genly get clothes and mostly enough food beside her eeda nodded vigorously already it was obvious she did everything vigorously except talk could be all those years with jassy had suppressed the urge to words kizra found her silence more comforting than her sisters vehemence eeda grinned at her then pulled the blanket up round her shoulders and settled herself to sleep when kizra looked around tinoopa was gone again and the rest of the women were either talking quietly and privately or dozing she was still angry but the panic was gone she wriggled around tugged at the coverall until she was as comfortable as she could get then she settled into a simmering resentment its targets tinoopa and the pregnant woman whod more or less bought them but most of all the person whod stolen her life from her all right shed survive shed not only survive but shed find the bastard and wring the reasons out of himor her and with them her history panic fluttered again as she realized the difficulties ahead of her but she let anger burn it out anger and determination she closed her eyes and slept the lurching the rattles the bonejarring vibration went on and on bad roads and almost no springing tinoopa slept through all of it adjusting to the bumps with an automatic ease kizra didnt despite her determination the stale dusty air the constant and punishing vibration and the pain from the binding seams of the coverall brought her out of her first heavy sleep and kept her dipping in and out of a nightmareridden doze until she couldnt stand that any more and stayed awake she glared at tinoopa people who were too adept at adapting themselves to circumstances got annoying very fast jassy was awake and talking eh eeda y getta look at what missus was wearing homespun or im a three leg kumis dewi baik y know what that means an looka this truck no ottolooms where we goin the skinny little womans voice rumbled loud enough to drown the other women talking together and the three girls giggling in a corner near the back ehya jass her sister shrilled back at her buts bettern hoein rocks betcha we do that too huh evathin eed wan it y make it djauk tis worsen overbite n overbite were worsen kacsa kypsa n kacsa kypsa were worsen maoustie they stopped their chant and giggled then dropped into silence bored with games they must have played over and over again kizra stared into the dusty twilight and brooded over the bits and fragments she was dredging from her ravaged memory she got feelings about things and those feelings had to come out of past experience the experience was no longer there but itd left something like a ghost behind and she knew things she knew what a world was and that shed come from another one than this she could recognize and name a truck a pellet rifle all kinds of things she knew about pregnancy and contract labor and gods knew what else it was confusing and hopegiving because there was the implicit promise that more and more would come back to her though she knew enough about mindwipe to understand that absolutely shouldnt happen but then something must have gone at least a little wrong in the process because she shouldnt have known anything at all about mindwipe the truck slowed turned onto an even worse road clouds of dust came up around them the sound of the tires changed the dust fell away they were on stone the truck stopped when the back flaps clashed open the sun glared in it was low in the west maybe an hour from setting the guards standing in the gap were dark pillars with melting outlines one of them banged against the side of the truck out he bellowed night stop he banged some more and kept on yelling houp houp houp out you napanapas on your feet shithouse round back got a hole waiting for your dirty asses a limber stick slapped against his arm he yelped and swung around the matja allina does not permit it was a rough ruined voice but pleasant despite that calm and mild the speaker was a long lean man with a badly scarred face what you on at go home knarkin you and your cadre we are all the guard that matja allina alka pepiyadad needs the guard glowered up at him hating his need to bend his neck standing in the opening at the back of the truck kizra cringed as the mans spite and petty fury came blasting at her wasnt you hired us pmurr was the artwa then you can go lick his boots until your time is up tirghe you leave now you can make the aynti pirra before midnight this aynti is hired to the matja exclusive your choice under a bush or pirra the guard glanced around he had his four but there were at least a dozen men standing relaxed and casual between him and the main house three of them started for the truck he shrugged hitched up his pants and walked off his men trailing after him his long thick plaits slapping against his back scarface pmurr swung around waiting for his men before he spoke these were very different from the city guards except for pmurr they were a stockier hardier breed only one of them was blond the rest were a mixed lot of browns and brunets they wore thick gray homespun trousers stuffed into heavy handmade boots and elaborately smocked shirts they all carried pellet rifles ammunition in crossed bandoliers handguns in holsters on leather belts kizra and the locals stared at each other a moment then pmurr brushed loose hair from his eyes and smiled at her come on out he said well be spending the night here when the women were standing in a shivery clot beside the truck he held up a hand one thing you need to know right now nights are dangerous there are walkers in the dark whod cut your throat for a pair of boots this is the only warning im going to give you do what you want about it for washing and like that there are facilities around the back ilip here hell show you he dropped a hand on the young blonds shoulder do what he tells you supper in half an hour they were finishing a meal of stew and crusty bread when pmurr came into the barracks room where ilip had brought them any of you know aught about birthing tinoopa looked up i do she comin early you will address the irrkuy as matja allina chapa no it is only a little over five months but it is a boy and boys come hard on women here anyone else no come with me tinoopa pulled kizra up with her might need another pair of hands she said all right he jerked his thumb at the door then went out matja allina was sweating in pain listening with barely concealed impatience to a longnecked stringed instrument being tortured by a delicately pretty blonde girl sitting on a stool beside the bed tinoopa pushed past pmurr and strode across the room shut up that noise she told the girl enough to turn a cat sick make yourself useful scat to the kitchen and have them boil some water eh for hot bottles you got them the girl gaped at her too startled to say anything tinoopa snorted if you dont know what im talking about get some empty bottles fill em and cork em and wrap em in towels and get em up here like five minutes ago and have the cook heat up some broth if the matja dont need it cook can drink it herself before the girl could get out any of the words crowding in her throat matja allina lifted a weary hand do it kulyari please when kulyari had flounced out the room tinoopa bent over matja allina touched and prodded her took her pulse inspected her eyes and her fingernails talking all the time in a comfortable flow asking questions hardly waiting for the answersas if she knew them before they came should be examinin your head comin on a trek like this specially since youve lost em before you have havent you lost em this late before it is womans lot matja mina said her words came out with the patness of a lesson long learned but there was nothing pat or submissive about her face or the rigid set of her body kizra went as pale as the matja and sweated with her as another spasm of pain seized her tinoopa was feeling nothing but placid interest and cool calculation and the handmaidsthere was nothing in them but a pale sympathy they all seemed opaque stone figures while she and the matja were filled with light red light shining pain she moved closer to the bed drawn against her will deeper into that flood of pain matja allinas eyes opened wide they were beautiful eyes an odd pale bluegreen only slightly darker than polished aquamarine exotic in her stern lean face she stretched out her hand and kizra took it smiling uncertainly if this is a twoway link she thought peace calm accept quiet flowed like cool water through her arm and into matja allina her stiffness and her anger washing away on that flood though kizra couldnt do anything about the pain the matja found it easier to bear now tinoopa looked from one to the other a weel a weel id say the troubles over this while wheres that silly girl with the water and the soup have you eaten matja allina the woman smiled a little moved her head from side to side i didnt think i could keep anything down better to go hungry than start something i couldnt stop true enough tinoopa clicked her tongue send someone for that oobaonk or shell take all night what you need now is warming inside and out yes allina turned her head on the pillow freed her hand gently and beckoned to a short stocky middleaged woman standing in the shadows by the door aghilo you go see that the soup and the water bottles are brought immediately after the woman had bobbed a curtsy and left allina folded her hands over the bulge in her middle and looked up at tinoopa shes a fosterling kulyari youngest daughter of my brotherbylaw utilas ampa cagharadad if you dont know the practice chapa what is your name tinoopa matja kizra waited for her to add the rest of it but tinoopa said nothing more right lesson for the lesser folk dont irritate your betters with more than they need to know she moved as inconspicuously as she could manage over to the bed table finishing up with her back against the wall she had a feeling this wasnt a great time to attract attention besides she wanted a closer look at the instrument lying on the bedtable her fingers itched to get at it if you dont know the practice chapa tinoopa its a game of lessening your responsibilities by passing them off to your kin and you child who are you well that didnt work kizra matja allina nervously she ran her fingers along the dark polished wood of the musical instrument touched the strings with her nails the wood seemed to caress her fingers comfort her how did you learn to ease like that i dont know matja allina i have no memories before i woke this morning i see may your life be happier here kizra shaman you touch that arranga as if your fingers remember it though your mind may not no no dont move away try it see what you can do i have a fondness for music her mouth twisted though you might not think so from what you heard when you walked in sit there she pointed at the stool where the blonde girl had been sitting kizra lifted the arranga held it as she remembered kulyari holding it tentatively she touched the strings sounding each of them yes her hands did remember she closed her eyes let her fingers walk through a simple tune that quickly grew more complex forgetting weariness and fear she let the music come out of heruntil the door banged open there was a hiss of rage and kulyari snatched the arranga from her matja allina clicked her tongue her face twisted with anger then smoothed to a calm mask alka cagharadad come here clutching the arranga to her breasts the girl went to the bed and stood beside it sulky and unreceptive does the arranga belong to you or to me alka cagharadad to the arring pirs matja allina kulyari looked smug her pale blue eyes were hard as stones a woman owns nothing but her virtue she hates her kizra thought startled really hates her put it on the bedstand alka cagharadad lips compressed in a straight line kulyari laid the arranga on the stand dont expect me to touch it again if that dirt smears her filth on it that is as it is go to bed alka cagharadad when she was gone matja allina sighed watch your back young kizra shell sink her fangs in you if she can shes tried it with me a quick smile rueful selfdeprecating meant to reduce the force in her words to a proper femininity and lost a tooth in the process she closed her eyes sighed wearily but she grew it back so be careful kizra shaman she moved restlessly as tinoopa drew the covers back took the flannelcovered stone bottles from aghilo and began placing them where the heat would do the most good i have to have this baby matja allina said she was talking as much to herself as to them i have to he must live aghilo murmured soothing syllables at her helped her to sit up and tucked pillows behind her i have two daughters now but no sons if this boy dies she sighed again closed her eyes let aghilo begin spooning the savory brown broth into her between mouthfuls she said play for me some more please you were a musician once and will be again kizra shaman play the convoy moved steadily along a narrow blacktopped road an armored sixwheeled landrover at point with a gatlin fixed to the top and the heavy shields laid flat for the moment to cut wind drag pmurr and his guards were in this car with a sentry up top under a tarpaulin longglasses sweeping the rolling brushland around them the second armored landrover followed it was a bedroom on wheels airconditioned and marginally more comfortable than the other vehicles matja allina rode here protected from the worst of the jolts by a gimbaled bed plagued mostly by boredom which kulyari exacerbated by her sulks and snits aghilo and her handmaids were silent women they had nothing to say at least nothing they wanted kulyari to hear so they said nothing the boxtruck was the last of the vehicles it rumbled along with numbing steadiness the women inside slept as they could the urge to talk dulled by fatigue and the difficulty of making themselves heard above the motor kizra knew them all now their names the worlds they came from why some of them were here that some wouldnt talk about why they were here jassy chattered endlessly eeda nodded laughed added a word here and there they were third generation contract labor and knew half a dozen worlds from the ground down and told kizra interminable tales about them whenever she looked halfway receptive bertem luacha sabato they were convicts like tinoopa with wild stories about the places theyd been and the scams theyd pulled kizra was skeptical but she enjoyed the stories anyway they were facile in half a dozen langues and impossibly deft with their tiny threefingered hands tictoc evalee and dorrit were cousins from connafallen fourteen fifteen and sixteentheyd signed up to get away from neighborhood wars and bride fairs figuring anything was better than that so far it was ah yes it was or so they told anyone whod listen anitra was small and so extravagantly fair she was nearly translucent silent as the ghost she resembled expressionless beba mahl was short stubby with faded brown eyes that blinked continually and teared in bright light another silent one she hadnt uttered a word the whole trip just sat in the corner by the backflaps looking grimshe was from a forest world and seminocturnal most comfortable in halflight like that in the truck zhya arru took the other corner curled herself up and slept with a determination that kizra found depressing she was another blonde a streaky one with freckles and limber as a snake lyousa va vogl had braids long enough to sit on and square busy hands she sat playing with strings knotting them into a bag of sorts doing it for her joy in the complex pattern of bumps rather than the completed object kizra watched her with amazementthe womans fingers went so fast and so surely it was wonderful to seeand she felt a nudging at her mind as if the knots brought out a memory ghost ommla jhapuki fraji rafikifriends or cousins or lovers they sang and chatted in their rapid staccato langue played finger games and laughed a lot and paid almost no attention to anyone else four tiny women with the palest of graybrown hair like ancient dead leaves beast handlers tinoopa said shed come across them before not this particular tetrad but their kind nomads from a hot dry world called jinasu ekkurrekah and yerryayin were tall and bony with mops of hair like yearold strawas slow in speech as they were fast in hand picking flies from the air with a casual ease that amused tinoopa and amazed kizra whod been after a pest buzzing about her eyelashes she kept slapping her own face without appreciable effect on the fly ekkurrekah and yerryayin were amiable creatures without much to say for themselves the calluses on their big hands spoke their history for them tamburra the kivkerrinite was the one with hair like burnished copper which she wore twisted into a complex knot on top of her head she had green eyes the color deep and clear cream velvet skin slowly eroding under the grind of the dust and the thin dry air she was a woman at the noon of her beauty and so obviously in the wrong place that kizra ached to ask her what she was doing in this lot she didnt ask tamburras innate dignity and selfcontainment made questions seem an intrusion and after the woman came awake screaming on the third night of the trip kizra decided she really didnt want to know tsipor pa prool was a listener secretive kizra shivered when she caught tsipor looking at her she wasnt sure why there was nothing but a mild interest radiating from the woman but it was rather like being watched by a snake vuodee and vassikka were twin dumplings plump fair gigglers a year or two older than the connafallen cousins ordinary girls neither intelligent nor gifted just surplus they giggled together and chattered in an incomprehensible argot but had little to say to anyone else flushing red and fidgeting if they were directly addressed day after day same faces same voices they were ground into her like the dust that never settled dyslaera vivisection scene operating theater the captive dyslaera as audience in two lines of cages raised headhigh above the floor techs in masks white robes white gloves working at stations about the room some waiting some already collecting information from sensors sealed to shaved areas on the heads and bodies of the captives the older captives are in the cages on the wall opposite the single entrance rohant though his nincsothran has been drugdiminished he is detached sitting like a lump his health seems good his bodyfur is sleek his mane thick and springy tolmant his body is spasming in withdrawal from the massive courses of drugging that have wiped away everything but rage hunger and a struggling distorted lust his personality is gone his memories his capacity to learn to respond to anything outside his skin nezrakan his hair is falling out in clumps his bodyfur is almost gone what is left is gray or white it looks brittle as if it would break off if you touched it ossoran he is cool calm like rohant he seems sleek almost untouched though there are subtle signs that his appearance is misleading he is sharing the cage with his closest friend feyvorn he is also healthy vigorous both of them move with a hesitant awkwardness as if they are holding themselves so tightly in check that every move must be visualized before it is made in the cage on the opposite wall the young dyslaerors glance repeatedly at their elders look quickly away each time more disturbed by what they are seeing tejnor his body has been shaved clean to facilitate healing he is still plastered with spray bandages from the beating in the pen he sits hunched over on the floor of his cage now and then he lifts his head but he avoids looking at his teachermaster tolmant azram he is brooding miserable though he has not been touched by the techs he shares his cage with kinefray his head is shaved bare a metal cap has been bonded to the skin the bodyfur is gone from his forearms and lower legs metal strips are bonded to the skin otherwise he looks vigorous healthy the heavy double doors whooshed open two lines of techs came in their white robes brushing about their silvaskinsealed feet a table rolling between them young veschant clamped naked on it outputs flared at the workstations as the sensors on the other dyslaera transmitted their reactions as they saw the boy for the first time except tolmant he didnt seem to know what was happening veschants eyes were closed his chest rose and fell steadily in the harsh light from the overhead his bodyfur was sleek glowing and he was even a little pudgy though dyslaerors seldom acquired much bodyfat the techs bustled about setting up an instrument tray inserting tubes and electrodes about veschants body shaving patches of his fur sealing sensors in place protected by the remnants of the nincsothran that the techs had tempered in him using what theyd battered from tolmant nearly destroying him in the process rohant watched and wondered distantly why they hadnt done all this preparation before they brought veschant in the techs settled in at their stations the operator stripped off his gloves held out his silvaskinsealed hand for the cutter we will begin with the legs he said and made the first incision veschants eyes snapped open and he screamed the clamps held him immobile and the operator continued slicing away the skin baring muscle and sinew savant speaking to notepad that veggie wasnt quite the waste we thought hed be tech kaddas notion for recycling him has paid off note enter commendation arrange for a day at black house as a reward we have collected readings from the other dyslaera especially the older ones it seems that the kinbond of theirs grows stronger with age suggestion acquire some cubs see what happens if they are reared in isolation also if possible acquire gravid females and remove the infants as soon as they are viable shadith in shadows after the fifth stop there were no more ayntis pmurr passed out water bottles and warned the contract women that it was all theyd get for the day so theyd better make it last the land was beige under a pale yellowish sky the tag end of winter sucking the color away it was as empty as it was colorless except for dark specks soaring too high above them to be identified when they pulled up for rest and meals jassy pointed them out with macabre zest she was sure they were vultures shed seen that sort of thing before she and her sister eeda produced a series of revolting stories about the habits of vultures on other worlds theyd favored with their presenceuntil tinoopa made them stop because several of the younger ones were sweating and turning green it was dark inside the box there were only those two small windows to light the space and both of them were gray with ancient muck outside the tires on the two landrovers and the truck threw up flufftails of white from the duncolored earth fine floury dust that crept through the most minute of cracks to powder the women and everything inside air came from outside through filtered vents bringing with it the pungent smells of the countryside it was cold dry air that leached moisture from their noses and mouths cracked their lips and made them bleed the convoy stopped twice a day the women in the labor cadre were given bits of coarse dun paper and sent into the brush to do what they had to and warned not to linger four armed guards went with them more armed guards lay flat on the trucks roof each facing a different direction and the rest took turns watching over the matja allina this and the loneliness of the land spooked even tinoopa she hurried into the truck as soon as shed eaten and relieved herself the others scrambled in with her giving a collective sigh of relief as the back panels clanged shut kizra was frightened every moment she was outside she hated that so she hated this place for doing it to her and she cursed the matja allina for bringing her here most of all she raged against the unknown whod stolen her memories and discarded her like garbage though she was uncomfortable there and increasingly ambivalent in her attitude toward the matja allina wanting to dislike her unable to dislike her kizra had to spend part of each day in the landrover amusing her with kulyari glaring at her then turning her back on her she knelt beside the matjas bed playing the arranga when matja allina felt strong enough she whistled tunes for kizra sang the words once kizra had the tune right teaching them to kizra and smiling with pleasure when kizra sang back to her she enjoyed the teaching it was something to do to make the hours pass difficult hours for allina since the landrover was only a degree more comfortable than the truck and she was worn out by the jolting and the boredom most days tinoopa was there too spinning tall tales when the matja was too tired to sing tales about shimmaroh real and mythical kizra watched this and listened enjoying the stories and absorbing the lesson tinoopa had her charm going full blast she wasnt missing a beat as she contrived to make herself valuable it was an education in how to deal with power when youve got none yourself kizra heard a flurry of sharp cracks a rattle against the landrovers sides one of the windows starred but didnt break the pellet that hit it went whining off she stopped playing wha matja allinas lips tightened to a thin line tumaks she said and motioned for kizra to keep playing nothing to worry you were well protected tinoopa sat crosslegged her back against the sidewallthe one away from the main thrust of the attack what are tumaks she said better we know so we can help against them matja allina sighed tumaks are hired fighters before you ask no i dont know who did the hiring procagharadad family is in kirtaa with several other families at this moment it could be any of them before tinoopa could ask she laughed and went on yes yes kirtaa private war mostly an exchange of snipings its juvenile nonsense and be quiet kulyari i dont care to hear you rant and desperately wasteful but thats the way things happen here the landrover picked up speed and the jolting increased exponentially matja allina ignored the difficulty spoke around the major jounces theres nothing much you can do chapa tinoopa just learn to find shelter quickly when the shooting starts ungh no no im all right that was a bad one wasnt it she lay pallid sweating and breathing hard silent for several breaths then took up where shed left off youll have to watch for brushies too the organized tribes dont bother us she paused as the landrover slowed settled toa more sedate progress there thats over for the moment but there are always outcasts ready with a knife or poison dart so you should stay behind the kuysstead walls ah yes there were no natives on this world the brushies are either contracts who left before term or the landtied who untied their knots she smiled again shook her head not a good life chapa no way a good life youll be far better off staying with us day after day the truck roared on matja allinas face got puffy and bruised her eyes were feverish with unabated fatigue when she wasnt spinning wild tales tinoopa massaged and bathed the matja aghilo held her and fed her kizra sang to her eased her tensions helped her sleep ignored and resenting it kulyari settled to a spitefilled seethe day after day on the fifteenth day the truck passed through the gates of the stockade about the main buildings of ghanar rinta the landhold that arring pirs ampa cagharadad and matja allina alka pepiyadad were wringing meter by meter from the stony wilderness fishing a strike kikun drifted onto the bridge stood at the back watching the screen which was labyrinthine with windows inserted into windows windows sluggishly moving vanishing appearing again as autumn rose worked over a broad sensor pad a section cleared in front of her there was a series of flickers across the face of the screen the windows crawled furiously about some changing size and shape some vanishing altogether to be replaced by others when the activity stabilized rose settled back in the chair scanned the results she sighed moved her shoulders shook her arms kikun scratched among the loose folds of skin under his jaw about finished she looked around another hour maybe or two unless youve had a brainstorm you want to talk about no but i might have a place to go once were ready to go somewhere he nodded at the screen i see youve got your fingers upto your elbows in that thing could you free up some starcharts and a looksee for how long he lifted a hand twiddled his fingers let the hand drop hmm she called up a status report frowned over it for a moment i can cut the auxcom loose for about twenty minutes if thatll do any good give you access to the chart files and hmm a searchline ill have to block you out of the main kephalos you know her fine blonde hair was soaked with sweat plastered against her skull she pushed at it impatiently otherwise we could get tangled in there and spend the rest of our lives squatting on this nice but boring world her eyes were blue as the sky outside and about as warm she was still immersed in her puzzle and not all that interested in what he was up to um youve worked charts before good this is pretty much an idiotproof setup not that im saying youre an idiot kuna she added hastily just that chart functions tend to be standard and barakaly lak dar installed the usual right you know where the auxcom is good so go kuna dont waste your time huh hit the beeper when youre ready configuration not found the words blinked at him from the dark screen kikun scowled at them hed fed in the characteristics of each of thestars their approximate distance apart at least the chart hadnt humiliated him with the insufficient data message wait there was a note running at the bottom see help yes i seem to need help he touched the sensor question pov what oh hed forgot default pov was the ships current position gaagi wouldnt be looking from this world hed be looking from dunyadzi the center of hismybeing he knew the coordinates of his home sun lissorn had made sure of that in case of trouble lissorn said capture teams dont lead the safest of lives if anything happens he said i want you to be able to go home if anything happens people change you know he said get jealous of proprietary information which is what those coordinates are just remember them kuna that way youre free of everyone even us and you can go when you need to kikun pressed his hands hard against his eyes he had given lissorns tocebai rest but not himself what mask and gaagi had shown him he was feeling in his bones he was alone his connections to home and kin so tenuous they were close to breaking he didnt know what would happen to him if they did he didnt want to find out he wiped away the tear gel scrubbed his hands on his trousers no time for this now he entered dunyadzis coordinates as pov and managed a smile when a familiar configuration of white dots filled the screen he redlighted the star he wanted saved the coordinates when they appeared and signaled rose that he was finished the screen went gray he lay back in the chair and closed his eyes metal room angular precise he felt like an intruder here on sufferance as it were the curves and bulges of living flesh didnt belong in this placeat least not his curves and bulges hed never been alone in a barebones metal room like this lissorns ship he sighed lissorns ship had its angles softened by the processes of living and the dyslaera love for hot bright primitive color paint and fabrics carvings and handknotted rugs plants everywhere noisy places those ships to the eye ear and nose mixed crews loosely organized occasionally squabbling full of life he didnt feel any life herethough that might come from what he knew about the owner a man who could enjoy one of ginnys productions must put death and pain into everything he touched or a numbness so profound that that he had no words to describe that nullity that absence of of everything maybe shadow could make a song that would name the void and tame it shadow wasnt here he shivered and went back to the bridge he hadnt found all that much warmth in autumn rose but at least she was alive and friendly autumn rose frowned at the screen well ill give you this the location fits that star is just off the line we were on when you lost the trace kikun frowned in the cluster no theres a rift then this system she touched in a code and a system schematic appeared along with a short addendum star iksalgun gal cat mlg planets inhabited yongm arumdam kochilm other seven burnttobedrock spheres kept that way by frequent sunflares three gas giants four large iceballs the world called arumdam has the best climate the biggest population she said slowly i imagine its the one we want she yawned sipped at the tea she had left from the supper shed dialed when she finished the purging theres this too kuna record shows lak dars been there several times her mouth twisted he seems to be a type who needs to know every crack before he steps on it so hes got enough stuff in file to write an encyclopedia about the place clutter most of it well going through it will be something to do while were splitting there kikun inspected the schematic then the index window i see he brooded a moment ears twitching restlessly you said you were going to call digby i put the call out there were shadows under her eyes like smudges of ink and the bones of her face seemed about to come through the skin he should be clicking in within the hour what are you going to say what is there to say if he calls you home i go what do you expect kuna what can i do on my own look im sorry but thats it he gazed at her until she twitched her shoulders and turned away angry at herself and at him then he went to the backwall and sat on the silken carpet waiting for the call digbys face filled the center cell broad and brown with black eyes in nests of smile lines nice to know youre alive autumn rose lil liz there she swung away from the screen waved her hand at kikun who was still squatting by the backwall swung back hes the one that did it listen dig this is where we are now she sketched out everything that had happened since the debacle at koulsnakkos hole ended with the star system kikun had dredged up so we have the ship its clean plenty of fuel weve got a thread we can pull on or not up to you dig do i go with it hmm for several minutes he communed with his ties his face a lumpy mask the life that informed the flesh gone then he blinked and looked at her with grave approval hows your rat supply ten racked two gone should be enough youre on a roll rose no point in wasting the impetus hmm while youre splitting get down every detail you can remember and rat it to me so lissorns dead ash saw it too bad another blow to miralys and you think the ciocans alive i dont know kikun says hes one of the prisoners taken from the hole hmm from what ive heard his records good on that kind of thing uhhmm omphalos kikun again i cant confirm right leave that to me and go with what youve got use the rats to keep me up on what youre finding will do anything else not at the moment except discretion rose if you find the lode dont spook the guards you can get a bit brisk luv i hear you dig better watch the dyslaera if you dont want brisk ill deal with that when it comes up take care rose the screen went dark autumn rose pushed at her hair and sighed brisk huh she twisted her head around gave him a tight smile there you have it kuna ticket to ride you know youre a useful being to have about lil liz wed be nowhere without you she straightened cleared the screen and began entering flight data while im doing this why dont you pick out a stateroom and get settled its not a long way from here to arumdam but well be moving slower than usual because of the traffic in the cluster he got to his feet went to stand at her shoulder how long anything from two weeks to a month depending ill let you know later right right a useful being to have about kikun turned on his side drew his legs up the bed shifted gently under him adapting to the changing weights and arrangement of his body useful being shadith worried about using him rose was more practical and less attached his gods were shadows his friends were dead or gone he was empty a skin stretched over a void he couldnt go home not yet awhile the daiviga ktawal lissorn called her a subqueen which was close enough who governed the grass had put a price on his head and the dawadai priests would haul him to the nearest stake and torch him the minute they got their hands on him how long was it only five years that was standard years dunya years were longer a little he didnt know how much say five years that was close enough five years the ktawal ilafur wouldnt have lost a feather in that short stretch let alone her memory of the dinhast whod hung up caricatures of her on every corner of ootlakil even without that he couldnt go home not really home his sept had cast him out he was a nonbeing among the dinhastoi that was always the fate of the clowngods avatar according to the songs clowngod was uncomfortable company a sport of nature fitting nowhere a singleton rogue in a people of triads and triad multiples a god who didnt believe in gods at least not for worshiping more for trading with or getting round a breaker of laws disrespecter of persons rebel and iconoclast bad enemy and worse friend personification of change in a world more comfortable with day after day of the same thing no matter how miserable that might be where nearly everyone was frightened of the turmoil and chaos that change invariably brought avatar he was the avatar for this generation hed been given no choice about that if the proposition had been put to his formless soul before it was seeded into his fetal body he would have rejected it indignantly he tried rejecting it later he shared the dinhast mindset that was much like the dyslaera mindset when it came to kin and kind he needed friends and family it was no good he was what he was he suffered because he couldnt make dinhast life fit him or make himself over to fit it the alien friends hed found helped fill the emptiness hed invested first in lissorn then in rohant and shadith friendship wasnt enough but it helped lissorn was dead rohant was gone shadith was gone shadith he lay wondering what had happened to her was she alive or dead surely the omphalites wouldnt go to the trouble to capture her just to kill her shadow girl dont do anything foolish were coming for you you must know were coming hang on wait wait he sighed and slept shadith kizra on the farm kizra jumped down her knees went and she would have fallen if tinoopa hadnt caught her long day the big woman said absently she was watching the man standing before large double doors at the top of a wide flight of scurved steps he was a tall lean man a gold and bronze man he shone like a hem in a stained glass window the bronze coal lamps at the upper comers of that door turned his fine blond hair into a shimmering halo about his lined face sank his eyes into glinting shadow he came down the stairs crossed to the landrover where aghilo and the handmaids were helping matja allina down the folding steps there was an urgency in him that filled the whole of the irregular courtyard melding with the urgency in the woman their greeting was a simple touching of fingertips eye meeting eye the woman bowing to the man the man lifting her it looked formal but the formality was on the surface beneath the force of the feeling that lay beneath those heraldic surfaces woke an ache in the emptiness where kizras memory had been her eyes prickled but she refused to cry just turned away to inspect what lay around her the court was paved with squares of dusty bluegray stone webbed with cracks the court walls and the walls of the great house were sod and cement short stiff grass grew on the sod like patches of coarse fur coal lamps smaller and less elaborate than the two giants by the house door were scattered about those walls throwing inky shadows into deepset doorways and arched window openings beyond the broad court and the house towers like snag teeth stood black against the crimson of the setting sun towers everywhere round and square fat and thin with flattop roofs or conical caps there was construction in every direction she looked scaffolding upper stories half complete the smell of the sod was pungent as the heat leached out of it mixing with the smells of people standing quietly in shadows hordes it seemed to her of small fair people waiting in shadow for the signal to move to talk the other women in the labor cadre stood beside her a ragged group lingering by the only thing they knew the truck the youngest and newest to contracts tictoc evalee dorrit vuodee and vassikka were looking eagerly about poking each other whispering and giggling the rest stood silent waiting for someone to tell them where to go what to do tinoopa watched the matja and the arcing meet then nudged kizra away from the others she turned her shoulder to the landrover set her hands on her hips and gave what she could see in the growing dark a good lookover quite a place she said shed pitched her voice to carry uuuuh huh kizra said considering how many rifles it took to get us here lovely walls she stretched groaned i would kill for a hot bath she too let her voice carry made a song of the words a song to remind matja allina how much ease theyd given her during that miserable journey she snatched furtive looks at allina as the woman stepped away from her arring and raised her hands in a ritual greeting to her household then spoke quietly to aghilo pointing as she did so at tinoopa and kizra hey it worked kizra murmured maybe tinoopa said maybe she meant to all along the shimmarohi tapped kizra on the shoulder a habit she had before she dropped into aphorism disguised as advice good intent is a fine thing but you dont chance you life on it kiz rules say they have to pay us treat us right yeh tell you this and you remember it rules mean shitall out here forget everything else but remember that if im allowed a weel a weel thats not like to happen twice luv not here anyway leaning heavily on her arrings arm matja allina went up the stairs and into the house aghilo took tinoopa and kizra in behind them the rest of the women were lined up and marched into the womens quarters in one of the side wings the second floor hall was lit by rank on rank of torcheres with dozens of wax candles impaled on spikes candles with glass chimneys over them to keep off the drafts that wandered throughout the house despite its thick earthen walls the herbal perfume from the oils in the wax drifted on the drafts riding atop the heavy stink of the hot wax tinoopa and kizra sat on an inadequately padded bench outside the door to the matjas suite no electricity kizra said after a lengthy and fidgety silence candles shooh tinoopa chuckled a warm rough sound that rubbed against kizra like a blanket you she said you dont know what bad is she thumped kizras shoulder it was laydownthelawtime again listen luv from now on no comments i know people like this pair they can be generous but its on their own terms you show em you think you have rights you threaten em they get mean happens every time she frowned at kizra dont complain and be ready with that little extra bit of service if youre valuable youre treated better we made a good start but its only a start its a rough world thisn looks to me like someone could get killed round here kizra yawned thrust her hands into the side pockets of her coverall all right look theres something been itching at me how come i still know stuff things like about laser markers and different worlds and well i mean stuff doesnt mindwipe get rid of all that tinoopa twisted around raised her brows were all talking local arent we how think about it oh kizra rubbed her shoulder against one of the knobs on the seat back oh yeh tinoopa chuckled again yeh easy when you think about it huh she straightened around folded her arms across her breasts and dropped into a doze kizra yawned and yawned she was exhausted and bored and if something didnt happen soon she was going to go to sleep in spite of the knobs on this damn bench she fidgeted some more wiggled her toes scratched at her head wondering with irritation if shed picked up visitors from the scabby places shed been sleeping in recently sucked at her teeth until tinoopa lost hold of her temper and slapped at her head slapped lightly but hard enough to get her attention act your age nit you driving me buggy age kizra fit the tips of her fingers together tapped them against each other one by one forefingers first what age hmp just sit still will you i sit still i go to sleep how much longer we stuck here until now be quiet kizra subsided till now shed been frightened groping for she didnt know what coming up here though just a minute ago something had happened to her like a boot in the behind between one breath and the next she relaxed all over it was as if shed shed centuries of worry and just sort of settled into her body letting it do its thing or maybe she was just so tired she didnt have enough energy left to stay scared there was a kind of freedom now she thought about it in having no history to set its claws in her she didnt know who and what she was so she could make herself up as she went well not quite free tinoopa was there to tell her things poke her when she needed to notice something talking about poke why did they put knobs on this furtzen bench just where they were sure to poke the sitter in the ass hmm funny how the oil in that wax made little balls of fog about the flames then went eeling up out of the chimneys tinoopa drove her thumb hard into kizras ribs muttered on your feet nit look sharp will you kizra was up and smoothing her coverall before she was awake enough to be aware of what was happening aghilo touched her arm come she said they want you she nodded at tinoopa both of you the rooms were rich with dark wood warm redbrown wood with umber streaks in it polished until it glowed with soul they crossed a short hall with closets a kind of anteroom and stepped into a sitting room with a soft silky bluegreen rug on the floor backless benches instead of chairs piles of cushions covered in rich damasks in striped cloths and embroideries heavy drapes fell in gleaming folds over two windows opening to the north on tall stands flanking the windows there were flowers in cloisonnй vases kizra pulled that word out of memory startling herselfit didnt seem likely a labor contractor would include it on his languatape who was she that she knew things like cloisonnй she started tensing up again then told herself forget it doesnt matter isnt worth a sneeze it was a warm cluttered cozy room filled with flickering shadow from the candle lamps in brackets on the walls she took an incautious step and slipped on the silky pile waved her arms to regain her balance without kicking over one of the little tables with their litter of bijouterie tinoopa caught her steadied her watch your feet luv its like walking on ice she muttered her boots were worn and old the soles smooth as ice she lifted her feet and put them down with exaggerated care and thought about those boots she hadnt before they were just there she took them off at night and put them on in the morning and that was that they were like cloisonnй not something a contractor would have provided they must have come from the time shed lost later later she told herself you can think about it later keep your mind on what youre doing tinoopa might be sleepinducing on the subject but shes right the next room was a bedroom larger than the sitting room less cluttered the bed was carved and fluted and draped with pale blue gauze tied up with pale blue silk ribbons matja allina lay beneath a blue silk pouf with crisp white pillows tucked behind her her blonde hair hung straight over her shoulders itd been brushed till it shone her hands lay limp on the starched white sheet folded over the top of the pouf all this delicate delicious fuss did not become her it made her look gaunt and drained arring pirs stood beside her frowning a little he wasnt happy with this business or with them matja allina managed a weary smile i commend these women to your notice miarring the elder is tinoopa the other kizra they have given me ease and enjoyment where i expected none arring pirs bowed i am obliged chapa his voice was deep and slow a perfect voice for a stained glass hero kizra glanced at tinoopa bobbed a quick curtsy a second after the shimmarohi finished hers there was a touch of amusement in matja allinas shadowed face her eyes opened a hair wider yes she said i hadnt expected such a fortunate dip in the pool but i mean to use it now that its shown its head she spoke slowly her voice dragging arring pirs bent over her whispered urgently she touched his face shook her head now she said i want them established in place before i come downstairs tomorrow youll do that for me he kissed her fingertips straightened up i will do it mimatja she closed her eyes a moment then turned to him again help me shift a little ive got an ache building when she was more comfortable she said aghilo come here she clasped the little womans hand listen my dear no one can or will take your place with me do you understand that aghilo nodded matja allina settled back on the pillows yes young kizra there is a gifted musician miarring is that not so child kizra stared at her hands thats for others to say matja allina well i do say it she paused closed her eyes your music was a joy to me child i wish you to play for me each night it relaxes me and gives me rest tinoopa matja allina yes youre a strong and capable woman i dont ask what brought you here though i suspect someone found you entirely too capable i need people i can trust she smiled up at aghilo squeezed her hand more people there are too many about who dont want this baby born alive i dare trust neither doctor nor midwife anyone could be bought or coerced or work against me for the pleasure of it people being what they are if you and kizra give me complete loyalty and intelligent service for the next year help me birth the boy alive and see that he stays alive i will have your contracts voided and i will do my best to send you offworld anywhere you wish to go with a stake to keep you while you look about for work not a large stake she added cautiously were cash poor our wealth is the land and what grows on it miarring do you second me in this let it be said mimatja your will is mine in this if youre sure yes besides what choice have we very little he shook his head his gilt hair shimmering in the halflight jirrilscadad dropped by last week while you were gone he brought his two youngest daughters there was a dry distaste in his voice i had to sit through string plucking and coos and blushes and giggling until my hide itched once the boy is born though he bent and touched her hair forgetting for the moment everyone else in the room matja allina sighed turned from the two beside her to the two at the foot of the bed well she said tinoopa snorted need you ask yes i do need tinoopa bowed her head spread her arms and spoke with more care and formality than she usually bothered with i agree to serve you with mind and body in wholehearted loyalty for the term of one year in return for the voiding of the labor contract and your good will for the rest of it i see you have some understanding of the dangers involved good kizra i agree same as tinoopa matja mina relaxed closed her eyes the bruises under them and the fatigue lines on her face more pronounced than ever arring pirs tapped aghilos shoulder pointed at the door as if she could see through closed eyelids matja allina said no one last bit the chapa tinoopa is to have full authority as subhousekeeper let polyapo keep the title ulyinik she stopped turned to them at the foot of the bed that means mistress of the house but dont confuse that with mistress of the kuysstead i am the matja she coughed waited while aghilo bent with a warm damp towel and wiped her face leave her the name miarring but nothing more make that very clear to her and everyone else im tired to death of her sniping and incompetence establish the chapa kizra as my personal companion and servant under no ones orders but mine make that clear also especially to kulyari who has already shown her spite will you see to this for me miarring with pleasure mimatja kizra caught a grim satisfaction in the words obviously pirs was not all that fond of his niece um aghilo love see that they have clothing and supplies suitable to their status and rooms in this wing and see that kizra has the arranga with her at all times from now on she opened her eyes meals and a hot bath for each i believe i heard someone saying shed kill for a hot bath the room on the third floor was long and narrow with pegs in a white plaster wall instead of closets and paneling there was a narrow bed with a coverlet white as the walls loosely woven in an intricate pattern pretty in the candlelight that picked out the texture and emphasized the pattern and turned the whiteness pearly kizra pulled the door shut behind her edged around the bed and set the candle on the table she sat on the bed with her slippered feet hanging beside the boots flopped on the floor next to her waddedup coverall she didnt care if she ever saw that coverall again it was stiff and stinky with old sweat and clogged with white dust and her chafed places were still burning from the fifteen days shed worn the thing remembered wearing it anyway she thought about kicking it out the door but was too relaxed and drowsy from the bath to want to move she sucked in a long breath let it out she was clean she smelled good the candle gave the room a warm welcoming glow it smelled good too it was one of the fancy ones from the matjas supply aghilo told her to enjoy it while she had it the next one she got would be tallow and not nearly so nice she pinched the candle out took the robe off and got into bed shivering a little as her warm body hit the cold sheets she had on a blousy nightshirt very soft and flowing but it didnt help at all with the cold she wriggled around until she was comfortable then shut her eyes and arranged her mind for sleep moonlight streamed through the narrow window beside the narrow bed white and chill and far too bright moonlight it was eerie things looked different she pulled her hand from under the covers stretched it out to intersect that slant of moonshine the color was leached from her skin the fingers seemed bonier they trailed light like smoke she wiggled her fingers and watched the shadows play inside the beam then pulled her hand back into the dusk where it took on an ordinary dark solidity sleep sleep she flopped over the nightshirt twisting about her body pulling tight against her neck she humped herself about tugging at the cloth smoothing wrinkles that felt like ridges under her the inside of her knee itched she twisted around and down scratched and sighed the itch moved to the middle of her back she chased it as high as she could reach shuddered all over kicked the covers off and rolled out of bed scratching at her arm she padded to the window and stood frowning out it at a strange colorless landscape at roofs with pantiles like humpy scales at a wall two stories high and wide enough to drive the landrover on with merlons along the outer edge and towers black against a sky hot with stars so many stars even the huge yellowgray moon couldnt blot them outa full moon rising into a cloudless sky limned against it a pair of strange mountains black silhouettes like pointy breasts with hardened nipples and a river like a streamer of silver silk splitting around the kuysstead moat she thought gods tumaks brushies those what theyre this spooky about i wonder what they look like all we saw was empty land empty land the guards were watching like it could hatch trouble any instant did too she shivered as she remembered the shooting north and west for fifteen days looong days had to be at least two thousand kays from where theyd started thirty days of misery for matja allina coming and going and for what for us twentysix women if that was the measure of her desperation ayyai matja allina is she crazy thinking up enemies for her baby or is it real will she do what she promised can she he backed her but maybe hes just humoring her he doesnt like us much that was so thick in the air i could sink my teeth in it he said hed back her promise with his he meant it i think now that doesnt say anything about later when the time comes he might and he might not if shes crazy paranoid then what she said its just words and were stuck for the duration ten years gods i hope not i dont like it here i dont like having to kiss up to a bunch of hmm does that say something about what kind of person i was before she leaned on the windowsill and contemplated her reactions since she woke in that miserable hut up and down elated depressed angry excited and tired sometimes she felt a hundred years old sometimes about six sometimes she felt in charge of herself sometimes she felt utterly helpless though mostly she was somewhere in between like now and right now she was so tired she ached but her eyes simply wouldnt stay closed and her body was giving her the fidgets of hell she blinked startled a small red dot bloomed high on one of the black mountains a fire it flickered at her vanished as if a wall had been put in front of it reappeared vanished reappeared then was gone altogether its a piece with everything else conspiracies to suppress a fetus things in the brush that need to be shot at not just shot at but machinegunned signals from a mountainside aimed at who someone in here what did that mean she yawned suddenly so heavyeyed that she wasnt sure she could make the bed before she melted in a puddle of sleep another turn in in the fog wasnt it fog for everyone who could read the future not me not anyone she stumbled the few steps to the bed fell onto it and wriggled awkwardly about until shed got the covers where they should be over her not under she wriggled a last time like a cat kneading a pillow getting it right then she dropped into the abyss if she dreamed she didnt know it

to wear with the long gray skirt the smocked shirt with the narrow scarf for a belt she thought about wearing them but something made her pick up the old boots and hold them and sit gazing at them her link with the past she slid her feet into them laughed a little as nothing happened no epiphany no magic rebirth not today anyway she went downstairs feeling vulnerable and tentative till she came up with tinoopa and smelled the meat frying and the new baked bread waiting for them says auntee akitha caught ol tinkkar playin fumblefinger with young impanni you coulda heard the noise in the next

witches that kulyari she was in some kinda snit made my life even more a misery than usual she the chattering housemaids seated about the long table fell abruptly silent as tinoopa and kizra stepped through the arch into the servant hall off the kitchens south end cook had the armchair at the head of the table a big woman with massive arms and breasts like pillows she didnt say anything just sat waiting for the newcomers to greet her she reigned here and wanted no doubt of that in their minds with kizra a nervous shadow in her wake tinoopa swept in stopped beside cook held out her hand i

girl yes you the little one dont hang about like an addled mouse you too skinny as it is sit down eat eat the morning was cool and damp with dew in the distance kizra could hear the blatting of some kind of beast a fussy irritated sound she could hear mens voices mixing with the blats she couldnt make out the words but she thought that they were swearing probably at those beasts sounded like the kind of misborn creatures who stubbornly and perversely refused to do what they were supposed to do and how do i know that gods i wish i wish the wipe had took all the way then i wouldnt have these ghosts no dont no she could hear squeals and loud whinnies she could hear a rhythmic thudding with a second thudding just off the beat she could hear singing that wove around that thudding she could hear birds twittering insect buzzes a thousand small sounds that blended into a sense of peaceful purpose a pleasant background hum for a bright sunny morning at winters end matja allina stood on the steps pulling on her gloves and letting aghilo tuck shawls about her to keep her warm her daughters were there a short distance from their mother ingva the older thirteen almost as tall as her mother and thin an austerely pretty child with the promise of beauty later on intelligence sparkling in violetblue eyes spirit in the set of her body the alertness of her face as she looked about there was a wildness in her that burned through the patina of control kizra thought she looked like a deer about to start running not because it was afraid but from the sheer joy of stretching its muscles three years younger than her sister ylapura was shyer and less appealing a wispy child with a worried little face she had her mothers eyes pale shining aquamarines set in sooty lashes but she lacked her mothers vigor maybe her intelligence the jili tutor arluja stood behind them a thin gray woman with a tired toointelligent face kulyari was there too hanging about the edge of things looking very pretty her hair braided and wired into intricate whorls her skin milk white and rose pink her mouth was a soft rose and her eyes a dark blue they glared hate when she glanced at kizra and a sullen dislike when she looked at allina a dislike that melted into demure shyness whenever pirs was around polyapo was there tinoopa beside her the ulyinik was a sour woman full of vague resentments but shed pasted a simpering smile on her face in honor of the occasion kizra couldnt understand why allina kept these two around what constrained her it wasnt pirs doing he was indifferent to both women barely noticed them he was indifferent to everyone but allina and his children leaning heavily on aghilos arm matja allina walked down the stairs and across the courtyard to the long table where her female overseers waited with the new women lined up behind them after she was settled in the cushioned armchair matja allina set a roll of papers on the table in front of her flattened them and held them down with two bits of slate set there for the purpose from where she stood just behind the matja kizra could see a list of names with a brief notation beside each anitra beba mahl eeda ekkurrekah matja allina pulled out the second page let it roll up beside the stone weight nunnikura chal weavemistress she called out and waited until a heavy middleaged woman with thick gray braids came to the far side of the table i have seven for you one with some preexistent skills the others trainable she looked beyond nunnikura chal at the labor cadre the chapa whose names i call you will go with the weavemistress she will show you where you will sleep equip you with clothing and other necessities and put you to work lyousa va vogl sabato bertem luacha tictoc enke dorrit matja allina waited patiently until that was sorted out then called intoyo chat dyemistress kizra clasped her hands over the arranga case hanging from its shoulderstrap and withdrew her attention tinoopa had been heavily into aphoristic advice after they left the breakfast table its all very well the big woman said being backed by the local bosses but i have to make that backing stick i got that polyapo soothed down tinoopa said it was easy some butter and a sweet or two mostly a sympathetic ear and agreeing with her vision of herself she thinks because shes irrkuyon born and bred the rest of the world should flatten themselves at her feet and say yesmand nom and do everything she says cause its her that says it stupid woman just as well though kiz if she werent blind and an idiot and pretty well loathed by everyone who knows her i wouldnt have this cushy job vindictive bitch that kulyari tinoopa said shes going to make my life a hell yours too unless hmm i wonder what they consider unforgivable around these parts kizra shivered at the memory of that predatory look in tinoopas eyes allina was right the shimmaroi must have found tinoopa far too formidable to want her anywhere near their world she was impressed when she found out about the mindwipe funny thing to be impressed by i suppose it was because i somehow scared someone enough he had to wipe me out like that mindwipe things keep leaking over from somewhere last night shed dreamed most nights she dreamed things that she couldnt quite remember when she woke except the feelings and the day ghosts ideas and images that slid into her head and out again before she could catch hold of them ingalina chal beastmistress a thin wiry woman came forward tanned leathery skin sunbleached blonde hair cut short matja allina took the last of the rolled up sheets passed it across to the beastmistress ommla jhapuki fraji rafiki zhya arru tsipor pa prool go with the beastmistress and do what she tells you she settled back into the cushions accepted a cup of hot broth from aghilo that ends that she said ulyinik polyapo come here please she continued to sip at the broth as polyapo waited across the table from her finally she set the mug down the supplies i brought from nirtajai have been stored and inventoried it is being done matja allina kizra blinked thats a lie she thought she glanced at allina decided the woman knew perfectly well that her ulyinik hadnt stirred herself that the supplies could have sat out and rotted for all polyapo cared about them good i will expect a plan and a listing a full accounting by sundown im sure that will be plenty of time since you are already working at it however i would appreciate your personal involvement in this inventory since youll need to know exactly what you have to work with during the following months chapa tinoopa will assist you in this and in anything else that will ease your labors amurras blessing ulyinik polyapo blessed be amurra matja allina polyapo creaked stiffly through the ritual bow then went sweeping off with tinoopa following placidly behind aghilo brought out the flask of broth touched the mug but matja allina shook her head no more thank you aghilo chal your arm please the dye vats were in a large open shed in a secondary court west of the main court there were lengths of cloth drying on lines shaded by thatch roofs hanks of yarn draped over pegs and vast steaming tubs of color with women walking on narrow ledges about them stirring the cloth or yarn or tufts of wool with long wooden paddles their hair protected by kerchiefs from the steam their faces smudged dark colorings under every fingernail blackened with coal dust and red with the heat young girls tended the fires under the vats fetched coal from bins built into the yardwall others rushed about with fleeces fresh yarn rolls of cloth it was a busy noisy place women talking laughing the girls singing chattering all of that despite the hard heavy work they were doing matja allina inspected everything the stores of ground colorings and other supplies the work done while she was gone looking for quality and quantity then she settled onto the leather seat of a folding stool uri gintji little chals little songbirds come and sing for me teach young kizra here some homesongs uri was a small pink and white child with hands dyed a dozen colors and frizzy blonde hair escaping from short plaits gintji was longer and thinner with less color in her face and more in her hair they curtsied solemnly conferred in whispers faces flushed blue eyes skittish then they turned and stood holding hands singing in sweet true voices small voices that fit the moment and the song the sun rises uri sang mayra spins the red threads the moon rises mayra spins the white threads the sun sets gintji sang hirmnal tends his sheep the moon sets hirmnal shears his sheep sun and moon moon and they sang together love waxes love wanes day turns to night night to a young man grows old a girl bears and rears sun and moon moon and sun love waxes love wanes the sun rises mayra weaves her bride cloth the sun sets hirmnal fattens his sheep kizra picked up the tune began playing her own thread to the song the girls were startled and stumbled over a word or two and then were back on track and finished with a flourish as uri and gintji retreated among their friends kizra kept on playing sliding into another tune that seemed to drip from her hands a strongly accented upbeat thing that had the women clapping and stamping before shed played a dozen phrases matja allina let the play go on for about five more minutes then she nodded to aghilo got to her feet and went out leaving a buzz of talk behind kizra felt the womens eyes on her as she went out sensed speculation and some resentment with a few spikes of outright dislike favor she thought they dont like a newcomer landing such a cushy job they liked my music well enough not me no not me she bit on her lip tried to tell herself bunch of backwater provincials dont mean a hiccup to me im out of here first chance i get weavers embroiderers and fancyworkers clerks mechanics turners and joiners leatherworkers herbalists blenders oil pressers and gardeners field workers millers in the watermill on the riverside the air white with flour and gritty with bran herders in from the field beast tenders in the home paddocks the sick and wounded in the infirmary pregnant women prisoners serving out drunktime or recovering from the lash given for assault and other offenses they visited them all matja allina had a word with one or two then kizra played and learned songs while matja allina rested drank more broth allina rested but she never stopped weariness grayed over her emotions but she didnt show any of that she listened smiled saw everything and moved on after several hours of this kizra began to worry getting out of the mess she was in depended on that baby and the mothers exhaustion couldnt be good for it she dropped back until she was walking beside aghilo is it really needed all this she whispered urgently the matja is too tired now she shouldnt let herself get that tired aghilo patted her arm yes she murmured i know dont say anything she flicked the fingers of her left hand at kulyaris back that one she shrugged give her a crack to pry at and shell have the matja out before tchah once the matja has seen everyone shell rest she cant miss anyone out there are jealousies i see shes a blessing to us all you dont know aghilo shook her head you just dont know child its why the irrkuyon hate her so much even her own family she makes them look ah like what they are she shames them you keep your eyes open youll understand now hush theres nothing you can do but sing your songs and play your music and make the day brighter for her and for us she knows what she has to do shell rest when its time go go ive talked too long dyslaera spree the gym was a long oval with three tiers of seats along one side where the spectators could look down on the games being played out on one section or another of the springy floor nine savants formally dressed in cowl mask black robe and gloves sat in the lowest of the tiers a waisthigh wall the only barrier between them and the floor behind them there were two score techs in their formal whites behind these stood a dozen wards in cowls black leather and stainless studs six had heavyduty stunners six held dart tubes armed with exploding missiles down on the mat facing the savants ossoran and feyvorn stood naked arms dangling loosely by their sides ossorans fur was rexed and sprinkled with gray it shimmered in the light with each breath he took feyvorn was a red dyslaeror he shone like liquid copper they were heavily muscled and despite everything the techs had done to them they were in magnificent physical condition savants and techs murmured with pleasure the guards stood imperceptibly straighter savant leaned forward spoke look up dyslaera a black cylinder emerged from the ceiling fifty meters up the cable it was attached to lengthening slowly as it paid from an unseen drum it stopped when it was about five meters from the mat the cylinder dissolved revealing a dyslaerin in a cage she was very young terrified furiousand in season her claws had been removed her fingers shortened by a joint she was biting at the bars wrenching at them trying with everything she had to bend them just enough to let her limber body through savant watched the dyslaerors smiling with satisfaction a contest he said you will fight each other for her the victor will be allowed one month free of tests and the services of the female one of you must die if both are alive at the end of the time we will set she dies if you refuse to fight she will be artificially inseminated and as soon as the cub is born she will be vivisected like that youth you saw a short while ago questions ossoran stared at feyvorn feyvorn nodded how long ossoran said thirty minutes we will fight they circled around each other feinting retreating moving so fast theyd finished one set and were on to something else before the watchers fully realized what had happened this went on for several minutes then they ran full out at each other feyvorn hit ossorans hands shoulders bounded upward and caught at the bars of the cage he twisted his body round got his footclaws hooked over the base surged up he reached through the cage and tore out the girls throat as soon as feyvorn was airborne ossoran ran at the wall vaulted it and began mauling everyone he could reach using his teeth and claws on his hands and feet savant speaking to notepad bloody debacle savants and are dead savant has been sent to the meat farm with massive injuries including one arm torn from his body three techs were also killed or injured two of the guards panicked unfortunately they were armed with the dart tubes they killed the subjects but also blew away several techs and savants and observations the techs on duty at the data stations are to be commended recommendation honor bonuses for each preliminary analysis of readings indicates a reluctance to accept control from external sources that is far more powerful even than the kinbond note we have a weakness that must be held in mind at all times when dealing with these dyslaera their claws and fur lead us to think of them as beasts and this induces us to discount their intelligence that is dangerous on looking over the flakes of this disastrous event i have noted that the plan was set and agreed upon in that first glance they shared without having to consult they noted the best points of attack to achieve their goals devised their plan and set it in motion recommendation i must add my voice to that of savant in the course that he suggested acquire dyslaera cubs preferably before weaning also gravid females these last should be kept comatose and their cubs surgically removed at term if we can tame these creatures they will be servants without peer highly intelligent and physically magnificent shadith kizra on the farm dinner over her duties finally done matja allina lay on her side pillows tucked about her to help with the weight of the baby hot water bottles spread around her warming the aches out of her as the hot milk had warmed her inside she was drowsing happily sighing with pleasure as tinoopa kneaded her back and shoulders now and then she sang a few words to the music of the arranga her grasp on the notes was sometimes shaky she frowned when she was off looked irritably at kizra as if the arrangas tuning were off not her voice kizra got the message she played to minimize the clashes mushing the accompaniment shifting her fingering to follow the wanderings of the matjas voice crawl shadow crawl she sang under her breath her fingers faltered as she realized what her mindvoice had said shadow who what was shadow she gripped her lower lip between her teeth and forced a brittle calm over her nerves ingva and yla were sitting on the floor in a corner a low table between them playing a complicated game of cards but not absorbed in it kizra saw them looking repeatedly at their mother she couldfeel their anxiety confined in the room they were confronted with her fragility and their inability to do anything about it the muted comfortable sounds of the kuysstead shutting down for the evening came through the open casement the sunset glittered crimson off the diamondshaped panes high overhead a hunting raptor screamed and stooped then swooped away with its prey dangling from its talons the wind was rising and a few clouds drifted past high clouds pink and gold with the sunset pirs came in he waved tinoopa away settled on the stool beside the bed and drew his fingertips along allinas bare arm kizra continued to play quietly though her fingers shook with the impact of what lay under that gentle restrained gesture after a minute allina caught his hand sniffed at it she didnt say anything just looked at him raid on the south pasture he said not brushies tumaks a dozen of them it got hot there for a while but we drove them off karr and ritmin were hurt flesh wounds nothing to worry about we chased the ones left alive past the boundmarks they had a rover hidden away got to it before we could get close enough we let it go no chance of catching up with them on horses too much chance of ambush so close to the house how they dare damage slaughtered a herd of woollies tried to fire the brush but its not dry enough yet karr thinks theyre townbred their landcraft was more notable by its absence fire yes that was a mistake i saw a brushie watching and a pair of lborrghas i dont think well have more trouble with fires lina aklina i dont think the tumaks will have time to strike a match if they try it again just to make sure though im going into the brush tomorrow for a limalima with chulgop its not necessary i think it is mimatja you know chulgop he wont lose his head if he kills you he hasnt before lina miklien tell no one im not worried about the brushies well not much its your kin that brother mingas drools in his beard when he thinks of this kuyyot and rintirry she caught his hand held tight to it id burn the kuysstead and kill myself before i let rintirry lay one finger on it or me in their corner the two girls had gone very quiet aghilo crossed her arms and hugged herself her face blank tinoopa stood in a shadowy corner brooding over this new turn kizra kept playing the same song over and over the sound like water flowing unobtrusive gentling pirs stood its time you slept mimatja aghilo cousin take the girls and wait come here ingva yla when they were standing before him he touched each head lightly a small caress say nothing of what you heard tonight you hear my lirrilirris yla blinked not even to the jili arluja papay particularly not to the jili arluja even if she

her sisters hand and went out tinoopa curtsied said arring pirs be sure we shant speak of this even to each other she hauled kizra to her feet and hustled her out pirs rode from the kuysstead an hour before dawn kizra woke sweating and moaning from a nightmare whose details evaporated before she got her eyes open she flung the covers back and went to the window where she saw him on the ferry his uncovered head shining silvergilt in the starlight the rider beside him was long and lean with plaits bumping against his back blond too but duller like rope braided from last seasons straw pmurr the loyal blood brother as close to pirs as chat ever got to irrkuyon they rode the big blacks pirs prize horses skittish beasts snorting and sidling hooves noisy on the floorboards of the ferry the sounds that they made as loud in the clean stillness of the predawn as if she were standing beside them she could hear almost as clearly the putput of the winch motor and the creaking of the windlass she watched them ride off the ferry and vanish into the predawn gloom moving toward the leftward of the two mountains the one called patja mount well good luck to him she shivered and started to turn from the window something flickered on the wall near the mill she pushed the window open farther and leaned out someone was running along the wall fair hair and skirts the way it moved young accustomed to that talent of hers by now content to view it as the equivalent of her ear for music she read the figure nodded kulyari up to something she could smell itspite triumph and a furiously busy mind what is it what could she do that little rat kulyari flitted along the wall like someone set her tail on fire corning inside fast as she can scoot how somewhere on the ground floor no other way in all right lets get down there and see what we see she kicked her slippers off threw the robe around her shoulders and went running out kizra leaned over the gallery rail peering down at the great hall shadows and emptiness no movement nothing she read the runner again the garden that was it kulyari was coming down into the family garden she stopped then she was moving again she stopped again stayed still doing something very busy sense of vindictive satisfaction she was talking to someone talking who using her reach as a dowsing rod kizra ran down the stairs and through the smudgy darkness until she was touching the south wall of the great hall one hand on the wall her bare feet silent on the elaborate parquet she ghosted along getting closer and closer to the girluntil she was standing outside a massive door she leaned against the door and tried to hear what kulyari was saying the wood was too thick she chewed at her lip nodded eased the latch up and opened the door a crack she saw a bluishwhite light flickering a ghost light hardly brighter than the shadows com must be battery powered i didnt think dont be stupider than you have to kiz this far out of course they had to have a com before dawn i told you less than thirty minutes ago kulyari stopped talking listened to a muted mutter kizra thought it was a mans voice but she couldnt be sure and she hadnt a clue what the words were no no one saw me theyre all asleep mutter mutter two of them on the blacks with a pack mule mutter mutter pmurr mutter mutter northeast toward patja mount kizra didnt have to hear any more aghilo she thought and right now kizra tapped at aghilos door tapped again swore under her breath come on woman come on aghilo opened the door chapa what are you doing down here and dressed like that let me in kizra whispered shes coming up the stairs i can hear her feet who kulyari all right aghilo stepped back so kizra could come in what are you talking about kizra stood by the door listening on second thought youd better go see that its her out there ive a feeling my word isnt worth much when it comes to the irrkuyon aghilo pressed her mouth shut she nodded true wait here leave the door open if you wish she snatched up a robe flung it around her shoulders and went out visiting a lover aghilos voice was peppered with scorn shameless one out of your bedroom this late get lost old woman keep your mouth shut or ill have you whipped for impertinence and dont think i cant do it kulyari laughed i dont have to explain anything to garaddys bastard she swept off laughing again aghilo came back she pulled the door shut sighed you have your witness shes putting it on under that arrogance shes scared oh really what is this about i woke up a little while ago nightmare i think but i dont remember anyway i was looking out the window and saw arring pirs crossing on the ferry someone else was watching once pirs and pmurr were across she took off it was kulyari she came down in the family garden and got into a room there i dont know what the room was but theres a com in it i cracked the door and heard her talking to someone on the com she was telling him i think it was a man about pirs where he looked to be going who was with him you know everything he didnt want to get out ah aghilo stripped the tie off her long plait began pulling the strands apart is there any way we can make her tell who it was she was talking to aghilo moved to her dressing table began brushing her hair her strokes full of nervous energy no she said the only one who could touch her is pirs matja allina no no you dont understand the way things are here she dropped the brush and twisted her long hair into a knot atop her head began shoving in hairpins each darting movement of her hand emphasizing a phrase of what she was saying shes the heirs daughter utilas he sent her here for fosteringonce he saw what pirs and allina were making of this place for fostering and to make trouble

what youre thinking you dont understand she has enough trouble without having to deal with you go on get matja allina was tired and redeyed she sat in the only armchair in her bedroom wrapped in a fleecy white robe with a bluegreen silk lining tinoopa knelt at her feet massaging them with a scented cream working the toes the muscles of her calves humming a placid soothing threenote tune the smell of the cream was strong in the room a sweetness with an acrid underbite after aghilo challenged her kizra finished kulyari went sweeping off in a snit so the matja said our precautions were useless hmm aghilo i saw wuraj in the infirmary yesterday didnt i yes hed tangled with a young lborrgha and had clawmarks here and there bonedeep some of them otherwise he wouldnt have bothered to

at her hair the sooner i can rest wuraj was a small wiry man with coarse gray hair in a braid that reached past his belt he braided his beard to match it hung in two tails down his front his eyes were a light yellowbrown narrow set in a weave of wrinkles one arm was heavily bandaged three ragged scabs raked down the side of his face matja allina frowned im sorry wuraj i hadnt realized how bad it

tucked the card in a belt pouch bring the roans to the kitchen gate and wait there for the jinasu and the rest of it she held out her hand bring him back whole wuraj michal for all our sakes she

packs and the rifles and bring them down to wuraj she grunted crossed her arms and bent over them no ah no hilo dont worry she gasped its not labor just kizra dropped to her knees pressed her hands against the active bulge of the baby sent calm ease reassurance felt the spasms relax under her palms matja allina straightened absently she patted kizras shoulder as she turned to aghilo go she said impatiently the sooner wuraj is on his way the sooner pirs will be safe kizra leaned out her window watched wuraj on the ferry riding one horse leading another with a small pack on its back the four tiny jinasu were there with him brown ghosts nearly impossible to pick out of the dark so many things she didnt understand about this place a man could send his daughter to his brothers house and expect her to well seduce his brother that same daughter could plot her uncles murder and rejoice in what she considered her cleverness i thought it was craziness when allina fussed about the danger to her baby and herself now when wuraj was across she turned away pulled on her boots and went down to breakfast after lunch matja allina went to bed and stayed there leaving tinoopa and aghilo to keep order and continue the work of the kuysstead kizra was forced to sit with her in the darkened bedroom playing the arranga for her singing now and then the songs shed picked up yesterday and on the trip here she was pleased that her memory was so good despite what someone had done to her head it was reassuring the day crept along now and then when matja allina let her stop playing for a while she pushed the drapes back and looked out one of the sitting room windows watching the chal and chapa move about the court below chattering knots of girls gossiping older women busy laughing serious none of them stuck away in a suffering eddy like this one where she was she envied them she was bored more than anything she was bored tinoopa crossed the court heading for the storage yard a covey of chattering maids trailing behind her she looked vigorous and contented even this far off kizra read a bursting energy the woman was enjoying her fight for authority using her cleverness and experience to get what she wanted some time later tamburra the kivkerrinite walked from the herb drying rooms and headed for the entrance to the womens living quarters she glanced up at the flee of the house as she walked by saw kizra watching her and then looked quickly away kizra scratched the inside of her elbow and wondered again what it was brought that woman to this place matja allina called her back into the bedroom play that thing you did for dinner last night her voice was fretful her face was flushed there was a shallow vertical painline between her brows this one matja allina she let the easy undemanding song drip from her fingers boring boring all of it stifling gods i want to i want she didnt know what she wanted except it wasnt this youre frowning what are you thinking matja allinas eyes caught what little light there was seemed to glow kizra shaman do you know something about pirs what is it tell me you have to tell me no matja allina of course not how could i i was just just thinking about what what worries you kizra blinked at her not even my own mind belongs to me she thought mutinously what to say what ah kulyari she said i was thinking about how disappointed shes going to be when the arring walks in what a snit shes going to throw she moved her shoulders that wasnt what bothered me its what shes going to do next after the arring walks in walks in yes so we must hope allina closed her eyes the brief spurt of energy draining from her matja ah what is it aghilo didnt want me to bother you but is there any way you can find out who kulyari was talking to little chapa its all right the matjas feverish intensity faded to a drowsy musing its no bother because i dont need to ask i know who she was calling rintirry my loving brotherbylaw dear rintirry who is so very fond of his brother he tried to rape me as soon as he saw pirs wanted me she clicked her tongue hai kizra you listen so deeply its easy to say far too much pirs doesnt know about that no one knows i broke the bastards nose for him and he went away please if you say anything it will make more trouble than you can possibly understand all right matja allina closed her eyes go find gilli chal will you please then come back and tell me what kulyaris doing kizra knelt beside the bed her hands folded in her lap kulyari slept until just after the noon gong she went into the garden and pulled heads off flowers there until polyapo looked out saw what she was doing and scolded her back inside then kulyari hung around the great hall when she thought no one was around she tried to get into the arrings study gilli chal says she had a screaming snit when she found out it was locked shes back in her room now trying on clothes changing her hair driving the maids till theyre ready to bang her on the head and stand the consequences thats it polyapo do you think shes involved in this if i had to guess no theres no tension in her and shes not um kizra sneaked a glance at allina to see how far she dared go matja allina narrowed her eyes to slits her mouth twitched and shes not intelligent enough to hide it well yes kizra got to her feet its time you should eat something matja allina you know what tinoopa said small meals but frequent do you want me to ring the kitchen no i dont want much a cup of broth and a roll will do just a minute then kizra crossed to the fireplace took the lid off the brazier and set on the covered pot of broth she put a fresh roll in a small dutch oven then leaned against the bricks of the chimney while she waited for the food to heat chapa kizra come here help me to sit up bring the extra pillows will you time passed matja mina drowsed kizra went back to watching what was happening in the court below to wondering what her dreams meant to speculating if she and tinoopa would get what allina promised them to yearning for release from this tedium it always came back to that she loathed being shut away from what was happening it was as bad as being in jail at least according to bertems tales or tinoopas boredom and being jerked about by anyone that had the power to jerk and even if i ran where do i run to i dont know who i am or where i belong i dont know anything how can i do anything the day ended finally that night kizra sweated through more nightmares worse than any night before this she remembered bits each time she woke giant spiders with intelligent eyes and orange pompoms where their ears would be if spiders had ears relentless implacable she shuddered with horror when she saw them crashing in a small fast ship going down and down and nothing she could do about it dying all the pain and emptiness of dying women dancing thin etiolate all bone and skin and huge dark eyes eerily unexpectedly lovely creatures that brought with them the anguish of loss she knew why in the dream but couldnt remember later a redhaired woman weeping for a lost child a grief kizra shared as if it were her own she knew her in the dream knew her like a sister a deeply loved sister but when she woke there was only the face and the hair the long fine red hair two cats died and a man cried out in anguish and rage a lion man she shared that anguish till the dream faded nightmare followed nightmare until she dropped into a hardfisted sleep that left her as tired when she struggled out of bed as she was before she lay down matja allinas estate office on the ground floor was small and intimate with a bow window looking out into the family garden she sat in a cushioned armchair drawn up to a swaylegged table her hands were folded on the table and she was listening to a dispute over the distribution of cloth polyapo stood beside the door despising everyone in the room for allowing the dispute to happen sitting on a low bench in the bow window halfhidden behind a carved and pierced screen of some dark rich local wood kizra watched the ulyiniks long nose twitch and thought if it were up to her everyone involved in this would be whipped until they knew their place and left to go without cloth until they were naked and properly grateful for anything they were given the promise matja allina the daughters promise i want the bolt for lahirras wedding blue cloth fine blue not just ordinary tirrk for all girls when they wed by your word o matja the weavemistress snorted and you got it luwlu chal on winterstart you signed for it and carted it off and you know it can i help it if ngwaral gets hisself clawed by some filthy lborrgha and dies two months later leaving my lahirra a sorrowing widow whats a mother to do ignore her child once shes wed and let everything after go as it goes the promise is made when a daughter weds cloth for her dowry so lahirra is going to wed with ntrurr next week so shes due another bolt aghilo slipped through the door and stood beside polyapo looking agitated kizra rubbed at her chin i wonder whats up matja allinas eyes flicked to aghilo then she returned to her absorption in the speeches of the two women huh the weavemistress said the way the girl goes through husbands she should open a clothing store lahirra has her dower all she has to do is carry it down two doors when she moves in with ntrurr and take better care of this one so he doesnt die on her hard hard youre so hard nunnikura chal hows my little girl to blame she didnt send her man out there to get chewed up she burst out sobbing and keening producing more noise than tears matja allina knocked gently against the table quiet luwlu chal answer me a question or two if you please no nunnikura chal you can speak later if you so desire luwlu sniffed wiped her nose on her sleeve dipped a curtsey and waited luwlu chal how much of the first bolt remains the woman looked sullen but she didnt dare protest about half she said after a long silence while she was pretending to remember matja allina it is certainly no fault of lahirra that her first husband met with an angry lborrgha and if the time between her weddings were somewhat longer there would be no question about providing a second dower bolt nunnikura you will measure the length remaining of the first dower bolt and complete it so lahirra goes to her second wedding with the same gift she had at the first and given the tragic circumstances that make the second wedding necessary you will also add a length of wedding cloth fine green for the twice married bride and a length of lace for her wedding shift from my own stores do you consent nunnikura chal do you consent luwlu chal nunnikura weavemistress compressed her mouth in a straight line she didnt approve but she wasnt about to say so she nodded dipped through a perfunctory curtsy luwlu chal had a discontented look but she too nodded and curtsied her acceptance then let it be done nunnikura chal and done within the hour i thank you for your courtesy ychala amurra bless blessed be nunnikura said she glared at luwlu chal who hastily added her blessed be then both left the room what is it aghilo you have something to tell me matja allinas voice was cool but there was more than a little fear behind the mask aghilo glanced at polyapo unwilling to give her message in the presence of the older woman matja allina sat back in the chair dropped her hands on the arms where they were hidden from the other two women ulyinik polyapo you will help me greatly if you would see how many supplicants remain outside and have one of the girls you trained so well make a list of names and when possible a short summary of each complaint will you do this for me please good amurra bless blessed be amurra polyapo resented furiously being pushed out like this and given what she considered a makework task but she knew also that her place here hung by a thread and that thread was the matjas good will so she went as soon as the door clicked shut matja allina brought her hands up clutched at the tables edge pirs theres word no allina its early yet this is almost as bad she looked down at her hands touched the ring of keys at her belt i was in the family garden setting up the screens for your tea i heard glass breaking it was kulyari she was trying to get into the study i had her taken back to her room there was a cut on her wrist i used that as an excuse loujary was with me you know to shift the screens he had to be rough with her i understand if she complains ill back you go on yes well i saw the summons light blinking on the com i expect kulyari did too and thats why she tried to break in anyway i thought it was someone calling her and it might help if i saw who it was but it wasnt for her it was tribbi you remember my half sister the one who keeps aynti tingger yes well she kept trying to get us but with the door locked there was no one to answer the com she wanted to warn us your fatherbylaw the artwa arring cagharadad flew in yesterday with his bodyguards and bedwarmer and rintirry he stayed there overnight left this morning hell be here sometime before sundown matja allina looked down at her hands they were shaking she flattened them on the table there was no color at all in her face how very convenient she said that rintirrys here when the news comes about pirs how very very convenient she sat silent a moment staring at nothing before sundown well she forced herself upright i doubt theres a chance pirs will be back tonight even if wuraj comes up with him and nothings happened she lifted a hand let it fall a curious halfhearted gesture as if she were too weary to finish what shed started aghilo find tinoopa quickly warn her about this descent on us as soon as youve done that go see cook you know what well want were not supposed to know hes coming but wed better cater to his tastes as closely as we can the supplicants its nearly teatime anyway tell polyapo to send them away as soon as the list is finished um you know which servants to put with the artwa no maids hell have to make do with the bedwarmer hell bring with him um as soon as the skimmers down send word round to the women that rintirrys come no girl between eight and fourteen is to show her face or anything else as long as hes here they know him but i want to make sure warn tinoopa about him tell her if polyapo tries to send a girl to serve any of that party she should take care it doesnt happen she can use any means she needs to ill back her warn her to stay as inconspicuous as possible for her own sake let polyapo do the greeting and appear to give the orders tell her my fatherbylaw cant abide dark faces hed have her whipped on the slightest suspicion of insolence that shes breathing and on her feet would be enough be as frank with her as you think useful i wont ask what you say to her so anything more good go luv quickly she watched aghilo scurry out then she scrubbed her hand across her mouth kizra come here kizra brought the arranga with her lifted it to play but let it fall when matja allina shook her head i have to say to you what i told aghilo to say to tinoopa stay in the background as much as you can i wont be able to hide you not with kulyari making mischief she knows the artwas she twisted her face in a brief fastidious grimace i said he cant abide dark faces thats not the whole truth child he wont have them around himexcept in his bed and the more reluctant they are the better in his eyes this isnt rape because they are beasts and beasts are put on this world to use as one pleases but dont worry child youll be safe enough she rested her hand on the bulge of her son pregnant women are indulged especially when they carry sons if i have a fancy to keep you with me he cant demand you and rintirry has to keep his hands to himself be thankful for that unless he can catch you alone somewhere after theyre settled in i want you to sleep in my sitting room never leave me when youre out of it i dont want trouble not now ayamurra if only pirs were here she sighed shifted among the pillows then grunted as pain seized hold of her kizra hurried around the table set her hands on minas neck and did again what shed done before transferred calm and relaxation so that the tension in the woman untied itself and flowed away and took with it the pain she stepped back do you want me to call the men to take you upstairs you know youll need all the strength you have once the artwa comes no im not going upstairs not yet its lovely outside well have tea in the garden as i planned matja allina touched her face looked at the damp on her fingertips from the sweat that was beading her brow yes get the lists from polyapo as soon as theyre finished you can read them to me later it was warm in the garden the high mud walls kept the worst of the wind off the late afternoon sun was still high and bright enough to flush the perfume from the flowers and draw shimmers of heat off the pond the fountains glittered and murmured jiltis and flying jejantis hummed and skritched the new green leaves on the trees whispered together the flowering plums shed pale pink and white petals that landed on the grass and stirred again as ingva and yla played with their cats and chased each other in endless games of tag and catch matja allina was stretched in a lounge chair sipping at a cup of broth when she remembered to drowsing in the sun listening to her children play and to the flowing music of the arranga a maid was massaging her feet the screens aghilo had set about her captured the sunlight and the warmth while the sorrowing willow beside her provided enough shade to ease her eyes tinoopa was handling the house there was nothing she could do to avert the trouble coming at them so she set aside her troubles and let herself enjoy the afternoon kizra was bored she hated that nothing music she was tinkling from the arranga she hated the bugs crawling on her arms miggas and tarynas and a dozen other kinds of pest she hated the willow pollen getting in her eyes and up her nose not quite making her sneeze and she was cold she was in deep shadow close beside the trunk of the willow no sun for her and if she stopped playing to slap at the bugs or scratch she got a fratchetty complaint from the matja there was one blessing in all this she didnt have to think she was getting tired of questions and ghosts and wondering a small graygreen lizard ran up the trunk she caught the movement from the corner of her eye but didnt really see what it was until he was almost nose to nose with her she stared at him and he stared back loose graygreen skin tiny orange eyes shock jolted through her she dropped the arranga cried out the lizard ran away and she fainted she was out only a moment opened her eyes to find the girls bending anxiously over her what is it what happened ingva clutched at her arm shook it why did you do that kizra blinked winced at the pain in her head shed hit a knotty root when she went down moving stiffly she sat up a lizard she said her voice was hoarse saying the word sent more shocks through her it scared me lizard ingva got to her feet lizard wont hurt you she flung over her shoulder ylie come on let the ol fraidycat lay there i got the mocsoc come see come see stomach cramping black spots with tailed halos swimming dizzily in front of her kizra pushed up onto her knees she didnt understand what was happening to her she could feel the matjas anger the childrens scorn the indifference of the housemaids standing like plants in the backgroundshe could feel out beyond them the life in the compound busy busy life everything enormously brighter stronger hammering at her as if some sort of filter had been peeled from her brain it was too much she knelt hunched over clutching at herself nearly out of control too much too much matja allina called her servingmaids to her with the girls help she sat up jili arluga she said take the girls inside please be quiet ingva you and your sister do what youre told i dont want argument from you daughter she sat silent as the subdued girls trailed out after their tutor followed by their serving maids then she passed a hand across her face chapa kizra get yourself together and come here her voice snapped with irritation and impatience and think about what youre going to tell me i dont want stupid stories about lizards you hear me yes kizra forced the word out as she groped about for the arranga when she found it she wrapped her hand in the carrystrap and got shakily to her feet she moved from the shadow of the willow withes and stopped at the foot of the lounge chair well i dont know what i said was true matja allina a lizard ran up the tree and frightened me i dont know why it did something in my head i suppose another shudder passed along her body i see with her maids help matja allina swung her legs off the lounge and struggled to her feet ill need you to play for dinner this evening will you be able to yes of course kizra spoke quickly but her voice was still shaking and there was an icy knot in her stomach not of course old disciplines kicking inkizra was one of her charges and due a certain level of considerationmatja allina suppressed her irritation you need rest she frowned at kizra eyes moving from the beading of sweat on kizras face to the tight clutch of her hands on the arranga i think yes i will authorize a hot bath for you soak a while rest in your room ill want you with me an hour before dinner so we can lay out the program youll stay in your room until i send for you yes of course kizra curtsied stepped aside to let allina walk heavily past there was a coppery taste in her mouth the taste of groveling gods shadow youre a worm shadow she shivered again slipped the arrangas carrystrap over her shoulder and went inside dyslaera blood magic azram paced from the ventilation grate to the doorgrid turned and went back back and forth back and forth glancing each time at kinefray sitting on one of the plank beds kinefrays ears moved restlessly his eyes blinked a muscle at the corner of his mouth twitched erratically two hours ago hed walked into the cell sat down he hadnt said a word since azram sighed stopped in front of his cousin fray kinefrays eyes glazed over he stared past azram with no further reaction azram extruded the claws on his right hand touched the tips to the side of kinefrays face running in a shallow arc from the corner of his eye to his jaw just below his mouth fray listen to me kinefray moved slightly retreating from the prick of the claws after a minute he blinked hissed a threat azram stepped back scowled as kinefrays face went empty again oh fray he said all his grief in those two words i dont know what to do savant speaking to notepad it begins to look like weve managed to break the very close kinbond between this subject f native name kinefray and the control subject a native name azram unfortunately this seems to require large and frequently repeated doses of cpfsub combined with levastrayin and trace quantities of the ananile called dragons blood the result does not justify the expense for anything but purposes of research the rapid metabolizing of these drugs by this species complicates the study in addition there seems a slow deterioration in the physical wellbeing that we have so far been unable to check especially when this

during forcible administration of a new drug series see flake ddy for details of incident and autopsy azram rolled up his left sleeve working with meticulous care getting the folds smooth and even he cut a deep scratch in his forearm watched the blood ooze out holding his arm level he got up crossed to kinefrays side of the cell and dropped beside him kinefrays ears twitched as the blood smell reached him but he didnt look around just stared at the dusty gray floor azram watched the dark red liquid round into beads on his fur when he thought there was enough of it he wiped his hand across it in a continuation of the same motion he smeared the blood across his cousins face kinefray screamed lunged up and leaped at azram azram ducked away circled him batting at the hands reaching for him

recommendation considering the expense the loss of subject material and the ineffectiveness of the drug treatments this series of experiments should be brought to an end we should concentrate on more efficient ways of acquiring information we will also need more subjects for experiment though the acquisition of that young female lost with subjects s native name ossoran and fy native name feyvorn cost us a number of agents and proved useless in the end i believe we should attempt to acquire more females it might also be useful to build up a stock of prepubescent males the one thing we must do is locate additional sources of dyslaera spotchals is becoming difficult about our presence there according to reports from our assets in the records department this is due to the continuing agitation of one digby of excavations ltd and one miralys toerfeles of family voallts and director of company voallts korlatch the abduction of that female has stirred even the most lethargic of the spotchallix authorities to action note our security seems suspect it is as yet uncertain whether the toerfeles miralys knows who took her people however the suggestion is that digby has discovered what happened at koulsnakkos hole how this is a question that must be answered shadith kizra on the farm the skimmer landed in the main court pulverizing a number of the paving stones taking up most of the open space on the side facing the house a ramp unfolded as soon as it was down and stable the artwa arring angakirs cagharadad came marching out and stood before the stairs like the earth was his but beneath his notice rintirry lounged behind him looking bored and beautiful perched in the opening behind the oriel window above the great doors kizra watched rintirry look around and decided allina had splendid judgment when it came to men he straightened suddenly his eyes fixed on something across the court kizra pressed her face against the glass swore under her breath tamburra the kivkerrinite was standing in a patch of sunlight that turned her hair to fire emphasized the translucence of her skin the perfection of bone and body posing for him gods thats trouble that is the artwa was a tall lean man with an abundance of coarse white hair and a vigorous white mustache his face was bright red his skin rough as a rutted road he glared at the silent facade and twitched his long nose everything was stilled waiting the great doors opened and matja allina came out leaning on aghilos arm polyapo and kulyari a halfstep behind her she stood quiet a moment at the top of the stairs looking down at the artwa a flutter of her fingers summoned polyapo to her side with both women helping her she came down to greet him she stopped five paces away from him placed her palms together bowed her head then let polyapo and aghilo lower her to her knees while they prostrated themselves before the artwa matja allina rounded her back brought her hands up palm to palm pressed her thumbs against her brow and waited to be acknowledged the old man spoke matja ghanar rinta is honored matja allina chanted in the tonal version of the local langue a formal singsong that her voice made into music artwa arring angakirs procagharadad amurra bless thee and thine this house and all in it are thine what is thy pleasure artwa arring in the cloudless pale blue sky a single raptor glided in wide circles over the kuysstead and precisely on cue gave its wild eerie call then went swooping off after something kizra couldnt see she pressed her hand over her mouth to stifle the giggles that threatened to burst out of her nervous gigglesthough the scene had gone comical on her there was still a soupcon of fear in it get up get up girl the artwa said a heavy geniality in his loud voice im an easy man you know these formalities he waved a hand then scowled wheres my son got his nose stuck in a book somewhere or is he so grand these days he cant come to welcome his old father with polyapo and aghilo boosting her matja allina got to her feet artwa arring angakirs there was a raid on one of the outer pastures arring pirs has gone with guide and guard to look into the matter if he had known you were coming sar of course he would have postponed his departure long enough to greet you if you will enter your house sar i have set the servants readying the honor suite for you and your household will you take some wine and cakes and rest yourself a while he nodded graciously and strode past her halfrunning up the steps then striding into the house rintirry strolled after him he reached with languid grace toward matja mina as if he intended to draw his hand across her belly she didnt lift a hand to stop him simply looked at him with calm contempt rintirry laughed at the matja it was meant to be a taunting laugh but it didnt quite come off he waggled his fingers at her and went sauntering up the steps kizra ran her fingers through her hair hurried back to her room there were two tables at the end of the great hall the high table where the men sat and the lower one for the women the high table was in a large curtained alcove raised a good two meters off the floor the candles in the torcheres flickered in the drafts that wandered through the hall waking shimmers in the damascened clothofgold tiedrapes and a deeper sheen in the green velvet folds behind the gold the rug was the color of fresh blood the table a dark tightgrained wood the dinnerware silver with gold wire laid into it in a series of interlocking double spirals the wine in the crystal goblets was oxblood and there were yellow and white and blue flowers in oxblood vases artwa angakirs wore viridian and gold a heavy gold chain about his neck set with emeralds turquoise and chrysoprase rings on all his fingers with more emeralds in them green and gold were the family colors and much of the family wealth came from the emeralds found on caghar rinta the gold in its streams and hills and the pockets of turquoise that kept turning up in the flickering candlelight he was magnificent an old king stupid as a rock vain and selfish but an impressive presence when presence was all you needed rintirry lounged beside the artwa in a smaller chair dressed in a goldcrusted crimson velvet tunic with wide oversleeves trimmed in white fur they fell back to show the black sleeves of his undertunic a silky knit that hugged his muscular forearms his only jewel was a single earring a black opal teardrop hanging like dark fire from his left ear the candlelight played games with his bright hair and gave an illusion of strength to a face that was a sculptors dream kizra sat in shadows on the second level concealed from the tables by a carved pierced screen six panels of polished wood hinged together and zigging across the small stage she was playing musical wallpaper again waiting for the dinner to start the double doors opened and matja allina walked into the light as onto a stage a queen to more than match the power of the old king waiting on the dais tall and slender graceful despite the heaviness of the child she wore a dress of royal blue damask high waisted and full in the skirt not hiding her pregnancy but diminishing it her hair was braided into a regal knot with a chain of aquamarines and silver twisted through the silvergilt plaits a wide necklace of beaten silver and aquamarines filled in the scoop neck of the dress the pale greenish blue of the stones almost a match for her eyes the sleeves of the dress were narrow fitting close to her arms with wide wristlets of aquamarines and silver made to match the necklace and the heavy earrings she wasnt pretty like kulyari following very much in her shadow not beautiful either with her wide full mouth and angular bones in a room full of women youd look at her first and if you looked away youd come back to her a sharp and ironic intelligence vigorous moral force tightly controlled passion like a perfume invisible but potent angakirs was leaning forward his weight on his forearms his body tense he was watching allina intently a glitter in his eyes hating her and wanting her with about equal intensity behind her screen kizra used one arm to wipe the sweat off her face while she kept the tinkle tune going with her other hand if they got through this night without disaster she was going to be very much surprised after a quick lift of his head when he heard the doors open rintirry lounged gracelessly in his chair and stared at his plate doing his best to ignore the women hate as strong as the artwas came off him like smoke hate and desire he tried to rape me at my betrothal feast thats what the matja said i thought she was um exaggerating but i sure as hell believe her now matja allina crossed the hall and came up the stairs without help the other women trailing after her mostly unnoticed kulyari glanced repeatedly at rintirry but he was so busy pretending to ignore the matja he didnt have time for her when she realized this her smile lost its glow her movements were angular with rage for the first time kizra felt some sympathy for her these last few years couldnt have been easy there was angakirs blaming allina for alienating pirs his favorite before the marriage and seeing her as a failure as a wife since all her sons had been stillborn there was utilas the heir jealous of pirs and willing to do anything that would injure him as long as he could do it without his fingers showing there was mingas the third son an old suitor gone sour he wanted to see allina reduced to poor relation and presumably available for seduction and there was rintirry the youngest who wanted anything he could get his hands on whatever he had to do to get it all of them urging her tempting her sending her here to ghanar rinta to seduce her uncle and get rid of allina it must have taken her less than a day to discover how hopeless that was take an ambitious and shrewd girl put her where ambition was thwarted and shrewdness was useless no wonder she wanted pirs dead and allina dispossessed and now it was obvious that rintirry had no eyes for her only for the matja matja allina bowed then let aghilo help her into her chair she lifted the silver bell beside her plate rang it and the meal began male servants sweeping in with platters of meat and all the rest of it kizra laid the wallpaper noddling to rest and began the program that allina had laid out for her he likes the old epics the matja said youve learned something of the gharadion youll begin with that it doesnt matter that you dont know the words you wouldnt sing it anyway he wouldnt stand for a woman singing that or anything else not at dinner as soon as the first serving is finished ill send impajin around to you hell do the singing hmm and paynto hes fair with a flute knows all the old songs after the gharadion hell take the lead you can improvise around him give some depth to the music hes pedestrian at best hes loyal though and hes got the ear if not the talent hell be happy enough to have you there distribute the blame if any the praise will come to him not you he knows that the meal went on with murmurs and the clink of silver against silver the sounds of glass and china payntos flute and kizra on the arranga blending and moving apart and impajins rough tenor louder than both the candles flickered the colors shimmered shifting light and shadow picked out texture and sheen it was like a brocade print gorgeous and rare and spoiled for kizra by the constant undercurrents of hate and fear anger and disgust tinkle toot lets get this thing over with the door slammed open and pirs came striding in there was a bloodstained bandage on his head and another on his arm his face was so tight with rage that the bones seemed to be leaping against the skin he nodded perfunctorily at his father went bounding up the steps to the second table nodding tightly at his wife grabbed hold of kulyaris arm and jerked her from the chair ignoring her protests he took her up the short flight of stairs to the main dais flung her to the floor in front of angakirs i will not have this thing in my house she called my moves to my enemy and i was brought near to death she is traitor to the blood kulyari was so startled by all this that at first she could only gasp and struggle she was frightened now no no lies no she cried she pushed up onto her knees its lies all of it i didnt the blood no without trying to get up she swung round and held out her arms toward rintirry tell them rintirry shoved his chair back came round the table kulyari let her arms drop her mouth widened into a triumphant smile he caught hold of her hair jerked her head up and cut her throat traitors die thats what i say dyslaera news from home is better than a kick in the pants interrogation note drugs used instead of probe because subject r native name rohant ciocan of clan voallts tests in the dangerous zone

realm while providing as little useful information as possible subject i cant know uuuh absolutely but you can have my conjectures seyirshi attacked voallts korlatch viciously during the past year we were bombed and murdered by his agents forced into defending ourselves in any way we could necessarily this made us sensitive to all unexplained inquiries and intrusions you made me watch the incident with ossoran and feyvorn i saw the girl i knew her you got her from voallts your agents must have left traces behind voallts always defends itself from any attack and the best defense involves knowing

silence savant very well thats enough for today take him out put him on a threeday water fast after that well see rohant stretched out on his plank bed closed his eyes hed tiptoed round the truth and got away with it shadow was out there somewhere her and kikun it had to be them somehow miralys was well the fear was gone that sick emptiness thatd been rotting at his guts since hed seen young kalaksi in that cage miralys was well and tending to business and id better be he thought shadow i dont have her gift but maybe something like it he remembered what happened between her and him when she mindrode sassa twoway flow there maybe we never thought it was possible the tie yes the bloodbond with the tiebeast but mindriding i dont know well its time to start thinking the impossible i certainly havent anything better to do these next few days fishing in a smaller sea kikun and autumn rose troll for the one who knows kikun came yawning onto the bridge and stood a moment blinking at the woman in the pilots chair autumn rose was wearing dull brownishpurple trousers and an acid green tunic and shed dyed her hair an ashy brown her skin olivetan clicking his tongue and shaking his head he sauntered over to her rose youre a sight for sore eyes and if they werent sore before theyd be now she chuckled camouflage kuna you have yours thiss mine tlee scratching at the skin folds under his chin he frowned at the green and blue and brown and streaky white of the world taking up most of the screen so tell me about that rose grimaced a twist of her wide mouth a quick wrinkling of her long nose well i have an idea or two look she played a moment with the sensor pad talking while she worked barakaly came here about once a year she clicked her tongue the man was a cretin you know he had the best blocks available installed in his kephalos then he goes and keeps his list of keys in this idiot antique desk in his quarters took me all of fifteen seconds to find the secret drawer he put his faith in once i had time to look around the place i mean there it was she paused frowned at the screen where a map was developing in one cell with images clustered about it of buildings and individuals and a sidebar slowly filling with data she made some changes then went on this old um thing just sitting there begging me to go poking about in it i found porno flakes and a bunch of crecards in different names and ah well never mind anyway there was this notebook with all you need to know to uncrunch his codes so ive been going through his personal records not a nice man barakaly lak dar chatty though i mean looks to me like he got kicks from telling about the things he pulled business and personal junk not a nice man oh no kikun lay back in the chair and let his eyes droop nearly closed absorbing what she was saying through skin as well as ears tone of voice and behindemotion everything she was saying through intonation as well as words thinking was for him a physical process sensual more than rational you say its omphalos responsible for this maybe yea maybe nay but one things sure barakaly doesnt know from omphalos not a word even in his twistiest files and if youd ve seen what hes got there youd know he must ve put everything in hes been to arumdam lots of times though seems theres a black house there that provides victims to order she coughed grimaced again all i can say is its no wonder he was one of ginnys clients anyway its a mess of a world every island its own nation and there are a furtzen lot of islands haeds theyre called she grinned youd think with that many heads around theyd have a little wisdom thrust on them but not so my friend not so the place is full of tiny wars whenever some local vaarlord gets an itch for someone elses land he whips up a war and tries to take it its worst in the south theres more land there more big islands subcontinents i suppose youd call them haemundas to the rummers dont look at me like that kuna thats what they say when theyre talking about each otheraccording to barakaly though i admit hes not a source id trust about anything sensitive well just have to wait and see anyway where was i ah good thing thats in the north she pointed to the city map the biggest city they have tos tous the landing fields there and its a freecity lots of strangers coming in and out offworlders too freetraders and types like barakaly in for the um amenities ive dug out the names of some contacts he had who might be useful they set up his stays at the black house and other little pleasures seems to me those are the types whod have the information we need to get at well call it omphalos what i think is we go in look over the ground go after these contacts take them question them and she shrugged thats as far as i can go now what happens after that depends on what we find out probably we scat for home and digby and miralys well need a small army if shadow and the others are here if they arent well we better go add our ignorance to the rest and see what we can do about it he blinked at her question nothing bloody luv even for digby i dont do torture but i picked better than i knew when i took this un barakaly has himself a nice little selection of head softeners drugs luv our targets theyll sing like baby birds when some of that stuff hits the blood as she started fiddling some more with the sensor pad there was a familiar rustle of feathers a scratch of feet kikun turned his head and stared into the corner beyond autumn rose gaagi was there his armwings folded tight against his sides his golden eyes wide and staring grandmother ghost was half behind him bent over peering around the wings snorting repeatedly because she was allergic to feathers she winked at him but didnt say anythingfor which he was profoundly grateful every time she opened her mouth she dropped him in trouble so deep he thought hed never see day gaagi spread his arms wide caught grandmother in the face with a feathered membrane and left her sputtering with annoyance he began signing his supple fingers moving so fast that kikun had difficulty following him journey of many days many sorrows hurt and hunger tedium and terror it finishes here yes it finishes here but not this journey nor the next come home nayol hanee come home o taanilcay or die here and know the dinhastoi do die with you rubbing at her nose grandmother ghost pushed past gaagi who faded into a black film then was gone she shoved her little bulldog face at kikun waggled her crooked forefinger at him her voice was a mosquito whine in his minds ear aya aya get you home or i be a fly on your backside biting get you that girl and leave off this interfering in foreign hashendilis you got your own to worry over hah i give you till you finish thisn then you wont know what sleep is you hang off any longer hah ya and she was gone kikun sighed none of that was any help if that was all his gods and ghosts could do for him tlee when grandmother got mad she had a bite like a borer fly he rubbed his shoulder grimacing at the memory that wasnt the only place shed got him either messages autumn rose sounded irritated what oh no nothing to do with this that wasnt quite true but he didnt intend to spend his time explaining grandmother or gaagi either rose somethings occurred to me what are you going to do with the ship if youd been listening to me sorry she snorted really what i was saying is i dont want to leave her parked in orbit this is a free traders market which means basically that anything left lying around unguarded is fair game bunch of pirates even the best of em not putting them down you understand id probably do the same given the chance what im saying a sweet ship like this without a watch on board is gone even without you to clue em kuna the average trader round here would get past security not even breathing hard and i dont want to put her down at the landing field too many noses around wondering what your business is and too expensive anythings too expensive except for my crecard im about broke and barakaly doesnt carry cash at least i didnt find any theyre used to traders slipping in doing their business and scooting no ones going to pay much attention to us ive picked a place to stash the ship see that isthmus no settlers and close enough to where we have to go the air was fresh and sweet theyd come down through a rainstorm into a mountain dawn and when kikun emerged and looked around crystal drops clung everywhere picking up the sunrise glittering red and gold and brilliant white the local life was already recovering from the intrusion there were grunts and whistles and a sudden soar of melody then the pattern repeated with changes he rode the lift down and walked into the middle of the meadow absorbing shape and color sound and smell relaxing into this new world the reprocessed air on the ship was clean and properly humidified even faintly perfumed with touches of leaf and flowerchoice air one might say pampered air despite this it smelled of metal to him as artificial as ginnys arm he breathed deeply and his soul expanded theyd landed on the narrow isthmus that was the spine connecting the north and south nodes of haemunda chajiari a sparsely populated area because the land was mostly vertical and stony interrupted with steep narrow fjords where cliffs dropped a hundred meters straight down into the ocean water the isthmus could support trees grasses and small mammals but a man would starve to death kikun chanted under his breath apologizing to the local life for the shock of the landing eyes watched from the treetops and the brush looked up at him from the grass not much fear here because no one came just an ordinary wariness he settled his backpack more comfortably leaned against a tree stump and waited the lift hummed again he turned autumn rose was coming down with her pack leaning against her leg and two miniskips like hobbyhorses resting by her feet help me kuna she said when the lift reached the ground i want to run west with the edge of dark and well miss it if we dont start soon he hauled his emskip onto the grass shaking the icy dew over his feet and over its metal surfaces then stood back watched the lift rise fold itself in until the skin of the skip was sealed tight once more west by north rose said she touched on the effect swung into the saddle set the tonc at two seven four corrected got it good lets go they reached the tola hills above tos tous with dawn pinking the sky ahead of them landed the emskips on a brushy ledge with a good ten meters of weathered stone rising above them and a drop over the lip of fifty meters straight down once the emskips were wrapped in a camouflaged groundcloth it would take some hard looking to spot them besides as rose said who in their right mind would look there despite the awkward weight of the pack kikun climbed the crumbly stone face like his looksake garden lizard going up a wall rose followed more slowly grumbling all the way she didnt like heights she wasnt going to have any skin left on her front or her hands besides she was freezing and starved there had to be a better way z toyff there had to be she reached up kikun caught her hand and helped her onto the flat above the cliff tos tous rambled around the curve of a wide lovely bay the city was a quilt of many colors all of them gray or brown thousands of small buildings gathered in haphazard clusters no streetif they were streets not merely gaps between adjacent buildingswent straight for more than a few meters lovely place anthill someone stepped on squashed all to hell and gone autumn rose unfolded the map shed had the kephalos print up for them looked from it to the city below thats the part we want she pointed there near the middle of the curve where most of the wharves and warehouses are um well be going through the main marketif were lucky enough and this is market day you should be able to collect quite a lot of coin do the best you can kuna we need the cash she chuckled nudged him with her elbow you should be about the best pickpocket alive with that talent of yours she sobered i can use my crecard in emergencies but id rather not i dont know who or whats watching readouts round here kikun sighed thats the third time youve said that rose i heard i heard nerves kuna always get em when im about to jump in something i dont know anything about she frowned over her shoulder at the eastern horizon where the tip of the sun was poking up a brilliant vermilion blob of light twenty kays we have to walk at least that well better safe than sorry come on lil liz lets go they reached the tos tous highroad as a line of plodding bullocks walked past two by two pulling carts piled high with raw leather and leather goods the smell lingering long after they rounded the bend ahead there was a young boy on the back of each left lead bullock whistling and tapping now and again at the withers of the pair stirring them back to a brisk walk when they threatened to slow to immobility these boys wore heavy bullhide trousers bright wool tunics slit fore and aft and long knitted scarves wrapped around their necks the ends fluttering along the bullocks sides they turned to stare at rose not at kikun of course they didnt notice him from large dark eyes in small brown faces their straight black hair blowing in the wind a man and woman sat on a bench inside the last of the carts he was stocky and bald and wrapped in a heavy overcoat he gave rose a single shrewd glance dismissed her and went back to watching his carts the woman wore an identical overcoat but added a shawl over abundant black hair twisted into a high knot she didnt bother looking at autumn rose her eyes were fixed on the back of the bullock boy she was frowning at him spitting words at the man beside her ten minutes later a line of heavily laden flats hitched together and pulled by a motorized tractor came rumbling along the road slowed to a sudden crawl as the tractor reached the last of the carts and couldnt go round because there was a caravan of large hairy beasts plodding north along the highway heading for the landing field autumn rose ran at the last of the flats pulled herself onto the bed it rocked under her and the hitch clanked loudly the flats rode on a single wheel and tilted at a heavy thought she waited erect on her knees until she was reasonably sure the trader hadnt noticed hed acquired a passenger then she settled between two bales leaned against a third and sighed with relief as she stretched her feet out she started made an exasperated spitting sound as kikun plopped down beside her and stayed present in a way he hadnt been for the past several miles one of these days im going to think im dreaming you lil liz and go not so quietly crazy an hour later the flats slowed again crawling through scrapshacks and garbage dumps on the rim of the city the dumps had a number of sluggishly burning fires producing a nosenumbing eyebiting smoke that drifted in a bluishyellow clots across the road people crawled like dungbeetles over the discarded paper rags and other junk half obscured by the smoke clouds grimly silent in their searches kikun fidgeted nervously his fingers moving in complex patterns rose suspected might be counterspells or something similar finally he slapped his hand on the bale beside him lets go rose now why not they slid down and strolled along behind the flats coughing as smoke blew over them keeping apart from the other walkers most of whom were scavengers going to or coming from their particular mounds of refuse the string of flats swerved to the side of the road a small horde of men came from a blocky building surrounding the flats while their leader waved a clipboard in the face of the trader driving the tractor you are being cleared for three flats he said you are having six that is going to cost you tusuk you are needing to read that thing again the trader roared at him six wheel it is saying is not saying nothing about flats you are needing to count em fool six wheel huh the guard brought the clipboard closer to his nose scowled at the papers on it wheel is meaning flat wheel is meaning wheel tusuk pounded his fist in his palm you are needing to count em he insisted six wheel i am having already paid the padj six wheel sixty peras he waved a paper heavy with purple wax in the guards face paid paid paid kikun nudged her come on come on rose its all very interesting but weve got things to do he pinched her arm lightly im ratcheting up the effect see you later the houses were stone on the first floor with narrow slits instead of windows the second floors and the rare third floors were wood with loopholed shutters over grilled windows about half of these windows were closed tight even through it was nearly an hour after noon these were wary secret houses ready to close up at too bold a touch the city had no walls according to the ships kephalos despite the wars that seem to be the natural state of things and constant raiding from wandering bands of pirates marauders whose only bases were huge junks that moved from island to island within loosely defined territories even villages had no walls walls involve a communal mindset walls are meant to protect groups and need many hands to build and staff it takes much less cooperation to build individual structures and arrange them so that the overlap provides mutual defense hence the angular semistreets also this world had been intermittently rediscovered by free traders and was a good market for what weapons the traders were willing to sell jump harnesses and pellet guns with exploding missiles made walls irrelevant it was more efficient to provide covering fire thats only a contributing factor kephalos said if there were none of these weapons around it would be the same thing these people simply have no love for walls they like mobility walls shut in as well as keep out she ambled along through hordes of children playing in these semistreets round games and ball games and complicated versions of tag games she remembered from her own childhood though shed spent more time watching than playing shut away from the street children by the walls of the chateau where her mother lived and worked she thrust her hands in her pockets and slowed yet more enjoying the clamor and confusion as she rounded one of the sharper angles she nearly stepped into a group of four guards dark green with crimson slashes and black leather accents beating a ragged man with their long whippy canes all five of them silent except for grunts and squeals one of the guards straightened glared at her hastily she cut out into the street and walked on bylike the rest of the locals getting out of there as fast as she could it was a warning a timely one reminding her to stop gawking and get to business as she passed from the semislums near the outskirts the traffic got thicker women with bales of cloth and fancywork balanced on their heads she admired and briefly envied the beauty of their walking the music of their voices they wore what looked to be long rectangles of patterned cloth wrapped in complicated folds about their bodies batik prints with a silky sheen some local fiber no doubt if i have time and some spare cash i should get me some lengths of that it looks like it feels wonderful against the skin men leaning forward and plodding along under backframes loaded with tubers and gourds sacks of flour and other staples handcarts and flats of the twowheeled variety with small noisy tractors pulling them she went round another angle and saw a clot of angry shouting armwaving locals and three guards trying to shift them away from an accident a tractor without its flats being raced along the thruway by a gang of boys had crashed into a handcart loaded with local chickentypes there were feathers everywhere blood squawking birds locals trying to get at the boys the guards pissed off at everyone a different set of guards these had dark crimson uniforms with green strips angled down the front one of them lost his patience entirely aimed his pellet rifle at the ground and blew a hell of a hole in the dirt the crowd scattered and the boys on the tractor ran off the only one left was the hapless soul with the handcart the guards hit him a few licks and went off leaving him to right his cart repack it and trundle it around the new hole in the middle of the road laughter and a satiric run on a stringed instrument of some kind rose looked around a street musician was standing in a doorway swaying a lutelike instrument cradled in his arms his face was flushed and he looked more than a little drunk after a moment he began to sing improvising a comic account of the accident describing the guards the careless boys and the hapless wouldbe trader in scurrilous terms picturing them as capering ludicrously about the hole in the road which he invested with enormous significance mostly sexual and wholly comical he had a crowd in moments laughing and clapping with him they threw coppers at the case open at his feet then someone yelled someone else took the lute from the singer and bustled him away and again the street was emptyuntil a squad of guards came marching around an angle behind them the vaarlord of this kehvar quarter ward neighborhood lolled on the seat of a groundcar his gorgeousness exhibited behind pelletproof glass as he looked over his subjects he was a big man with a seamed scarred face he didnt loll well cultural things she thought idleness as an attribute of greatness no as a toiler he was an abject failure there was too much animal vigor in the man his eyes moved over the houses and the people over her as one of the people with hard possessiveness his hair might be gilded his mustache and goatee stiff as gold wire his face enameled white his lips carmine but none of that mattered she watched him pass and shivered head down rose she told herself its survival time quiet went down the street with him the people around her going still as he passed prey beasts in the presence of a lion praying he wasnt hungry one of the guards following him looked at her interest sparking in his eyes he kept walking but he turned his head to watch her as he went along as casually as she could manage rose turned down one of the semistreets that crossed this one moved swiftly through several angles ran into a swarm of beggar children turned again to get away from them nearly ran into two guards at the boundary between two kehvars engaged in a bracing match that was clearly on the verge of breaking into a shooting war the locals were smarter or faster than her theyd gone for cover she backed off as quickly and quietly as she could ducked down another of the winding ways and made her way back to the main trafficflow street noises grew louder and less distinct voices of the child beggars and the street singers blending with drums and pipes and lutes there were more guards out new ones like wasps dark yellow tunics with black vee stripes down the front and back kephalos had said it would be so each vaarlord hired his own guards there was a highvaar over the whole city but he ruled more by consent than coercion he was a convenience a court of last resort the keeper of the peace he was the only one who could force the vaarlords to keep to their boundaries but he didnt meddle inside those boundaries which meant shed better keep her eyes wide open and stop dreaming her way through these streets come on rose you know the score get a move on the sooner youre under a roof the better the market was five acres of dust and noise several free traders were down onplanet looking for this and that trading what they had for as much as they could get a complex system of barter that both sides played out fullvoiced and passionately games both sides enjoyed to the max spice dealers and flower women dealers in rare oils and essences these turned the air into a soup of smells there were clothsellers and leather dealers used clothes men lampsellers knife women pot women chandlers and cosmetics dealers dealers in everything imaginable jugglers and jongleurs plied their varied trades with varying success painters and sculptors and a local brand of artists who produced a complex combination of both with a touch of performance thrown in these had their stands and their rivalries a maximum of confusion and stimulus rose sighed with pleasure and plunged into the middle of it tuluat the tukkaree that is being me buying and selling selling and buying come by come and see treasures for the trading come by come and see tuluat stopped his chant leaned across the table toward autumn rose big dark eyes warm and confiding and what can i be doing for you jonjabaey lovely jabai autumn rose smiled guilelessly back newly browned eyes warm and trusting the warmth as genuine as his why fentu tuluat perhaps you can i have a few trinkets she sighed that have sad memories attached i hate to lose them but a break is a break and time heals wounds perhaps youd like to look at them the blessing of the tanadewa time and its healing tuluat shook out a square of black velvet smoothed it on the table in front of him do be letting me see autumn rose took her gleanings from the ship and set them with slow care onto the cloth a ring with a starstone slightly chipped an antique chronometer in a nicked and battered gold case a fingerstone of tongjok jadeite in the form of a smiling fat frogga an escalari earbob its dangles carved from hardalwood and set with fossil amber and half a dozen similar small but valuable items when she finished the serious bargaining began autumn rose weighed the coins in her left hand shook her head and ran them through the portable assayer shed found in barakalys antique desk she clicked her tongue short tuluat lovely striking but theres too much base metal in the gold i think another ema and two silvers what are they ah peras will make up the difference he shrugged grinned and handed the coins over without protest now if you are liking to sell that little gadget i am offering hmm a nice sum say hmm emas no no i dont think so she tucked the assayer back in her belt pouch flickered her fingers at him youve made enough from me today he shrugged again laughed so so i will be having it within the week anyway and cheaper at that unless you prove more alert than i am thinking jonjabaey lovely jabai he turned away flung out his hands tuluat the tukkaree that is being me buying and selling selling and buying come and see come and see treasures for the trading come and see come and see you are being a free trader jonja rose started cursed under her breath the guard had come out of nowhere was suddenly pacing beside her he wasnt one of those in the market he had a combination of green with purple diamonds and black slashes that was eyeblinding and surprised her because she couldnt imagine him fading into shadow no way tuluat just might be right im not into this yet no she said just a traveler where do you be heading uh oh she thought i hope this isnt what it looks like just ambling around seeing what there is to see she said mistake she thought i shouldnt ve answered in the first place i dont know i dont know one thing i do know i dont like the smell coming off him there is not being much worth looking at round here better you are letting me show you a place i am knowing right she thought just come alonga you huh no way skinkhead she didnt say anything just kept walking looking straight ahead if she couldnt handle this jerk she shouldve stayed away best if she could just lose him some way a long file of women came walking toward her baskets on their heads they were laughing and talking walking with willow grace beyond them there were several handcarts and a tractor pulling a line of flats trundling along at a crawl beside the carts other flats and handcarts and oxcarts were coming from behind her when the women got close enough if she broke away suddenly cut around them didnt get run over by a tractor with a reasonable amount of luck she could get lost before the guard made up his mind what he was going to do she risked a glance at him stopped walking her mouth hanging open the guard was sinking to his knees folding down with a surprised look melting from his face a small graygreen figure in a graygreen shipsuit had him by the elbows and was easing him down so that he didnt bounce she looked at him and remembered z toyff kikun he hissed at her flickered his long fingers impatiently gesturing at her to get on let him deal with this right lil liz she swung round and strolled off the incident immediately wiped from her mind along with kikun she moved through a double dogleg found herself in the kind of place she hadnt seen before a green space grass and trees and a small fountain in the middle and behind that a graceful columned structure that was the antithesis of every other building in the city open and airy white marble with insets of colored stones in repeating patterns like those in the cloth the women wore three women were dancing on the grass three women drummers squatted beside the fountain along with a flute player and a woman crouched over an angular stringed instrument plucking at it with a metal pick like a teardrop a ninth woman sat crosslegged beside the walkway murmuring blessings as passersby dropped coins in the wooden bowl in front of her when rose got close enough she saw that the woman was blind there were terrible scars on her face and one hand was mutilated three quarters cut away with only the little finger and a stub of thumb remaining the blind woman lifted her head as rose walked past i am smelling blood she cried out i am smelling danger a demon is walking among us embarrassed and annoyed rose walked faster muttering to herself very impolite commenting on visitors to their faces what about a little friendly hypocrisy haah she walked quickly on constrained to a steady pace because she didnt want to look like she was running though she would have run if anyone had done more than stare at her everyone around stared at her blind bitch what right had she got saying things like that you want demons lady look closer to home haah a few doglegs on she stopped sniffed sea air all right where ah that way now rose find a place you can go to ground then well see well see autumn rose stood on the walkway and examined the house another white card in another brass and glass case rooms twenty kuries the night one pera the week the rumach was as shabby as the rest shed looked at so far with worn weathered shakes on the upper floors and salt stains on the shutters but there was a vigorous vine growing about the door with trumpetshaped crimson blooms nodding in the brisk wind off the water behind her water glittering between two warehouses on the far side of a space that was more like a street than any shed seen in this place its form dictated by the waters edge one line of buildings away she considered the rumach the flowers were nice the touch of color appealed to her it was the first shed seen on the outside of any house she curled her toes inside her boots there was a burning on her heel where a blister had burst she knew it had she could feel skin moving with each step goerta brite if this rumacha is marginally less a sleaze than the other oofnarcs ive talked to so far thisll do she climbed the short flight of stairs tugged at the staghoof that served both as bellpull and signifier the woman who opened the door was tall and lean with a cloud of tightly curled white hair and a face carved from dark chocolate offworlder and female rose sighed with relief id like one of those rooms youre advertising she said ill be here several weeks rose shut and locked the door tossed the key on the bed shrugged out of the backpack and dropped it on the floor next to a large overstuffed chair with a blue throw on it sewn from the silky cloth shed seen in the clothing of many of the women she yawned threw herself into the chair and sat a moment running her hands along and along the padded arms relishing the cling and slide of the brilliantly colored material then she bent jerked off her boots tossed them aside and scrubbed her feet back and forth on the rug braided from more of that cloth green and red and purple and bright blue the room was shabby and well used but clean and comfortable and pleasant on the eyes furnished by someone who had a love for color and the strength of personality to force order out of exuberance there was a saggy double bed with crisp white sheets and a pile of quilts a table beside the bed with a lamp and a blotter and stylus a ladderback chair pushed in under it next to the table was the rooms only window deeply recessed with a cushioned window seat built atop a chest kikun was sitting there nested among the pillows rose gasped blinked hello lil liz she said finally um cant you fix it so you dont do this to me every time i could drop dead with a heart attack the folds of skin on kikuns face shook with silent laughter rose unlatched her belt pulled it from around her tossed it on the bed with the key i picked up ten emas two hundred peras and a handful of kuries for the junk i brought off the ship how much did you get i havent counted it yet lets see he dumped his sac on the cushion began arranging the coins hmm one hundred coppers to one silver one hundred silvers to one gold right what kephalos set the assayer to he swept the coins back into the sac announced the total fifty emas three hundred peras and about a hundred kuries and a handful of offworld coins no telling what theyre worth i dont recognize any of them she yawned z toyff im tired hungry too but i dont feel like moving trailfood in your pack i know ill dig it out in a moment kuna you going to be all right here this doesnt look to be a good world for outsiders and youre more outside than most he shrugged ill get along well take care id rather have a disappearing dinhast than a decaying corpse she yawned a third time i think ill get some sleep its been a long day tomorrows soon enough to begin winnowing out our targets she groaned pushed onto her feet you want the right side or the left huh the bed kuna whatd you think i meant theres one of it and two of us which reminds me ill have to get a key cut for you tomorrow i dont think id better ask the rumacha for an extra so which is it right or left i dont like walls let me have the outside good enough she stretched groaned again shook herself and started breaking open the fastening on her shirt if you wake first kuna shove me out im so tired i could easy sleep till next week but the sooner we start looking the sooner well know shadith kizra in the halflight a blood halitus sweet and musty spread through the room as the irrkuyon on the dais stood without moving a tableau that held until rintirry dropped the knife on kulyaris body and strolled to the end of the table he flung himself into his chair poured a dollop of wine into his glass and gulped it down memory she turned a corner found herself in the middle of a kidnapping before she had time to react one of the men had an arm wrapped around her and a slicer against her temple move and youre dead he whispered his breath was hot on her ear she was pressed hard against him he wasnt much taller or wider than she was but she kept thinking of steel traps and sword blades and other hard and lethal things lethal yeh he wanted to kill her so badly she could smell it like body odor matja allina exchanged a quick look with airing pirs got to her feet she signaled the women at her table to follow her then went sweeping from the room behind the screen kizra clutched at the arranga and wondered what she should do danger was as thick in that huge room as the bloodstink off the body she wanted out of that place now no ten minutes ago fragment by fragment since the encounter that afternoon with that signifier lizard she was reassembling her past and with that past regaining an acerbic view of power and the powerful a view underlined by what had just happened a lesson of what would happen to her if she followed her natural tendencies in this world memory the door whooshed closed behind him expanding as it moved to fill the whole space of the opening as if it erased itself to underline the futility of trying to escape the cell hands clasped behind her shadith scowled at the seamless wall mashak dafta your soul smells like dogshit when she was trapped in the diadem she was essentially immortal shed abandoned all that when she had aleytys decant her into this body i must have been out of my alleged mind that struck her as funny and she giggled but the spurt of humor was quickly gone time meant more now the idea of wasting her counted hours in a hole like this one with nothing to see nothing to do made her wild she closed her eyes and reached searching for other eyes single or compound large or small anything she could look through somewhere somehow he must have left a crack she could worry at until it was big enough to let her crawl out of this a small dark maidservant slipped like a shadowmouse from the curtains behind the screen and touched her on the shoulder ghineeli chal when kizra started to speak ghineeli touched a forefinger to her lips then she beckoned urgently pointed at the curtains memory she came painfully awake looked up into the liquid copper eyes of the sauroid captive she was lying on a floor somewhere and he was kneeling beside her she wasnt tracking too well whatever ginny used to put her out seemed to have pushed the slowbutton in her head she rubbed at her eyes groped around with numb hands kizra followed her out into the kitchen hall what she whispered ghineeli shook her head then went scooting along the hall to the swinging doors at the far end she pushed open the lefthand door stood holding it until kizra was through then she eased the door shut with no more noise than a faint whoosh she touched kizras arm the matja said go to her rooms now by the serving stairs she took her hand away and left slipping shadowmouse through the wide service door into the kitchen quarters memory she scowled at the black figures seated by the fire two of them standing and shivered involuntarily as she heard the two on their feet arguing on and on it was about her and the others she knew that it was like an auction in a way as if they were agents bidding for the contents of the cage she thrust two fingers into her boot smiled as she touched the hideouts hilt braincrystal knife limber as a company execs morals hold it wrong and it would whip back on you and slice your hand off rohant dropped to a squat beside her his eyes shown red like bits stolen from the fire soon he said she nodded soon kizra clicked her tongue matja allina she wasnt sure how far she trusted the matja the woman would serve her own first and drop overboard anyone or anything that threatened them promises or no promises good will or ill still there was no one else right now who even looked like offering protection so what could she do moving as swiftly and silently as she could manage cursing under her breath when an awkward turn made her bump the arranga against the white plastered dirt wall she went up the back stairs her nerves were stretched tauter than the arrangas strings turn and turn then out on the second floor scurry along the service corridor push out into the main hall after listening nervously and hearing only the hiss of candles burning after peering out and seeing only shadows stand before the matjas door and wonder should i knock or not if i dont knock how does anyone know im out here the door opened aghilo took her wrist and tugged her inside an urgent fearful pull on her arm matja allina looked up nodded then let her head fall back her eyelids droop closed again she said nothing her daughters were crouched at her feet they didnt know what was happening but theyd sensed danger and were pale and tense ingva was looking fierce again memory she extended her reach sweeping through wide arcs finally touched a bigeyed moth hunting gnats along the dark stream she went swooping through the night with the prowling moth in and out among the trees soaring on muffled wings that read the air currents so exquisitely they beat just once or twice a minute only speeding up when she rushed down on a swarm of prey insects a sudden burst of heat drew her heat radiating away from the cooling engines of a grounded flit an open flier capable of lifting a score of passengers the moth played in the thermals like a child dancing in wavefroth forgetting her hunger in the exuberance of her tiny joy candles were burning in here also the current that fed the bedroom lamps had been diverted into the honor suite hot wax and fear the stink of both filled the room aghilo dropped her arm and went back to the chair where shed been sitting tinoopa was already here sitting crosslegged on the floor in the lefthand corner of the room where she had a view of the door but was inconspicuous behind the chair where polyapo sat the titular housekeeper looked older by half a century than shed been at the start of the meal though polyapo was irrkuyon by birth she was also female and a poor relation without any protection but her relatives good will and when relatives fought if she guessed wrong about whod win if she went too far with the wrong loyalties shed be one of the first to perish she wasnt an intelligent woman but instinct told her that this situation could go in any of half a dozen directions most of them deadly that she could do nothing to influence the outcome nothing but sit here and pray to whatever gods a preybeast had that the powerful and the angry wouldnt notice her the jili arluja was in more or less the same situation but she was in less danger being without ambition she was content to be here and teach the girls as long as they needed her what happened after that she was also content to leave to the good will of the matja any dreams she had time had leached out of her she was sitting quietly beside the girls touching them now and then a gentle encouragement and comforting especially yla as kizra crossed to tinoopa yla gasped suddenly turned and pressed her face against arlujas knees the tutor sighed stroked the girls hair memory stripped to his dry rough hide kikun strolled away from the cluster of buildings and walked along the ruts to the wharf shadith looked at him found herself looking away forgetting him looking back startled each time she saw him his hands were empty he had no weapon nothing visible anyway she looked away again forgetting him again as she heard yells of anger and disgust then a rattle of shots from the largest of the crumbling warehouses shadith lifted the stunner waited in the boat kikun slid behind the driver as the kana jerked away the sauroid took his helmeted head into an enveloping embrace twisted sharply with a continuation of the neck whip kikun flipped the local into the river on the shore side used a boathook to shove the body under the wharf where it got hung up among the rotting piles kizra dropped beside tinoopa the woman touched her arm in greeting but said nothing like the jili she knew when to keep her head down the women sat and waited no one spoke the curtains were pulled back from the windows and moonlight streamed in to fight with the candles shadows flickered over the faces of the women and the silent girls clouds were blowing in rapidly thickening and there was a dampness in the wind that howled around the towers rattled the diamond panes and crept through the cracks it promised a storm before the night was over matja allina opened her eyes and sat up kizra she cleared her throat play something light quiet she closed her eyes and sank back kizra rested the arranga on her knees tested the strings then went with meticulous care through the complex process of tuning though she could see that the jagged disconnected sounds were setting the womens teeth on edge memory shadith inspected the fingernail shed glued on to replace the broken one then swept her hand along the harp strings happiness came by me again clap your hands oh yes oh yes yesterday clap your hands my dears he wouldnt stay i wrapped him in my arms displayed my charms like smoke he slipped away she played a lively tune brought them onto their feet swaying and clapping a counterrhythm sorrow came by me again clap your hands o softly softly and stayed a while clap your hands my dears to caress and beguile bittersweet is better neat and tastier than honey i would not let him go but he faded so like smoke he blew away dancing in the drafts when she finished she thought a moment then let her fingers walk the strings in a simple tune that slipped without thought from dreamtime maybe from her past it was a happy tune with a tinkly spritely lilt to it there were words but not in the irrkuyon langue she played the tune and played with the words translation was useless but maybe she could yes section by section she smiled a dreamy inward smile it wouldnt be elegant her rendition but maybe amusing considering the situation why not step easy stepchild she sang step easy stepchild watch where you walkin its wolfdays stepchild bourghies in your garden humming along with the tune her fingers were elaborating she considered the second section stoop swiftly gyrfalcon your eyases are shriekin its catdays gyrfalcon pussy on the pantiles kizra stopped singing and whistled softly along with the arranga yla was leaning against the jilis knee tearstreaks drying on her face she was good at whistling and proud of it she tapped her fingers a moment to catch the rhythm then whistled with kizra the sound flowing like water from her flute song melting into the more abrupt arranga tones step easy stepchild wasps are in your willows its rage days stepchild stingers pricking wild go grimly grimalkin your kittens cry for dinner its hunger days grimalkin famine in the straw ingva couldnt whistle but there was a tradition of nonsense syllables in the irrkuy womens culture she caught up the rhythm and blended her voice with ylas whistle ba ba vay ba lay la vah she sang the song went on and on blending the stepchilds story with the beasts around herhim some verses translating more successfully than others some more surreal some more pedestrian but it did the job the matja wanted took their minds off the danger stewing below them memory the air shook and the brightening day turned suddenly dark as a vast blanket of sleds filled the sky over them flying low enough to brush the fronds of the lower trees cutter beams slashed through the foliage churned the mud boiled the water around them bracketing them missing them again and again she was splattered by mud thrown up by the bombs metal fragments went whining through the sides of both boats one ripped across her arm another clipped a tuft of hair above her ear the door to the bedroom opened and arring pirs came through it into the sitting room he stopped beside the couch where matja allina was sitting hes settled in he said touched allinas head fingers sliding gently over her smoothed hair he called utilas and told him ut wont be coming allina caught his hand held it against her face at least theres that i dont think i could bear it watching utilas and rintirry stalking around each other like a pair of randy tomcats randy he said he dropped to the couch beside her yes rintirry his bloods up you know what that means youve warned our women to stay inside and bar their doors and if he kicks the door in what are they supposed to do then matja allinas control was slipping what could we do slap his wrist and say bad boy there was rage in her voice he doesnt care whom he uses you know that even our daughters arent safe and the artwa would support him you know that do something pirs i dont care what it means i wont have any of our people her mouth worked used i wont and if the artwa calls the mortgage let him try he cant afford an inside kirtaa to add to his other wars and if hes foolish enough to go ahead with it id rather go into the brush i swear it pirs i will go into the brush before i turn my head and sacrifice a baby to rintirrys lust he took her hand kissed her fingers one by one yes sweet warrior mimatjali yes he set her hand down i put pmurr on guard at his door with orders to make sure he stays where he belongs hell enjoy doing it mikilli hes tired the laugh lines deepened about his blue eyes he lost the tip to his ear and has a buttburn from a pellet out of a tumaks rifle hes quite annoyed at rintirry he bent touched ingvas cheek and ruffled ylas hair you sleep in your mamas bed this night lirrilirris mama she will be in with me ingvalli you and yla and the jili will be all alone he straightened jili arluja take them in now please he watched them out then turned to polyapo ulyinik you are welcome to a pallet here as long as this situation lasts but if you prefer to return to your own quarters i think you will be safe enough polyapo got slowly to her feet she bowed perfunctorily and left without a word pirs waited until aghilo was back from barring the door after the titular housekeeper then turned with grave formality to tinoopa and kizra kizra could feel his unease with them he was a better man than his father but he was also a product of his culture what was in his bones and blood fought the pale overgrowth from his mind he was honest enough to realize this and recognize the roots of his distaste for them but he still felt itand showed it in his dealings with them memory shadith felt her power come on her nothing but the intensity of the belief before and behind her kikun squeezed down that force and funneled it into her the feedback built and built until the air clanged like metal she began to shape digging deep within herself laying hold on the power offered her crafting out of memory and instinct out of the peoples belief she shaped the three and sent them dancing over the crowd made them sing with the voice of the throng it would be best he said looking past tinoopa at the wall then forcing himself to look directly at her if you would spend the night here things being as they are you would probably be safe enough in your rooms but he shrugged then turned his eyes on kizra i owe you my life child there was a shade more warmth in his voice he touched the bandage on his head then the one on his arm it was close there for a while without the warning and the weapons i might easily be resting in some lborrghas belly i thank you kizra bowed her head said nothing yes he said he closed his eyes a moment then stirred himself and finished what hed determined to say and you chapa tinoopa you have made the matjas life infinitely more pleasant even in the short time you have been here i have said nothing before now for this lack i ask your favor he turned abruptly took the hands the matja held out to him and pulled her to her feet at the bedroom door he looked over his shoulder aghilo if the chapai decide to stay here take care of them please we know how surely we may rely on you memory a redheaded woman came riding through the cicipi gate sitting in an arslibre howda mounted on the arching back of an immense and ugly warbot like the worse possible cross between a spider and a lobster two more paced alongside and a third followed behind they shot gouts of steam through spiracles along their sides opening a path for themselves through the surging throng of pilgrims walked with ominous sinuous agility through the steam clouds eh shadow dea ex machina reporting for duty eh aleytys shadith closed her eyes opened them again as she remembered you better machinate some more or this world is going to go boom aghilo went out without waiting to ask if they meant to stay backwater worlds tinoopa said she stood stretched looked around the room its the floor for us dust headaches and an aching back ah well could be worse you could easy have been the goat kiz hung out for that oogaluk to gnaw on kizra wrinkled her nose lecture time tinoopa was going sententious again she was getting tired of being instructed especially as her memory drained back she loosed the strings on the arranga set it on a table and moved to a chair tinoopa rubbed at her arms and frowned at one of the windows a raindrop splatted against the glass then another and another we havent seen a strong storm yet not the kind they call a kwangkular sound of that wind says this might be it too bad lasts a good week they say no flying in that weather those two oogaluks might be stuck here for days youve been shut up with the matja most of the time you dont hear what the chal are saying its only a matter of time theyre saying pirs is better than most irrkuyon but he wont stand up to his father he never has except maybe when he courted the matja theyre taking bets how long hell last she glanced at the door stopped talking memory arel the smuggler got to his feet he was a small dark man with a bony sardonic face fans of fine wrinkles about the outer corners of his eyes and his mouth his long dark hair was pulled through a filigreed silver clasp at the nape of his neck and hung halfway down his back what am i doing here you can bypass goyo security get a lander down and off again unnoticed oh shadow shadow you need to ask that its my business i need a back door just in case operating against one of the families arent you his brow shot up she didnt answer figuring it was none of his business you owe me danger money then those goyo are tricky bastards aghilo came in two maidservants following her with bedding and rolled up pallets she waved tinoopa and kizra aside to give the girls room to make up the beds im going back to my room for the night the door out there chapa tinoopa you lock and bar it when were gone she twisted a key from the chatelaine on her belt tossed it to tinoopa ill knock and call out my name in the morning when its time for you to be up be very sure whos out there chapa tinoopa before you open the door use the peep to see if im alone do you hear me i hear aghilo chal she died again in her dreams plunged down and down through fire and pain and crashed she woke sweating tinoopa was getting up smoothing her hair out of her face shaking out her nightgown someone was pounding on the outer door what kizra scrubbed at her eyes there was a terrible urgency in that knocking though it wasnt as noisy as shed first thought when it crashed into her dream she kicked off the blankets rolled from the pallet and got to her feet lifting the front of her borrowed nightgown so she wouldnt step on it and fall on her face she followed tinoopa into the anteroom the knocking continued she could feel the desperation the fear and anger in the woman on the other side of the door aghilo what was happening after a quick look through the peep tinoopa turned the key slapped the bar up and tugged the door open aghilo stumbled inside her face was drained of color her mouth was working she put out her hand flattened it against the wall and stood leaning into her braced arm while she caught her breath and stifled her panic after a moment she straightened looked quickly from tinoopa to kizra youd better get dressed she said theres trouble she started past tinoopa but the shimmarohi caught her arm what happened contract woman she killed rintirry hung herself i have to wake the arring wait wait just a minute its barely light now youve got plenty of time before the artwa goes nova sit down using her size and her grip on aghilos arm she maneuvered the smaller woman to one of the benches and muscled her down then she stood with feet apart hands on her hips howd you find out memory the room was as stale and sordid as shed expected she felt a little sick when she saw it she closed her eyes and told herself it didnt matter but it did arel put his hands on her shoulders he was exactly her height his mouth on a level with hers she focused on that mouth not daring to meet his eyes give me a minute luv whistling softly he tossed the filthy bedding into a closet brought out clean sheets he made the bed with an expertise that had her smiling he caught her at it and his whole body laughed for a moment she couldnt breathe he took an incense burner from his shoulder bag filled and lit it the scent of pines drifted to her cool and clean he brought out a pair of thick green candles lit them and turned off the light the room was filled with flickering shadow touched with magic the outside world with its threats and dangers was banished for the moment come here he said kizra collected tinoopas clothes brought them to her then started pulling on her own clothing when she was dressed she dropped to the rug behind tinoopa where she could watch aghilo but be more or less out of sight aghilo twisted her hands around and around each other as tinoopa was dressing the sight of the shimmarohi shaking out the nightgown and starting to fold it seemed to reassure her and she began talking well first thing i knew loujary chal was beating at my door hed gone into the honor suite to clear up and make sure things were right for when they woke you know warm the towels pick up whatever was thrown about kind of things theyd expect to have done and get she grimaced get cranky about if it isnt anyway pmurr let him in said itd been a quiet night rintirry hadnt given him any trouble loujary said they talked some before he went in this and that he didnt go into what they said except what i told you soon as he was inside he twisted the rheostat way down and turned the lights on and went around picking up getting things ready you know he looked in at the artwa old man was sleeping snoring he went in picked up there folded set out you know artwa didnt stir just kept snoring he went in rintirrys bedroom she shuddered i couldnt believe him i had to go see she pressed her hand across her mouth closed her eyes briefly then forced them open i cant forget tinoopa took her shoulders shook her a little no time for that now listen i need to know what it means for us chaps and chat what do we have to do to protect ourselves aghilo squeezed her hands together moving one over the other endlessly the soft sound of skin on skin filling the tense silence amurra bless ive never seen worse even she shook her head while her hands kept moving she cut his throat that was first i suppose it had to be thats where the blood was you could smell the blood all over the suite i dont see how loujary didnt i suppose the door was shut then shut it in cut his head completely off and set it on the pillow the eyes were open it was like he was looking at you and she cut him ah cut it off and put it in his hand like he was ah and she cut open his chest and took his heart out and put it down there where ah and the skin on the arms and legs it was gone ah except for his hands and feet it was like he was wearing gloves and slippers and ah shed cut the skin she got in strips and braided it into a rope ah it must have taken her most of the night ah and when she was finished she used that rope to hang herself ah from one of the bed posts its a big bed like the matjas youve seen hers carved like that with posts holding curtains its the drafts come winter its hard to heat the rooms we dont have that much fuel ah theres coal in the mountains but weve just started getting it out she was naked red hair hanging down to her waist no blood at all shed washed it off in the bathroom bloody water and shed oiled her body smelled like ah i had to look see everything who the one called tamburra tall redhaired strange woman the matja assigned her to the herbmistress she worked in the distillery how did she get in wasnt pmurr supposed to stop that kind of thing i asked him she didnt go past him i suppose she must have been inside already when the arring set him there tinoopa scowled i dont know her kizra scratched at her nose she was the one who had nightmares every night on the trip here tinoopa looked around and down what you must have heard her screaming woke everyone up several times didnt explain except it was nightmares got her yeh the beauty all she had to do was be where the man could see her hed work out the rest of it probably told her to go in and wait for him keep quiet about it he knew what the arring thought of him it wasnt any secret aghilo was settling into lethargy as if by telling all this she was passing it on to tinoopa making it tinoopas responsibility us nothing we can do artwa might want pmurr skinned hes head guard the arring wont let that happen pmurrs loyal you cant buy what he gives if the woman hadnt hanged herself if shed run there be trouble shes dead that should finish it i dont know you understand anything could happen artwa doesnt need a reason its his right were his by law chal and chapa too he can do anything to us he wants all we have is the arring and amurra only knows how far hell go to protect us right tinoopa twisted round to look down at kizra kiz get the sitting room cleared im going to see what i can do with the maids and houseservants she straightened aghilo youd better go on in and let the arring know what happened tell him well be ready for anything he wants us to do even if its just keep out of the way she hauled aghilo to her feet just tell him what you saw hell know better than us what he has to do he knows his father you all right better aghilo smiled shook herself went soberly out of the anteroom tinoopa murmured i hope this turns out better than i think its going to kizra shrugged we stick with the matja i dont see we have any other choice and hope she can put some starch in the arrings spine id better get moving you take care kiz she looked like she was about to start one of her lectures then she glanced over her shoulder at the door no time for talking i mean it child keep your head down dyslaera lizard magic rohant sat in the pen absorbing the sun it was good to be out again and eating again hed always been astonished how easy it was for other cousins to fast for days on end without serious damage to their bodies digby said hunger goes away you forget about it you shake a little get dizzy but you forget about eating he smoothed his thumbclaw along his mustache dyslaera werent like that he was not at all like that he went cold and weak and his mind started shutting down there was a flicker of something down by the sump lazily not much interested he turned his head saw a small gray sauroid perched alertly on the rim of the sump he smiled it made think of kikun lil liz the lizard spun its long thin tail snapped out the prehensile end whipped round a large flier that was circling down for a drink and slammed it hard against the concrete floor of the pen it sat up on its haunches took the insect in its hands and turned it to expose the soft underside with absurd small relish it began biting fastidiously at its prey interesting wonder what they call it here it had an almost dyslaer facility with those tiny hands tie with that why not rohant let his eyes droop closed and considered the creature tried to sense it with the faculty hed used before he could speak male and female dyslaera were born with the talent to link with certain beasts to tie into their nervous systems to vibrate in tune with their feeling lives it wasnt nearly as broadranged and apparently indiscriminate as shadiths ability to mindride but there were possibilities it took time to build the tie time to understand the beast to relate what was sensed to realtime acts and reactions time lots of time hed had sassa from the egg carried that egg against his body warming it becoming slowly aware of the creature inside hed relinquished the egg just before it hatched to allow the hatchling to imprint properly on his own kind took him back as eyas kept him always near sleeping in the same room trained him was trained by him an intensifying give and take until the tie was complete months and months more than a year it was much the same with the mutated panthers magimeezand nagifog he didnt want to think of them their death still screamed in his head their terror and rage and pain he thought instead of the notlizard a name what should i call you little liz miji yes nimble fingers abbreviated because the whole would be too long miji i cant take a year to get to know you miji all ive got is an hour or so but maybe we can hurry it up some the sun is warm today very bright just a few clouds a shadow of a cloud is passing over you miji do you feel the difference in the warmth aaah yes astonishing it seems rubbing against shadow opened some doors in my head opened them a crack anyway shadow no rohant get your mind on what youre doing do you have any curiosity in you miji youre not wholly a reptile are you native to this world life in the process of evolving the change altered or cut short by us intruders do you feel me aaah miji the notlizard lifted his frilly head stared at rohant his eyes were large for his head black as jet beads lively eyes bright with the curiosity rohant wanted to find in him miji miji come and see he formed the words in his mind and tried to project the welcoming warmth generated around them miji shivered ran a few steps toward him retreated time passed unnoticed slowly warily miji got closer and closer finally close enough to sniff at rohants fingers rohant didnt move miji panicked skittered back about a meter sat on his haunches and contemplated the dyslaeror rohants ears quivered he heard the sound of footsteps in the tunnel the walkers were several minutes off still but he knew them his warders come to take him back to his cell for the first time he looked directly at the notlizard go he said aloud he slapped his hand several times against the concrete hoping miji would understand the warning it was a common one among the reptiloids of dysstrael his homeworld miji chirked the first sound hed made slapped the spatulate tip of his tail against the concrete then went scooting away darting down the outflow pipe at the bottom of the sump basin a moment later the grill clanged open and the five masked wards assigned to him came stomping out savant speaking to notepad a rather amusing incident the capture specialist playing his tricks on a common sakali appears the subject is suffering from boredom question except for samples of body fluids and brain tissue and drugs to suppress the fugue state the ciocan has been left undisturbed by orders of the council the failure of all attempts to control adult dyslaerors cannot of course be counted a waste of time negative results are often as valuable as positives however work with the remnant of the sample has reached the point where further experiments will not be worth the expense the council must agree that it is time to start collecting infants and gravid females and dispose of this lot suggestion ransom one or more of them to voallts korlatch alive but wiped if ransom is refused then dispatch them to black house so we can recoup some of our expenses they are too dangerous to keep shadith kizra in the halflight memory she sang wordless sounds filled with joy pain desire fear in a half dream deeply relaxed she sang to her sisters her six dead sisters the weavers of shayalin they rose from the mirror tiles slender and angular black and silver similitudes of naya zayalla annethi itsaya tallitt and sullan spinning threads from themselves to shape the images of goyo dreams she sang the ancient croon that mated with that dance and filled the spaces this alien voice shed claimed could not reach with the pure flowing tones of the harp her sisters danced her joy celebrating her love with her commiserating with her on its ephemeral nature helping her to rejoice in what it was and refrain from unreal expectations she sang laughter as she saw itsaya wink at her saw naya smile and clap her slender hands saw zaya shake her hips and grin over her shoulder as she saw each of her dead sisters show their pleasure she rode that surging wild wave a hair away from disaster always out of control rode it with a mastery shed never reached before and might not again shadith prowled about her room going round the bed and back again in the narrow floorspace left for her to move in window to door door to left wall back again memory funny thing still cant remember how i did it or why set up this forgetting she shuddered as another image intruded cut his throat skinned him hung herself on the rope she braided from his skin gaaah dont think about that memory lizard i set up the trigger to trip the next time i saw kikun and got it tripped by a sixinch garden lizard thats a giggle my minds more creative than i thought just as well kikuns a long way off dead maybe no lil liz is too slippery for that i hope all right all right nows not the time but ive got to get out of here stop leaning drifting i know a lot now my name friends names if i can get a call out someone will come call that means getting to that city what was it nirtajai thats not so easy wont get easier if i sit around and do nothing drifting cant do that any more im safe here and comfortable comforts an illusion and nobodys safe do it now now start working at it anyway theres lots i can do to get ready she paced the movement cooling her rage and impatience planning how to get back to the port city and win access to a skipcom so she could call someone to come get her in essence it was the same problem shed had on kiskai but there shed had rohant and kikun to help and asteplikota and mobility she wasnt stuck off to hell and gone with the only transport available walking around on four legs she stopped at the window and scowled down at what she could see of the main court and the skimmer that mostly filled it it was a gray and gloomy day with scattered spatters of raindrops pattering against the walls and the skimmers dome stow away no hed have thought of that the artwa would this kind of society no way the irrkuyon would trust their precious persons to unsecured transport kitchikooing round the artwa since he had a thing for dark girls no memory kikun caught up a tree branch knocked out the last fragments of glass in one of the windows climbed through it shadith climbed through after him the wind snatched at her skirts threatened to whip her off the narrow heavilycarved ledge the stone around her had an eerie luminosity faint but enough to give her the outlines of the building the walls and towers she reached the end clutched at the stone and waited for lightning the tree was jerking desperately about creaking groaning a section of branch tore loose came flying by her and slammed into the window beside her then went clattering away along the wall flash she jumped landed sprawled across the limb clutched at it as it bucked under her she steadied herself and crawled cautiously inward cursing as her dress snagged on a broken branch she tore free and struggled on the thought made her want to vomit and it wouldnt work he wouldnt take her with himnot back to his home ground where people would see what he was fucking she smiled it was comforting that inclination matched with circumstance not that shed have done it anyway she wasnt backed into a corner here and there are some things that corrupt so deeply that whatever advantage they give is destroyed in the doing there has to be some way at least kays fifteen days travel across land i dont know fifteen days in a truck not on horseback we were attacked twice on the way here followed sniped at and we had a dozen guards armored trucks and a gatlin i need allies brushies i wonder tinoopa i dont think so city woman couldnt sit a horse three days let alone the thirty or forty days itd take maybe longer dont know if i can who damn it looked like a good thing having the mafia favor me made life easier would have been better if i was down with the rest stuck up here isolated as much as if i were in purdah damn have to get out more talk the matja into giving me a break i have to get out of here somehow get to nirtajai find a skipcom like on kiskai wonder how theyre getting on with their reforms if theyve got the world they wanted or if its falling apart in their hands miowees probably back to singing in the streets if things went like most rebellions aste back in the swamps well thats their business she heard noises below and leaned out the window something was happening in the court but she couldnt see anything from here she pulled back in and ran for the door memory the pod was on the launcher a shadowy black seed she crawled into the flightspace stretched out on the pad and eased herself into its hollows fitting her skin against the sensors a moment later she felt the hard sharp kick of the launcher her vision cleared she could see the cillasheg floating half a kilometer away could see all round herself she shifted her vision out and out until she could see the asteroids frost in the darkness white and black glitter in the light of the dim distant sun shifted down again until her vision was confined to an area the width of her wings at full deployment she snapped the wings out full gossamer fields like shadows in glass the lightwinds filled them pushed her outward she gathered speed for the turn feeling the sunmoth come alive under her as she drank the winds and rode them out and out she laughed and groaned making love to the winds laughed again and swung round tilting her wings slipping the winds tacking right tacking left sweeping toward the sun on and on faster and faster time compressing to nothing her blood was wine her body sang on and on there was no one at the oriel window though it was one of the better outlooks in the house she climbed into the round hole pressed her face against the colored glass pirs stood at the top of the steps ignoring the splatters of rain that came every few minutes he was standing very erect his head up he wasnt saying anything the artwa stood on the same step a double arms length apart from his second son the old man was seething the younger one deeply disturbed but there was no grief in either of them at least none for rintirry pirs was miserable but that had more to do with his fathers rejection than the loss of a brother give him his due half brother and one trying to kill him not the sort you mourned the big doors boomed open loujary and wayak came out and moved carefully down the steps carrying a litter with rintirrys body on it wrapped in heavy white damask shadith relaxed shed expected a lot more trouble than this infected with tinoopas gloom probably and the weepy gloom of the day as if the skies wept for the double death she sniffed fancies with no touch of reality even old cagharadad wasnt grieving she grimaced memory lissorn was racing toward ginny stunner forgotten claws out ginny raised a hand four cutters flashed from overlooks hit lissorn in midstride for an instant the dyslaeror was a black core in the furnace where the beams met then they winked out and there was nothing left not even dust when his son died rohant screamed with grief and rage his great voice filling the room rintirry he was a human being just barely but he was and someone should grieve at his passing and the manner of it someone not me loujary and wayak came silently from the flitter and went off toward the mens quarters arring pirs dropped onto one knee and bowed his head the watery sunlight that struggled through the clouds turning his long loose hair to melted gold shadith couldnt see the artwas face but she could smell the stink of his malice he was beginning to enjoy this i leave no blessing on this house he intoned his voice blaring out through the whine of the wind there is kin blood on this house until it is cleansed i curse it and you kin blood he repeated liking the taste of the words pirs said nothing he didnt move shadith shivered it was all too apparent that he revered his father that he needed his approval that he was suffering under the old mans spite that he didnt see it as spite would never see it as anything but a fathers justified distress over the needless death of a son however worthless that son might be the blindness startled her he was an intelligent man even a good man given how hed been brought up and yet he let this this vain stupid old warthog rule him aghilo was right pirs would never rebel against his father he would hunt ways around the old mans more irresponsible acts and edicts but in the end hed do what his father told him the matja knows that too thats why gods the matja means well but what shes promising it probably wont happen the old man will see to that and pirs will do as he is told so i do for myself or it doesnt get done the artwa went stalking down the steps the skimmer door closed behind him the motors whined a moment later the court was empty and the flier a black speck vanishing into the clouds they threw tamburras body into the river for the fish to eat the locals didnt want lborrghas to get a taste for flesh that walked on two legs at the same time the smoke from the pyre they built for kulyari on amur hill rose black and solid into the clouds she was irrkuyon and couldnt be discarded like offal there was only the briefest of ceremonies with polyapo there to represent the family and the amurspeaker to say the restrites then the fire was lit and a cadre of charcoalmen left to keep it burning until even the bones were ash ghanar rinta settled into peace there were no more attacks from bands of tumaks no one said anything but they all knew what that meantthe supply of gold was cut off when the supplier died allina continued healthy tinoopa ran the house with unobtrusive efficiency making points as shed say with every easy day pirs lost his strained look with a facility that amounted to a talent he forgot old terrors and went back to his books and the business of running the kuyyot shadiths restlessness increased she got pirs to let her look over his histories and the atlas he kept on his desk whenever the matja gave her some free time she was in the study making notes trying to work out a way of reaching nirtajai without getting herself killed and she began looking about for allies the chal wouldnt run with her she knew that she didnt bother thinking about them vuodee and vassika had settled in and started courting almost immediately now they were promised with weddings due before the month was out they were full of plans and elated because their contracts were to be voided as soon as they took the chaloath to the arring and the matja tictoc evalee and dorrit had been having a grand time flirting and generally making mischief among the men but they too were beginning to settle down according to tinoopa the betting was evalee would be promised before summerhighday and the other two soon after lyousa va vogl was blissful with the opportunities offered by the weaving shed nunnikura weavemistress had recognized her gifts and left her free to improvise it would take a planet wrecker to blast her loose jassy and eeda had a widening circle of friends they were hard workers cheerful and outgoing contract levies were all they knew and they were content to have it so jassy was a practiced storyteller and she had an endless supply of strange wonderful tales to liven meals and sit over brushtea with in a world where books were scarce and most entertainment homemade she was a treasure beba mahl had settled into embroidery shed bargained for night work and gotten it she had a room of her own and almost no contact with the rest of the kuysstead she could complete her contract and move on no one would miss her and she would forget them as soon as she joined a new levy ekkurekeh and yerryayin were hard workers and unambitious for reasons they never spoke of theyd adopted the levy system as home did what they were told and dropped into kuysstead life without making a ripple the cousin convicts bertem luacha and sabato were bored and unhappy here they loathed the work in the weaving sheds and wriggled out of it whenever they could the problem was like tinoopa they were citybred the brush scared them they couldnt ride and didnt want to learn they liked their comforts baths and beer and warm beds with friendly company shadith considered them shook her head no better go alone than chance the miseries that trio of sybarites would bring with them the jinasu ommla jhapuki fraji and rafiki spent their days with the beasts and their nights with the herders and were as likely as the young ones to take the chaloath when their term was up though not because they wed any of the locals theyd branched far enough from the other cousin races to make children unlikely and any that appeared sterile they were candid about that early on and it made life much easier for them since theyd ceased to be a threat to local women they liked this world and would do nothing to injure their status here zhya arru spent long lazy days tending the livestock of the kuysstead she liked beasts and loathed unexpected changes though she didnt work at it she too had her admirers and would probably wed one of them and take the chatoath before the end of summeras long as it was clearly understood she wasnt about to do any housework or other boring tasks anitra vanished the third night after their arrival it was assumed shed gone to the brush pirs sent out trackers but they found no trace of her tsipor pa prool stayed a month longer than anitra then she vanished too she was a silent women secretive and strange no one bothered going after her in fact there was a collective sigh of relief when she was gone in her room at night shadith paced from window to door to wall and back again raging at her helplessness it seemed absurd that she couldnt get away from here there were no bars to hold her no walls she couldnt climb only that two thousand kays of wilderness that was enough right now more than enough prisoner ginny slips his shackles and goes hunting a shadow the minute ginbiryol seyirshi woke he knew hed been moved theyd drugged him and shifted him from his cell on the planet to a cell on a ship he sat up slowly looked around four walls and a floor empty toeup furnishings unsprung except for the cot hed waked on wallslot for food delivery he placed his hands on his knees dropped his gaze to the floor and brooded the cell was a twin of the holding cells on his own ship and for a moment he wondered if omphalos was playing games with his head sending him out on a vessel they said was destroyed no the reasons hed conjured for believing them were valid this was a case of form following function he suppressed his surge of hope got laboriously to his feet and began exploring the resources of the cell betalli smoothed gloved fingers over the back of a gloved hand watched the monitor a moment longer then touched it off and got to his feet ignoring the side glances of crewmen in dull gray shipsuits and mirror visors he left the bridge and dropped to the living quarters he touched the announcer on the savant quatorzes cabin and waited and waited he folded his arms and prepared to outlast the savants annoyance this was his nominal superior but the man had to be aware of the web of support betalli had throughout the powers of omphalos hed listen he wouldnt do anything but at least hed listen the announcer chimed the door slid back betalli went in his mouth tightened when he saw the savant was wearing his robe cowl and gloves this was supposed to be a secure mission all ties to the source carefully erased this fool he bowed waited to be offered a seat it was another lengthy wait the savant was making sure betalli knew who ordered whom finally a gloved hand lifted pointed at a chair betalli sat waited you wanted seyirshi is awake so its time isnt it you dont understand him i do hes a dangerous man most dangerous when he looks most helpless that again i cannot guarantee to control him if you let him out of the holding cell leave him in there until we reach bol mutiar you made that argument to the mimishay council they didnt buy it why do you expect me to i was instructed to start the man working once we were in the insplit i am going to follow instructions if youre so worried come up with something specific you want done to tighten security otherwise stop carping and do your job betalli got to his feet bowed and left he was for omphalos it was the center of his life his reason for existing he believed passionately in what omphalos stood for in rule of the masses by a benevolent elite he believed that ordinary people were incapable of regulating themselves and organizing their own lives they needed direction guidance gentle coercion for their own good sometimes not so gentle if they were resolutely wrongheaded he was honored by the powers of omphalos and honored them but at times it seemed to him the lesser brethren had so little grasp of the soul of omphalos that they were scarcely better than the sheep they were being bred to rule hed met types like quatorze before all too often hed brushed against them in his labors outside the comfortable ambiance of the home foci he worked alone a focus in himself no brothers for him the more conventional brothers resented his selfsufficiency because it stood as a measure of their own limits quatorze was a fool betalli walked into his quarters sealed the door behind him and sat at his console he called up his plans and sat frowning at the schematics fool yes the man had a small mind and a big grudge back on the council with his armgraft still itching tierce had set this crawler over him tierce was an enemy he betrayed omphalos with every breath he took betalli marked that down quatorze was too small to bother with but tierce yes when this is over ive got to do something about him betalli leaned closer to the screen began going minutely through his surveillance arrangements trying to discover any place where seyirshi might find the leverage to subvert the system seyirshi would find something he was sure of it he knew the man too well hed seen him poke and pry at systems until they collapsed in ruins all the while flaking the destruction hed set going nothing betalli ran the system over and over poking at it trying everything he could think of simple or complex he found no entry for manipulation but no comfort either he recognized his limitations he was a plodder no way he could follow the eccentric leaps of ginnys brain he tapped into the monitor watched ginny sit slumped on the cot his face inscrutable waiting with an iron patience for whatever was going to be done with him for nearly an hour he sat watching that stolid motionless figure then he called up record flakes of ginny in his cell hed been over them before over and over them trying to discover what was happening in the mans mind seeing nothing he could put a finger on finally he sighed shook his head quatorze is a fool he repeated to himself passionless words wornout litany most men were fools that was the point of omphalos he got to his feet took off the impermasuit the gloves stripped to his skin and walked into the cleansing chamber hed had installed beside his workroom he sat a long time in the dry sterile heat disciplining his mind as he disciplined his body he had to be ready when ginny went to the workshop he had to watch the mans every movement hope he could spot trouble before it fruited finally he retreated to his secure sleep chamber lay under the flickering killights and slept clean inside and out and weary beyond description seyirshi felt the faint tingle as the ship dropped into the insplit he tensed briefly then forced himself to relax security androids came for him took his wrists and led him to the workroom hed requested they stood in the middle of it holding him until the release code was sent in from outside then they separated and went to stand one at each end of the room their scanners following every move he made he ignored them and walked about the workshop checking supplies against a list on a handheld notepad ticking off each item with meticulous care it took a day to finish the inventory and he logged five complaints about missing materiel then let the androids take him back to his cell betalli watched as ginny checked his stock it was a tedious process again and again he found his mind drifting off again and again he jerked his attention back acid in his mouth wondering if hed missed something the process was being flaked he could replay what was happening down there examine it in detailbut that might be too late the day ended he watched ginny a while longer as he ate his supper from the tray delivered through the slot watched while he washed put on a nightshirt stretched out on the cot and slept betalli left the screen lit stripped and went into his scrub room when he came out again ginny was breathing slowly steadily the readings said he was in the first stages of sleep betalli thinned his mouth pulled on another impermasuit sat at the screen and began replaying randomly chosen moments from the stock taking slowing the action down focusing in on ginnys hands nothing nothing nothing he tapped the screen black and brooded the bland innocence of ginnys every move was not reassuring it only meant he was getting ready for somethingor hed already done something and betalli had missed it missed it missed it if he had he had and would continue to miss it his eyes sliding over and over the place he sighed and went shuffling into his sleeproom stretched naked under the killights and litanyed himself to sleep ginbiryol seyirshi adjusted the magnifier to a comfortable height took a standard eye from its pod and began peeling back its rough black skin he didnt like exposing his secrets this waythe extensive modifications hed devised for the eyes that made them as undetectable as dreams that enabled them to collect emotions as well as full sensory data from his targets when the omphalites wanted him to do this work onplanet under the recorders of the foundation he wouldnt he hadnt argued with the council or the chom he simply said no and refused to amplify his refusal he began preparing the eyes exactly according to the plan he had worked out for the subversion of bol mutiar humming contentedly as he constructed then tucked in new elements what was effective for bol mutiar was even more so when applied within the closed system of the ship the omphalites had overlooked thator if they hadnt overlooked it they expected to be able to control the eyes and him he smiled theyd lost control the minute theyd transferred him here with his prosthetic arm intact if hed been in charge hed have removed that arm replaced it with one he could be sure of theyd scanned it of course and found nothing except the minute forces that controlled its movements and theyd left him with it fools he attached a notepad to the eye ran the program and input additional instructions using his own intensely compressed proglangue when he was finished he zipped up the eye set it in a vault tray and took another eye from its pack he worked steadily until his midday meal lay down on a cot he toed out of the floor and took a long nap when he woke he went back to work on the eyes betalli bent over the screen running over and over the sections where ginny was altering the eye programs trying to work out just what he was doing calling up the inputs and studying them until he was forced to admit he didnt understand what he was seeing he loathed the kephali that ran most ships and many cities he didnt trust them thought of them as whores giving out to anyone who tickled their pads hostile whores who took a perverse delight in tempting men into destructive situations he had no choice now he had to turn the program analysis over to the kephalos and try to prevent the results from going to anyone but him he set the analysis going then replayed the dayend records he watched ginny put the eye he was working on into its slot in the vault tray pack up his tools watched him hold out his arm for the android escort and go placidly off to his cell the second android lifted the tray of eyes and carrying them delicately took them to the heavy vault that betalli had installed in the workroom the android set the tray on its insulated shelf tugged the door shut and set the timelock then settled in front of the vault keyed into guard mode ready to burn anything that moved in the curve of his watch area smooth not a glitch anywhere he could see nothing he could smell taste nothing but a cold certainty that ginny was plotting something what that scratched at him an irritant that wouldnt go away he touched the screen black stripped and went into his cleanroom sat in the heat until his brain was baked then lay brooding under the killights until he finally managed to shut down his mind and sink into a dreamridden sleep three hours into shipnight ginny twitched opened his eyes he got to his feet crossed to the fresher drank a glass of water then returned to the cot he bent down took hold of the cot edge with his prosthetic hand twisted the hand slightly and pushed down a moment later he lowered himself heavily to the mattress swung his feet up and went placidly back to sleep in the vault two of the eyes stirred began to throb the tiny spherical nodes slipped through slits in their skins rose a handwidth above the tray and hovered above the discarded husks minute lasers sealing the escape holes the naked eyes slid down behind the tray clung to the plastic they hummed briefly spun a chameleon field about themselves and effectively vanished betalli sat watched ginny work on the eyes the report from the kephalos lay at his elbow he hadnt read it in detail but on the surface its conclusions were reassuring the additions were a series of commands to internal elements whose capacities were not fully apparent that might have been worrying but the report went on to state that the additions were entirely passive that they needed an outside trigger to begin operating and there was no way ginny had access to such a trigger he began a slow search of the workroom then probed at seyirshi nothing other than the toolfields the only forces operant in that room were the minute motors and fields woven though ginnys prosthesis he scowled at the arm at the lacy schema of struts and wires no connection with the outside no apparent connection he considered removing that arm there was no way to get it off without damaging some very sensitive linkages crippling the man and canceling his usefulness yes he thought i cant have it off but i can put a read on that arm if it does anything at all beyond its ordinary output ill have it off i dont care what the savant says ginny looked up as a third android touched his arm a moment he said i cannot stop right now the android stepped back and waited until ginny set the eye on the tray it took hold of his prosthetic arm swung him around straightened the arm out it slit ginnys sleeve glued a sensor strip to the pseudoskin released the arm and walked out ginny touched the dangling sleeve sighed dear me he said aloud how annoying he used a small laser to cut it away then went back to work three hours into the shipnight the free eyes clinging under the table woke and pulsed inside the vault two more eyes woke slid out of the skins and went to ground behind camouflage fields waiting for the vault to be opened ginny slept the six hours he allotted himself without moving he woke exercised ate went back to work betalli watched and fretted went over and over the records of the previous nights over and over the report from the kephalos hed missed something he knew it ginny would never submit this docilely to control but there was nothing nothing at all betalli wasnt sleeping well even under the killights in the sterile security of the saferoom in his worst nightmare he woke and found himself staring up into ginnys smiling face watching ginnys hands pour filth on him he doubled the watch androids left three in the workroom every shipnight sent one into ginnys sleepcell with instructions to burn him if he did anything at all out of the ordinary and all this time ginny plodded stolidly along never deviating from the path hed laid down back on arumdam on the tenth day there were only five eyes left ginbiryol seyirshi did some special work on these more modifications to the circuitry more complex instructions added to the standard program betalli didnt wait until night to seize those eyes one of the androids took the tray as soon as ginny set the fifth eye in it placed it in the vault and locked the door ginny smiled sadly began filling firing tube inserts with drugs and tiny bloodsoluble darts on the tenth day in the insplit in the third hour of the shipnight one of the five big eyes woke and hid on the eleventh day in the insplit in the third hour of the shipnight the big eye raided the supply bins and vanished into the ventilation system to join the smaller eyes already hiding there on the twelfth day in the insplit during the third hour of the shipnight the eyes acted by the fifth hour betalli and the savant were the only individuals aboard the ship other than the engine crew alive and in possession of their faculties at the sixth hour ginbiryol seyirshi rose from his bed ignoring the android deactivated in the corner of the cell he dressed and went out by the eleventh hour he held complete control of the kephalos and the savant quatorze was dead he contemplated what hed accomplished smiled with satisfaction and sent for betalli betalli stared at him from redrimmed eyes then he nodded fools he said all of us ginny tapped the readouts not you he said they should have listened to you you knew they wouldnt oh yes they have given me data enough to know them you worked for me long enough that i knew you how how escape your surveillance ginny chuckled i did not of course i did not betalli waggled the fingers of the hand imprisoned in the androids fist why am i standing like this if you did nothing i did not say that surely it must have occurred to you that materiel meant to subvert a world would be exceedingly effective at subverting a much smaller community i warned them and i watched you i had the kephalos analyze your additions it said every addition was passive needed a triggering from outside had you gotten to the kephalos already oh no merely trusted my luck and implanted a latency in one eye ginny smiled and lied much as he was enjoying this he knew better than to broadcast secrets promiscuously in the night in the vault the eye woke and primed others a pyramid betalli once the first triggering was done the rest was mere reduplication the crew is dead oh yes at least all but those crucial to running the ship you were greatly overmanned you know waste of resources i control completely everyone still alive everyone but you of course i see yes i am sure you do you betrayed me betalli you were in my employ and used my trust to destroy me it will take many years to repair the damage you have done to me you and omphalos your death will serve me two ways it will discourage others from following your example and it will entertain my customers oh yes i have a new project betalli a new limited edition something i havent attempted before it has a simple title no need for fuss the fall of omphalos nice play of sounds dont you think betalli struggled ginny flaked his struggles he had betalli stripped and thrust naked into a disabled rescue pod an eye there to watch him as air ran out on him when the air was thick and stale ginny touched a sensor and a sac opened releasing spiders and other manylegged wigglers to crawl over the prisoner three hours after the pod was ejected from the ship betalli died filthy and raving ginny smiled and exploded the pod he didnt want the little lives to suffer more than they had to he deployed betallis android force to dump the dead out the lock then took samples from the unconscious crewmen and brewed up a comealong that would turn them into permanent zombies it cut their efficiency way down but he wouldnt need them long just long enough to get him to the nearest clandestine pit where he could hire some temporary efficiency and ersatz loyalty he thought a moment about ajeri and the paems sighed and gave orders to his clutch of zombies crew first then weersyll and bolodo neyuregg then shadith then mimishay then trolling in the tavern autumn rose begins to play a big fish jacket hung round her shoulders like a cape autumn rose sat on a lichencrusted bitt and watched the surging bay water as the sun set gaudily behind her turning the clouds into salmon chunks and touching the foam tips on the waves with a fugitive vermilion there was a narrow alley past her left shoulder a strip of weedy ground between two blocky warehouses beyond that the street and across the street the rumach where she was staying on the next wharf over a handful of ladesmen and nightwatchers were sitting with their backs against a brick incinerator chugging down dalbir from twohandled stoneware jugs and eating meatrolls theyd heated on wire skewers spread over the sluggish fire burning inside the brick enclosure even this far off with the wind blowing in off the sea whipping her hair about her face she could smell the grease and the gahwang maybe she only imagined the gahwang everything shed eaten during the last two weeks had been laced with the herb probably her own sweat stunk of it she lifted an arm sniffed at the inside crease of her elbow straightened up and smiled at the memory this evoked on the first morning kikun slid out of bed stretched and padded over to the basin he opened the cold tap wide cupped his hands to catch the stream of water splashed his face and delicate leafform ears the light streaming through the window beside the basin turned them into jade pale green and translucent he soaped a washcloth washed with care all the folds of skin on his face and body then round his sheath and testicles he extruded his bonewhite penis washed that with the same care let it slip neatly back and lifted his foot onto the basins edge and began to wash it when hed finished soaping himself he rinsed out the cloth and went over his body again with the same meticulous thoroughness cleaning away every trace of soap autumn rose lay with her fingers laced behind her head watching all this with bemused amusement he padded to one of the chairs shook out his trousers and tunic and pulled them on then slipped his feet into his sandals and turned to look at rose a challenge in his shining orange eyes or so she read what she saw there but all he said was dont forget to get a key made she frowned its going to be a problem isnt it you go out i forget about you so i forget everything to do with you how do i remember the key thing or anything else im supposed to do for you yes he scratched the folds beneath his chin ive been thinking about this he crossed to the bed rested his fingertips on her wrist may i for an instant she hesitated but curiosity and need were more powerful than her faint revulsion whatever unless you start biting off chunks of me he grinned then bent and nuzzled the inside of her elbow rubbing his nostrils against her moving back and forth back and forth his skin soft as old leather warm she kicked her heels against the bitt it sent shivers of heat along her body when he did that youll remember now he said then went quickly to the door and was out and gone before shed recovered enough to answer him he was rightoh yes she wriggled on the smooth worn top of the bit every morning after that he did the same and left she understood what he was doing after shed thought about it he must have scent glands at the base of his nostrils he was marking her she couldnt actually smell anything but she certainly didnt forget him again she rubbed her thumb across the place where he nuzzled her and wondered if there were pheromones in the exudate she was getting so hot it was a wonder she didnt burn his nose long hectic time since shed laid down in lust she licked her thumb grinned mocking herself that was her grandda talking through her she wouldnt exist if he hadnt done a lot of laying about in lust himself engendering her mama in his scattershot sowing but he was a hypocrite without peer she giggled again well in the end he was mostly peering if what mama said was right hypocrite about women yes the few times hed actually beaten her were when hed heard her cursing one or another of the chateau boys tied up my tongue when it comes to sex anyway digby would say he didnt do much for my working vocab the wind was getting stronger and most of the color had died out of the clouds a raindrop splattered in her hair she swore hugged her arms across her breasts where the hell is that little worm she freed one arm brought her hand close to her eyes so she could see the ringchron supposed to be here a good twenty minutes ago if i have to winkle him out of some hole ill twist that rat into his boots there wont be a grease spot left there werent any ships right where she was sitting through there were a number on both sides of her sailing ships the wind and the swell making them rock and rub against the fenders their wood sides creaking their ropes slapslatting with monotonous regularity the men down by the incinerator had stopped talking they were watching her she pushed her arms into the jacket sleeves pulled it closer around her it was getting cold and dangerous vaarlords didnt waste good money on useless lights they had guards and torchmen if they wanted to go out after dark five minutes worm bungkuk slid out of the alley and squatted in the shadows on the side of the bitt away from the incinerator fife pera he muttered i am haffing got all you are asking nothing till i hear then well see he fished in his vest brought out a packet wrapped in leaves with finicking small gestures he peeled back the outer layer of leaves and bit of a section of the plug inside kunja root chewing busily a strong musky oversweet odor rising from him he refolded the leaves and put the packet away he dropped his arms onto his knees and contemplated the heavy heaving water after a moment he spat wiped his mouth you are giffing me fife names ia so syous uppato he is being hilangiceer you are understanding hilang gone vanished more than that estralluar it is meaning put down a hole not something he was

tjis is liking to squeeze anabody gif im the chance for the fun a it he set his fists together and turned them in opposite directions while he chattered his teeth on the sixth day kikun said i followed granzadoman the past three days he runs errands sometimes but mostly just hangs about i saw him meet people get money from them decided i should see what i could see about them trailed more than one of them back to the troc istana thats the high vaars little shack looks to me like hes an informer ill pay for those two she said go on bungkuk excavated the wad from his mouth pitched it into the water wiped his lips with the back of his hand hary prechar is doing drugs y name it he is going to be hafing it i am not knowing what you are needing from this lot but hary is being no good for anathing but pops it is being a very bad idea to hit im for cash is being even worse to get names or like that he is having so many blocks is taking him half hour to be getting into his own head he is letting effabody know this he is not liking pain is so on the ninth day kikun came dragging in when she asked him what hed got he shook his head was looking into prechar he said cant get close to him not even me hes busy all right got people going in his place all hours in and out never staying long hes paying off the local vaarmanta got the city guards keeping order shooing people on if they hang about too long kikun shuddered what i saw of him hes crazy smells like hes going to implode any minute just as well we keep as far away from that one as from granzadoman and theres this if i make too much of a point of my being in a place the thing doesnt work rose so i cant fool around there without getting pinned be easier to get at the high vaar he sighed flung himself onto the windowseat what about you rose you come up with anything she rolled over pushed up on her elbow i found a skambler a hustler she said a mangy little driedup mouse who knows things name of bungkuk we had a conversation in the park where i met those angatines and the blind one laid the curse on me they werent there thank whatever hes going to meet me round sundown the wharf across the street from here you be careful rose she grinned lazily at him its not like i havent done this before kuna ill have a stunner in my pocket and eyes in my backhair right she said thats three ill buy it go on sai jinksay he is knowing effabody is doing a bit of effathing is having no high contact but if you are wanting to put together a small deal not too complicated is the man you are wanting to see or if you maybe are wanting to find someone he can do that downside she pushed her hands into her jacket pockets shivered as another stray raindrop splattered across her face tjis no he is not selling it he is getting his throat cut if he is selling it but beza preszao is having him picked up effa so offen and is squeezing him dry the squeeze is being due any day now it is being only to wait a week or so if you are wanting to use him hmm right go on jao juhfeyn huh he is being different from the others he is being offworlder but he is being connect you knowing what i mean is being married to high varmantianne mostly he is being taffernaman the kipuny shimmery is being his place where people are coming for meeting without guards ofer effa shoulder or where they are coming for playing ffagnag without taxman or tjis are sniffing about their winnings and losings jao is knowing more things and more people than jinksay but efen high faar is not putting squeeze on him is being too useful for wasting he dont be talking he dont be bothering anabody they dont be bothering him he snapped his fingers at her the sharp breaking sounds almost lost in the whine of the wind is being payday estralluar she sat hunched over the cold beginning to strike to the bone a lot of what hed told her shed already found out for herself either her or kikun but there was enough new there to justify the price plus the fact she was fertilizing a source besides it wasnt her money she was spending not coming from an expense account shed have to fight digby on blood out of a stone any old day right she said finally worth five she took her right hand from her pocket dropped the pouch into his twitching fingers as he counted and felt each coin she could almost smell him speculating about her possible vulnerability and how much cash she might be carrying and she knew the moment he decided it was better to go with what he had be you wanting more he muttered you are knowing how to find me the sounds of his movements covered by the wind he went scurrying off she ran her hands through her hair it felt stiff and wet beaded with sweat and condensation from the chilling air best have a bath tonight she thought wash the mop or ill be scratching everywhere hmm wonder if ive got pale roots showing better fix that she glanced down the wharf the men at the incinerator were still watching her she got to her feet shook her hands and arms then went strolling off her senses alert her hand on the stunner in the pocket of her jacket it was only a step to the rooming house but one of the first things digby had ground into her was closest to your base is your biggest danger in the narrow way between the warehouses the wind mugged her as she walked snatching at her blowing gravel against her hard enough to bruise her even through the heavy cloth of her trousers there was a cluster of sounds behind her a scrape another several small crackles she didnt bother looking back just moved as quickly as she could without actually running the street was dark and empty and getting damp as the rain started falling steadily there were a few lights from windows in her rumachs facade and from other rumachs along the street pale amber squares with dark lines of bars crossing them not much illumination on a night without moon or stars she slowed once she was out of the alley strolled across the street the short hairs on the back of her neck were standing up and itching like crazy in her righthand pocket she slid back the sensor cover on the stunner felt the handle vibrate minutely against her palm in her lefthand pocket she separated out the front door key and held it ready when she was about to step from the street onto the short wooden walkway leading to the stairs and the front door she heard another a flurry of scuffs coming on his toes the oofnarc she whipped round triggered the stunner and dropped him a heavy dark figure a blob in the slanting rain bulky without grace in his standing or falling then she was back around sprinting up the walk thrusting the key into the lock she made sure the door was locked and started for the stairs the concierge looked out her wicket saw that rose was alone and going quietly about her business went back to what shed been doing rose unclamped her hand from around the stunner blessing whoever it was whod invented the thing the cretin out there who tried his chances hed wake in a couple hours with a sore head and maybe a touch of pneumonia to give him an incentive to stay the hell away from her no body for her to explain to the authorities she climbed the stairs groaning silently each time she had to lift her weary legs another step old she decided thats what it is im old and crazy she sighed switched keys and unlocked her door kikun was waiting for her a shadow in the windowseat she felt a jolt in her groin felt herself flushing bright red she cursed her thin skin and blessed the dimness in the room only one candle lit and that one the width of the room away on the table by the bed he probably felt none of this churning and would be horribly embarrassed if he noticed so would she she liked to have things very clear and limited between her and the occasional lovers she acquired ambiguity and uncertainty were threatening she tossed her jacket on the bed crossed to the basin and washed her hands splashed water on her face then sat on the bed and tugged her boots off still without saying anything she swung around with enough violence to make the bed squeak under her and stretched out the pillow folded under her head her fingers laced over her stomach kikun coughed a failure at covering a chuckle hard day she wrinkled her nose thumped her thumbs on her stomach cool down she told herself come on rose dont be a fool its not his fault youre hot to trot shayss what a phrase digby would never let me forget it if he heard me hard night she said nearly got jumped not a problem i think just some shisskop after spare change she gave him a quick summary of what shed learned from bungkuk you get anything more i took a look at the kipuny shimmery didnt try to go in busy place even early i went over before noon then i went to the auctionhouse where sai has a grungy officetwo rooms third floor bayside got a hulk guarding the place he sits in a corner with his feet up chewing a cud of kunja a ottoshot on his lap big as he is that thing ever goes off itll knock out the whole front wall two overage whores answer com for him and take messages when theres nothing doing which seems to be most of the time they chatter away one of them does tapestry the other works on lace i suppose theyre doing it for money he cant be paying them much from what the women were complaining about hes almost never there he stays out massaging his contacts and keeping his links clear with the different kevars two calls came in while i was sitting in a corner watching one was a merchant looking for a shipper willing to go south he didnt say much but apparently theres some problem involved so he cant go through the hiring hall the other was a shipmaster looking for cargo specific cargo which he seemed to think sai knew all about hmm sounds like he has possibilities youd better see if you can get a look at him find out his patterns so we can lift him out say we have to ill take the kipuny shimmery she let her eyes droop closed then forced them open she was very very tired she wanted a bath before she slept but if she didnt shift herself soon shed be waking up come morning with her clothes on and a mouth like something died in it kipuny shimmery she sighed and started watching the candle shadows dance across the high ceiling bungkuk says they play vagnag there she said her voice dreamy they tell you about my grandda no hnh he was an important man you know almost as important as he thought he was when i was born he was ceo botanicals division cazar company we were living in the chateau in juoda city klan karra he never acknowledged my mama was his daughter but he kept her close and ran her like she was his slave didnt quite kill the life in her but he turned her sour i remember well never mind the man who was supposed to be my father he ran off mama said he got killed somewhere she thought or maybe just dived down a deep hole grandda raged for days when she got pregnant wouldnt see me for almost a year after i was born dont know why he didnt make her abort me or boot her out or something well yes i do it wasnt that we were family we were property and anyone who laid a hand on us was robbing him my sire that oofnarc he scuttled like a rat he knew he was a dead man if he stayed it wasnt that that made mama so mad it was because he didnt even ask her if she wanted to get out with him she was still furious about that the day she died wouldnt ve gone she said but at least he could ve asked anyway what got me on this was vagnag when i got old enough to talk grandda used to keep me around like his dogs long as i had sense enough to stay quiet said i was his mascot brought him luck he had this thing about gambling games vagnag especially he wanted to work out a way to win consistently without the downanddirty cheating which could get you killed in the company he liked to play with i got so bored there was nothing to do but watch him and his sharks going at it so i learned the games they played she sighed yawned big mistake one day he caught me playing my own version of vagnag with the chateau boys taking money off them because i used to win most of the time and it wasnt because they were letting me win i was just the chateau bastard even the sweep was more respectable than me at least he had real family family to claim him anyway i was about six regular little prodigy a natural mimic with a trick memory impressed the hell out of grandda which surprised me scared me actually he wasnt an easy man with kids and id heard nasty stories all my life about the kind of things he did to people when he was mad at them so i didnt like it much when he started paying real attention to me besides life went sour on me after that he brought in men women had them teach me everything they knew about playing all kinds of games especially vagnag fifteen years of hell thats what it was kuna hour after hour day after day manipulation math and aerobics and weightlifting took all that and more i ran away a couple times he jerked me back third time was the winner he was just settling in at a new place moving up using me to get where he wanted i ran when i got a smell of a chance and this time i got clear had a pretty good life for a while yeh walking the knifeblade you can understand maybe what i felt finally free of grandda and his strings well after a wild ride i fell off the blade i ran into this oofnarc who thought he was hot stuff papa was a local bigass with a lot of pull the oofnarc lost accused me of cheating and tried to jump me real loser i didnt mean to kill him i was trying to keep him off clumsy cretin it was like he threw himself on the knife the other players disappeared i only knew their handles and gambling was illegal anyway on that world so they were outta there i hadnt a hope in hell of getting off it was the stranglers cord for me i was so damn scared i was almost ready to yell for grandda not that he would ve come she stopped talking and lay gazing dreamily at the shadowplay on the ceiling kikun shifted on the cushions what happened huh jolted out of her drowse she turned her head to look toward the shadow in the chair how did you get out of that oh she pushed up swung her legs over the edge and sat with her head in her hands it was digby he sent one of his ops to make a deal hah she straightened up the op would spring me if i either paid digbys fee or went to work for him digby i mean she pushed onto her feet grabbed a robe off the foot of the bed im for a bath if im going to get into a game at the shimmery i cant be so ripe no one will sit next me the door was three massive planks with a dalbir jug carved in low relief head high in the center plank she pushed the door open and stepped into a long room with bare roof beams and smoky lubrinjahoil lanterns hanging from those beams it was a warm and rosy room the amber lamplight waking amber and crimson lights in the smoky oily wood and the crimson leather on the stools funny she thought all the worlds ive been on a bar is a bar is a bar there were groups of men sitting at tables others on stools at a long solid counter by the inner wall it was built atop a kneehigh platform that was just wide enough for the scatter of stools they must lose a lot of drunks on that she thought fall off and break their necks oh well thats their problem the low mutter of talk died away as she moved into the room picked up again as she strolled to the bar relaxed and easy for the first time on this world she was in really familiar territory she was the only woman here but shed met that before it just meant she had to be quiet and quick to establish her credentials there was a brass grab rail under the counters edge she ignored it stepped up and settled herself on one of the ladder legged stools the other patrons made their hostility felt the weight of their stares tried to push her out of the place she ignored that knocked on the wood to summon the barman sitting on his own stool leaning against the cabinets behind him he took his time about coming but he did come and something in the way he moved tickled at roses memory she kept her face calm tried to trace the tickle who he set his hands on the bar played a small impatient tune with his thumbs there was a tiny white scar below his left thumbnail three lobed like a classic flurdelli yes well and well and well abruptly she was back in an ivory and gilt room and he was seated across from her at the vagnag table she blinked something in a local wine white and dry she said no gahwang in it i hope its a tasty herb but rather overused dont you think she spoke in interlingue not the local patter the first step in settling what she was rather too much of a good thing yes he nodded without speaking and went off returning with a glass bottle stoppered with waxed leather rolled into a tight bundle he showed it to her removed the stopper with an odd misshapen gripping tool poured a little in a glass and passed the glass to her she checked the scar again yes its him she tasted the wine concealed a grimace as it bit back itll do she said she wore a simple black dress back then avrishum from jaydugar outrageously expensive a gift from her last lover but one he probably stole it but she wasnt fussy about provenance those days and appreciated the thought though she didnt appreciate the occasion that induced the gift a black dress doesnt erase a black eye hed vanished one day killed she thought and moved on taking the dress with her lost it that time she got in trouble on tyurm mourned the gift a lot more than the giver that night her hair was braided and pomaded and set with jade and pearls with a necklace of jade beads and pearls dipping into the deep vee of the dress three of the men in the game werent professionals or obsessive gamblers they had eyes for more than their cards shed dressed for them he was the fourth man quiet thin and almost too handsome when he sat down and brushed at his sleeve fingers signaling a pro she was annoyed shed gone to a lot of trouble setting up this game and was irritated to find another of her guild intruding onto her pasture she drew her right forefinger along her jawline flicked it from under her chin sign for back off these are mine he smiled and tapped thumb against thumb the first time shed seen the scar challenge she didnt hesitate tugged at her left earlobe agreed they fought their war under the noses of the other players stripping the marks almost as an afterthought the last chapter was between them all for all the dice and the cards had gone for her and she was just enough cleverer in her play to clean table pen and holse he bowed and walked off smiling a flicker of his fingers congratulating her and acknowledging her victory he had reason for the smile hed cleaned table in at least half the chapters and won holse twice the last chapter had put a hole in those winnings but hed doubled his stake and that was enough to satisfy all but the pickiest she left that night on a free trader going elsewhere at a leisurely pace and before she slept she wriggled with a pleasure she hadnt felt in years it was a good hard fight and shed enjoyed it enormously she sipped at the wine and watched the man move off to stow the bottle in the cabinet hed got it from driving the stopper in with the palm of his hand and laying the bottle flat this was a long way down from that she sighed for both of them in some ways he should have gotten that scar removed why hed kept it she hadnt a clue unless it was a mascot of some kind ah well ah well thats the way it goes he was good but he wasnt first rank even at his peak and hed been sliding from second the last time shed seen him where was that cazarit lumilly no i cant remember long time ago she sipped at the wine and thought pleasant thoughts those days shed lived hard and fast everything was sunbright and coalblack the ups were shining soaring joy and the downs were misery condensed shed lived a calmer life since shed hired on with digby there were satisfactions in that but sometimes she yearned for the old times she downed the last of the wine knocked her knuckles on the wood and straightened her shoulders as he got the bottle out again and brought it to her there was still some of his bone beauty left but he was wrinkled now like old parchment left in the rain and put away wet and there was something odd about the left side of his face stroke or wound maybe bad dye job on the hair a dead black that left him looking older than god traggan she said as he filled the glass again the silver circus forty some years ago remember she brushed at her sleeve flickered her fingers through the prosign he set the glass down pushed the stopper home they call me hadluk here been some changes howd you know im rose was blonde then in black avrishum she nodded as she saw recognition flare in his eyes finally she thought the coloring is camouflage she reached out ran the tip of her forefinger over the tiny scar you dont want folk to know you you should get rid of that he shrugged here who cares the wines twenty kuries a pop she set a silver pera on the bar watched him sweep it away count out her change in the copper kuries ah well way it goes word is you run vagnag here not me he drew his thumb down the subtly distorted left side of his face past it rose long past it gray market ananiles bad batch burnt gaps in the old brain cant do the calcs any more too bad i would have enjoyed another pass she didnt mean it but it was the polite thing to say buy yourself a drink on me old times she pushed the coppers back at him to pay for her second drink and his signed to him to keep the change and watched amused as he chose a different bottle to pour for himself he swallowed shuddered one eyelid drooping he leaned against the wall cabinets hip hitched on the flat top heard you hit a slippery patch a while back wheel turns hadluk just let me make the right connections and its all back again he nodded but she could see pity and a flare of malice in his dark eyes hed lost his face no wonder he quit he must have started growing tells like weeds need a stake he said wariness replacing pity no she didnt elaborate and he asked no more questions humming under his breath he began playing finger games on the bar short nails adding an edge to the thumping of his fingertips rose tapped a counter rhythm these were pleasant little sounds innocuous but by the time they broke off their game theyd bargained out his commission for introducing her to a game his percentage of the take and set a time for her to show back here she took a swallow of the wine i dont want to come on as a whore she said give me the local protocols hmm long skirt arms covered in the evening thats important bare arms after dark are an advert of intent ill dig something up she drank the last of the wine pushed the glass away before i show see the others know i dont play on my back huh that hasnt changed huh he grinned at her a tinge of red in the whites of his eyes whatever he was drinking it was powerful stuff dont worry ill pass the word on thanks she slid off the stool see you when autumn rose hurried along the jagged semistreet heading for the market she needed to pick up something she could wear without binding herself into so much material shed be hampered if she had to fight and something she wouldnt be embarrassed to be seen in and something that was neither so expensive it was a temptation nor so cheap and flimsy she lost face with the players she plunged across a dark sideway flinched as a group of angatines came out of the shadows and began to wail at her cursing she turned down the next opening turned again and yet again losing them finally almost losing herself before she stopped her flight and began working her way back to the market this was what the tenth eleventh time theyd ambushed her they were getting to be more than a nuisance jumping out at her everywhere with the same accusing plaint she was a demon come to do harm to the people no one seemed to pay much attention to them but you could never tell what spark would set the locals off when she followed hadluk into one of the back rooms there were already half a dozen men seated at the vagnag table she settled into the empty chair rose she said nodded at hadluk he went out the man at her right gathered up the eightsided dice handed them to her he was an offworlder probably a freetrader big burly blueblack with a noble nose like a hawks beak jutting from the gray fur on his face he wore a long robe earth colors in a violent design heavy gold earrings dangled from long lobes brushing against his massive neck tayteknas he rumbled at her he tell you she took the dice remembering with pleasure the feel of the crisp points against her palm the cool facets she hefted them judging the weight the feel the sound as they clicked together yes she thought yes she said aloud she dropped the dice on the table and watched them dance then settle she reached into one of the large pockets the skirt came equipped with took out the sack and laid out three gold emas on the ledge in front of her next to these she lined up five piles of four silver peras each she took one ema and flipped it into the holse the circle drawn in the center of the dark blue felt whos marker tayteknas tapped a blue black finger against the front of his robe me whats high so far double eight plus three hmp vakkar all gone youre the last i see she gathered the three dice held them a moment warming in her hand feeling for the rhythmthe beginnings of the rhythm it wasnt there yet but it would come the smell of the table came up around her a subtle aroma rising from the felt the paint on it the coins the blend of odors drifting from the mena smell that brought memories rushing back some places the game rules wouldnt let you handle the dice you had to use a cup to throw them and a scoop to pick them up this wasnt that big a game just as well she rattled the dice rolled them out watched them dance across the felt there was tumult in her then a vigor shed lost for years a joy shed made herself forget the yellow dice flickered over the dark blue felt then slowed and rocked to rest skotsker she said with satisfaction six and eight and five tayteknas grunted vakkar rules skotsker he said pulleet first rose second barangkaly third tayteknas fourth kahtik fifth uj sixth nikeldy seventh he broke the seal on a deck of vagnag cards peeled off the wrappings all entries in the holse he reached down brought the rake from where it was hanging on the table cleared the seven gold coins from the painted circle to a painted halfcircle nuzzling against the side of the table entries in the sump open one pera raise limit fifty ema he took a silver coin tossed it into the holse set the deck on the felt and used the rake to push it across to pulleet pulleet was a small dark man with pale splotches on his face irregular pink yellow tan areas breaking up the chocolate brown over the rest of him pigment deficit the result of disease or birth defect offworlder probably freetrader he had small hands the skin on them blotchy like his face he handled the cards with a deftness and dedication she could appreciate and dealt them out in packets of three to each of the players in the order given matching names to faces for rose nikeldy was another offworlder freetrader most likely quiet little man forgettable kahtik wore a university ring engineers compass laid into the jewel freetech no companies on this world some freetechs were erratic but brilliant some were merely adequate kahtik looked middlish reasonably prosperous but not flying the highwire vagnag was a game of combinations and probabilities as a universitytrained engineer hed be high on math skills if his game sense was as good hed be a formidable player barangkaly was a rummer a local merchant shed seen him in the market he had several booths selling cloth and herbs uj was a local too the paint on his face said he was one of the vaarmanta whatever else he was was not immediately apparent though she had her suspicions and wasnt happy about them second seat she didnt like being second in the first seat she could influence the flow of play in the last seat shed have the advantage of seeing the styles of all the other players here she had neither advantage she had to give before she got she picked up her first set hanged man runner and four diamond two picture cards not bad not great either she folded the set together and laid it down waiting until the dealing was finished the sets landed neatly in front of each the players three more small piles face down on the felt pulleet placed the remaining cards in the sump by his pen a rectangle painted on the felt tossed the opener into the holse he looked at his first set folded them and placed them face down on the ledge before him all his moves quick and neat and precise he scooped up the dice clacked them vigorously and threw them out three twos a triple blakkro without visible reaction he swept up his cards chose two and set the third face down on the ledge he laid the two cards face up in the pen seven triangle three diamond contemplated the backs of the other three sets and chose another card from the middle pile he looked at it a moment still without expression laid it face up in the pen a three spot beside the three diamond it was a strong opening the lady had kissed both cards and dice he looked thoughtfully at the coins on the ledge took a gold ema and added it to the silver already in the holse took another ema set it in the pen challenging table in a second level stake moved an ema and two peras onto the number gridtable wager on the probable gap between his count and any other highlow tayteknas raked the dice over to rose she scooped them up rattled and threw them and swore under her breath one six and seven a koetta bust she couldnt turn a card or put one down ticktock what to do shayss damn think i have to count this chapter a loser still lets see what we can finesse get the rhythm back and not go down too bad theres still the claiming round more vags have been pulled from the sump than won straight out besides im here for information not prizes she smiled with sweet confidence took a pera and an ema and tossed them to the holse stay as she said and laid the set on the ledge barangkaly scooped up the dice flung them out with an expansive curl of his arm three three nine bijjet one of the highest throws possible z toyff she thought this how its going to go everybody but me he beamed at the dice flipped his cards over with an extravagant exuberance dropped them into the pen without bothering to look at them danced his fingers over the other three sets chose a card flipped it over shifted it to the pen chose another started a second line in the pen two dancers a clown a lancer and a seven sword takabul only a step from a sudden win if his luck held through the claiming round he had this chapter sewn he tossed the ante pera and a push ema in the holse lay down another two emas in the pen and spread a scatter of peras about the grid the play went on pass round claiming round pass and claim for the four doubles of each chapter rose went down badly on the first chapter the dice were all right after the first round but the combinations were miserable and nothing she could do during the claimings was enough to make up for the weak sets barangkaly continued his expansive style and rode his luck to a win in the first chapter but went down and down on those that followed second chapter rose still had bad cards but finessed a tie with pulleet who she judged the second best player at the table tayteknas was a steady though not brilliant player kahtik was tight overly cautious wasting opportunities rose relaxed he was no threat uj was mostly cautious but he had a propensity for wild chances that sometimes paid off and sometimes didnt he was unexpected difficult to readand she got a strong feeling from the others that it wasnt a good idea to challenge him when his calls were questionable lice she thought one of the papa policers boys nikeldy was a plodding player negligible he sweat a lot and lost consistently even with fair hands she won the third chapter outright and after that could have won them all she had the measure of the players and the rhythm of the game but thought it wasnt wise to clean them out especially uj the fourth chapter she split with uj the fifth she dropped out early they took a nosh break between the fifth and sixth chapters the usual time this was the time shed come for when the relaxation of the tension from the game also relaxed internal censors and a lot of good gossip got going the shimmery had set up a nosh table along the wall with local wines teas and a version of kaff which smelled to her like burnt toast rose filled a plate with fingerfood and a glass with the white varnish she was developing a taste for it went well with the nibbles the shimmery provided cutting the force of the ghawang that the rummer cooks seemed to put in everything she sipped chewed circulated mostly listening contributing a nod of her head here a murmur of agreement there her ears stretched to catch anything remotely relevant to her search kahtik signed a query wondering if she might be freetech also effortlessly she returned an assent aware of uj watching both of them stayed where she was as the freetech drifted over to her hunting his voice was high flat there was a scar on his throat from a wound that had almost decapitated him with meatfarms available to anyone with an income like his had to be she didnt understand why he hadnt had that scar fixed some kind of perverse pride in the narrowness of his escape no i just came off a job scratching an itchy foot anything around bigger than local he grinned at her whats the need if youre not looking she rubbed her thumb back and forth across her fingertips never turn down a chance at cash im industrial design whatre you programs and systems just as well youre not in the market aint any not here not for that unless the mimishay foundation he ran his eyes over her shook his head and they wouldnt hire you why not im damn good though its me who says it youre female they dont hire women their loss you play a helluva game she winked at him programs and systems tall helps he glanced past her flickered his fingers at her in the twitter of the digits a takecare sign and drifted off uj moved around in front of her sipping at a hot fruity drink new round here he said he had a commonplace voice under the paint an ordinary face he was neither tall nor short dark nor light shadowman his edges shifting with the shifts of the wind hmm she said your ordinary tourist she inspected her plate selected a small roll of meat wrapped round a piece of fruit and took a bite of it um she chewed swallowed this is good what is it uj smiled a grimace that bared his teeth and got nowhere near his eyes babi slin he said why our world no reason just general wanderfoot she popped the rest of the babi slin into her mouth chewed and washed it down with a gulp of wine i finished a job here in the callidara and decided to take a look round not a trader then no freetech programs and systems looking for work not really this is playtime of course if i got a good offer she matched his toothend smile visiting friends no i dont know anyone here footloose and fancy free mostly looking for games i have a thing for vagnag its not that often one can get a really good game if one isnt in the megagelder range she found another babi slin bit into it and this is a good game she raised a brow fair if you should happen to get an offer yes there are certain formalities there always are yes i see youre experienced in this he put a peculiar twist on the word experienced that gave her a chill at the bottom of her stomach come see me i would be delighted to facilitate matters for you how kind she said sipping at the wine she drifted off complications rather do without complications the play went on pass round claiming round pass and claim for the four doubles of each chapter she played carefully winning more than she lost deliberately letting chances go by when uj looked like winning she wanted him to go away happy yes and without too much interest in her again and again as the hours wore on she felt his eyes on her read speculation that was an uneasy combination of sexual and professional by the time they reached the twelfth and traditionally last chapter in a game like this though she didnt let it show she was beginning to be very worried about how she was going to shuck uj when it came time to leave might have to try outsitting him call on hadluks tenuous goodwill or something as they moved into the last chapter barangkaly dealing the air was stale the lubrinjah oil was low in the lamps and her eyes were stinging with the effluvium coming through the chimneys and the strain of trying to see by the dim flickering light she inspected her first set sighed the cards were too good a vagnateka triad itd take a really foul chance at the dice to negate this the highest combine available it hurt her to think of breaking up a vtek but there was no way she was going to win this chapter barangkaly threw and went bust koetta he spread his hands out shayss she thought that narrows the focus and im last up this time if uj busts out tayteknas tossed the ante pera into the holse threw a one three six siettran he dropped a ten heart into the pen set a pera beside it for the table but stayed out of the holse and off the grid passed the dice on kahtik threw siettran inspected his cards shook his head out he said he collected his cards blended them into a single pile and set them on the ledge in front of him then he took out a square white cloth wiped each of the coins in the piles beside the cards tucked them neatly away into an inside pocket or perhaps a money safe sewn into his vest uj scooped up the dice sat holding them loosely in his hand his eyes closed autumn rose tensed if he busted he tossed the dice smiled three fours triple telvi he examined his set lay them down and squared them option he said took up each of the three other sets and examined them shifted several cards about placed the sets face down on the felt done he said rose started breathing again she looked around saw pulleet watching her his mouth hitched up in a brief smile matching his relief with hers he touched the left top corner of his set moved a pile of coins onto the left bottom corner scratched at his chin she tapped her chin lifted one coin set it back without letting it clink well well not a freetrader after all like me a ringer good old hadluk hasnt lost it as much as i thought finessing himself a double cut pulleet had been playing the table more than the holse and had done comfortably well so far though she thought none of the others realized just how well since he had a habit of stowing his wins away after each chapter hed done better than her despite her holse wins done it on tiptoe as it were clever little man she bubbled inside with laughter and relief though she was careful not to let it show they could be better slotted being like they were they lost leverage still the claiming round was coming up and with a little bit of luck they could make uj think he was fingers harry himself if he didnt do something terminally stupid which he was quite capable of hed already done several moronic plays like this wasting a play just looking at his cards nikeldy threw another siettram looked at his cards and the single pera remaining in front of him he squared the set dropped it on the felt out pulleet threw seven six two marstori a middle level pass he dropped two cards in the pen a dancerlancer combine she smiled when she saw them good with the clown and a hanged man she held that was almost vagnag if somewhere in his sets uj had a seer a witch or a magicianor a wilder of necessary degree to depute for them he could do a major claim with the possibility of making a small large or double vag uj pulled out a small vag and play went on he was exultantbut he didnt forget her he looked at her with a proprietary gleam in his eyes that sent cold chills down her spine he flew from triumph to triumph face flushed getting wilder and wilder infuriating rose and pulleet who had a real struggle to win only the small secondary stakes and leave the holse gelt for him tayteknas suspected what they were doing but he kept his hunches to himself dropping out early or playing table when he got the chance the others plunged or teetered according to their natures final pass round before the dealing began the door opened and a cloud of dasuttras came in with kaff and tea and small cloths dampened with scented water their palms were dyed pink more dye was burnished into their nails dyeflowers were stamped on their bodies a graceful spray spread across the swell of their breasts single blooms in the center of the brow and on each cheek they fluttered about the players their filmy draperies whisper whispering caressing whatever they touched three dasuttras filled delicate porcelain cups with steaming local teas and set them on the ledge beside the players rose leaned back and let one of them have her hand while the other massaged her neck and shoulders she closed her eyes sighed with pleasure the tension going out of her drawn away by the warm wet cloths the skillful fingers of the masseuse she cracked an eye and sneaked a look at uj suppressed a grin lord of all he sees she thought shayss damn thats a pretty child playing with his neck she opened her eyes wider hadluk was standing in the doorway looking amused he met her eyes tapped his temple in a two finger salute and stepped out of sight he was a snake but an honest snake give him that the way uj was snorting at his attendants he was going to have little interest in fooling about after her probably well well she slid unnoticed from the room as uj preened himself before the dasuttras enjoying the minor triumph of sweeping last chapter nikeldy was chewing his large bottom lip as he tapped notes into a cardfile barangkaly gone morose stared at a wall now and then stroking his thumbnail down one or the other of his rattail mustaches kahtik stood withdrawn concentrating on his coins wiping them carefully with the white cloth before restowing them about his person tayteknas tossed down a cup of lukewarm kaff wiped at his mouth and checked his clothing to make sure he left with what he had when he came in none of them noticed her departure the taproom was noisy now filled with men and dasuttras three servers behind the bar none of them hadluk this way pulleet cupped his hand around her elbow turned her back into the hall and nudged her along it to a door in the end wall he knocked once said payday the door swung open hadluk was sitting behind a table that doubled duty as a desk loading penciled notes into an interface he looked up the distorted side of his face emphasized by his smile and his tiredness sorry about that he said he was speaking to autumn rose i didnt know uj was coming till he showed thought youd pick up on him but if you didnt he shrugged just in case he nodded at pulleet i called in a favor she dropped onto a backless chair lice big lice collector taking a double skim way it goes hes busy now not for all that long hes shorttime in the sack a whambam and goodbye he turned to pulleet how is she still got it yup he pulled his hand across his mouth frowned down at it been thinking he said you cleaned pretty much not flat but limping i have passage offworld if thats what youre on at nope wanta meet neutral ground angatine chapel no she didnt explain you get watersick no he looked down at his hands ran the edge of a thumbnail down the paper hed been reading not a bad idea that right we can have ourselves a picnic on one of those rocks out in the bay when tomorrow ill do the food you just be there gaunga wharf ill be thereout on the water watching you pick your island and ill join you better that way yes you really havent lost it have you so we all should hope she dropped the sac on his desk waited while he counted out his cut anything i should bring got a mute cone i do indeed battery operated she reclaimed the sac see you when when she turned to pull the door closed behind her she looked back the two men were nose to nose pulleet talking rapidly his hands fluttering hadluk listening so intently he wasnt aware of anything but the voice murmuring into his face two maybes she said kikun was withdrawn a shadow curled in the windowseat she wasnt sure he heard her but she went on she was mostly talking to herself anyway trying to get things straight theres something called the mimishay foundation i think its on one of the other islands they hire techs but they dont hire women could be omphalos under camouflage if the institute is into ransom theyd need a cutout in case theyre traced could be a thousand other things kikun stirred mimishay sai has a file on them he was silent a moment i only saw the directory and that by accident one of the exwhores accessed it for something else and i was looking over her shoulder that is not my gift rose working akurrpa machines lissorn and his crew taught me to play with them but working is something else i smell danger on this one time comes if theres need youll have to do the thing time comes well see if its all that tricky we might have to hire the talent there was a man tonight at the game a freetech he says hes into industrial engineering but i think he lied he said it too easily and he didnt like it when i claimed programs and systems he did friend well enough well as any of the techies do but his smiles stopped at his teeth way he played too hes into systems i think maybe he doesnt want competition second thing i ran into an acquaintance from the time before i signed on with digby he doesnt seem to know about that which is certainly plausible its a small world the game circuit you leave it and you might as well have dropped down a black hole hes got a thing he wants me in on something to do with a game i go along with him ive got some protection i think im going to need it he set me up the snake pointed one of the beza prezaos men at me he said he didnt know the man was going to be there ill believe that when it rains up he had a ringer in the game to see if id lost my edge pulled the lice off me when he got the signal from his ringer i dont think this has anything to do with why were here but if im going to keep on this track im going to have to go along with him she woke sometime later it was black outside and cold inside despite the half dozen candles burning on a plate kikun had set in the middle of the floor he was sitting crosslegged on the other side of the clump of candles his eyes like orange fire blind orange fire because it was obvious to her he was seeing nothing in the room he was looking into elsewhere yearning into elsewhere swaying on his buttocks chanting in monosyllables she watched for a while but it was like watching a flake show with the sound gone and youve come in the middle of it she turned over drew the covers up about her head and went to sleep dyslaera working toward escape rohant combed his thumbclaw through his mustache his palm hiding a smile his tiny hands braced on the bottom bar of the doorgrill miji leaned into the room his black eyes eager his neckfrills extended reassured he hopped through skittered across the floor to rohants leg he sniffed at the ankle patted at the soft bronze fur on the dyslaerors leg eeping with pleasure he rubbed his forepaws then the side of his face over and over that fur rohant waited miji put a forepaw on the frayed hem of rohants prison trousers he scratched at the worn canvas caught his tiny fingernails in it and abruptly scurried up the leg he didnt stop until he was perched on rohants shoulder nibbling at the dyslaerors mane kinefray twitched in his sleep convulsed rolled off the cot and hit the floor before azram could catch him his claws out his head banging repeatedly into the concrete he thrashed wildly until he was fully awake azram scrambled around cushioned his cousins head with his thighs and when he quieted helped him back on the cot do you remember what it was no kinefray saw the fresh rips in azrams sleeves shuddered something was after me i think ive got that wobbly feeling in my gut you know i know stretch out now on your back first azram began rubbing the back of kinefrays neck working on his shoulders theyve left us alone a whole week maybe theyve got what they want kinefray shuddered again began crying nezrakan lay curled in a fetal knot for three days hed refused to eat now he was too weak to move it didnt take a dyslaeror long to starve himself dead savant speaking to notepad note negotiations with the black house have slowed due to the need for a considerably greater security in handling the dyslaera also the difficulty in getting the value out of them since it would not be wiseor safeto advertise their presence also there is a degree of uncertainty as to how many dyslaera we will be able to provide note the cutouts have been arranged for the ransom demand clumsy setup but what happened when voallts went after seyirshi is more than ample evidence of the need for a careful distance kept between mimishay and voallts the rat with the message is on its way we should have the answer in about forty days rohant closed his eyes and concentrated he ran with miji as the sakali scooted through the tunnels heading for the pen and his exit into the open world though he couldnt see through mijis eyes like shadow he felt the coolness of the concrete under mijis feet felt the sakalis surge of fear felt the response of his muscles when he dived into shadow to avoid one of the warders he let the intensity drop and sat up it wasnt much and at the moment he had no idea how he could use the tie but he had to try something he sighed and settled to brood over what to do next shadow watching arring pirs held his son over his head so chal and chapa could see him the baby didnt like that he waved his small naked arms and legs and squawled his displeasure with a lusty enthusiasm that brought laughter and approving whistles from the chat and chapa of ghanar rinta gathered around the amurhill for the naming ceremony behold the son pirs chanted in the formal langue hear his name arringgarri paji knigo pirs ampa cagharadad nima procagharadad his voice escaped the bounds of the rite became a shout of pride and joy answered by a shout from the chat and chapa a restless fringe around the edges of the crowd the children of ghanar rinta gasped with pleasure shouted and whistled as the amurspeaker touched his torch to the conical pyre rising fifty meters from the top of the hill saturated with kerosene the wood caught immediately and the flames went running up the slope like an echo of pirs triumphant cry while the amurdrums rattled in the laps of the amurdeacons seated around the fire and the amurspeaker sang the litany of the son pirs dropped on his knee and held the baby out to his father for the artwa to bless the child and formally accept the boy into the family the drumbeat slowed quieted the speaker broke off the litany and waited chat and chapa and even the most boisterous of the children went quiet stood hushed and grave waiting this was the vital thing this was the pledge that their lives would be unchanged a small redfaced surety of continuance the artwa arring angakirs cagharadad spread his hands over the wriggling baby behold the son he chanted behold the summerday child the newest fruit on the tree of procagharadad behold the joy the promise i artwa procagharadad declare this boy irrkuyon of irrkuy i artwa procagharadad declare this boy blessed i artwa procagharadad call upon you the chal and chapa of ghanar rinta to declare your fealty to the son of ghanar rinta standing at the back of the crowd among the children shadith shifted from foot to foot scratched at her arm she was here because tinoopa turned maternal and dogmatic and dragged her along dont be an idiot tinoopa said you need their good will and you know it show your face and behave yourself child she watched as the rite went on and on thinking poor baby hes going to catch pneumonia if they dont wrap something around him no wonder boy babies had a hard time surviving jerks matja allina isnt even on the hill wouldnt you know come on come on get that poor baby back where he belongs let me get back where i belong old bastard i have to admit hes impressive times like this should keep him in a closet and just take him out when its time to chant something the amurspeaker spread scented oil over the babys body shadith wiggled her left bootheel on a dirtclod crushing it pirs hes riding high right now daddys spreading it thick almost cooing at him old warthog wonder what he wants hes got his boy the brushies are friendly and there havent been raids for the past eleven weeks enough to make any amnesiac happy well we get our papers out of this signed and locked away lovely so generous the man is as long as it doesnt cost him anything last night pirs called her and tinoopa into the study he showed them their contracts and the cancellation papers as they watched he signed his name stamped his seal on cancels i wanted you to see this he said in six months your year will be completed we will honor our promise as you have honored yours to the limit of ourability he folded the documents together laid his hands on them and waited for them to leave arring feelgood dispensing favors to his chosen favors with a calldate half a year off locked up somewhere in that study hmmmm mingas was up there on the hill standing behind his father it was the first time shadith had seen him and she didnt much like what she was seeing runt ugly pup in a way he was very like his spectacularly handsome kin but his individual features were larger their contours more rounded he was a head shorter and considerably bulkier it wasnt fat he was rock hard but he looked clumsy pudgy odd what a thin line it is between beauty and ugliness she reached touched him shied away almost immediately it was like touching acid behind that bland immobile face hate and rage were bubbling boiling her mouth twitched stick a pin in him and lolly save the ashes sar pirs took the baby down to allina helped her wrap him in his blankets on the hill the speaker blew into his horn signaling the end of the ceremony the chal and chapa went back inside the walls and the party began dinner with daddy slipped by with nothing much happening itd been a nothing much day the day after the nameday party chal and chapa dragging to work sour in breath and spirit tinoopas eyes were red as alert signals and she didnt want to talk about anything just got grimly on with her business shadith took the hint the fifth time tinoopa moved her aside so she could get something she went to her room and played at escape for a while the rest of the time she slept which was why her head was hammering right now and her own temper on a short leash paynto was playing some kind of shepherd song on his flute too many high notes they were digging holes in her brain she let her fingers find an accompaniment and tried to shut down her hearing ghineeli chal slipped from the kitchen door knelt beside shadith touched her arm when this is over she whispered matja allina says you dont need to come to her tonight feel free to do what you want she patted shadiths arm slipped away lovely more hours looking at walls she glanced at the screen sighed the three cagharadad were talking about shearing and problems with getting their goods offworld getting the money back wandering desultorily from topic to topic none of it meaning anything all of it embroidery on a tension growing between them a tension that had nothing to do with what they were saying she didnt understand it and that put a cold shiver in her belly she didnt trust them even pirs they could explode in any direction any time they were drinking the bottle of brandy the artwa had brought to celebrate the name day pirs was trying to enjoy himself rapidly getting drunk as usual he was ignoring anything he didnt want to know about the artwa was waiting to spring spider in his hole he wanted something and was sure he knew how to get it mingas simmered she didnt know him well enough to know how much of that was standard and how much aroused by whatever it was that waited for pirs his glass was still half full hed taken a sip at each toast no more if tinoopa was here shed say never trust a man who wont get drunk with his own family the artwa cleared his throat looked at mingas mingas hurried around the table pulled his fathers chair out as the artwa stood help your brother angakirs said waited until mingas was standing behind the arring pirs i want to talk to you lets go into your study pirs blinked his eyes were clear the blue as brilliant as ever his face was slightly flushed but he showed no other sign of how much brandy hed consumed study he said amiably he didnt move stand up the artwa snapped at his son annoyed because hed misjudged pirs capacity take his arm mingas dont just stand there help him shadith kept playing because paynto kept playing same song over and over he didnt stop until the study door boomed shut then he sighed shook out his flute another night killed he said wonder when hes going home impajin grunted he stretched shook himself lets get they nodded at shadith left she stood slipped her arm through the arrangas carry strap went out through the kitchen she sat on the bed pulled her boots off balancing the left boot on her thighs she slid her fingers into the slit and drew out the braincrystal knife it was still there in spite of everything overlooked in its incarnation as a stay stiffening the soft leather sides of the boot since the main court had to be kept for the name day party the artwas skimmer was parked outside the walls guarded of course but the guards were probably as drunk as pirs by now most of them anyway might have a designated drynose might not when the cagharadads get out of the study she held the knife up the candlelight shivering along the blade then she sighed and eased it back into the boot and dropped that boot beside the other i could do it theyre used to seeing me in there i could get the papers grab the skimmer and run for nirtajai but she knew she wouldnt a runaway chapa was one thing a skimmer thief was something else the artwaes would stop a war to go after someone stupid enough to steal a skimmer thatd be an attack where it hurt an attack on their power even if she managed to reach nirtajai and found a skipcom and got the call out shed still have to hang around until whoever was picking her up could get here travel time you cant get around travel time shed have to hide to survive without allies and with a price on her head that would tempt an anchorite no too much downside well you know what it is shadow you just dont want to face that long lone ride she thought about rohant and the dyslaera winced quickly away from that omphalos had them she had to do something about that she couldnt while she was still a prisoner here she flung herself around face down on the bed she didnt want to think she reached and found a rodent burrowed into one of the walls of the study teased it out and sent it running from shadow to shadow until it was under a bookcase near where the three men were sitting she made it curl up there nose on its forepaws and listened through its ears hot kirtaa angakirs was saying you know about probrantarradad s been going on forever we nibble at them they nibble at us she heard creaks and cushion whispers as pirs shifted in his chair i know we get kurns tumaks out here when he comes up with the cash to hire them well he picked up a backer two weeks ago kamaachadad old mulyas and kurn had a secret meeting round then kamaachadad found out who carried his daughter off a couple years ago bitch she went willing eager even rintirry swore it trouble is she ran off tried to abort the cub and bled to death that chalwhat was his name dont remember its not important the one rintirry made so much of once tirry was dead he got to feeling utilas wasnt treating him right and he ran off to the brush but before he did he sold us mulyas sent me the warblade a week ago along with the kind of letter a sane man would have burned he hit us at caghar rinta the next day it was a close thing pirs kamaachadad amur bless hes got more sons than he has chals five less now rintirry damn his soul to hell why mingas stirred cleared his throat rintirrys dead angakirs hand splatted against chair leather keep your mouth from rintirry both of you i dont want to hear that pirs i want you and fifty of your men at caghar rinta youve got a son now your matja can keep busy with him she doesnt need you fifty men we cant spare fifty men you know were coming on shearing days i know you owe me im your father and this rinta is still mine till you pay the last payment your chals are sworn to me i could take them all if i called in my rights mingas spoke again very softly our father has lost one son pirs our best fighter lost him because you were careless you have a moral duty to replace that son angakirs said nothing but shadith listening had no doubt of his agreement with that pirs drew a long shuddery breath let it out again the hiss loud in continuing silence all right he said finally ill come and ill bring the men if you arm them i will not strip this rinta for you not even for you what good are men without arms i will not strip this rinta well get them to me and ill arm them no father send the guns here good guns and ammunition for them as soon as the weapons are here my trucks will roll we need drugs and cloth and other supplies ill give you a list bring a truckload of those with the men all right the chair creaked again shadith made the rodent creep forward until she could see what was happening pirs was on his feet father he said mingas he turned and walked out shadith knew she should stay and listen to mingas and the artwa but she was tired of these men and their problems she loosed the rodent and let him go scooting back to his nest she stretched out on the bed and stared at the candle shadow shivering on the ceiling one damn thing after another well maybe itll be over soon the artwa and mingas left next morning going without ceremony shadith leaned on her windowsill and watched the skimmer disappear into the clouds one opportunity gone how many more would she see before she managed to kick loose five days later the weapons came mingas brought them in the skimmer offloaded them and left immediately arring pirs came into allinas sitting room he stood behind her watching her work on her tapestry then crossed the room to look into his sons cradle he bent touched the sleeping babys cheek then came back to her she looked up managed a smile are the guns what you wanted wanted he poured heavy irony into the word rested the tips of his fingers on her shoulder not new he said but they work pmurrs finishing the inspection when will you be leaving you and pmurr im not taking pmurr she stabbed the needle into the canvas left it hanging there caught hold of his hand and held it against her face you will she said you must no amurra amurra amurra she whispered please please kiyami kaltjimi if youre worried about us here what happens to us if you die you have paji now father will take care of you she was silent she couldnt agree and he wouldnt hear her if she tried to argue in her corner shadith continued to play softly shivering at the anger and helplessness in the matja she knew what allina was thinking it wasnt just the war that was waiting for pirs it was mingas spite utilas jealousy angakirs stupidity allina was sick with fear that pirs wasnt going to come home from this especially if he left pmurr behind i have tinoopa and kizra wuraj for the men the chal and chapa allina said after several moments of silence dont you trust them miarring take pmurr please for my peace of mind if nothing else no he pulled away angry i have said matja i hear arring two days later pirs left with fifty chal in three trucks a fourth truck loaded with supplies matja allina stood on the steps for the ceremony of leavetaking calm smiling pride stiffening her spine when the last truck vanished through the gate she signaled the young amurdrummer he played a quick roll then blew into the convoluted shell of a land snail matja allina looked down into the faces of her people you know what this means she said she spoke slowly her voice carrying to the farthest corners of the court chal explain to chapa chal and chapa take great care of your lives you are dear to us and you are needed there will be tumaks come to burn and kill dont go beyond the walls alone dont go without a guard i will see you have them when you need them pmurr bring the herders to the great hall in one hour i will have arms for them and ammunition one by one she named the leaders of the men those left at the kuysstead after pirs winnowing setting a time for each to bring his men to the hall we must go on she finished shearing waits for no mans war to end planting has its seasons she signaled the drummer turned and went inside to the rattle of his sticks for three days she worked to tighten down the kuysstead then she took aghilo and her baby into her suite pulled the shades down and grieved she was in agony that agony filled the house and shadith was sick with it she struggled to shut it out but could not everyone but her was hard at work pmurr and tinoopa were running the kuysstead the place was busy as a termite mound with the top kicked out but she had nothing to do but brood she was tired of that so she took the arranga and went to play for whoever would have her aghilo came into the kitchen stood shaking her head her hands on her hips housemaids were clustered around shadith trading turns singing verses of the joke song she was playing gilli chal looked up saw aghilo hissed a warning the rest of the maids stopped their giggling scattered guiltily ashamed of being caught enjoying themselves in a house of grief the cook stilled the hand that had been slapping vigorously at the table composed her face into dignified sobriety yes chapa tinoopa is she around she went across to the dye shed should be back in about ten minutes oh aghilo went out again cook got heavily to her feet looks like youll be back on the job kiz scamper matja allina emerged from her grieftime she was pale and gaunt but composed she carried baby paji in a sling that kept him nestled warm against her hip an innovation shed gotten from tinoopa irrkuyon custom said the baby was given to a wet nurse after name day but allina refused to be separated from him polyapo protested the chal stared but the matja ignored them she summoned the chal leaders to the great hall informed them she was going to the brushies to get replacements for the men pirs took with him they protested she shouted them down the cool controlled matja theyd known was gone what was left was a wild creature who filled the hall with her passion seemed to suck up all the air until the rest were about to smother she lowered her voice and went back to telling how things were going to be left behind shadith wandered through the house she got into the study found her papers sat looking at them for a long time i ought to go now they wouldnt miss me her hands shook come on shadow its just a long hard ride thats all a bead of sweat dropped on the parchment she blotted it up with her sleeve careful not to smudge the writing this is freedom shadow all you have to do is go i cant go im not ready i dont know which horses i can take without being chased for them polyapos in charge while the matjas away shed send men after me tinoopa couldnt stop her i cant go until allina gets back she stared at the papers a moment longer then locked them away again they were safest here until she was ready to go the days slid away she used the braincrystal knife to cut lines in the wall each mark was another day in prison she was building her own locks and walls building them higher every day each morning when she rolled out of bed she thought i should go today the chance might not come again i should go today each night she lay down in fury at herself at the lethargy she couldnt seem to throw off on the tenth day of the matjas absence shadith slipped into the family garden climbed into one of the wall towers and leaned on a window sill looking west across the heat hammered plain whats happening out there could i get to nirtajai without getting killed where the hell is caghar rinta all right all right lets get ourselves together shadow this is a volcano about to pop you get caught in it youre going to get the shit kicked out of you she dropped to her knees folded her arms on the sill rested her chin on her forearms sweat gathered in her hair and dripped down her face her neck she was in the shade up here there was a strong wind blowing down off the mountains behind her but the heat was punishing i cant ride in this i cant theres no use even dreaming i could whats that the blotch out in the brush came gradually closer spreading into a ragged line of vans pulled by large creatures rather like stubtailed lizards their daughters beside them holding any infants in the family women in bright dressesreds and blues and greens with patches of yellow and orange and yellow kerchiefs knotted into turbansdrove the vans men in patchwork smocks rode horses spread in a wide arc enclosing the vans boys brought up the rear with extra horses another blotch to the right of the first and several kays behind another and another brushies coming in for the shearing she got to her feet all around the kuysstead the herds were coming in woollies pouring through the brush heading for the shearing ground she sighed with despair and relief the decision was taken from her the matja was back and the shearing was about to begin noise dust heat the cutters whirred with scarcely a stop two men threw a woolly blatting on the shed floor while a third ran the cutter along the beasts sides in half a dozen long smooth sweeps that cut away the matted fleece intact the throwers swung the woolly on its other flank and held it while the shearer took off the rest of the fleece as another woolly came wide eyed and blatting from the chute floorboys grabbed the fleece and ran to the bins with it the beastmistress and the women drove the denuded beast into the hold pen where they went over it for pests and disease then chased it into one of the grazing paddocks or into the butcheryard later it would be slaughtered and the meat suncured or smoked or ground into sausage or stowed away in barrels of brine against the winter need the throwers threw and shifted the shearers sheared the boys ran the women inspected twenty sheds twenty teams twenty paddocks waiting in an ordinary year it would have been thirtyfive or forty but even with the brushies help ghanar rinta was shorthanded this year short in everything but food drink and exuberance the matja provided generously there were shear dances each night bonfires and torches lighting the shearfloors where the dancing was barrels of skatbeer hauled up from the cellars woolly carcasses barbequed over vast beds of coals brushie singers and musicians taking turns with ghanar players and singers round dances and slow dances kick up your heels rub against your partners generating a heat greater than the fires more than one set of dancers left the floor for the prickly pleasures of the brush ingva was out there dancing with brushie and chal enjoying herself enormously running wild ignoring all shed been taught about the proper manners of irrkuyon daughters shadith saw her but said nothing she was too busy playing till her fingers bled drinking skatbeer until she was sodden each night she went to bed exhausted day melted into day distinctions lost in a haze of heat dust and exhaustion the paddock herds grew and grew the bins were full of fleeces ready for winters combing and spinning the culls were finished and butchering done the brushies collected their pay in woollies meat cloth and sugar and prepared to leave it was over matja allina stood on an upended fleece bin and spread her hands as if she blessed the wrungout workers looking up at her it is done she said well done a patter of hand against hand you have worked hard and played hard she smiled at them letting her eyes wander across the faces of chal and chapa and the harder darker faces of the brushies i have no doubt theres a crop been planted that will come to light nine months from now a lusty squalling crop of sons and daughters laughter and some long smoldering looks exchanged between brushies and certain of the chal and chapa this is a happy day for all of us she spread her hands again it is a great sadness for me to blacken these good feelings but i need to warn you all especially those of you going back to the brush procagharadad is in kirtaa with two families you know that know this the arring pirs called me last night to warn me kamaachadad has hired a hundred tumaks to hit at ghanar rinta i said a while ago that shearing waits for no mans war to end but amurra bless the war has waited for the end of shearing it wont wait much longer the tumaks will be here before the month is out you know them you know what theyll do if they catch you in the brush theyll play with you until you wish for death and send you home to be a warning theyll fire the brush yes theyre fools enough to do that theyll kill whatever they cant catch weve had tumaks before but never so well armed and supplied so take care people of the brush if the time comes when you want shelter behind ghanar walls if i still have the say she broke off her composure momentarily shattered a sigh passed through the crowd they knew what she was not saying if pirs was killed someone else would be ruling on who was let inside ghanar walls if i have the say still she went on her voice hoarse but determined you will be welcome here go then our friends and take care take very good care of yourselves you let her run wild matja wild out all times of the night by herself no one watching her the jili should be whipped for neglect hasnt the girl learned anything what if shes not virgin what if your own daughter has got herself a brush bastard whos going to marry her then matja allina was nursing paji and staring out the window her shoulder turned to polyapo she twitched like a horse trying to shoo off a troublesome fly but this fly wouldnt be twitched away and wouldnt stop its buzzing she sighed shifted around so she was facing polyapo moving carefully so she wouldnt disturb her baby ingvas no fool any girls a fool when her blood is up no

staying alive youll see such anger youve never seen before polyapo ulyinik must i remind you its only by my forbearance you are notchal hear me polyapo continue to annoy me and youll find yourself swearing the oath now get out of here and consider your future carefully polyapo pinched her lips together and left the room paji whimpered his milk supply interrupted by the knotting tension in his mother that woman ah that woman allina rubbed the babys back oooh baby ooo aaah lovey yum yum she drives me wild sometimes yes babalirri pajiji yes my lovey kizra come play me that funny little song um that stepchild song i need something to wash that bitch from my blood shadith brought the arranga and a cushion across the room settled herself and began picking out the song step easy stepchild she sang step easy stepchild watch where you walkin its wolfdays stepchild bourghies in your garden as the days grew longer and hotter matja allina napped through the middle of the afternoon leaving shadith on her own the grays closed around her what is this she threw the question at the grayness and got no answer but she didnt really need one her memories were back the good and the bad the grays were closing round her when she allowed herself to think she told herself i will die here still dithering it wasnt as bad as the time in ginnys ship when she saw no way out and just started to die she knew the way out she just couldnt scrape up the energy to take it she couldnt plan she couldnt go on preparing for the run to nirtajai the escape she kept putting off and putting offall the reasons she found for not leaving were good reasons logical reasons but fake she slept as much as she could spent what waking energy she had notthinking waiting for the grays to pass they would she knew that with interference or without the grays would go away until then all she could do was stay alive and wait then the tumaks hit them the herbmistress had eeda and jassy and the rest of the garden chals out before dawn working in the home gardens harvesting the first planting of tubers after the shearing and the departure of the herds matja mina had set chal and chapa to getting in all produce mature enough for preserving she wanted the storage bins and shelves filled as much as possible before the tumaks made working outside the walls too dangerous they were digging up the roots brushing them off and tossing them into baskets laughing chattering jassy teasing the girls about lovers in the brush eeda throwing tubers at her sister when she got too graphic a cheerful lot working hard trying to get the field clean before the sun got too high there was a shot another jassys head exploded she fell sprawling across a row of tuber plants eeda screamed crumpled across her sister as another pellet punched through her heart the watchchals in the towers began shooting the herbmistress and the workers were on their stomachs crawling for the walls a few more shots tore through the rustling plants a girl grunted and lay still another screamed as a pellet tore off her braided topknot the top of one tower exploded a ministinger from a dart tube another mini blew out part of the houses roof then the fire from the towers drove off the tumaks the herbmistress and the chal and chapa still alive got to their feet grabbed the tuber baskets and ran for the gate the attack was over as the days passed tumaks set fire to the grainfields and the garden plots destroying much of the food the kuysstead needed for the winter they set fire to the brush they blew apart more towers killing the watchchals and those the towers fell on pmurr organized roving teams who managed to ambush many of the tumak bands the chals had the advantage of knowing the land and the brushcraft of the tumaks was sketchy at best when the tumaks fired the brush the brushies joined the fight they slipped round the tumak bands and slaughtered them armed themselves with the tumaks weapons and searched out the base up in the mountains it was defended and well supplied but the brushies knew the ground in ways even chal and chapa did not and they got in and out like ghosts stealing whatever they could get their hands on destroying what they couldnt carry off and still the tumaks hit and hit again in the middle of the night a ministinger crashed into the side of the house blew out a large chunk of wall and floor just missing shadiths bed the bed tilted creaked and fell through the gap before shadith woke enough to understand what was happening it landed on the roof of the womens quarters slid down the pantiles and shattered on the paving stones shadith was jolted by the sudden stop bruised and more than a little terrified but nothing was broken she crawled out of the mess and knelt on the stillwarm paving stones gaping up at the hole in the wall tsoukbaraim more of the wall fell away and her boots came flying down hit the tiles and slid off to land close by the bed she got shakily to her feet stood looking at the boots and laughing kiz you all right she looked up tinoopa was leaning out her window her dark braid dangling past her shoulders bruised but intact shadith yelled back better than the bed hang on ill be down and let you in ththanks she was suddenly shaking all over her body shaking so hard her knees gave under her and she dropped to the mattress she grabbed the boots hugged them to her breasts and started crying she was alive but itd been so close so close she was still shaking still crying still clutching the boots when tinoopa came down and led her inside she woke to afternoon heat and the realization that the grays had gone away as if theyd never been she was alive the hook is baited autumn rose goes fishing in a pond of sharks autumn rose poured more of the resinated wine into the stemmed glass and looked out across blue blue water to the lichenous city that spread gray and olive and dull brown along the curve of the shore i drink enough of this and i might even get to like it they were sitting in a nest of pillows and reed mats on one of the many small barren islets spattered across the bay the catboat hed come in was moored to a rock her outrigger snugged next to it the maneuver had gone as planned with hadluk providing the meal and the comforts he liked his food and hed used the shimmerys cooks to good purpose hed also avoided even a hint at the proposition she was out here to hear from him steering her away from it when impatience got too much for her a flock of birds rose from the next island over a sudden swirl of orange and blue they circled around twice and settled back seeing ghosts she thought she sipped at the wine enjoying the harsh roughness against her palate the birds swirled again went screaming away came fluttering back she flicked on the mute cone and turned to hadluk wasnt very nice of you aiming uj at me like that for a moment she thought he was going to turn away even that oblique attempt to focus on the reason for this picnic then he said found out what i wanted to know didnt i did you found out youre hungry but not desperate i told you i wasnt hurting so you did hunh she refilled her glass held it up so the sun shone through the strawcolored liquid so whats this about hungry yes belaboring the obvious hadluk im assembling a stake if you want a piece of that think again no gain without pain rose i choose my pains hadluk this isnt one all right so she stared down into the glass tilted it side to side to make the light wine swirl looked up suddenly challenging him do we say thanks for lunch pack up and go home he wrinkled his nose refilled his glass from the amber bottle he kept close to his side the wind blew the smell of the soursweet ouiskag across to her it was a smell that hung around him like a halo stronger today than yesterday good thing she wasnt depending on him for much he sipped from the glass cleared his throat juhfeyn opens up the mewa room three four times a year for topenga vagnag same rules as always table stakes only no markers truce ground and everyone with masks last few years its been more or less the same players same sort anyway some of the southern vaarlords um might be one two three um slummers you know the types and probably someone from mimishay theres usually at least one hell come by flit from their place on haed nunn maybe the manager of the black house if hes not too busy to get away and sometimes the high vaar though juhfeyns the only one knows for sure whos coming he does the inviting he handles the security no bodyguards allowed he supplies food drink and dasuttras word is the high vaar wanted a good game and a safe ground got juhfeyn to handle it because ol jaos married to one of his cousins daughters jao uses me to keep things honest youd be surprised what some of these types get up to he glanced at her shook his head or maybe you wouldnt player gets one warning then hes out he coughed squeezed his hands into fists big he whispered piles of goldtherebegging someone to take it i want some of that rose i have one chance one and run masks hmm you wouldnt have to worry about tells or pulleet what about him you played him i get the point even if i could do the calcs rose juhfeyn would slit my throat if i tried slipping in autumn rose let her head fall back against the boulder behind her stroked her fingers under her chin and down the curve of her throat ive got this perverse fondness for breathing through my nose hadluk youre an outsider rose he doesnt know you with your help and a little luck i can work it if you want it oh yeh i want it how good are they better than average but nowhere as good as they think they are ive watched those games the past twelve years rose watched and sweated and waited for my chance youre it i like the setup but im still not risking my stake financings up to you and it has to be big hadluk or theyll freeze me out of every hot one pulleet and me weve had some things going for us well bank you well cut the take four ways three to us one to you seems to me im the one doing the work down the middle half to me half to you you can split your half however you want ill go three ways it may be your labor rose but its also the past twenty years ive spent scraping together that stake ill throw in passage offworld with me and pulleet you do realize youd better be somewhere else when the sun comes up hadluk my luck went soft for a while not my head he grinned at her and lifted his glass he shouldnt grin she thought he looks deformed when he grins the lady bless he said then gulped down the ouiskal without waiting for her to join him he coughed and wiped the back of his hand across his mouth his eyes glittered at her over the soft white curve of his pampered palm we start building you tonight i want you in dresses like the one you wore first time we played i want you to clean the marks down to their toenails they love a winner on this world a winners as good as a saint maybe better every night after that as long as we can pull in marks who want to beat you i want you winning i want rumors breeding like maggots in meat you hear fine with me one thing hadluk and you better believe it i start getting official pressure you know what i mean i fade my nerves are a tad touchier than they were back when ill talk juhfeyn into putting the word out shouldnt be hard to do since he gets ten percent of the net from everyone who plays even uj pays him once the rumors start youll be hauling them in and hes a man with an eye for profit she frowned i didnt i took it out when i culled my cut thought youd call me on it slipping rose she shrugged i was waiting for the deal if i was interested fine if not it could come out of your hide ten per hmm you take that out of the gross hadluk not out of my third i mean it he blinked at her let it go so you dont need to worry about the lice whens this game going to happen dont know yet jao never announces the date ahead of time but theres things he does to get ready and hes started them hes got feelers out for prime dasuttras getting in a special cook went to see the high vaar yesterday id say sometime soon no earlier than ten days from today not more than thirty plenty of time for you to get known i hear does juhfeyn do any banking for his players what my winnings im not walking back and forth with that kind of cash stuffed down my front i want that made very clear good idea you might as well start that tonight hell be at the shimmery going over the books hell see you hes a man with an itch curiosity you know um yes hell be in to watch you play after a few nights just to make sure its luck not fingers you understand that luck and what ive got in my head hadluk never my fingers it doesnt pay that was before thats now and always i cant help what jorkheads think if you can call what they do thinking i play straight i never said you didnt rose im just saying jao will want to make sure fine long as he knows what hes seeing you said he keeps you around for that im the sump rose the goat the finger i get the bad vibes and he stays clean believe me hell know she got to her feet well its time i was busy getting ready i take it we dont meet again until after the game not to talk i mean right keep it clean im off then she scooped up the mute cone dropping it in her bag and strolled toward the boats picking her footing with care among the weathered stones when she was out on the water she looked back he was still sitting in his nest she saw a glint of amber as he tilted the bottle one more time she clicked her tongue not good that ah well doesnt matter i dont need this not like i used to kikun shifted on the window seat knocking one of the pillows onto the floor his eye a brief orange flash you trust him autumn rose snorted about half as far as i could throw him she rubbed fingertips along her jaw kikun was tired tonight withdrawn she got the feeling he was desperately unhappy but there was nothing she could do to help he wasnt going to talk about it im all right until the game she said hell keep things sweet until thats over its worth the trouble another flash of orange eye and youre itching for it i dont know maybe its been a long time i like working for digby hmm she fidgeted as the silence developed i dont know kuna this whole business is weird i dont know why digby got involved in it hes been paid yeh but i doubt hes close to breaking even he never tells us anything except what we need to know to do our part of the job thats all right theres no confusion that way when i was working the team you know advising the dyslaerins when we were tracking down leads to ginnys auction it was business thats all i liked them but that was beside the point it was a clear clean job even when it went wrong it had um shape do you see what im saying i like to do a quick neat job its a good feeling kuna you slide in do the thing slide out no fuss neat surgical almost well doesnt happen like that all the time even most of the time most of the time it gets messy one way or another when it does though ah when it does when things click youre wired youre walking the edge i like that kuna but i dont know this business its like a fog i cant get hold of it makes me crazy when i think about it mostly i try not to think about it i mean the game now thats clean do you blame me for wanting that why didnt digby call me back im not im a sprinter kuna i run out of go on a long trail goerta brite ill be glad to get off this world she sat up abruptly this is no use look have you got anything more from sai no after a minute he amplified this he hasnt been in to the office once he runs the place through the com i dont know how to find him likely hes trying to duck the squeeze if we believe your source he swung around and sat up shaking himself as if to throw off the lassitude eating at him i cant get a smell of him rose im cut off he shivered his eyes flickered restlessly i dont think we can pin him not in the time we have with the game being the limit you want what hes got on mimishay youll have to ask the kephalos she grimaced i hear kuna you dont mind i want you in that office in the morning picking up everything you can get about keying in when will you go for it sometime around the game probably the night before i dont know depends on how things are what you can get how much time im going to need how much noise its going to involve she sighed how desperate we are um hadluk says someone from mimishay might be there a player you can pin him as omphalos oh yes then well see wont we the dance began she won and won again she found a dressmaker and got clothes made started the woman on a black dress like the one hadluk remembered after so many years long hard years for her harder for him he was sculling round bottom at first shed been annoyed at him telling her what to wear when she hadnt asked hadnt intended to ask then she changed her mind that was a good night shed been sure of herself more than sure it was magical nowfrom the time she rose in the morning until she went to sleep on the ship outmagical how everything she touched went right she knew the value of talismans for herself and for him they gave that extra thing without a name to people they touched that night shed tapped the flow and ridden it higher than shed gone before or after it was good to recapitulate recapture revivify that woman who was that woman who knew the local fibers didnt have the special sheen of avrishum but they had their own beauties and when she drew the heavy rich black material across her arm the hairs on her spine stood up yes this was going to be another magical dress she felt it wake the power in her she gave the woman the sketch and her measurements and paid the price for the cloth without a murmur of protest the angatines set up a tent as close to the kipuny shimmery as jao juhfeyn would permit and held a mourning service every night she played starting their keening the moment she came round the corner whitened faces and bodies moved in a somber slow dance to the steady slow thump of the drums the blind woman chanted her exorcisms in a wild rough contralto no one paid attention to them they were just part of the show shed been afraid theyd wake hostility among the locals but apparently the rummers were used to the angatines taking against somebody and calling the wrath of heaven on them apparently the wrath of heaven struck or didnt strike according to the whims of god and the rummers didnt consider that any business of theirs by the seventh day there were crowds of child beggars street singers magicians acrobats cutpurses food venders hadluks rumormill was working industriously and producing the desired effect he knew his rummers the crowd grew every playday shouting the number of the win when she came out seven eight nine they opened and let her pass without hindrance when she arrived there was a hush hot and tense like the hush before a storm the question was there in their faces would she win again would the lady kiss her once more they had the answer before she came out yes she won the whisper came she won ten eleven twelve she won she won dasuttras ran at her elbowed past the guards she was forced to hire they touched her just touched heras if they hoped her luck would rub off on them sick people came at her on hands and knees to outmaneuver the guards or paid child beggars to tear pieces of cloth from her dress she moved quickly into the maze of semistreets dismissed the guards as soon as the worst of the crush was left behind depended on kikuns notthere to screen her from the more persistent followers andsomehowkept her homeground in the rumach secret from friend and enemy alike on the thirteenth day as hadluk counted out her winnings he murmured the high vaar called jao this afternoon wanted to know about you if the luck was real or you were pulling something thats good yup youre in got the date not yet can you keep this up long as the plays straight it will be on the fifteenth playnight there were only three marks waiting for her by the second chapter she knew what she faced they were combined against her she almost giggled with relief shed been expecting this for days jao came in looking grim she caught his eye shook her head he thought it over a moment then left she cleaned them they yelled foul the beza prezao came himself and took them away jao waited while hadluk counted the coins and locked them away then he took her arm and escorted her to the quartet of guards waiting by the door he turned her to face him that wont happen again after prezao gets done with them theyll walk small and stay away thanks he smiled you know whats really going to discourage repeats of this night you cleaned them they pulled a sneak on you and went down tails on fire why havent i heard of you i play privately go on binges then quit so theres nothing to hear some nothing come see me tomorrow what time have lunch with me with pleasure noon one ill be there she stripped the dress off threw it on the bed were in kuna im having lunch with jao tomorrow i have a feeling hes going to offer the invitation then kikun was curled into a tight ball his skin fell looser by the day his bones were starting to show soon enough he said his voice was dull dragging you all right kuna no im not all right im tired rose i cant sleep i cant eat i need things i cant get here the words came to her as sighs puffing through the flicker of the candlelight she had to strain to hear them she pulled the woolly robe around her irritated by his limpness shed come home high and happy and hed gloomed her down till she was low as the rug she couldnt do this thing without him not the way it was set up but more than ever she regretted not being on her own she sat on the bed and began taking down her hair its almost over kuna tell me what you got from the office he muttered words she couldnt hear uncoiled and sat with his legs dangling his hands clutching the edge of the seat i picked up two more passkeys wrote them down theyre on the table i dont see any pattern in his keys i think hes using private symbols translated through the local ideograms not numbers gestalt of some kind probably interlocking gestalts ideograms lend themselves to that sort of thing youd probably find it simpleminded it works for him lets his women get what they need to run the business for him keeps the rest private gaagi he blinked and looked unhappy a small graygreen manlizard sinking into wrinkles gaagi decided to show he says the machine is trapped push it wrong and the whole building goes boom lovely hmm if i can get in pull the data without bringing the house on my head ill have the shimmery for refuge three days thats how long topenga vagnag takes ill be sleeping there wont go out till the games over thatll give you a chance to rest if you can hang on till then after you get a look at the players she pulled the dozens of fine plaits apart dropped the pins and clasps on the quilt beside her working quickly impatiently ignoring the sharp little pains when she pulled too hard i need you hot and ready to go when its time to get away this is going to be tricky kuna hadluk and pulleet will do their best to put me down types like that always get greedy want it all and the other players will be hmm shall we say most unhappy and one of thems going to be the high vaar they say they want a good game what they mean is they want to win mmm we cant come back here not after the game we should have everything we dont want to abandon packed and ready to shift before i go when you have a moment kuna see if you can locate us a tractor thats about the fastest way out of town we need to get close to where the miniskips are before anyone wakes up to the fact that were gone about milking that kephalos the night before the game hmm impossible to do it without traces you think you could get me something that would make sai think it was lice nosing into his business insignia or something i could leave lying in some inconspicuous spot i should have the timeline set after my lunch with jao then well know where we are she thrust her fingers through her hair combing out the worst of the kinks bath goerta brite i need a bath how much did you get tonight i dont know all they had i didnt bother counting it you are odd rose ive never met anyone like you why because i dont give a damn about money she shrugged got to her feet i can always get money its other things that dont come when you whistle she made a face collected the towel and facecloth and coins for the heater slot you want me to run water for you when im finished please jao tilted the bottle and poured a pale liquid that wasnt even a kissing cousin to the turpentine shed been drinking home wine he said from my cousins vineyard on shimmaroh i think you will like this he filled his own glass and smiled as she sipped then sighed with pleasure forgive me in advance for intruding on your private affairs after such a meal i would forgive almost anything you have a considerable sum banked with me could you perhaps have access to mmm say triple that amount possibly yes good have you heard perhaps of our sessions of topenga vagnag you might say its among the things that brought me here ahhh yes it is the custom for offworlders to deposit a certain sum with me before they play this smoothes out possible difficulties and makes life more pleasant for everyone lets have things clear jao juhfeyn you are inviting me to play topenga vagnag yes if you can present the necessary deposit i have a credit link tied to helvetia which you may use if you wish that wont be necessary how soon must i have the deposit three days on by the first hour after noon and when is the game the players will arrive four days on i see you have secure rooms for them for you also if you wish the room is part of the service i provide in return for my fee which is ten percent of your net wins if you are a net loser consider it a gift most kind id really rather avoid the um distractions of coming and going youve played topenga before yes what name will you be using my name is my talisman juhfeyn i never change it i will go by autumn rose he smiled settled back in his chair so youre a tech a systems specialist freetech i cant talk about it company privilege you understand silence is part of what they buy from me i see have you ever been to shimmaroh no whats it like you know spotchals who doesnt true something like spotchals in a smaller system kikun slid along the alley stopped by a narrow recess easiest to get in here he murmured autumn rose fished the keypac from her toolbag got the door open and slipped inside a shadow in shadows she had a black scarf wrapped around her head and as she moved there was a springy power in her thin body that reminded kikun of the sohdihlo dancers back home who trained for the holy days at plibajatsi toh the sacred lake he grimaced it seemed like everything was reminding him of home these days grandmother ghost getting her pinches in there was a hiss from the darknessautumn rose wondering why he was dallying out in the street that was another thing about these days rose was impatient all the time scratchy as the thorns on her namesake the building was dark and smelled of urine and dust it had the hollow echoing feel that told kikun it was empty he didnt say anything he didnt think it was necessary gaagi was hovering somewhere in the background he wasnt showing his face but kikun could hear the whisper of his feathers now and then just often enough to know he was there might or might not be a help kikun slipped in past rose went scurrying up the gritty sagging stairs staying close to the wall so they wouldnt squeal on him or under him as the case might be the door to sais office had a dirty mirror in the upper half a mirror that turned into oneway glass once they were inside rose looked over her shoulder snorted elegant kikun shrugged whatever works she wrinkled her nose set her hands on her hips and looked around a grayish light filtered through the ancient dust on the windows enough to show them the sagging benches lined up against a side wall the broad armchair in an inner corner where the guard sat with his ottoshot across his knees its seat cushion was worn and shabby molded to the shape of his broad butt beside the door into the inner office a bulky deskset pouched through the wall with a grill across a hatch during the day the woman sat behind that grill readouts at their elbows and did their needlework while they waited for someone to comcall or walk in rose inspected the door to the inner office fished a readout from her toolbag and ran it along the jamb when she was finished she looked at the result sniffed with satisfaction over her shoulder she said watch my back i dont know how long thiss going to take she keyed the door went through it and settled at one of the readouts kikun watched her start work then went to squat in a corner by the outer door humming hymns that were so old even the gods had forgotten who made them jadiigevas the antelope spirit ran clickaclack through the empty stinking corridors his black eyes wild his breath wet before him kikun quivered with him shuddered with his fear looked through his eyes searching searching for motion the thing that jadiigevas was created to find find and flee the antelope spirit shuddered and fled as wind rattled a window his hooves clacked on the bare wood floors like hail as he fled again when a rat came trundling from a pile of anonymous litter spashats the bear sat in a corner of the room big and dark shining amber eyes he yawned opened his mouth wide enough to swallow kikun snapped it closed toothsliding against tooth he was shadow without substance but his power was like perfume it lingered even when the wearer was mostly absent he was warning he was reproach he was the summoner kikun shuddered whenever he looked into that corner he tried not to look but he couldnt keep his head from turning he couldnt keep his eyes away he was supposed to be watching for intruders he was supposed to be guarding autumn rose not harrowing his soul for the edification of his gods gods he couldnt believe in even when he was looking at them he kept looking at them he let jadiigevas do the watching the soft sound of roses fingertips came to him along with a faint flickering greenish glow from the screen she was concentrating so hard it was like a skin of glass was pulled around her glass tough as ship steel he sighed he missed shadith she understood things that rose never would because rose didnt want to understand them he spent a moment wondering where shadow was and what she was doing right nowthen was jerked from his reverie by the challenge roar of jadiigevas antelope spirit reared huge and dark antlers like naked trees eyes red jadiigevas reared obsidian hooves hanging over the head of the man coming unconcerned down the corridor coming toward the office kikun whistled a brief warning to rose dropped flat against the wall the stunner ready there was a form on the far side of the glass the rattle of a key in the lock the door opened kikun fired the man jerked shuddered dropped xumady the otter clashed his teeth and giggled a high whinny that scratched at kikuns ears and called a lump into his throat down among the dead men xumady said to him youve a corpse to play with nai kikun cursed the trickster in the reduplications of his natal langue the agglutinations he didnt want to believe it but hed felt the spirit go out of the man and he saw cold and empty flesh lying on the shabby rug with a last flicker of hope he dropped to a squat beside the body caught hold of the nearest wrist tried to find a pulse nothing he scowled at the stunner held it close to his eyes so he could see the setting minimum stun the lowest notch rose he whispered no answer she was so tied into what she was doing she didnt know what was happening out here rose she made an impatient sound looked up what im just getting somewhere kuna hold on a minute will you no theres a problem i need you she swore worked a moment over the pad then came through the door so you stunned him i hope yes i did but hes dead what she strode across to him stirred the body with her toe did you change the setting no look he tossed the stunner to her she examined it scowled down at the man all right so whys he dead or is he she dropped to her knees held out the stunner here take this thing she pressed her fingers up under his jaw z toyff they dont come deader miserable luck he mustve been one of those extra sensitives you dont happen on them often goerta brite she checked her ringchron passing her hand across her eyes yes who is he dont know i suspect hes sai hes got keys what are we going to do with him she pressed the heels of her hands hard against her eyes for a moment she didnt say anything just knelt there as if she were praying though he suspected what was going through her head had nothing to do with prayer she straightened got to her feet another half hour and ill have the mimishay file i was going to go for black house too but might as well forget that he can stay where he is until im finished were not likely to have more visitors or are we no i dont know probably not mm this buildings right on the bay there must be windows looking out over the water yes just drop him out like he was garbage hes beyond feeling it kuna its not respectful i dont know him why should i respect his corpse its our skins kuna and not just ours what about your friend shadith if we get topped what happens to her he moved uneasily i hear right then she transferred her scowl from him to the body jorkhead middle of the night she swung round and stalked into the inner office kikun heard the squeak of the chair as she sat the patter of her fingertips saw the unsteady light from the screen chasing shadows across the wall beside him he sighed caught hold of sais shoulders and tugged him out of the doorway laid him against the wall xumady giggled and danced a triumph about and around the dead man spashats gloomed in his corner and piled his silent demands on naiyol hanee called kikun honor the dead honor your dead jadiigevas the antelope spirit ran clickaclack through the empty stinking corridors his black eyes wild his breath wet before him watch for me kikun told antelope the bear watch for me dance for me kikun told otter guide he told gemla mask suddenly there he knelt beside the dead man and sang a goinghome for him we drink from different rivers now o stranger o enemy we always have surprised from life your heartsoul dances on a dry plateau cries out to me why o stranger o enemy i do not know loudly your voice calls you sent me show me the

your feet hold you from the blessed go quickly and do not remember your death or he who gave it unasked may shizhehoyu father of all bless you and give you rest gemla mask hovered over the dead man drawing the spirit from his body then danced ahead of the wildeyed ghost teasing him on and on until the ghost ran without prodding ran and forgot what was drew ahead of gemla and vanished kikun stirred blinked got creakily to his feet with the goinghome closed out the weight of the dead man was off his shoulders the thing before him was only rapidly spoiling meat the sooner they got rid of it the better rose looked up as he wandered into the inner office the minicorder was sucking up data it didnt need her her hands were limp on her thighs a sheen of sweat was drying on her face youre supposed to be watching jadiigevas watches what watch is being kept dont worry one of your gods kikun blinked at her say one of my ghost brothers she looked wary tapped restlessly at her thighs if it works want me to start cleaning away our traces dont bother youd have to burn the place down to thwart the forensic machines the lice are bound to use even then she flipped a hand dropped it back with luck they wont find him before were gone after that who cares fighting grime accumulated over the life of the building they wrestled a window open on the third floor flung him out it was like throwing a log he was that stiff he fell like a log landed on the edge of the wharf teetered there for a long moment a gust of wind caught in his ruckedup jacket swayed him just enough to tumble him into the bay the splash he made was swallowed by the other night noises and he sank quickly out of sight rose shivered jerked the window down ignoring the squeal it made in its slides lets get out of here i need sleep and a bath before i start getting ready for the game autumn rose lifted the mask dropped it over her head and adjusted the eyeholes so she could see without difficulty it wasnt actually a mask but a headsmans cowl in soft thick velvet long enough to fall in graceful folds over her shoulders she leaned closer to the mirror adjusting the folds to leave the deep vee of her dress uncovered and the necklace of rough crystal and knotted silver wire kikun moved into the mirror field rose gasped twitched then had to rearrange the hood folds z toyff kuna he grinned at her you look marvelous rose sss she smoothed her hands down her sides the black sychoura clinging softly to her palms magical yesss after a last inspection she straightened her shoulders and went out the mewa room had eight sides and seven doors six were doors to securesuites for the players the high vaar went home for bed the seventh was the exit the room was rich with dark woods and green velvet a greenonbeige rug rich redbrown wood paneling there was a deep glow from crystal lamps on the walls and the massive chandelier hanging above the vagnag table low benches set against the walls between the doors were piled with green and gold cushions dasuttras were arranged like flowers among the cushions faces bosoms and arms printed with flowerforms in the pink dyes of ancient custom long hair down and gleaming under chainmetal caps set with moonstones and jasper citrine and turquoise peridot and aquamarine semiprecious gems catching the light like drops of colored oil in one corner two dasuttras were playing flute and lute unobtrusive wallpaper sounds autumn rose walked in and felt her soul expand this was her realm hers again she belonged here if shed needed that little extra bit of confidence the room gave it to her three men stood beside the table talking in low voices two hooded the third jao juhfeyn he crossed to her held out a silver brooch a fullblown rose on a circle autumn rose as she pinned it on jao stepped back gestured sunhawk a tall paunchy man nodded his brooch was a raptor on a rayed circle hiushark the second man inclined his head his brooch was a leaping shark on a plain circle one by one the others came each by his separate door received his brooch and was introduced by his usename snowcat tandukviper direwolf the last man was tall and solid a crackle to him when he moved his brooch was a barracuda arching openmouthed across a silver circle when he saw rose he jerked his head up turned to juhfeyn a woman you object if i did youre free to leave i see he shrugged pinned the brooch on and stood waiting for juhfeyn to seat them kikun squatted in the corner and watched the players roll for order he smiled when he saw that rose got the lead its where she wanted to be grandmother ghost pinched his ear get your mind on why youre here lazy boy he forgot about the game and looked at each of the men oozing out of the wall feathers rustling brushing against him small distracting tickles gaagi bent over him whispered in his ear this is catalog of men sunhawk the high vaar tidak beruba hiushark overleader of the metug pirates tanduk vaarlord of haemunda pamina snowcat zly zlostin the vamcac of damatvedd direwolf attata marteau exec of cazar company barracuda enfilik abrusso grand chom of the mimishay foundation a power in omphalos gaagi came whirling out of the wall leaping high into the air landed on the table shook his behind in barracudas face xumady giggled dived from the dark and joined raven on the table doing a mockshock dance a satiric curse on the target they finished with a howl and a swirl and dissolved into the dark kikun ignored them and watched barracuda the omphalite was angry every time he looked at rose he clenched his gut he was going to go after her any way he could kikun smiled good that was stupid and it was likely to break him fast yes the sooner the better the game started the fine blonde hairs on roses forearms shimmered in the light from the chandelier as she dealt the cards at the end of the first chapter she was a net winner having avoided the grid for the moment lost two pen wagers but won the holse despite his irritation barracuda played cautiously he won one table wager lost the other came close to breaking even sunhawk played a meticulous game had fair cards but bad combinations that didnt seem to bother him he was deeply content his mind humming with the calcs that let him finesse a small win hiushark was a plunger though he kept the lid on until he had the measure of the other players tanduk was a fusser but either his intuition snapped to with every card or he could beat a kephalos at calcs he spread his bets over the number grid in carefully plotted patterns and ignored the holse during the first chapters snowcat was slow refused to be pushed he played his cards with heavy slaps threw the dice with a force that nearly took them off the table he played the holse and the pen ignored the grid until the last chapter before break direwolf played quickly spread his bets on grid pen and holse depended on instinct for the proportions the play was slow at first the players feeling each other out setting down their personal minimums black feathers brushed around autumn rose black scales glittered over her head her cards were good her throws brought fine combinations gaagi was her luck though she didnt know it kikun could feel her confidence growing but she kept her caution until she knew the other players and had a feel for the flow of the game then held back still until the break kikun squatted in his corner bored to stupor he didnt play gambling games he liked watching them even less there was no talking no witty or even unwitty exchanges to distract him from the soporific slapclick of the play his noseeme ratcheted as high as it would go he dozed confident no one could discover him he knew the man now the target now all they had to do was take him all i have to do he dreamed yes rose is out of it i will take him when the time comes he shifted from the squat until he was sitting with his back against the wall let his eyes droop and slept the stirring for the first break woke kikun the players moved to the tables filled plates with fingerfood handing these to the nearest dasuttra to hold for them pointing out what they chose to drink and waiting while dasuttras poured these liquids into the special glasses juhfeyn provided delicate flutes with angled glass straws so they could drink through the mouth slits of their cowls kikun got to his feet slid around to the eighth wall and collected a glass of wine retreated to his corner where he sat sipping and watching the players circle round each other trying to find some way to pry information out of the others without revealing anything about themselves the idea of that snoopdance was mildly amusing the actuality was boring direwolf wandered over to rose autumn rose he said sucking on his straw its a name that resonates oh there was a game on cazarit some decades ago a woman who was also autumn rose played in the prime seat blonde woman attractive very good player very good stylish oh yes stylish had a way with the cards never forgot it ah going to be an interesting game once it gets started ah he raised his glass to her the straw tinkling against the sides then went strolling off barracuda stood close to his door his eyes fixed on rose kikun winced at the malice steaming off the man grandmother ghost pinched his arm and muttered in his ear black bile man he stinks baby you watch him you hear hes up to something and its nothing good you hear listen to your ol gramma you get over there stand in his shadow baby you let him get away hell wreck everything you hear me gaagi danced behind barracuda great black beak threatening the man black scales glittering wing feathers shuddering around him abruptly gaagi froze then he beckoned urgently to kikun kikun set his glass down slipped around to stand behind the man barracuda took a babi slin from the plate the dasuttra held ate it held out his hand to the other attendant she cleaned it with a lightly scented cloth that woman he murmured who is she why was she invited to this game you havent heard the kneeling dasuttra a very young very lovely girl looked up at him her eyes wide glowing ah senhuan she is accursed of god and blessed by the lady she has won thirteen days running that seems unusual no senhuan the dasuttra at his side had a deeper voice she was older surer in her beauty sure enough to venture a small contradiction jao juhfeyn certifies her she is blessed by luck not by her fingers yes senhuan the kneeling dasuttra said words coming out in a rush i have heard a woman was cured of muteness by the touch of her dress and the ringing in a mans ears went away and another dug in his garden and found a treasure someone had buried there she looked over her shoulder at the other players leaned closer until she was nearly touching his long black robe it is said high ones required her presence the highest of the high barracuda made a slicing gesture and the girl shut her mouth he tapped her cheek fished in his sleeve and set a gold emu between her lips he dropped another emu in the plate leave me he said and waited till they moved off then he swung round and pushed his door open kikun followed him there was a short foyer then a small but luxurious room identical to the one rose had barracuda crossed to a table with a black case on it punched a code into the cases lock and opened it a com shielded kikun dropped to his hands and knees scooted under the table he could hear the soft patter of a keypad as barracuda entered another code then waited fingers tapping an irregular impatient rhythm on the tabletop black house a mans voice a light musical tenor barracuda tapped a second code tinggal here another voice deeper rougher i need a team to pick up a woman when and where day or so tos tous kipuny shimmery thats truceground we could be dispossessed if we break truce shes offworld silence from the com more tapping from barracudas fingers speeding up as the silence stretched out after another few breaths he swore softly said you know who i am yes but youre only one i answer to the whole council i see therere crowds outside this place the woman is a luck piece thats what im told the draw send the team they neednt come onto the shimmery grounds they can merge with the crowd no one will notice them as soon as shes clear they can take her youll mark her dont need to crowdll mark her for them yes anyone you prefer sul purgis is available to head them yes let him choose i want her untouched with her full vigor on tap you understand me quite ill join you in say four days out whistling breathily barracuda returned the pad to its slips and shut the case leaving it on the table he strolled out hands clasped behind him kikun scurried after him vibrating with anger grandmother ghost waited for him in the corner her outline was sharper her colors stronger than theyd been in months look at him baby monster you know what he wants to do to her dont you look at him look at her i curse him head to toe may his feet crack open and rot may the hair on his legs grow so long and thick he trips on it and people laugh like fools saying see the beast see the stupid hairy beast may his knees turn to stone and crumble when he moves may he know pain without end may his thing wither and fall of may the rot enter his body and grow upward till it meets the rot in his brain kikun tuned her out he was sick with anger but curses were futile things the only one grandmother ghosts curses worked on was him he didnt know what to do rose had forgotten him and he couldnt remind her without bringing himself into focus for too many of the others in here play had already gone on three hours the next break would come after the tenth chapter yes another three hours maybe unless play slowed shed have to leave then comfort stop surely her bladder would force that did she drink grandmother he mindshouted quiet grandmother the laellenox subsided to mutters pinched him for his lack of proper courtesy to his elders what what is it baby what do you want did rose drink anything during the break i dont mean just hold the glass i mean really drink yes yes thats smart of you baby yes two glasses of wine that should hit her kidneys hard not so long from now he settled back in his corner arms crossed on his knees and watched the game go on gaagis black wings fluttered about her and the cards came well for her the dice came through again and again he could feel her feeling the flow she began to push the game her wagers challenges to the others she played holse and grid and pen with machine speed and sureness reading the odds running the calcs everything in her coalescing for this game she won she lost some of the table stakes but won the holse again and again her pale skin shimmered in the glow from the chandelier the fine blonde hairs on her arms were curved streaks of light there was a power in her that the others felt they couldnt see gaagis wings and glittering scales but they felt them kikuns anger faded into boredom again as the play went on and on he slept rose came from the fresher went to the mirror she inspected herself leaned closer touched a fingertip to the slight sag under her eyes rose she straightened wheeled relaxed kuna right he dug his fingers into the folds under his jaw hed turned his options around and over and around again he still wasnt sure about it but hed decided the truth was best and this was the best time to tell it ah mmm barracuda is omphalos all right he made a com call the first break black house hes arranged to have you picked up the moment you leave the shimmery she moved her shoulders looked irritated i dont need this thought id better tell you yes yes youre right youve got your stunner of course you have look the next break its for a sleep session six hours you remember ah according to she touched her lips frowned i was told hed come by flit if he came at all it has to be parked somewhere close while were sleeping you think you could find it oh yes she didnt try telling him what to do when he found it one good result of a touch of healthy paranoia about being overheard it kept her from belaboring the obvious something she had a tendency to do irritating to be treated like a subnormal child right she sighed its back to work she caught up the hood slipped it over her head adjusted the eyeholes lets go lil liz sunhawk was waiting when she walked in standing apart from the others his hood was a gesture no more everyone in the room knew who they entertained his eyes flickered as kikun slipped in behind her then he forgot kikuns gift wiping the image away abetted by the obsession growing in him an obsession that became apparent as soon as he spoke he touched her arm autumn rose he said his voice was a caress i havent seen such play in years oh she said i suggest you find a mirror youll see a better one than i am gracefully said but not true his fingers stroked the bird on the rayed circle is this your profession no i play when i have the time and funds my life is elsewhere and i prefer it that way a diet of desserts is quickly boring hmm theres no time at the moment the game is about to begin again consider changing your mind i offer securityno more than thatluxury anything you want all i ask is a game now and then he lifted a hand no dont give your answer now not till the end of this game consider where you are and what i can give you kikuns ears twitched the voice was genial the words innocuous but the intent behind them oh rose its almost comical half of tos tous is going to be waiting out there ready to grab you grandmother ghost the laellenox pinched his arm just like a male look at him preening like a fool tchah just because that bitty chile does something he wants to get his hands on he reaches out and grabs didnt his mamah teach him better but whats a mamah to a man once he gets his growth you try going on like that round me baby ill snatch you skinless you hear otter leaned over patted grandmother ghost on her head with his stubby handpaw you doing that dance again old woman boring boring we heard it all before heard it all heard it all kvetching carping boring boring i stop carping when you get a brain hair fool kikun turned them all out leaned against the wall and tried to sleep the laellenox was the sole female in his personal clutch of gods and sometimes found it necessary to defend all females in sight when she was in one of those moods she was capable of raising such a storm he threatened more than once to exorcise them all and find his peace in absolute unadorned reason the ultimate atheism they were powerful though these gods hed birthed for himself from his flesh and soul and the collective experience of his people they were not perhaps had never beeneven in their crudest form when he was a child groping toward consciousnessmerely convenient ways of dealing with parts of himself he was incapable of understanding he knew on one level that the only reality they had was what he chose to give them but at a deeper level by far he needed them they had a grip on him hed never shake loose most of the time he didnt want to most of the time he slept grandmother ghost pinched him awake when the game broke for the third time the players departed by their separate doors hadluk collected the women and took them out jao juhfeyn supervised the cleaning of the mewa room took a last look round and went out locking the door behind him kikun slipped away with the women then followed juhfeyn as jao checked the shimmerys security when jao left for bed kikun undid the alarms on the back door went out morning he collected a fork a spoon a plate and a cup from the kitchen then followed the girl carrying breakfast into roses room waited in a corner while she laid out the meal on the table knocked on the bedroom got an answer then left rose came out yawning blinked when she saw kikun sitting at the table sipping at pinkishyellow fruit juice from a crystal pitcher she looked over her shoulder shrugged came across and sat down i dont know whos listening kikun leaned back watched her pour the rest of the juice into her glass no one she pulled her mouth into an inverted smile shook her head i dont know she said maybe so well found it theres a park out back chain fence around it guards three flits in there black and silver one with some kind of sigil on it thats probably his didnt try to get to it no point in that not yet itll be locked hes either carrying the keys or has them in his rooms ill take a look there during the first break see what i can find he yawned yawned again you look like someones sucked the air out just tired lot of things going on takes it out of you you know kuna nothings going to happen today except more of the same why dont you stay here and sleep its an idea have a nice hot bath stretch out on the bed its a good bed comfortable lovely sheets like this she smoothed her hand along the heavy silken stuff of her dress only white you sold me he got to his feet youre just a wall away you need help scream she giggled go to bed kuna scream huh not likely he wriggled all over shaking his skin along his bones then strolled out the bed was as comfortable as promised he stripped stretched out between the sheets started to sigh and was deep asleep before the sigh was finished grandmother ghost the laellenox pinched him awake a short time before the maid came in to make the bed and straighten the rooms kikun pulled on his clothes and strolled out rose was talking with the pirate who was describing an improbable fish hed encountered in the southern seas kikun listened a moment drifted on must be using him as shield against the high vaar he thought tlee what a bore he stopped beside her chair raised his brows the small table where her stake was piled was bowed under the weight of the gold on it more rouleaux piled beneath it and around its legs rose could have herself cast lifesize in gold and make herself half a dozen copies how were supposed to cart that off even a third of it grandmother ghost leaned into him inspecting the pile yellow peril sad stuff poison stuff that chile has the right idea baby otter giggled faded when grandmother turned to glare at him hed suffered his share of pinches and scolds and wasnt looking for more blackbear touched kikuns arm the maids were coming from the suites they circled the room and left kikun yawned and went to search barracudas room rose shook him awake he sat up blearyeyed and yawning she laughed scream hunh what just a comment not a summons suppers laid get yourself up wash your dishes come join me it was a light supper half of a smallish bird soup several rolls and a large salad a pot of local tea sat in a quilted nest a curl of steam rising from its spout after she divided the meal meticulously in half they ate in silence for several minutes find anything she said at last he keeps his keys on him or theyre locked in the combox which youd have to handle my training lies in other lines hmm he drank the last of the soup refilled his cup with tea from the pot you seem to be doing well at the game well enough not excited theres gold enough there to gild half the roofs in the city gold tchah hadluks been in this backwater too long hes lost his perspective you know kuna ive played single passes where more value changed hands couldnt get enough gold in that room to interest some types ive been in games with you know like ginnys clients well thats not why were here is it is it course not she wrinkled her nose then grinned at himand he found himself liking her better than he had for a long time sure i hate to let that idiot hadluk cheat me but no way im going to go running off with half a ton of gold stuffed down my front my funs in the playing riding the high i told you i can always get money she sobered just as well were not planning to hang around after this is over high vaar getting possessive you got it hes bidding for a permanent partner got so far as to say id make someone a fine wife someone who liked vagnag him for instance z toyff well itd be an easy life wash your mouth out saaaa easy that plasticman pawing over me make me sick just thinking about it besides i like my work id kill myself if i had to sit around doing nothing she looked at her ringchron time in whered i put that hood the game went on and on at the close of chapter the end of the second day of playing autumn rose sat like an icon of the lady inside of walls of gold piles of gold a black white and golden image with the fugitive glimmers of the crystal in her necklace while the attendant dasuttras brought the gold shed won in the last chapter she got to her feet and walked out surrounded by a tense and angry silence not taking it well are they kikun bit a piece out of a chunk of green from the salad bowl autumn rose snorted jerked off the hood threw it at the nearest chair they say they want a good game doesnt matter win or lose hah what they mean is im gonna break you to your last copper she backed up to him unbutton me will you i want to get out of this he wiped his fingers on a napkin began unhooking the thread loops sounds like youre not enjoying it any more she shrugged out of the dress draped it over her arm id forgot how boring forty chapter gets she said and went out when youre winning he murmured i heard that she called from the bedroom win lose after a while its all the same booooring he ate more salad and waited she came out pushing her arms into the woolly robe tieing it tight around her goerta brite ill be glad when this is over one more day kuna she dropped into her chair poured herself a cup of tea and reclaimed the salad from kikun one more day hmm he broke open a roll spread butter on it what happens when it is over she snorted what do you think hadluk and pulleet will try to kill me if they see a way of keeping all the gold sunhawk our esteemed high vaar will give his best shot at disappearing me into his little place on the hill there barracuda will be torn between knocking me on the head and hauling me off or waiting till i walk out and letting his thugs do the job he chuckled a piece to each maybe hunh so so i think jao is likely to squash hadluks ambitions im not going to bother my head about him hmmmm youre stronger than you look kuna could you carry barracuda any distance like out back to his flit why bother ill liberate a rolling tray from the kitchen fold him up on it and wheel him out good enough she emptied her cup refilled it one more day kuna restless after his long sleep kikun followed the cleaning maids from the mewa room went out and wandered the semistreets about the shimmery the crowds had left gone home for the night that was usual once the sun went down tos tous was dead no lights and crazies in the shadows he wandered to the wharves near the auction house there was no sign sais body had been found no new ships in port quiet dull ropes slapping wood creaking not even a strong wind the harbor watch as usual hung about the incinerators spread along the bayfront standing in clusters of two or three talking drinking taking a leak over the edge of the wharf strolling out to look up and down for stragglers trying to sneak onto the ships or steal the rescue ropes hanging in coils from mooring posts at intervals of half a kilometer kikun drifted near one of those groups listened to the men talking nothing about sai one man was cursing his wife whod walked out on him going on and on about what he was going to do with her when he found her after a while the others got bored with this and shut him up at the next incinerator a man had a pair of lottery tickets and the others were hooting at him telling him the things were always rigged he wasnt anyones nephew he hadnt a hope of winning better than that he said i got a bit of cloth from her dress slept over it and dreamed those numbers im gonna win youll see whod you buy it from djikki the snot he stole my wifes sisters skirt off the wash line tore it up been selling it to any fool whod bite naaa i snatched it off a angatine and she got it from some trip who tore it loose hisself i saw the whole thing im gonna win i know it you seen the woman yah tall skinny thing bet youd do yourself a misery on those bones you tried to djink her not bad looking kikun moved on as the men traded comments on roses attributes not especially flattering ones it was their way of rebelling against circumstances that set them down at the bottom of their world discards straw to be walked on and used by the powerful he understood it didnt like it was glad he didnt have to deal with the anger disguised by those mocking debunking words he met more of that anger as he walked along the men by the bricks admired and hated rose used her as a way of talking about tabu things complaining about her supposed excesses as a way of getting at the powerful they didnt dare speak against the players in that game of topenga vagnag could lose more than a hundred men could make in a year a thousand men ten thousand like them and whod pay they would people like them the vaarmanta would squeeze their losses out of their peoples hides it was a story he knew only too well it was happening on his world the conquerors acting like conquerors everywhere the sweat of his people paid for daivigili excesses kept the eternal queen in luxury it was why hed come away with lissorn to find help weapons maybe knowledge mostly someway somehow to throw the daivavig out of keyazee send them back to their hot dry southlands he twitched his ears scratched at the skin folds under his jaw soon like rose said one more day he went to the rumach used the spare key and went up to the attic where hed hidden their gear after rose left he roped the travelsacs to his back went shuffling through the streets his notthere blasting out to keep the predators off him when he reached the shimmery he went round to the woodshed beside the fencedin flit park and stowed his burden up in the rafters where only the spiders went back inside the shimmery he found an empty room and curled up to wait for morning when juhfeyn would open the mewa again and he could get to rose autumn rose stalked in tore the hood from her head and flung it on the floor plucked the pins from the knot shed twisted her hair into and tossed them on the hood she shook her head scratched her fingers vigorously through her hair turning it into a fright wig she flung her arms out aaaaghhhh kikun chuckled tilted his head well well clean em near enough she scowled at a knock on the door combed her hands through her hair trying to smooth it down its not locked jao juhfeyn came in hadluk a shadow behind him jao bowed straightened autumn rose you are the sole net winner do you understand that youll be paying my full fee you made that quite clear will you trust me with the count or would you prefer to do it yourself do it i couldnt keep my eyes open what do you charge for using your creditlink his eyes laughed at her his teeth were very white between the black beard and mustache be my guest he said my fee is large enough to embarrass even me i doubt that but ill take your offer no no this is a win that will make legends autumn rose therell be stories about it after were both dead he sobered you have your credit bracelet with you naturally when the count is finished wake me i want to transfer a third of the net to helvetia the rest ill bank here i have to pay my backers ah i see it will be several hours sleep well youve earned it he left hadluk winked at her followed him out kikun wiggled his ears rose snorted all right so i was exaggerating a little its nice to have and i dont like being cheated and i knew about the creditlink when i said all thatso what i meant it in essence if the creditlink werent available id walk away without a quiver all right she yawned lets get some sleep weve got a few hours while they finish the count i think we ought to talk about later kuna later plenty of time autumn rose pulled the door shut came in sliding the credit bracelet back on her wrist thats done she flung herself into a chair clearing up out there getting ready to put all that metal away she checked her ringchron two hours till dawn she held out her arm mark me kuna i need to know where you are why just do it hmm ill explain in a minute hurry we havent got much time he widened his eyes flicked his ears if she wasnt going to talk nothing he could do to make her he looked past her grandmother ghost the laellenox was in the corner sitting on otters back giggling in a way she had when something was about to hit him in the face she wasnt going to talk either sighing with exasperation he nuzzled roses arm felt her heat up and tremble that wasnt something he wanted to think about so he didnt all right thats done what now hadluk and juhfeyn should still be out there take a look and see hmm he looked at grandmother ghost she nodded i dont have to look he said they are good kuna stun them and tuck them away under one of those benches we cant let juhfeyn button up this place we need to leave without a major fuss i have to get ready for barracuda so i cant do it barracuda uhhuh second break he made his move came on to me strong she grinned annoyed sunhawk which i wasnt unhappy about you better believe i made like i was fluttered and flattered by his um masculine force made an assignation with him for after the count he wouldnt come here the jerk so im supposed to go across and knock at his door twenty minutes on see nice when they do it to themselves uhhuh got your stunner rose sorry so go will you hadluk was stacking the last of the gold coins on the second cart when kikun stepped into the gameroom juhfeyn was moving around the room straightening a pillow or two checking to make sure the maids had swept properly and all the glass straws spoons forks napkins and other paraphernalia had been cleared away kikun stood in the shallow recess of the doorway waited until both had their backs to him lifted the stunner for a moment he couldnt touch the sensor all he could see was sai falling and falling hitting the floor hitting the wharf falling into the water his hand shook grandmother ghost slid a hand through the door pinched him hard he moved his thumb hit juhfeyn first then hadluk then scooted across to them to make sure they were still alive grandmother ghost clucking after him the pulse was strong under his fingers he closed his eyes grandmother ghost patted him gently he could feel her soft hands touching him all right baby all right cumya cumya grammas chile he got to his feet began moving the bodies under the nearest bench rose turned slowly how do i look shed washed the coloring agent from her hair it was blonde and shining hanging loose about her shoulders like a spill of liquid gold her face was fair and flushed with excitement her eyes were blue again sparkling with glee and malice the shining black dress clung to her torso swirled about her ankles barracuda will be enchanted she laughed it was a wild sound rather like the cough of a cat on the hunt big cat lion lady golden and ready kikuns ears twitched and he was very glad he was dinhast and too alien to be her prey she looked at her ringchron time lets go barracuda opened the door lovely he said you surprise me i hope so she said and moved toward him forcing him to step aside kikun tapped the trigger sensor caught the man as he fell right rose straightened get that tray kuna faster we move the better by the time he got back from the kitchen rose had stripped out of the dress changed into tunic and trousers shed gone through barracudas suite cleaned the place including the case with the shielded com i thought id leave most of my stuff and clear him out might confuse folks about who did what to whom for a while anyway anything moving out there no nothing till we hit the pad out back good lets go thirty hours later tired and grimy but with everything theyd gone in for they were in their ship on the isthmus and autumn rose was talking with digby weve got some strong leads and a prisoner hes omphalos kikun says though his papers say mimishay foundation kikun thinks the oofnarc knows where shadith is and the dyslaera were going to talk to him in a little bit wait if hes really omphalos you wont be able to touch him with what youve got on that ship bring him here now fast as you can kick it you can do stasis theres a box on board good keep him under you dont want him suiciding that oofnarc he wouldnt listen rose i dont care what kind of jerk he is or how much he loves himself if hes pushed to the wall hell be dead before you know whats happening right i didnt go to all this trouble to waste him see you soon unprisoner first leg on the shadow hunt weersyll was a small rocky world inhabited by lichen and worms weersyll the star was a hot greenishyellow dwarf out in the middle of nowhere like a spark that popped from a fire into the middle of a black rug after the slavetrading debacle when omphalos acquired bolodo neyuregg ltd through heavily insulated surrogates the reconstituted company set up headquarters at the bolodo substation on weersyllthere wasnt a populated world in known space that would have them and they couldnt operate out of a clandestine hole the new set of execs made the best of what they had it wasnt bad weersyll might be in the middle of nowhere but it was also equidistant from three clusters thick with planetbearing stars clusters undergoing an explosion of development and lusting for cheap labor they could kick out once the job was done ships buzzed in and out every hour of the day and night customers looking for specific types of laborers transports bringing in cadres whod finished their stints taking other cadres from the domes to the worlds whod bought their services still more bringing in new contracteessurplus men and women who preferred the security of the cadres to starving convicts dumped into bondservice by one world or another people on the run from some danger or other seeking safety in the anonymity of a labor cadre names didnt count here there werent even numbers they were listed by cell prints and vended that way omphalos hadnt bothered themselves about what happened to shadith once they stripped what they thought were her memories and handed her over to the contract market all his annoying them got ginny no farther than that it did get him her cell printand sneers behind their privacy shields he didnt have to see their ugly faces to know that after hed collected a pilot a pair of mercs and a sikkul paem for drive crew at ilkabahar pit ginny headed for weersyll and the records of bolodo neyuregg ltd he spent the insplit time laboring in the workshop retooling a number of the eyes constructing and programming specialized ticks and borers he had everything he needed for the work all the tools and materiel the omphalites at mimishay had spread themselves on this ship they drooled when they thought of bol mutiar on the fifteenth day the ship surfaced at teegahs limit and began moving sublight toward weersyll a gnat among the swarming transports the ship slid into one of the outermost slots of the orbitpark and settled to wait three hours later there was a tentative flicker on his screen then a harried face appeared in the center cell you havent logged in ginny waved the pilot to silence and answered himself this is the caprisi kumar out of blagn i claim emergency status glitch in the splitter my engine crew are working on it at the moment the chief is sure the matter can be rectified without outside help so i have no reason at the moment to bother you down there i just want a place to perch until the repairs are effected you may have noticed there arent that many systems about he rambled on for several minutes longer repeating in other words and a dull monotone what hed just said watching the controllers eyes glaze over pushed to desperation the man interrupted him right emergency be sure you let us know if youre going to move again the screen went gray ginny smiled the pilot raised her blonde brows that was easy he slid out of the captains chair stood with his hands on the arm it is all traffic control can do to keep the incoming and outgoing ships apart and at the same time juggle the shuttle slots they are not about to challenge anyone who provides a reasonable excuse i will be busy the next few hours mertoyl same story for anyone who gets bothered by our presence he transferred to the workstation watched the shuttle traffic carefully chose a moment when the confusion gave even him a headache and dropped a shell to the surface its tiny fields lost in the soup it curved through the thin cold air went to ground over the horizon from the headquarters complex and the clustered mudcolored domes of the levy pens he shut it down and waited one hour three no reaction he cracked the shell sent the eyes flitting toward the complex ticks and borers piggybacked on them the eyes were tiny and relatively slow it was nine days before they reached their target he spent a day exploring the outside of the massive headquarters building and another day insinuating the eyes through outvents down and down he sent them until they reached the memory banks of the company kephalos for four more days he explored the hardware until he was sure he knew the configuration then he flew the eyes where he wanted them and offloaded the ticks and the borers and waited nine hours later data began flowing into his kephalos keyed by shadiths cell print a few clucks and a click and the flow stopped he triggered the secondary programs in his tiny vermin army shifted to the captains chair and called the pilot to the bridge be ready he said say nothing just take us out on the route i planned he called control glitch repaired departing now the screen lit again wait what sector take grid send he tapped the sensor that sent his proposed exit route hed worked it out with considerable care keeping to the least busy sector it meant he headed nearly straight up hitting the limit at a wide angle from the orbital plane made navigation difficult once he was in the split but it was more likely to be approved without argument path approved do not deviate three transport convoys will be surfacing within the next five hours approach the ecliptic and you will be warned then blown away information received will not deviate ginbiryol seyirshi sat in the captains chair and smiled at the image of the world dropping away behind him in about thirty hours bolodo neyuregg ltd would be out of business again and helvetia would be most annoyed if weersyll accessed it at any time during that thirty hourswhich was more than likely considering how busy the place was there is a disease about he thought as he watched the sphere shrink warn your sexpartners you posy whore miralys digby miralys stormed into the room threw the flake on a table that appeared at her side politely provided by the naked man lolling in the bubble hanging under the dome digby stretched out on his stomach among flurries of bright cushions propped his chin on his palms and contemplated the dyslaerin thats a major snit miralee meluv read that she slapped the table hard enough to make the flake bounce as a concession to public form digby closed his eyes a moment and pretended to scan what he already knew then opened them wide so isnt it about what we expected except perhaps their rather excessive optimism as to the sum theyre prepared to accept miralys snorted looked round for a place to sit im in no mood for your games digby all right his exaggerated sigh blew like a gale through the veils undulating about the room a good host honors his guests grouches even when said guest is selfinvited miralys gave the chair that appeared a hefty nudge with her thigh then sat lowering herself with undiminished wariness better adjust your acid levels dig youre beginning to sound bitchy what do i do that lot threw in so many cutouts itd take a century to trace them back he acquired clothing and sat up i assume you dont intend to pay the ransom no only to eat the bastards raw she curled her lips up and back baring her tearing teeth in the dyslaera threatgrin would you be willing to stall for a while go through the motions of getting the cash together why late last night i got a call from autumn rose no no she doesnt know where your ciocan is but shes got her hands on someone who may i thought she was no kikun got them both clear seems they overlooked him she scowled at him how long have you know this a while and you didnt bother telling me no her ears flattened against her skull she started to get up then with visible effort she controlled her anger and resettled herself in the chair why kikun identified the enemy omphalos and omphalos has ties in places even i cant reach until this moment no one here knew but me i see and one dont talk about this two rose is bringing a package for me when its unraveled i should know a lot more a good possibility i should have the location of rohant and the others travel times around four weeks so youll need to stall five million helvetian gelders could you raise that if you wanted to not from voallts korlach if i went to the family she extruded her claws sheathed them we dont pay ransom her ears flattened against her head she brought her claws out again sank them into the simulsides of the chair if i were serious about this id have to take the korlach public bring outsiders in no tss miralili you could start negotiations make it look right but they dont have to go anywhere send off your reply say youre going to need time then start looking for buyers dont have to look what digby snapped his eyes wide someone has approached you i hadnt heard her ears came up twitched i am shocked digby allknowing sssah dont tease miree meluv he brooded a moment then smiled omphalos it has to be i couldnt say the approach was through brokers vidloeg gavinda of helvetia hmm using rohant as a lever into voallts korlach right that gives the answer to how youre going to stall start talking with vidloeg gavinda miralys ears flattened again her lips curled back baring her tearing teeth she hissed with rage restrain your instincts toerfeles go home and get ready to ride and make sure none of your people so much as sneezes beyond your compound walls you dont want outsiders noticing hmm she stared at him gold eyes blind with fury then she bounded to her feet scooped up the flake and stalked out digby clicked tongue against teeth then faded from the bubble sinking into the circuits of his kephalos as he began to ready his house for the peeling of the chom shadow running matja allina bent over the sleeping chal touched his face his fevers down whats the stump look like the herbmistress consulted her list it was checked two hours ago cool no infection um appetite good wanted solid food turned cranky when he saw the broth but drank it down ate his biscuits we can send him home by the end of the week good matja allina moved to the next cot and looked down at the form swathed in bandages burns yes hes still alive but we dont have much hope unless we can get him to the ottodoc in the center at nirtajai is there any chance of that ill ask the arring when he calls she sighed shook her head the artwa isnt likely to spend fuel on a chal do what you can brushie healwomen have some herbal pastes they use on burns summer brush being what it is and summer storms ill send to see if they have something we can use she bent over the motionless form curved her palm over the bandaged face not quite touching the cloth amurra bless and give you peace she moved on aghilo looked through the door shadith touched her arm the matja says the world could burn down but shes going to finish this first what is it the arring pmurrs on the com he wants the matja tell him shes in the infirmary itll be at least another half hour before shes finished is it urgent i dont think so he said theyve taken the base good we can do without more of this aghilo mimed wingflutters with her hands her sudden brief grin lighting her face and you wont be flying your bed again shadith grinned back right its a dead loss as a glider pmurr had a bandage on one arm and a new scar on his face he looked exhausted but he was smiling flat he said razed to bedrock tumaks are dead or scattered with brushie hunters after them it was the fires did it matja bad enough when lightning starts the summerbrush burning they tell me this lot had the habit of riding out and tossing incendiaries for the fun of it with the winds they have out here nothing could outrun those fires and there were families caught i wouldnt want to be a tumak in those hunters hands the result for us is good we wont be bothered by tumaks not any more when news gets back about what happened danger pay wont do it what did it cost us five dead the wounded every mans got a nick here or there most of them not serious ten bad but theyll live brushie healwomen are tending them i suggest we leave them at the mirp until theyre fit to ride we made a pyre for the dead and spread their ashes over the base site brushie dead im not sure about twenty i think most of their wounded are in good shape if they didnt get killed they just got a few scrapes a broken bone or two we owe this to the brushies matja they raided the base arsenal before the tumaks tightened security they got grenades and guns and cussives when we hit the base they blew out the gunposts before the tumaks knew what was happening wed have had a lot more dead if it werent for that good work pmurr one thing before you come home would you see the healwomen and ask what they do for burns and see about the bloodprice for their dead i want that cleared as quickly as possible weve a lot of rebuilding to do right dont relax the watch yet matja allina the bands that were outbase when we attacked are still around either the brushies will get them or we will but itll take a while i hear amurra bless pmurr amur bless matja allina matja allina touched the com off slumped down in the chair one hand absently patting paji in his sling she stared for a long time at the study wall kizra she said finally get the chapa tinoopa please chapa tinoopa send maids to the chalmistresses and chalmasters i want a meeting in the west reception room set the table up with pads and pencils i want an urn of tea and those cheese straws cooks got packed away tell the maids to pass the word that the tumak base is taken and burnt to bedrock people should still be careful but the worst is over ill need you here too we have to replant and rebuild or winters going to be murderous go now the sooner we start on this the sooner it will be done when tinoopa had bustled out matja allina swung round to face shadith kizra shaman id like you to go back to the infirmary the convalescent ward play your songs for them for an hour or so brighten the day a little its a dreary place such a dreary place the rest of the afternoon is yours to do what you want by the time shadith left the infirmary the worst of the afternoon heat was over the air smelled of dust and smoke but the wind sweeping in off the mountains was damp and almost cool in comparison to the swelter of high heat she found a hat pulled it down to shade her eyes and wandered out to the paddocks east of the kuysstead the jinasu had the kuyyot horses out for the first time in weeks they were playing with them riding bareback racing them joying with them in the return of their freedom to run shadith climbed the fence sat on the top rail with her feet hooked behind the rail below she spent a while enjoying their enjoyment it was a splendid antidote to the pain and boredom in the infirmary then she swung the arranga off her back began improvising to the beat of the horses hooves the high fluting laughter of the jinasu they danced the horses to the music black and gray and roan pinto and bay a mosaic of color and shape necks arching manes and tails swinging in the wind jhapuki rode over to her sat on the big black smoothing her hand along his neck scratching through his mane wanna ride uhhuh done it before yeh was years ago though any good not bad jhapuki twisted her body around ommla get the bay gelding the rocking chair huh shadith slipped the strap of the arranga over her head hung the instrument from the nearest upright swung onto the bays backgrabbed a handful of mane as he quickstepped away shed forgotten how wide a horse was when you had to straddle the creatureand how quickly you felt his backbone in your tenderer parts with the jinasu giggling with glee at her clumsy efforts but patiently helping her to recover her form she walked the bay around in circles the girl whose body she wore now had ridden almost from the day she was born so the body knew in muscle and bone what she had to relearn it didnt take long by dusk she had her balance back and her feel for the horses rhythm she couldnt come near the skill of the jinasu but she was racing with them laughing with them enjoying the play of muscles in the beasts the sting of the mane against her face the thunder of their hooves when she slid off the bays back her legs had no strength left she crumpled to the ground sitting splat in a pile of droppings the jinasu held their sides and laughed so hard they nearly fell off their mounts she shook her head laughing with them as she slid sideways onto a clean tuft of grass wriggled back and forth to wipe her bottom off then rolled onto her knees and staggered up oh god she groaned oh god i hurt she waddled bowlegged to the fence crawled over it collected the arranga and tottered back to the house slowly laboriously the kuysstead recovered from the terror new gardens were planted ditches dug and a waterwheel erected by the river to bring water to the plants it was dry season high summer it wouldnt rain again until fall matja allina nursed her son and worked tirelessly to restore the kuysstead alive only when pirs called shadith continued her riding lessons and began gathering supplies for her flight to nirtajai aghilo came into the matjas sitting room stood quietly beside the door waiting for allina to look up from the account books the minute she saw the chal shadith knew what was coming she set the arranga aside crossed the room to matja allina she touched the matjas arm allina yawned stretched what is it kizra aghilo oh she set the stylus down flattened her hands on the table aghilo chal come aghilo walked slowly across the room stopped beside the table i tell me quickly dont make me wait my half sister you know tribbi she called to warn us mingas is is bringing the arrings body home allina closed her eyes moved her tongue over her lips amurra she said finally and the chals no the artwa must be keeping them tribbi says the only men with mingas are his own guards aaaaah allinas hands twitched on the pages of the account books mingas the artwa isnt bothering to come so it seems um matja allina theres something else tribbi said about mingas yes he got drunk with his men and started boasting hes turned off his wife sent her back to her parents he says hes going to get him a new one a young one unspoiled ingva i see and um you dont have to tell me what he plans for me tribbi says he went into lots of detail what he was going to get out of you she didnt repeat any of it just said it was enough to make a goat sick she called soon as she could hes still drinking him and his men they wont leave the aynti until tomorrow sunhigh at the earliest which means itll be round sunset tomorrow before hes here yes the word was hardly more than a whisper allina shook herself scrubbed her hands across her face find ingva will you dear send her to me that is what waits daughter matja allina leaned back into shadiths hands closed her eyes a moment sinking into the calm shadith was feeding her ingva was more angry than afraid she ran her hands through her hair caught up a china ornament flung it against the wall hissed through her teeth as it crashed to the rug shouted curses shed learned from the brushies hra nguntik no the matja straightened listen to me i want you to think carefully ingvalirri you have three choices you can wed mingas no listen to me youll have rights as a wife you dont have as an unmarried girl and if youre clever enough youll learn to manage him you are clever enough you know hes full of spite and anger and hes apt to take out his frustrations on you but hes stupid stupider than the artwa without any of the artwas charm you understand what that means quieter now ingva twisted her face into a grimace of distaste gah youd be comfortable youd have a place to be plenty of food clothes no i was hoping youd say that the thought of him matja allina sighed and let shadith once more soothe away her tensions i can send you to foster with one of my mothers brothers theyll take you find a husband for you when the time comes for that and ill see you have a proper dowry hra no she snatched up another ornament caught her mothers eye and set it gently down my uncles are no mina smiled they are arent they youll be safe there but youll have to be what they want are you sure amurra yes you know what the third choice is luv go brushie itll be a hard life and a brutal one youve seen enough of it to understand that i think ill tell you this ingvalirri if i hadnt met your father at just the right time id be out there myself come with me now ingva rushed to her mother dropped to her knees caught hold of allinas hands we can both go take yla with us just leave i cant luv theres paji this is his kuyyot i have to hold it for him yla shed be miserable out there shes not like you and im too old to bend daughter id be a drag on you and the brushies and a danger youll be neither ingva dropped her head rested her cheek a moment against her mothers hands ill come back and see you when hes gone if you go luv dont yearn for what youve left behind thats a chart for disaster believe me i dont yearn for things ingva gave her mothers hand a last squeeze got to her feet only for people still she rubbed at her forehead frowned at the wall without seeing it im going to need things what can i take with me well matja allina got to her feet resettled the sleeping paji kizra would you spend the next hour please with the convalescents after that do what you want for until an hour before supper then i want to see you and tinoopa in the arrings study she crossed to ingva who was waiting by the door youll want horses and gear ingvalli im going to give you your fathers blacks i cant stand the thought of mingas getting his hands on them ill tell him they were killed in the terror sugar and cloth guns her voice faded as she went out and up the stairs with her daughter shadith wrinkled her nose got the arranga and went out singing for the maimed and the sick depressed her but it was only an hour then she could go riding for the rest of the afternoon she was sore and stiff yet but it was wearing off it was time to go no more lingering or dithering leave or live under mingas rule whistling under her breath she strolled from the room matja allina walked beside the black horse her daughter rode she walked with head high her hand on her daughters knee signifying to all who watched her approval of this thing pmurr waited for them on the ferry landing he stood beside matja allina watching ingva nervously following the instructions of the ferryman as she led the two blacks onto the ferry i told you to go with her you should have gone allina said no my fealty is with the arring pirs not with his daughters pirs is dead his son isnt i see then youd better move your things into the house and sleep each night in the nursery it was irony in her mouth but not in his ears he bowed i will do so at once startled she watched him walk off she hadnt realized how much he disliked her he blames me for pirs death she thought im the reason he wasnt with pirs and couldnt save him or die for him the sound of the winch motor changed she closed her eyes a moment then turned slowly and watched ingva lead the horses up the far bank of the river she watched her daughter mount one of the blacks and ride off leading the other ingva neither turned nor waved matja allina stood silent on the landing until the brush had swallowed ingva then she turned and walked back to the house her head was high her eyes blind with the tears she wouldnt shed matja allinas face was drawn weary beyond description she waved the two women to chairs across the table from her and began talking without bothering with any of the usual courtesies pirs was determined to keep you here the full year of the bargain she curled her hand under the weight of her baby not so much holding him as taking comfort from him he thought wed need you even more while paji was getting through these first months the hard months things she swallowed things have changed she eased forward careful not to wake the baby i want you to have these she lifted the rolledup documents from the table held them out the papers pirs signed on pajis nameday shadith leaned over took both scrolls looked down at them the names were written on the outside she handed tinoopa her papers and sat holding her own allina flattened her hands on the table kizra shaman youve been working up to leaving us shadith gaped at her allina shook her head my dear you have forgotten how small a place this is everything is known you might as well have shouted it from the roof oh yes matja allina touched her tongue to her lips she started to speak changed her mind for several minutes there was no sound in the room but the whine of the wind outside and their own breathing mingas she said finally shadith nodded you told ingva she said stupid malicious a weak man a bad man she thought a minute and ugly yes utilas has been the heir pirs was the the beautiful one the one everyone liked allina closed her eyes pressed her lips together she shook off the weakness went on rintirry was the baby spoiled you saw him mingas was the accident he was a son so he was adopted into the family but the artwa never bothered to marry his mother i remember her she was still alive when i married pirs a long shuddering sigh now hes got his chance i know hes talked angakirs into appointing him pajis guardian otherwise it would be utilas coming with the with the body when he finds out you let ingva go tinoopa tapped the papers on the curve of her knee what can he do to you whatever he wants oh not legally but whos to see out here and he has his guards with him like the pair he brought with him to the nameday thugs yes what about yla as soon as i can ill send her to fostering he cant stop that shes too young for marrying while theyre still children girls are the mothers responsibility will he marry you not during my year of mourning not marriage shadith stirred look matja you dont have to take this you should get out of here with yla and paji you could come with me or go to the brush allina tapped her fingers on the table top a curiously restrained expression of the passion shadith felt seething in her she shook her head no this house the land theyre pajis birthright i will not let that viper steal them from him a pillow over pajis face thats all it would take to clear title isnt that right oh yes you want us to guard him if you cant stop mingas how could we you couldnt kizra shaman she twisted her fingers together stared past shadith at the wall i will i will do anything i have to oh allina shivered flattened her hands again im still the matja here until tomorrow night i can give the two of you what i choose to give kizra shaman has chosen her way what is yours chapa tinoopa ill wait here thank you im too old and fat and citybred besides i know from jits not horses fall off and kill myself two kays out she looked thoughtfully at matja allina you want to be very careful or youll bring down the roof on you and the children what something happens to mingas hmm the artwa doesnt like you thinks youre uppity ive run into that myself way things are here how olds utilas son or is he the next heir you have it the oldest inherits unless hes totally unfit and rulas isnt hes a lot like pirs reelyn is the second son hes a little younger than rintirry was i dont know much about him which is good right then utilas wont be wholly hostile to um say fate for giving young what was it reelyn a break thats a plus whats he think of mingas detests him another plus tinoopa frowned at the roll of papers she made a circle of thumb and forefinger began sliding the roll back and forth through the round she looked up mind some blunt speaking matja allina smiled wearily i havent so far have i do you want more children allina touched her fingers to her lips a sudden wave of grief and pain and loss rolled out of her filling the room like fog tinoopa didnt see it but shadith was almost drowning in it no allina whispered pirs is dead im an old old woman no right i got to talking with a circle of brushie healwomen during the shearing it was youve some interesting herbs on this world hmm when youre feeling more like talking business i know a drug prospector whod be interested we could work out connections with the pharmaceuticals improve your credit line we started out the healwomen and me talking about contraceptives and abortifacients subject of rape came up told me sometimes tumaks come looking for brushie girls drunk enough theyll jump anything with a hole in it and its safer to meddle with brushies no blood feuds or private wars brewed up that way if the brushie girls family catches him well they find themselves a smet colony bury him up to his neck next to a mound and smear his face with sugar syrup she smiled not a nice smile my youngest daughter i lost her to a diaper salesman thats not what you think he sells children to pedophiles i never found him i ever do ill bring him back here well thats beside the point sometimes the tumak gets away keeps getting away comes back time after time the healwomen go round the mirps and choose someone a woman maybe even a girl someone who doesnt want children and is willing to take a chance on being killed they prepare her stake her out for the sekerak thats what they call him though i suppose you know that sooner or later he takes the bait does the deed before the month is out hes dead the girls sick for a while the ointment dries her up inside and the antidote turns her eyes yellow but they say she doesnt mind and afterward shes fine sterile but fine matja allina contemplated the older woman for several moments if i were wise i would say interesting but nothing to do with me im sorry about your daughter thats true tinoopa shrugged it was a long time ago in some things time has no meaning no tinoopa drew her thumb along her jawline youre wrong there matja it does have meaning what im saying is this grief heals and rage cools she dropped her hands onto her thigh but youre also right hate doesnt die it just gets old and cold and harder than stones yes matja allina got to her feet kizra youll have to leave by dawn tomorrow so youll be far enough away by the time mingas arrives that it wont be worth the danger going after you i can supply you tonight afterward she shrugged its short notice im afraid but you were going anyway so make a list let me know what youll need she didnt wait for an answer but turned to tinoopa immediately i will take supper in my room when kizras list is ready bring it to me ill mark what i approve and authorize you to dispense the materials be careful around pmurr he isnt liking me much these days so hell do what he can to make problems for anything i try a knocking kizra shadith rolled out of bed pulled the robe around her and crossed to the door yawning she let tinoopa in that time already not quite cooks got breakfast ready for you some sandwiches for later shes waiting to give you a sendoff shadith ran her hands through her hair scrubbed at her eyes gods does everybody know some sneak sit down a minute want to ask you something shadith dropped on the end of the bed huh the mindwipe didnt take did it there were um complications the operator didnt know about things came back to me and you know where youre going what youre going to do who youre going to call yeh i thought so catch the sac landed in shadiths lap with a series of dull clunks it was heavy she loosened the drawstrings pulled the neck open coins inside she raised her brows incentive tinoopa said im a thief remember what id like you to do get word to my son where i am jao juhfeyn he runs a tavern called kipuny shimmery on a world called arumdam iskalgun let him know where i am all right consider it done thanks the matja authorized hot water at least you can ride out feeling clean tinoopa this mingas hes mean maybe a bit crazy tinoopa waggled a hand hes not going to live long enough to be much trouble if the matja doesnt get him i will all i can say is im glad im going to be somewhere else interesting times tinoopa straightened the lady bless young kiz she left shadith cupped her hand under the sac hefted it well the weight of it makes all this real no more dreams no more dithering in a few hours im going im really going she felt like throwing up terror thats what it is sheer sickmaking terror swearing under her breath her legs shaking she stood tossed the money sac into the knot of quilts and went out shadith rode out from ghanar rinta an hour before dawn she had a packer on a lead rope one of the roughcoated ponies that the shepherds used she rode a small sturdy bay pony with a black mane the matja had offered horses but the jinasu jhapuki insisted on the ponies its a long way she said horses will die on you get a notion in their silly heads and go down and they wont get up the ponies wont go fast but theyll get you there walk as much as you ride and give them plenty of time to browse the matja had provided a map with roads and ayntis marked on it notes pirs made about water and campsites estimates of time between trailmarks notes about ambushes the map he usually carried around in his gear hed left it behind when he took the chal and the supplies to caghar rinta the ponys head bobbed rhythmically before her his hooves beat out a slow syncopation on the hardpan underfoot his tail switched now and then stinging against one leg or the other mesmerizing put her into slowmotion into a drifting inconsequent reverie she thought about memory memory was everything its fragile deadleaf lace was threaded through her present and in a way controlled her future when her memories were temporarily displaced she turned passive fearful every step she took threatened to drop her off the brink of the known in a way her brain and body began reverting to the dead meat shed revivified such a short while ago only her underlying toughness and the prodding of those nightmares shed resented so much had kept her alive in those prelizard days the nightmares and tinoopa providing a stable pole she could revolve about after this business was over if she survived it shed move with measurably less assurance through her days that was one thing shed learned another thingmaybe more importantwas how desperately she needed other people in her life shed known people quietly content with living alone preferring a filled solitude to empty company but these were always settled into stable societies where tradition and the ambient culture were sufficient surrogates for family and friends its what aleytys was hunting for all those years a context that and a family to replace the one that drove her out shes got it now family and friends and work i want that not the details gods id be petrified on wolff i dont even like grey that much family and friends and work she thought about mingas the artwa matja allina in the prison of her culture wasted and unwanted distorted by what was demanded of her and by what was forbidden youd better be careful what kind of context you pick shadow very careful therere downsides to everything you want to be sure what they are before you commit ayyah thats the third thing youve learned here and likely the most important she pushed hard at first letting the ponies alternate between a fast walk and a canter riding the little bay was like sitting a jit on a corduroy road but she spared neither herself nor her mounts the day heated up as the morning winds dropped and finally she knew she couldnt go much longer she let the pony slow to a tired shuffle and fished out the map the brush on both sides of the rutted dirt road was a meter higher than her head there was nothing else to see but the tan road and a sky yellow with a punishing heat she checked the angle of the sun almost directly overhead around a halfhour past sunhigh she pulled the map into the shade of her hat brim to cut the dazzle of the parchment squinted at the tiny black writing there was a bridge some way ahead built over a wide swooping bend of the river that ran past the rinta water and browse a good place to stop and wait out the worst of the heat she folded the map again tucked it into the saddlebag and slumped into the sway of the ponys walk she reached the bridge at the beginning of the fourth hour past sunhigh the river was siltladen and sluggish but under the pohn trees there was a tentative small breeze that hugged the water and barely stirred the stiff leaf lozenges and the shade was balm for her burning eyes she watered the ponies stripped their gear off gave them some grain on a square of canvas and left them to eat and browse as they wished she hung the saddleblankets over a low limb to dry out laid down her groundsheet and stretched out on it using the saddle as a pillow she was asleep in seconds it was two hours later when she woke she was sticky and sore she had a crick in her neck and a hollow feeling in her stomach the shadows were longer thicker the sun low in the east she sat up rubbed at her neck and felt around for the ponies theyd stayed close by they were nosing among the dried grasses under the trees nipping at choice bits and chewing patiently once they had a mouthful she dug her fingers into her hair scratched extravagantly half a day sar she dug the map out of the saddlebag and sat studying it well shadow i might as well spend the night here cant reach the next water before dark hmm looks like id better do some planning isnt going to work riding straight through that suns a killer she scowled at the map dismayed by the tiny distance shed covered in those hours of riding at this rate itd take forever to reach nirtajai a high whining broke through the whisper of the leaves the mutter of the river off to her left a black dot arced by cutting in and out of sulfurcolored clouds gone before she could get to her feet mingas ahead of schedule hunh she yawned she sat watching the fire die the wind was rising the clouds had blown away taking the heat with them the blanket round her shoulders actually felt good alone she was starting to feel comfortable with that as long as there was an end to it comfortable even happy i know what it is im not drifting any more im doing something she wrapped the blanket around her stretched out on the groundsheet her head on the saddle even if i had to get booted into it she sighed with pleasure and gazed up at the sky the moon hadnt risen yet the stars were thick and brilliant it was like the sky shed seen as a child when she was so young she still had the skin on her eggsac slinging a spark popped from the circle of stones landed on her hand startling her awake the raska tsipor pa prool was sitting across the fire from her watching her you built it up shadith said yesss why tsipor shrugged her narrow shoulders you want something omphalos what you going to make them hurt shadith wriggled free of the blankets and sat up that good or bad i felt your purpose i came huh to sssee them hurt at the moment im not too capable of hurting anyone you will i feel it her black eyes reflected the flames she undulated her torso her mouth was open a little and her thin black tongue flickered in and out of the gap there was a force in the woman something unleashed in her that shed kept hidden all the time she was in the truck and at the rinta how i mean whatre you talking about tsipor did an odd twisting movement of her hands talking seemed difficult for her i know i come with you shadith frowned oh hell with it she thought why not tsipor nodded she came round the fire reached out held her hand above shadiths arm not quite touching the skin she waited all right shadith said the hand touched her soft warm dry power flowed into her jolting her as if shed stuck her finger in a light socket after her first startlereflex she reached there was a horse a short distance off tied to a tree with a tether long enough to let him graze on a patch of grass there were lbourghhas sniffing round the ponies she twitched a nerve in the predators and sent them running off the ponies kept on grazing and didnt know what had just passed by them her reach leaped beyond the horizon all the way back to the kuysstead she felt allinas anguish mingasshe wrenched herself away from him sickened she touched the back of tsipors hand the raska moved away the powerflow was gone and shadith felt deeply diminished as if shed suddenly gone deaf or blind it took minutes for her sense of herself to settle she contemplated tsipor i look through beast eyes do you look through mine tsipor nodded telepath tsipor shook her head not thinking feeling she held up her narrow hand only touching shadith relaxed why dont you go untie your horse let him graze ill bring him in when its time to start on unless you no is feeling is not riding is not like yours is other things but once again she did that painful twist of her hands it seemed to be her equivalent of a shrug you had something to eat yess you sleep i watch on the second night shadith gazed across the fire at tsipor tell me she said the raska nodded her story was a performance part body a dance of torso and arms and face part words single words short phrases part ghost images that appeared and dissolved between them despite her resemblance to the cousin baseform tsipor pa prool was not a cousin her way of seeing and saying was skewed at an odd angle to shadiths so shadith was never quite sure she understood what tsipoor was saying to her in her multilevel langue image sipayor sirasaka tsipors homeworld sense of dryness of complexitycrystalline scoutship finds it the sigil on the ship is the circled spiral of omphalos something happens omphalos controls the world now omphalos is doing things to the raskas making them different surgery forced breeding terror anger grief image raska males conical mounds of flesh can move some slowly sloooowly prefer stillness contemplation makers of songs and joy receivers of life taking fertilizing incubating the eggs of the raska females image mating rite wonder power pleasure raska females dancing in the light of seven moons rubbing themselves against the male mindflow as music shadith heard it as a grand symphony played by an orchestra of hundreds image time has passed the raska females return to the male deposit eggs in the prepared cavities of his spongy flesh explosion of tenderness love joy and then omphalos came tsipor wept not tears but with her hands and her pain image the eggs cut from the male he keens his agony and his loss the females tied to him come racing to him are captured or killed tsipor is one captured the male dies he cries out his grief his pain and dies she feels him die her sistermates die she feels them die omphalos keeps her alive alive and alone tsipor cut off the story at that place what happened after that did not matter she would not speak of it why she said finally her hands and body repeating her confusion her anguish why make such pain dont ask me shadith said i didnt understand ginny i dont understand omphalos tell you true i dont want to id be afraid itd rub off on me they rose before dawn rode and walked walked and rode to the next water on the map slept through the worst of the heat rode and walked walked and rode for several hours after sundown day faded into day they saw no one no traveling chals no wandering brushies or tumaks no trucks on the road or skimmers overhead after the second night they didnt say much to each other there was no need on the fifteenth day shortly after dawn four silver spheres flared into sudden visibility before behind and on each side of them tsipor and shadith shot at the same time each hit their mark but the pellets rebounded from the spheres without damaging them i permitted that as an exercise in futility i know that voice shadith said ginny singer what do you want not your death thats obvious you dont waste words on targets yes i will be joining you in one moment i prefer not to have to wait for you to recover from a stunning so stay where you are all right a small flit dropped to the ground ahead of them opened up its side ginbiryol seyirshi stepped onto the ramp beckoned to them shadith kicked her heels into her ponys sides dropped the lead rope and rode forward tsipor pa prool stayed back watching rifle held loosely under her arm ginny held up a hand truce he called out do you agree shadith stopped the pony five meters off sat frowning at him last time you didnt bother asking just grabbed why all this i need your active cooperation why should i have anything to do with you omphalos the enemy of my enemy is my friend i never much believed that does it matter no matter what you think of me you do have friends and omphalos has them not for long experimental material has a short life line in their hands why should i believe you read me tell me destruction breeds round you singer i need you i dont trust you i cant your own words singer last time i didnt bother asking just grabbed we both remember how wrong that went true how did you get away you were a prisoner werent you they meant to use me to take a world for them so they sent me out on a ship with a workshop built to my specifications fools yes as big a fool as i was trying to contain you truce till when one year during which time neither attempts to kill the other good enough one last thing my companion she has reason to loathe omphalos she comes necessary yes agreed provided she swears truce also shadith twisted around waved tsipor to them the raska came slowly her dark red eyes fixed on seyirshi he offers truce shadith said while we go after omphalos is true ssaying at the moment tsipor flipped the rifle around handed it to shadith she slid from the saddle with a boneless ease and walked up the ramp she stopped in front of seyirshi reached toward him let her touch you ginny theres no harm in it tsipor the right arm not the left tsipor pa prool dropped her hand lightly on seyirshis true arm jerked it away hissing as she did so she stepped back turned to face shadith bad she said to trust now iss yess all right shadith said were in dyslaera rohant edges toward escape rohant lay on his back his hands resting one below the other under his ribs it was dark in the cell as dark as it ever got the lights in the corridor outside dimmed to a grayish twilight as he had night after night for weeks now miji the sakali trotted along an unlit corridor frill erect senses alert for insomniac wanderers it was about an hour before dawn on a night as uneventful as last night and the night before and the night before that and so on but he was never at ease inside the prison wing for weeks now rohant had been using the sakali like a blind mans cane probing the corridors around his cell and throughout the prison wing it was a frustrating process he could not see through mijis eyes or hear what he heard he could only read the sakalis reactions feel the play of his muscles despite this he was acquiring considerable information about his surroundings dyslaera had unusually accurate perceptions of distance direction and duration each pitpat of mijis tiny feet told him more about the maze around him the omphalites took him out of his cell nearly every day sometimes twice every five days they took him to the exercise court so he could wash get some sun and work the kinks out of his body running round and round inside those slippery walls the other times he went to the saferoom where the techs made lifeflakes of him in the first one they made him shave off half his mustache then read out a message to miralys the degree to which his halfmustache grew back was a timing device for subsequent flakes evidence that an extended period was being recorded and they took him to dine with the grand chom who discarded his mask and robes for these encounters the serviteurs were androids not flesh to be shocked by the choms departure from the rules of behavior before outsiders there were no guards inside the room but he wasnt being foolish there was a stunfence down the center of the table ceiling to floor between omphalite and dyslaeror come here he said the first night they dined warily rohant came toward him he touched the screen and went down he was out for twenty minutes when he woke he found that the serviteurs had lifted him away from the screen settled him in his chair crossed his arms on the table laid his head on them a lesson the grand chom said its a stunfield it wont kill you youre much too valuable to waste the third night they dined the chom showed rohant the flake theyd made for miralys rohant shaving half his moustache then reading the statement then six successive views with related physical data then the final message detailing how the payment was to be made we have you he said if your toerfeles wants you back she has to sell us a piece of voallts korlach she wont be able to raise the ransom elsewhere weve seen to that and once we have the piece we have the whole he held his hands up closed them into fists before the years out your toerfeles will be working for us rohant said nothing let the chom think he was chagrined by this development he wasnt it wasnt going to happen hed learn his mistake when miralys was standing in front of him tearing his throat out they kept flaking rohant every two or three days after the first demand was sent out theyve done this before he thought theyre almost as slick as they think they are he hadnt been called to dinner for over two months the chom was away somewhere or so the gossip went he didnt know if he missed it or not the food was better than he got in his cell but the company took his appetite away miji pattered through the corridors growing more restless as the minutes passed dawn was approaching and he needed to be out of this place and in his burrow before the sun was up rohant brought him back through the maze of corridors took him out to the exercise court he gave the sakali a mindrub felt him wriggle with pleasure then let him go miji dived into the murky water of the sump swam vigorously through the outflow pipe and went scurrying off hurrying to get home before the sun brought the tjejunga birds out hunting for stray sakalis and other smalllives he was ready to go he had his escape route planned into the novice living quarters out into the novice garden through the pleasure house to the postern gate that stood open night and day far as he could tell propped open by something cold and heavy that miji didnt like touching once he was outside the compound hed head for the nearest cover and keep running hoping he could stay clear long enough to get outside the range of their seekers it wasnt much of a plan but it was better than sitting around on his tailbone waiting to be skinned for the amusement of these stupid sheep there were three conditions that had to be met before he could make his try he had to be out of his cell only the kephalos could open that grill for him he had to have a means of overcoming his flesh guards always two of them one going before him the other following he had to have a way of distracting the android guard one android always always the same one leaving the cell was no problem for one reason or another he was out nearly every day the guards werent a problem either thanks to miji miji pattered along an offshoot of the main corridor there were cells on both sides in a cubicle in the middle of that cellrank a man mijis startle response alerted rohant to the presence of the man the speed with which curiosity replaced wariness suggested he posed no threat miji pattered into the cubicle and began nosing at the man poking and tugging at him with his agile sixfingered hands gaining confidence every moment as the man showed no response in his cell rohant was sweating with the effort to stay calm he could feel what mijis fingers felt he got the textures of the cloth and the skin the prickle of the fine hairs the looseness of the muscle under the skin he knew when miji had worked his way up the mans body to his arm there was something under the sleeve a sheath leather probablybecause miji nibbled at it a metal rod in the sheath short about the length of rohants thumb but thinner it could be a stunrod rohant squeezed down his surge of excitement it was disturbing miji who backed off and was about to scuttle away sweating his face twisted with concentration he coaxed the sakali back to the arm got him to pop the snaps take the rod from the sheath and bring it away again and again he had to convince miji to bring him the rod he caressed and cajoled the little sakali kept him trotting along on his hind legs the rod clutched to his chest after what seemed an eternity miji was crouching outside the grill his bright black eyes sparkling with satisfaction rohant knelt by the grill reached between the bars and brought him into the cell palming the rod at the same time getting it into the front of his prison shirt he sat with the sakali on his knee scratching gently about the frill with the tip of his foreclaw miji closed his eyes and went limp his tongue hanging out he trilled with pleasure a tiny bubbling whistle that was pure joy later when miji was out and sleeping in his burrow rohant manage a brief look at his prize it was indeed a stunrodsmall short range but all he needed to take out the flesh guards he opened a halfinch of the hem of his shirt slid the rod into the opening and went to work on figuring a way of distracting or disabling the android i went she told rohant when he came back i didnt know what to expect what i saw was odder than i expected still i dont know digby was sitting in a pulochair inside an image bubble he was a square brown man with black eyes wide cheekbones and a smile that could light up all of spotchhelspar i liked him the minute i saw him he had a good smell well you know what i mean it was the same thing with that odd creature frittagga addams anyway i let him take the language extract then we talked and he told me he already knew what part of the problem was the watchman program youre running it on full cycle arent you yes thats the way i was told to do it when i bought the androids everyone is the jacals love it that way what i suspect thats what youve got raiding your stocks someone hired a jacal probably to get the jinnkitt i hear youve refused three separate offers for it yes we wont deal with brokers and we wont sell where we dont trust right you know the reason why watchman androids are sold in threes memory it was early days for voallts korlach theyd just opened the compound in spotchhelspar miralys was pregnant with lissorn and they had a single capture ship out bringing in stock for their cages rohant was their sole capture chief and his cousin napos ran the ship in addition to the dyslaerors they had four grydeggin trackers in their capture team a universitytrained katsitoi triad acting as a communal xenobiologist and two trumpet viner cousins as ecologists setting the pattern for mixed crews that voallts korlach continued till the present day a series of thefts had been giving miralys fits despite sentries and a triad of watchman androids someone had been getting to the stock carrying off small but valuable birds beasts reptiles the thief had twice got close to their most valuable beast a pure white mersallan jinnkitt with a base worth of fifty thousand helvetian gelders its actual price probably double that miralys had already turned down two bidders because she didnt like the way they smelled a third had used a broker she sent the broker away without bothering to listen to his offer it was something she and rohant had agreed on from the beginning they would not sell so much as a feather through brokers the buyers had to represent themselves they wanted to know where their stock was going and what was going to happen to it i was wondering what to do next she told rohant when he got back when zimaryn brought in this card it made me laugh there was this miniholoa up in the left corner a shovel dancing silly thing of course id heard of digby and excavations ltd is there anyone on spotchals who hasnt i wasnt sure what to think of him and his business and most of all his prices the well the exceedingly ambiguous being who sent the card in ill say she for conveniences sake was a blonde beauty im not that good at judging the attractions of outsiders but it seemed to me she was rather past her prime she sat in the pulochair crossed her legs and smiled at me and said her name was frittagga addams i tapped my claw on the card and gave her the hoteye why i said five thefts in the past three months police nowhere though theyre trying here on spotchals the ptb like to encourage young healthy expanding enterprises young so right i said we cant possibly afford digbys fees even if theyre only half what theyre rumored to be digby is willing to take his fee in services rather than gelders specify digby is a man with a voracious hunger for knowledge dyslaera are very little known outside of dysstrael he wishes to learn the language and history of your people nothing sacred or private just whatever is public knowledge what you teach your children if you will provide a language extract and would agree to come and talk with him once a week for the next year hell consider that sufficient fee for his services which are he will discover the thief the means by which the thefts are accomplished and if possible recover the stolen stock he cant guarantee this last because he doesnt know the purpose of the thefts i understand i said ill have to consult the family first do that then come and speak with him youll see wouldnt it be better for him to come here so he can see the place not possible come youll see and then she left i quoted the brochure to him she told rohant i was irritated he was belaboring the obvious so i might as well respond in kind to insure flexibility of response and reaction speed in a casing of reasonable size memory capacity is limited the intake must be sorted and downloaded every three hours the three androids must download in staggered series so that at least one is at full efficiency at the moment when one is taken out of circuit whats wrong with that i said it only takes a minute it means that the jacal has an opportunity to raid every hour of the night he had already acquired plans for your pens he knows when the fullresponse droid is as far away as its going to get he chaffs the halfloaded droid overwhelming itsintake flips in his scoop and gets the target out before the fullresponse can locate the trouble and cross the intervening space he can do it over and over again whenever he wants if you add flesh guards hell kill them i take it youve moved the jinnkitt once or twice yes first night it was off its feed we had it in the infirmary the second time was just before a client was coining to look at it we were grooming it and playing with it so it would be in good spirits right thats the only reason you still have it the first part of the answer is simple change the routine new pattern of patrol every night for one thing for another download after one hour not three you keep your droids livelier time down is much shorter and the change in pattern will annoy the jacal no end i hadnt thought of that ro it was such a simple change and so obvious once he said it it was worth whatever trouble this chatting business put me to besides i liked the man i already liked talking to him i did what he said we caught the jacal digby got enough on the one who hired him a turd named tambaedee to scare him off and the rest you know omphalos was using the same android every time they came for him it had a scratch underneath its right visionlens which gave it a rakish look almost like a dueling scar he was sure they were keeping it on fullcycle twice hed seen signs it was near saturation a faint hesitation in its movements a sluggishness in its responses the first time was before he had the stunrod the second time they made him strip in the cell before they took him out they were taking him to a special session in the lab so he had to leave the rod behind now he was cultivating a hunters patience waiting quietly till all three factors clicked in it would happen soon had to be soon before they gave up on miralys and moved him to black house the grand chom was away they said how true that was rohant didnt know or where or what had happened to him there was a restiveness in the place that was connected with the choms absence something has gone wrong for them they cant figure what but they feel things arent right he knew that nervousness it was the kind that passed through a herd when a predator was eying them he had to get out of here soon savant speaking to notepad subject r native name rohant has emerged from the fugue state but continues in a curious passivity tech insists this has nothing to do with passivity but is rather the typical huntmode of a predator the time of waiting before the strike note tech is showing further signs of deviation i recommend removal from mimishay and rehabilitation at the institute if his attitude does not improve subsequent to such actions i must advance a suggestion of termination with prejudice his skills as a tech are without question however his growing insubordination is a corrupting force among his juniors further note negotiations with voallts korlach are proceeding slowly but there is no real problem another rat is being prepared to increase pressure on the toerfeles so she will expedite the bargaining and reach the point of decision despite the losses this has been a markedly successful ploy congratulations to the planners may their fertility increase worms in the walls wasps in the rafters wherein mimishay learns the folly of messing with dyslaera and distorting the creations of dedicated artists like ginbiryol seyirshi shadith ginbiryol seyirsi tsipor shadith followed the android onto the bridge she stopped in the doorway shuddered it was the ugliest place shed seen since stavver stole the diadem from the rmoahl towers what wasnt starkly utilitarian was heavily disastrously ornamented the cabin ginny gave her was stripped to the bones nothing there but toeup furniture and gray walls as she looked around she decided he had redeeming qualities she hadnt noticed before since he hadnt put her in a suite with this sort of decor ginny was seated off to one side working at the comspecs station a habit she remembered from the first time hed hauled her off somewhere he braced his prosthetic hand against the sensor board and pushed the chair around you slept a long time i was tired apparently tell me something singer was ajeri kilavez among the prisoners in the hold you do remember her she was there in the pod beside yours ah i thought so the omphalite told me she died at the hole he brooded for a moment staring down at the unflesh hand watching the fingers and thumb twitch then he looked up i had to replace my crew the pilot is one mertoyl there are two mercs in crew quarters they will handle beams and missiles and i have acquired a sikkul paem in bud to tend the drives i prefer sikkul paems as engine crew they do not interfere in what is not their business it is an attitude i recommend you adopt tuitui wheres all this cooperation you flourished when you roped us in he contemplated her a moment produced a small tight smile cooperation i do not think i mentioned the word my recollection is that we have agreed not to kill each other for the moment right she settled herself in the coseat crossed her legs and rested her hands on her knees so what now we will talk in a moment i must finish what i am doing here he pulled himself around bent over the slantboard and went back to tapping the sensor plates watching the hexa cells in front of him as the halfdozen he was working with flickered through image after image shadith rubbed at her eyes let her head fall back as she considered the new pilot mertoyl was a thin fair woman with wispy ash blonde hair and gray eyes so pale they were nearly colorless her trousers were gray leather its shadow diamond texture identifying the leather as murraskin which meant it was contraband and almost as expensive as her tunic that tunic had the deep subtle sheen of avrishum probably cost more than many people earned in a year a single earring dangled from her left ear a teardrop of silver with a gray shimmerpearl in the cutout center she was a ghostimage of a woman but a ghost with very expensive tastes where does he get them these etiolate blondes these peculiar pilots with their penchant for absolute loyalty because she has it too bad as ajeri has it already though she cant have been with him more than a few months is it catching gods i hope not tsipor was squatting by the back wall her arms crossed on her knees her dark red eyes empty of expression though she was hard to read her rhythms so alien they only rarely approached cousin norms she seemed powereddown almost dormant shadith glanced at her shivered looked away during the nights and days of the ride across the brushland shed felt close to the raska their shared needs and the solitude they were locked into had overcome instinctive dislike mutual disliketsipor found the monkey cousins as repellent as they found her and had no difficulty making that revulsion apparent that closeness pseudocloseness whatever it was gone now probably because tsipor had transferred her loyalty such as it was to ginny as the one most likely to see omphalos rolled in the dust a hexa cell pulsed widened until it touched top and bottom of the forescreen a world image swam in the center of the cell arumdam ginny said that is where we are going shadith blinked coincidence thats the world where tinoopas son is hope hes not in this if he gets killed what am i going to tell her ginny tapped in a code took the pov in a rapid slant downward until it hovered above an island shaped like a tadpole trying to bite its own tail a curving ridge of mountains the bony protrusions of the tadpoles spine haed nunn he said the mimishay foundation is there he tapped a sensor and a small red light began flashing at the back of the circle of water the tadpoles head on one side and tail on the other there is some manual capacity but its defenses are mostly controlled by the kephalos i intend to infiltrate eyes into that kephalos once i have control of it i can turn their defenses against them and slag the place sounds simple enough what about rohant and the dyslaera theyre in there arent they how do we get them out even before i left half of them were dead and the others in such misery they would welcome death why complicate things complicate one tooth and a fingernail left theyre coming out as the ship swam through the insplit the argument went on and on taken up and dropped taken up again shadith stalked restlessly about the bridge she stopped beside ginny fists on hips whyd you bother coming for me you dont need what i do you dont listen to me why you are the one who will not listen i have told you again and again i do not know why i need you that will only become apparent when you do something do what you see you do not listen is it too simple for you i have no idea what i will not know until you do it i do know this you will destroy either mimishay or me because i am no threat to you at present i can hope it will be mimishay that will receive the force of your aah presence so im some goddam primal force precisely youre crazy i suspected that and now i know primal force gah he smiled at her that characteristic small tight twitch of his pale lips he was undisturbed by her skepticism and felt no need to defend himself shadith went stomping off the bridge before she drowned in her own futility look getting rohant and the others out that comes first then you can do what you want with mimishay if im a primal force i might as well make it mean something ginny you worm i wont let you fool with me sar you want to see primal force just keep this up you cannot even know that any of them are alive if they arent then theres no problem is there if you go on with this the way youve planned it you better call off the truce and shove me out a lock because im going to use everything ive got to stop you he stared at her a long moment as if he considered that option then abruptly he gave in very well how close must you be to control large beasts it depends on the beast and the circumstances but say a circle of radius um twenty kilometers then you cant work from a synchronous orbit no certainly not tsipor stood up came across the bridge with the shortlegged sinuous walk that was like no other she lies ginny opened his eyes wider really linked to me her range is extended a hundredfold well singer shadith scowled at tsipor all right shes right its certainly extended i dont know how far hundredfold i doubt it and in any case i dont intend to try the limits i mean to be on the ground when i work very well he recalled the image of haed nunn most of the aah pirate swarms are in the south but there are several that make forays into northern waters mimishay has set up a rather primitive defense against attacks from these infested flotillas it is primitive but effective since the ships are wood hulls and the weapons on them pitiful mimishay has strung a cable net across the mouth of the bay there a red line leaped across the open section of the circle of water it can be charged with enough current to electrolyze the seawater and char any hull that slams against it it usually is not however mimishay does keep a certain number of sensors alert for intrusion he shifted the pov down the curve of the world until haed nunn vanished and a string of rocky islets occupied the center of the cell haedsa thats island chain chavada barren not much fresh water a few fishing families i will take the ship down land her there yellow light flashing on one of the midsized rocks this is a freetrader world ships come in all the time many use the field at tos tous but others land wherever they take a notion mimishay notes but ignores them it is my intention to approach haed nunn on miniskips and come through the mountains rather than take the easier approach on the bay side mimishay has been undisturbed on that haed for at least two centuries so the brothers and the powers are careless about security they depend on those kephalosdriven defenses because these neither sleep nor lose their edge they forget that such things have their limits and if focused in one direction will ignore a small nonthreatening intrusion coming at their backs as it were we will need a distraction if you are able to locate and mindride a number of large sea beasts drive them against the net at the mouth of the bay that should be sufficient to cover us can you do this remember you will be straddling a miniskip while you work can you put my emskip on a lead i cant boot whales and navigate at the same time yes we can do that then youve got your distraction the storm wind beating at their backs they rode the heavilyladen miniskips across the water flying so low the spume whipped from the wavetops slapped into their legs clouds boiled low overhead and phosphorescence ran in crooked green lines through the troubled swell shadith felt the storm as a distant discomfort the greater part of her consciousness was in the calm deeps split between three megaforms great black creatures half a kilometer long from blunt nose to the tips of the massive tentacles whose slow steady beats drove them through the water they were solitary beasts uneasy so close together again and again she had to herd them back as they struggled to turn aside to put a more comfortable space between them she was troubled by what she was doing riding them to their deaths but rohant was her friend and he needed her help her eyes were squeezed shut and tears leaked from under her lids yet each time the beasts tried to peel off she tightened her grip and drove them on the beasts hit the net as the miniskips passed from water to land and began the steep winding climb through the jagged cliffs on the stormside of the mountains shadith shivered and groaned as a massive jolt of electricity fried one of the beasts before she could free herself from his brain she heard the hooming roars of pain and fury as the other two exploded with killing rage and flung themselves against the lethal net the winds snatched and shoved at the emskips tried to drive them into the walls of the ravine they were sweeping along the tether joining her emskip to tsipors whipped her about threatened to wheel both of them into a downspiral that would turn them into bloody meat shadith struggled back into herself fought with the clip connecting the tether to the emskip shaft finally managed to trip it the minute she was loose the emskip swerved wildly her left leg scraped along the stone part of her trousers tore away a flap of skin ripped loose then off the skipfender squealed and threw up a fan of sparks the noise hammered at her the winds hammered at her the skip bucked under her grimly she fought for control after what seemed an eternity of confusion and noise the drive bit the emskip straightened out she pushed the speedlever down and hurried after tsipor and ginny who were both nearly out of sight the place ginny had chosen for their base was a moraine flat with a tumble of huge boulders and a litter of stones from the size of eggs to sofa pillows the flat was halfway up the tallest mountain west of the mimishay compound they labored to clear a space for the domes a figure eight with one lobe twice the size of the other though the wind had abated once they reached the eastern slopes of the mountains the rain lashed at them coming down hard and cold as they bent and lifted the stones carried them to the ragged wall they were building about the site bent and lifted and carried jammed fingers in the dark against stones they couldnt see and scraped off skin and worked their backs until even their bones ached in the bay below the tumult was calming as the last two black beasts died and their bodies heaved against the net lifting and dropping with the storm swell nearly invisible in the dark water after one look shadith bent to the stones and labored with a desperate intensity using pain and fatigue to shut out the things she didnt want to see or think about ginny inflated the shelters into mottled gray domes that shed light even more efficiently than they shed the rain then he exploded anchors deep into the mountain to hold them steady despite the snatching of the wind shadith crouched in the backcurve of the larger dome using a small handpump to blow up an air mattress her head was wrapped in a towel and now and then she stopped her pumping to shiver the thin silken undersuit shed put on was dry but no barrier to the drafts the air machine was blowing through the domes tsipor crouched silently across from her holding herself as far from the others as she could in the cramped space ginny sat on an air cushion before a low table working quickly neatly clipping components together sliding accumulators from their cases and snapping them into the receptors of the shield generator the eye controls the viewscreen and the rest of the equipment that ran the domes half an hour later he grunted and sat on his heels that is done over his shoulder he said i must wait for the storm to abate further before i launch the eyes singer are you able to reach into the compound shadith moved onto the air mattress sat with her legs drawn up her arms draped over her knees i wouldnt mind a cup of tea first im still cold to the bone ginny smiled startling her with the sly amusement she felt in him i live only to serve you singer yeh yeh sure you do she spread a blanket over her knees pulled the towel off and began to rub at her hair shadith set the mug on the floor and stretched out on her stomach her head resting on crossed forearms tsipor knelt beside her narrow hand cold on the back of her neck she reached rohant lay awake and tense on something hard and uncomfortable enough to keep him shifting position frequently he was waitingshe didnt couldnt know for what she left him at it and felt about for the other dyslaera ginny said half of them were dead she didnt believe him hed say anything to get what he wanted nothing nothing nothing one omphalite probably a guard on watch nothing nothing nothing out and out she spiraled the point presence of her reach a sick cold hollow growing beneath her ribs nothing but omphalitesexcept for a few local women clustered in a small tight area near the northern end of the compound it didnt have to mean the other dyslaerors were dead they could have been mindwiped like her dumped in a contract labor levy could have been it was only a thread of a hope and it shriveled as she tried to cling to it ginnys report about omphalos intentions was too convincing they were dead disposed of all but rohant she sprang back to rohant scanned his body no real damage relief flooded her and she sobbed before she could stop herself tsipors hand tightened on her neck she steadied and went back to searching the compound locating and counting the omphalites so ginny could better avoid them when he sent in his eyes and she could begin planning to break rohant free shadith opened her eyes groaned pushed herself up till she was sitting crosslegged on the mattress the blanket draped loosely about her stylus she said tsipor crawled across the dome to the place where shed been squatting before sat there crimson eyes narrowed to slits face blank ginny tossed shadith a clipboard a stylus held to it with a small magnet five hundred and nine she said five hundred and ten if you count rohant no dyslaera there except him she began marking clusters of circles these are sleepers not to scale though im keeping angles and organization as accurate as i can i didnt find any of the other prisoners i suppose theyve been processed and sent wherever she finished the circles and began laying down xs some of them with dotted lines and arrows indicating direction this lot are the wakers the ones without pointers arent moving probably sitting at terminals or watchposts the others are going here and there either insomniacs or guards on patrol she added a rectangle rohant hes not far from the outer wall it shouldnt be too hard to pry him loose the eyes go in first yes but once youve got them in place im going to blow that cage and pull him out that argument is finished singer you annoy me when you bring it up again and again all right i just want things clear she stretched out again on the mattress flipped the blanket over her wake me when youre ready to go miralys and voallts on the huntblack house the three dyslaer transports plunged into the atmosphere and sped across the night sky sheathed in halos of superheated gases they dipped low over haed ke released a swarm of capture landers and went flaring up and out settling into synchronous orbit above tos tang a small unimportant seaside town and black house a rambling structure growing like lichen on the stony mountains above tos tang aboard anyagyns cillasheg miralys prowled restlessly about the bridge maintaining a precarious control on her temper and her needs huddled in one of the observer seats by the offside wall kikun watched her with admiration and apprehension it was rather like hanging around a volcano about to erupt beside him autumn rose wasbusy with the totacorder tapped into the ships kephalos recording for digby the attack and everything that happened aboard the cillasheg this was his price for the data he provided and the contacts agile as stingships and almost as lethal courtesy of digbys sources the capture landers swept down on the black house blew out the nodes where the defense centers were located then retreated into a ragged disk hovering over the house her face filling the center cell tasylyn twitched her scarred ear got em all they couldnt light a match anyagan the szajes showed her teeth good work cousin you want us to go in wouldnt take us ten minutes to fetch ours out down kit we want ours alive not dead well take the long road first ta she blanked the hexa swung to face miralys you ready toerfeles miralys settled into the coseat get them the sweaty furious face of a man filled the central hexa his thick gold hair straggled about his ears his eye paint was smudged and his lip rouge rolled into crumbs at the corner of his mouth a mouth working in a futile frenzy futile because the sound was off anyagyn sniffed the small sound heavy with distaste you want to hear that toerfeles no can that hear me when you want do it done the man blinked and started yelling more furiously waving his arms hands appearing and vanishing as they swung in and out of the viewcone miralys dug her claws into the padding on the chairarms shut your mouth fool listen to me her ears twitched her lips curled up and back in the dyslaera threat grin there was a flicker of fear in the mans eyes understanding immediately suppressed his face smoothed out acquired a sudden patina of grooming he smiled bowed his head spoke briefly then waited i am miralys vey voallts tol daravazhalts toerfeles of voallts korlach you have blood kin of mine prisoner in that abomination of yours i want them without delay and intact she turned to anyagyn let me hear that the man smoothed nervous fingers over his hair pressing it into a semblance of order what are you talking about toerfeles his voice was pleasantly rough more interesting and attractive than his surgically enhanced face there are no dyslaera here someones been lying to you who are you would you know i am pinjaro da tinggal he was almost purring now that he knew what he dealt with sure of his ability to defuse the situation i am pengurra of this house i know what happens here miralys ears went back against her skull anyagyn szajes do it hannys sugnam tasylyn go three capture landers left the disk swooped down and blew away a section of black house went spiraling back to their places a breath and a half and the attack was over tinggal yelped and vanished from the screen he reappeared a moment later there were people in those suites important people you killed them miralys snorted turn about worm how many dead she broke off that doesnt matter you have ten minutes after that we will remove another sector and another one every ten minutes he started to speak then snapped his mouth shut and vanished once again miralys turned to anyagyn ears up and quivering anyagyn wiggled her nose they cant hear for the moment any chance the worm can come up with a defense if digbys right no hmm get hannys you sure her mum raised crazy kits we need craziness right now a side hexa pulsed awake hannys was a red dyslaerin with bright yellow eyes and a round face her eyes sparkled and her lips were curled in a friendly grin teeth carefully covered toerfeles she said can we bite em heyhey can we do it maybe cousin i want you ready go in and snatch ours if the worm down there starts trying to argue with me forget him lets do it cool your blood cousin you dont move till i give the word you hear aaah not a whisker or ill snatch you naked and feed you to the nearest ritors tinggal slid back into view i must apologize toerfeles he said easily with a quick charming smile to underline what he intended to be a rueful sincerity we have two young guests who appear to be dyslaera it seems one of my subordinates was overzealous in his attempts to please our clients and acted without authorization be sure he will be dealt with this will not occur again only two if you doubt my word toerfeles ask them yourself he stepped aside azram and kinefray moved into the viewcone they were thin and strained but seemed otherwise unharmed miralys sucked in a breath then said quietly azoe azram kinefray kinefray stared down at his feet azram answered her azoisha toerfeles there was a touch of mischief in his reddened eyes worm says theres only the two of you azrams ears crinkled forward his eyes glazed over spilled tears despite his effort to stay calm true he managed he rubbed at his nose with the back of his fist rest re dead cept the ciocan he added hastily that other lot kept him he looked to one side nodded then he and kinefray shifted out of sight and tinggal was back as you hear toerfeles as i do see slime youre not thinking nonsense like hostages are you certainly not toerfeles purely as a matter of curiosity though say we were we take our own by force then black house and everything init will be slagged to bedrock and if there is no further fuss we collect ours and leave my word on it and what is your word worth more than anything youve got within your walls very well we will send the young dyslaera out immediately the main entrance there is sufficient room in the garden there for one of your landers to alight miralys watched tensely as the hannys lander touched down collected azram and kinefray zipped up and leapt off for the circling disk of landers as soon as hannys was in place the landers swirled up in a grand helix reached the transports and were swallowed by them the transports went arcing onward going deeper into the dark mimishay savant answering the com the grand chom is elsewhere at the moment i speak for the council what is the problem tinggal problem ill tell you the problem weve got a fleet of dyslaera hanging over us someone talked they know about the subjects you passed to us savant fleet tinggal speaking with a growing impatience three armed transports and i didnt bother to count the landers armed better than a lot of governments took out our defenses before they bothered to say a word knew just where to hit too someone talked yes someone talked burned down four suites killed everyone inside and what were going to tell their families i dont know savant and tinggal with obvious satisfaction better look to your own defenses the toerfeles has given us ten minutes to produce her kin and turn them over well do that weve got no choice which means less than half an hour from now shes on her way to you savant ward master i want that dyslaera brought to the question chamber his voice took on a shrill note despite the distorter he was wearing i want him there so fast the air smokes around him you hear ward master yes savant anything special you want tools personnel whatever savant prepare for full hostile probe ward master the chom savant the chom isnt here hes not going to be here any time soon this is an emergency fool the dyslaera are on their way here now ward master should i order a full alert you have to authorize it savant do it dont just stand around asking stupid questions do it rohant on your feet the wardbrother was rattling the doorgrill shrieking the order he sounded terrified as if he were apt to do something terminal if given half an excuse and he was alone rohant rolled off the cot and stood beside it hands clasped behind him head down they hadnt come for him before like this in the middle of the night or sent a singleton guard after him he stared at the floor and wondered what was going on after a delay that drove the young ward twitchy the grill slid open and the watchandroid came in rohant snatched a look at it yes good not just hesitations the warning light by its left sound receptor was pulsing red this wasnt his usual escort no scratch it was older too they were scraping bottom with this one why no matter he pressed his arm against his body felt the stunrod in the hem of his shirt yes if they took him past the novice quarters this was it goodbye mimishay when the watchandroid was in position behind rohant the guard yelped out blitsor you know the drill move it hup hup rohant trotted through the corridors the meat in a loose sandwich between guard and android the android lagging farther and farther behind one more turn if we go to the right past the novice quarter go right he thought at the youth ahead of him right not left he reached under his tunic began sliding the stunrod from the hem the wardbrother turned right turned again the watchandroid clattered along far behind out of sight rohant stunned the guard kicked the door open to the novice area and plunged inside his bare feet padding silently on the thick matting he ran full out past the closed doors of the sleeping cells first block not a sound not even a snore second block the novice master backed from a cell pulled the door shut turned claws out rohant slammed his hand into the omphalites throat jerked away before the gush of blood could saturate his fur he caught the man as he started to fall threw him across the narrow hallway like a fleshy speed bump and ran on just before he reached the door at the end of the corridor he heard a metallic clatter and curled his lips back baring his long yellow tearing teeth android tripping over the dead man good he slapped his palm on the sensor and pushed out before the door was halfway open it was dark out wind howling round corners clouds covering the moons blinking at the rain that stung his face he raced along the walkway to the small pleasure house built into the wall he kicked the door open ran inside a woman came from one of the bedrooms bleary eyed and still half asleep wha he ignored her and ran for the back of the house jerking doors open cursing the barriers that kept slowing his flight the android was coming after him gaining on him he reached the postern door ran through it it was open as it always was day and night the omphalites hadnt yet got round to closing the holes in their defenses god be blessed and ossoran and feyvorn be blessed for killing off half the council apparently the smarter half and a triple blessing for whoever took the chom out something slammed into his back sent him tumbling into grass and gravel rolling toward the stream that slipped past the compound walls and danced into the sea he sprang onto his feet swung round the winddriven rain was hissing and sliding off a domeshaped shimmer over the compoundthe defense shield with the android trapped inside he laughed aloud a fullthroated laugh his offering to the gods of absurdity deafening squeals a crash that shook the rock under his feet what he squinted through the rain at a swarm of small ships like dots of light moving in and out of the clouds above the dome others were swinging back from their first attack he saluted them the lady kiss you whoever you are he shouted then turned and began trotting toward the mountains a few kilometers away miralys the man in the screen wore a coarse brown robe with the cowl pulled so far forward his face was lost in shadow all but the point of a long narrow chin he sat at a rustic desk his hands hidden inside his voluminous sleeves who are you and why do you threaten us he said his voice mild and faintly metallic passing through a distorter something that undercut the image he was trying to project we are peaceful students here acquiring merit through works of the mind if you want gold we have none why do you come with intent to attack miralys ears snapped down and back her lips came open showing her teeth angermusk rolled off her she waited for several seconds before she spoke waited until she had control you have ours she said we want ours and payment for our dead you have stolen my mate my ciocan give back what you have taken from me i do not understand what you are saying dyslaera we are simple brothers here whoever told you kikun squeaked as grandmother ghost nipped him hard now he shouted we were holding anyagyn tapped the sensor under her thumb down below the capture landers shifted position in a preset repatterning that left no lander occupying the original space of another any of your people a double dozen cutter beams drove through the suddenly empty places where the landers had been they wavered a moment in futility then swung about hunting the targets that had moved too fast for them slippery sliding dots of light flipped about by dyslaera muscle and dyslaera reflexes sliding too fast too fast the screen went blank the transmission interrupted as the defensive shield flashed into place around the compound the landers struck back some played cutter beams of their own probing at the shield getting nowhere while others used more specialized weapons digby had dug up for them dyslaera fighters sugnarn pulled his lander in a tight circle about a cutter beam dusted it with rot grains that went skittering and glittering down the beam edges crawled inside the projector and began eating everything they touched twenty seconds later the beam withered and died but sugnarn didnt bother looking back he was already dusting his third beam once she was sure there was a flesh operator behind it that it had been clipped loose from the kephalos hannys flirted with a cutter beam letting it come close enough to graze the side of her lander but never never close enough to do serious damage teasing it down and down until it was straining in its gimbals jammed so hard the operator could barely move it then she dropped into the hole created in the defenses skimmed along the shield and laid down a line of thermix eggs that hit the ground and began to melt down into bedrock following the shield down and down stone bubbling and seething until that section of the compound was resting uneasily in a thin layer of lava while steam generated by rain hitting the melt rose in agitated clouds about the dome hannys went screaming up and out dancing elusive as a thought hunting for another beam to tease tatakarn was a hair slow on one of his turns a missile caught the edge of his drive projector blew the lander into dust when jarnys saw her brother die her concentration wentonly momentarily but it was enough the cutterbeam sliced into her lander carved away a third of it took most of the rightside of her body with it dying she went nincsothran and shut the pain away the drives were partially intact she had some power she fought the machine around sent it screaming at one of flickering cuttergates in the defense shield got her timing perfect and took a large chunk of the compound with her as she crashed miralys on the bridge of the cillasheg miralys watched the battle below her her claws shredding the padding of the coseat rohant was dead his body might still be alive down there somewhere but that didnt matter he was dead and gone beyond her reach she wasnt grieving yet she wasnt even angry now just grimly determined to take that island down to bedrock not even a microbe left alive kikun and his gods kikun watched the deathdance on the great forward screen and mourned the lives hed known and not known this was what his grandfolks had seen when the daivavig landed their guns on keyazees shores when theyd flown their hot air balloons overhead and dropped incendiaries around the easterness forces this is what theyd seen and he could feel the terror of it his gods came to him suddenly they were there watching demanding jadiigevas stood behind miralys wild black eyes fixed on the screen he was snorting and jerking his head the antlertree swaying up and down forward and back spashats stood at the back of the bridge bigger and darker than before his darkness pressing against the glow from the screen life not death spashats rumbled at kikun what must be done see that it is done without excess that it is finished quickly and cleanly as such things go you can do this nayol hanee you must do this xumady snorted and danced across the control panels and sensorboards beneath the great forescreen his nimble black paws flickering over and around the nimble clawed hands of the dyslaera working there his long limber body humping and flattening he sang a wordless song of fierce triumph a hot joyous song of rage and hate as the mimishay compound began to crumble under the blows from the landers and when a lander burned to ash or went tumbling in a black arc to the boiling stone he sat up on his haunches his long back straight and stiff his short forelegs stretched wide and he keened his grief and the dyslaera grief he was all passion and heat his fire beating at the cool restraint of spashats dark reason gemla mask hung before kikun white stripes across the black base flushing red with xumadys song going icewhite and pure when spashats was stronger change and change again a rhythm as steady as the splash of waves against the islands shore kikun was mask was caught in the ebb and flow then grandmother ghost was back pinching him her strong ancient fingers as punishing now as they were when she was still alive and he was a small naughty tokon playing in the mud your girls down there chile you want her alive youd best go get her her and that rohant what i can see they going to get themselves roasted any minute now gaagi you gormless shade haul your tail out here and show him she pinched at kikun till he swung his chair about and stared at the emptiness where spashats had drawn back into himself gaagi bloomed from a speck of darkness and stood a shining black figure against the matte black cloud of spashats he spread his arms stood with his head turned so kikun saw only one glittering eye and the powerful jut of the ravens beak gaagi did not dance this time his feet were not defined this time this time he spread his wings and swayed his torso to make the black scales shimmer light came from those shimmers gathered in a cloudy sphere floating before his chest the clouds cleared to crystal and in the crystal kikun saw two bodies lying facedown on the earth shadith and rohant lying facedown and very still dangerously close to the creeping melt around the periphery of the compound shadithginny tsipor shook shadith awake with an awkward undulant flip of a hand she pointed at the small screen it was divided into several cells all but one dedicated to the eyes worming their tortuous ways down toward the compound kephalos buried deep in bedrock the singleton cell was tied to the eye ginny had grudgingly sent to overlook rohant at the moment it was expanded by a factor of three and dominated the screen rohant stood beside his cot staring at the floor an android was moving around him with ponderous weightiness and outside the open grill a robed cowled ward jigged from foot to foot rapped the back of his metalled glove against the edge of the heavy steel grill physical expressions of his agitation shadith knelt beside ginny frowning at the image whats going on middle of the night isnt it you see what i see she heard the guard scream at rohant then watched the trio go trotting off the eye followed them she glanced at the other cells on the screen but there was nothing in any of them to explain the guards nervous distress or this sudden summons well what do you think is happening i do not know it has been very quiet down there since the sea beasts died ginny hesitated reached for the control pad chew his hand back if i were where i should be he glanced at her annoyance in his face and voice i would have the resources to explore this properly shadith snorted you can play that tune for someone else ginbiryol seyirshi if youd meant to run this from orbit wed be there right now take too long wouldnt it and youd be too vulnerable a target what do you want me to do he gazed at her without expression for a long moment i could start another eye for the compound but it would not arrive for an hour and that would most likely be too late i want you to reach into the directors chamber and tell me what is happening he swore shrilly as rohant stunned the guard and took off running that could ruin i have to know what the omphalites are doing go search singer that fool could bring the whole island down on us good ol lion all right all right she glanced at tsipor but the raska wasnt offering this time she was focused intently on the cells of the screen shadith swallowed a giggle crawled back to the mattress rohant was out and running free running free hed done it for himself he hadnt been waiting for anyone to come and cut him loose she felt like whooping giggling running out to meet him she didnt feel like stretching out and hunting eyesandears inside that compound so she took her time getting there ginny swore again as the images in most of the cells began breaking up he bent over the pad working frantically to reestablish full contact with his infiltrating eyes what is it she called to him what happened defense shield came on he muttered do what you are supposed to do leave me alone shadith wiggled her brows touchee she murmured then sighed and crawled onto the mattress before she stretched out she looked again at rohants image he was running easily heading toward the mountains now and again squinting up through the slackening rain at something she couldnt see because the eye was focused downward centered on the dyslaeror tsipor hissed scooted for the domes lock was through it before either of the others had time to react she was back a few moments later ashipess she said worked her hands and did the other things she did better than words creating corneroftheeye images of small ships darting restlessly about attacking that one hand shot out undulated toward the compound miralys shadith said ginny twisted round stared at her you looked no a guess but id bet my skin on it which is all i have at the moment kikun and miralys come for rohant maybe me rohant for sure who else is going to attack omphalos mimishay whatever ginny danced his fingers over the pad changing the direction and focus of the rohant eye turning it upward so he could see and evaluate the attackers shadith watched the conflict develop saw one of the landers get hit and go down taking out part of the compound as it crashed saw others teasing the cutter beams into a deadly sworddance saw sparkles sliding down beam edges then the beams withering winking out ginny twisted his mouth in his small tight smile the way those landers are being handled i suspect you are correct in your assumption singer i am much reminded of the skirmishes at koulsnakkos hole he tapped his thumb on the pad the rohant eye shifted focus once more rohant flung himself to one side went rolling into brush came onto his feet and fled deeper into the scattered clumps of trees breaking line again and again until the beam hunting him winked out and left him with singed fur and a laboring wheeze hmm ginny tapped a code into the pad slid off the cushion and got to his feet we had better go collect him before he is killed by his kin or by accident singer you will ride back with me since our combined weights will be less than his the skip would be dangerously sluggish trying to haul the two of you shadithrohant ro shadith shouted old lionface look up she brought the emskip swooping around him leaned over tugged at his hair swept away again landed the skip a short distance up the mountain wriggled free of it and ran for him shadow girl he scooped her up hugged her so exuberantly she couldnt speak or breath still laughing he swung her round and round then set her on her feet and held her away from him so he could look at her i thought you were dead not quite im hard to kill old lion that yours up there more yours miralys and voallts but you brought them no i suspect it was kikun youd never in your wildest dreams guess who ginnytsipor ginny slid the stunner back in its loops tapped the caller tsipor come the raska rode her skip around a bulge in the mountain landed beside him she dismounted walked across to the bodies dead no merely stunned help me load them on the spare skip why tsipor lifted rohant with an ease that startled ginny laid him along the bar of the miniskip went back for shadith then began fastening them down pulling the narrow woven straps tight and slapping the velcro patches together why not dead i said i would not kill her for one year tsipor ginny freed a clump of shadiths hair from a patch pressed the closure tight besides he straightened she could very likely still be an important force against omphalos you have not seen destruction swirling in a vortex about her leaving her untouched i have you have the tether her eyes so dark a crimson they were almost black the raska tossed him the plastic cable canna take cross t water ssso i have no intention of trying we will leave them down by the compound he looked at the clumsy bundle on the shaft his mouth tightening into a shallow curve if she dies from friendly fire that is the ladys throw not mine i would like that i do not expect it come they slipped downslope following the stream that curved past the northern corner of the compound sheltered from observation by the trees that grew thickly along its banks as they reached the edge of the attack zone chance took the hotspots of the fight to the south away from them ginny nodded his head signed his thanks to the lady and brought both the skips to land he dismounted and began ripping loose the straps without comment tsipor joined him and helped him free the bodies you take him i will take her you will not place him in the melt but on the grass that is left iss better dead perhaps so but not by your hand or mine they laid shadith and rohant facedown in the brittle dead grass at the edge of the trees retreated to their skips and started back along the stream ginny shifted his arm read his wristchron one hour he said aloud enjoying the sound of the words in one hour the eyes will reach the kephalos and trigger the selfdestruct there will not be a microbe left alive he entered a code into the pad got to his feet in mimishay or in that swarm of landers tsipor was crouched against the back wall of the dome brooding her eyes flickered as she saw him stand she followed him out bent to the nearest of the miniskips straightened it up and straddled the saddle ginny laughed aloud no no tsipor you will not need that ah yes mertoyl is admirably prompt the small spherical lander came arcing down hovered a handwidth above the ground the lock irising open unhurried despite the capture lander breaking from the melee over the compound and racing toward them and a second ship a skimmer dropping down at them ginny stepped into the lock passed through it into the small compact cabin tsipor came diving after him gasping in her urgency before she had time to settle herself the lander sealed up and darted away fire from the chasing ship splashing after ittoo late much too late as ginnys transport came rushing down in a halo of overheated air sucked the lander into itself and went racing off flaring from the atmosphere heading for teegahs limit and the insplit shadithrohant shadith groaned and sat up brushing fragments of sodden grass from her nose and mouth pushing soaked hair from her eyes ro rohant lay beside her he was still out but beginning to twitch there was an odd little creature rather like a miniature kikun crouching in his dreadlocks holding onto the hair with tiny sixfingered hands it was eeping pitifully blinking bright black eyes at her shivering with terror but unwilling or unable to run a cutter beam came slicing past them took the top off the tree behind them tsoukbaraim shadith threw herself onto hands and knees grabbed at rohants tunic and tried to haul him farther into the trees away from the attack zone he was too heavy she couldnt budge him a missile exploded fifty meters off sprayed them with earth and halfmolten stone the noise punched at her the pressure slammed her onto her back her mouth popping open steam from the rain drifted around her the heat from it reddened her skin burned her nose and throat the dyslaeror snorted then groaned lifted his head and sneezed sar what shadith scrambled back to him pinched his earlobe hard move were in the middle of a war a section of the compound shuddered then fell in on itself the debris melting into stone liquefied by the heat seeping through from that seething boiling ring outside the shield rohant got unsteadily to his feet my head shadith caught hold of his arm move it ro lean on me come on a lander turned too late exploded the pieces pattered down among the trees starting small fires that died when sap gushed forth from the injured branches and cupshaped leaves flipped over dumping the rain theyd collected they staggered through the tree clumps and brush thickets until they reached the stream the water was hot steaming but they got across at the cost of some minor burns and sank onto the relatively cool earth on the far side rohant leaned against the trunk of a tree winced as his weight shook a spatter of drops from the leaves overhead the rain was almost finished but there was still a steady drip here under the trees as their leaves released what theyd captured the creature in his hair shifted position hastily to avoid being drowned burrowing deeper into his tangled mane what he reached up touched it what happened who i was about to tell you be careful rohant sneezed again held his hand still so the creature could crawl onto it he grinned as he set it on his knee miji he said hes a sakali friend of mine you were about to tell me right about to introduce my rescuer and sometime partner ginny seyirshi what miji eeped with fright went running down rohants leg he sat on the dyslaerors ankle tiny hands pressed to his ribs black eyes shifting from rohant to shadith and back again long story how that came about tell you later looks like he decided to dissolve the relationship rohant chched at the sakali without looking at her he stopped his coaxing a moment said so why are we alive he gave his word said he wouldnt kill me for at least a year it was omphalos he was after you trusted him didnt have much choice right then she ran her hands through her hair shivered as a vagrant draft hit her soaked undersuit besides he keeps his word you just have to be careful you know what he means by it like hed be clamhappy if miralys ashed us both but he wouldnt do it himself um not too long from now this place isnt going to be very healthy deflected by the defense shield a missile hit the ground blew a hole in it and sent fragments of stone scything through the trees a short distance downstream rohant coaxed miji onto his arm drew his thumbclaw down his mustache raised a brow at her dont know why you say that consider our gently salubrious surroundings hah shadith pulled herself onto her feet discounting little things like she waved a hand at the shattered trees and steaming water this is going to be ground zero of a humongous meltdown rohant stood scowled at her meltdown yeah shadith shivered as another explosion shook earth and air ginnys sent his special eyes at the kephalos theyre going to trigger mimishays selfdestruct goodbye island goodbye all of us them included she jerked her thumb upward waved her hand in a circle to include the attacking landers how much time god knows not me rohant scratched absently behind the neckfrill of the sakali shadow could you reach miralys not miralys kikun maybe and thats only if his gods have him looking well try it not here hunh she began walking upstream cuddling the sakali rohant shook himself all over spat and started after her this doesnt work we can always climb on a rock and dance hope they see us and dont shoot us autumn rosekikun autumn rose booted the skimmer away from the cillasheg started descending in a wide spiral keeping her distance from the attack zone without taking her eyes from the board she said just where is it you want me to put down kikun scratched at the skin folds under his chin north side close as you can get big place mountainside north or seaside he frowned tlee i dont know then we better go too z toyff an immense elongated form went rushing past the skimmer sending it into a wild tumble falling end over end toward the ground autumn roses crashweb snapped tight and the emergency pad popped up under her hand with the argrav spurting out streamers of blue smoke while the skimmer flipped over and over and kikun lying unconscious in the cochair twisted under his crash web half strangled by it rose rode the wild oscillations praying for time widening and flattening the curves holding the skimmer longer and longer in the flat mode until she had control over the drives again and took a look round to see where she was and found herself in a descending slide across the top of the compound with cutter beams dancing around her and the swarm of dyslaera landers swinging in and out of view and she was heading straight for a broad beam that was also sweeping toward her seconds away a black bear fifty meters high reached out a smoky paw and the beam was deflected turned downward the bladeend slicing through the already tortured earth and a black raven flew before her feathers glinting like shards of jet she followed it out of the turmoil nothing touched her cutter nor missile rot grains nor melt fields nothing touched her she got the skimmer to ground on a grassy meadow some distance up one of the smaller mountains west of the compound for several moments after the web loosened then slid into its receptacle rose lay in the chair shaking all over teeth chattering as she cursed kikun digby seyirshi the dyslaera and everything and everyone in her life that had brought her to this point shed never been this close to death even when she was sitting in that condemned cell waiting for the stranglers cord never this close never this helpless never when she calmed enough to reason she remembered the bear and the raven kikuns gods she laughed stopped laughing when the sound went crazy on her never imagined id be the subject for miracles she said aloud kikun you all right no answer shakily she pushed herself upright groaning as every muscle protested she was bruised all over battered scraped bonesore she twisted around and frowned toward the coseat kikun lay limp in the seat one arm tangled in the semiretracted web a trickle of blood drying at the corner of his mouth blood bubbles formed and burst in his nostrils as he labored to breathe goerta brite a tiny ancient crone of a dinhast came dashing at her like a puppet on strings a glass puppet brightly colored but so translucent it was hard to see yammering soundless words from a mouth snapping open and closed like a puppets jaws soundless wordsyet rose knew the ancient was crying at her to get on her feet and do something for kikun something anything get on her feet get moving help him comic and terrible the crone swept at her through her her skin prickled all over as if from a thousand tiny pinches rose struggled from her chair stood with her hand on the arm gathering herself so she wouldnt fall on her face the knee shed injured at koulsnakkos was sore again shed bumped it or something she was still shaking nauseated by her brush with dissolution and her brush with the inexplicable a dark musky smell spread through the cabin from a great deerlike creature looming over kikun shaking his antlers roaring soundlessly his dark eyes ringed with white his head was clearly visible though translucent like the crone colored glass lit from within but the rest of him was vague shapeless rose stood clutching at the chair arm swallowing hair standing stiff along her spine what she saw was ancient beyond counting immensely powerful and essentially uncontrollable a demiurge in beast form terrifying she forced herself to cross the short distance between the chairs it was hard walking into the ambience of that beast the bear was there too she couldnt see him but he was present in the darkness that boiled in the corners of her eyes as she bent over kikuns trapped arm and began working the web free she couldnt see them anymore but she knew they were still there she could feel them feel the pressure of their demands their fears there was no sound in the cabin and the musky aroma had vanished with the deer form with that gone she could smell the acrid stench of burning insulation and the more elusive odor of hot metal the web came loose finally slid home she examined kikuns arm wrinkling her nose as she felt bones grating under her fingers the crone came back tiny hands long for their size curling round roses wrists pulling at them rose yielded to the pull that wasnt there and let grandmother ghost guide her as she straightened kikun and eased him as much as she could without injuring him more than he was already freed by his coma kikuns gods swirled round her at times merging into an amorphous shimmer at times hardening briefly into raven otter bear antelopedeer grandmother ghost stayed beside her seen sometimes sometimes unseen as rose plundered the emergency medkit gave kikun painkillers splinted his arm stabilized his chest so the broken ribs wouldnt do more damage to his lungs time passed she finished all she could do down here locked the crashweb properly in place over him so it would support him keep him motionless everything was set for liftoff the pressure faded kikuns gods folded back down into him autumn rose straightened her aching back wiped at the sweat pushed the hair off her face and spent a moment staring blankly at her hands not at all sure what had just happened all right she said aloud so you want me to get him back to the ship and the ottodoc well then show me where they are rohant and the singer i cant leave till i have them she felt like a fool talking to herself or worse to figments of hysteric imagination the screen turned itself on in the darkness outside glinting in the uncertain glow from the beams that still walked round the compound a large black bird flew in tight circles squawking well rose limped back to the pilots chair lifted off a few meters then followed raven through the clearing storm until he began flying in circles again this time over a line of thickly set trees growing along the creek that ran past the compound grandmother ghost pinched her gaagi faded feeling a fool again autumn rose settled the skimmer onto a patch of grass and gravel activated the external speakers shadow rohant if youre out there shift ass over here this is autumn rose kikuns with me miralys sent us to collect you after a tense eternity when all she could see were trees and all she could hear was silence two small figures broke from the shadows and ran for the skimmer autumn roserohantshadith get me through to miralys fast then get the hell out of here autumn rose raised her brows well hello the two of you rohant growled subdued weary shadith ignored both of them and went to inspect kikun in his support cocoon of foam and bandage all right all right keep your hair on autumn rose got through to the cillasheg anyagyn rose here give me miralys quick huh got something to show her miralys bloomed in the midcell of the screen when she saw rohant her ears snapped up her eyes shone she sang without being aware of it a wordless croon of joy and yearning rohant leaned toward the image his ache matching hers he reached toward herthen he shook himself all over wrenched himself back to more pressing needs toerfeles get ours out of there that things going to blow any minute and itll take them with it light shimmers fled about the cabin power thrummed through it a deep subsonic chm that poured into shadith go go go she cried her singers voice driven by the immediacy of the threat filling the space go autumn rose felt the gods come back grandmother ghost was pinching her and pinching her and the antelope deer was belling terror in her ear she booted the skimmer up and went racing along the mountainside rising at a steep angle going for distance rather than altitude she crossed the mountains dropped again putting those tons of stone and earth between her and the compound then she fled out out over the sea miralyscillasheg get out now get out get out going to blow get out anyagyn sang into the speaker her voice rising and falling in dyslaer warn miralys watched the skimmer dart away her ciocan inside as it vanished below the mountaintops she brushed the back of her hand across her mouth turned her attention to the compound it rested on the ground like a gray clenched fist the fist crackedleaked a blinding bluewhite lightopened widespilled light like molten milkglassfilled the bay and flatsrolled up the mountainsidesboiled up and up into the clouds specks of light lost in the great glow the ganders fled from the expanding explosion how many anyagyn smiled wearily hannys got her tail singed thats all everyones tucked in and hitting the freshers she scratched at the fur between her ears autumn rose is on her way back passengers intact except kikun who needs the ottodoc rather badly she says once shes docked any reason we should hang around here no lets go home weve a business to whip into shape epilog digby wore a white linen suit imported out of the mists of memory and sat in an elaborate wicker chair with a soft white hat on his knee and the shimmerglimmer of his bubble around him rohant and miralys came in she was quieter than usual and dressed in mourning white a long robe cream colored velvet that complimented the fading bronze of her fur and moved elegantly with the vigorous shifts of her lean body she looked around her ears twitched this is different hed changed the decor of his meeting room to a deliberately exotic simplicity recreating a room in a house where a family had lived for generations perhaps a farm house comfortable but far from rich the furniture had the feel of age and hard use the fabrics were faded and frayed the colors muted there was a fireplace with logs burning in it and oil lamps spread their flickering amber glow in patches that left the corners dim where paintings and shelves of trinkets sprang into jewel clarity one moment and sank into shadows the next digby smiled nostalgia lives he said hello rohant its been a long time digby rohant bowed his head then settled himself in a chair close to the fire and sat gazing into the flames his robe was crisp and starched snow white cold white he was withdrawn physically present mentally absent the dyslaer way of grieving was to sink into the minutia of mundane life as miralys had to grow excessively busy exhausting themselves with work and planning the dyslaeror way was to create stillness within and without to withdraw from the world and contemplate meaningsthe meaning of particular deaths and generic death of particular lives and generic life voallts korlach had an estate in the sarinim a patch of gentle wilderness they kept to soothe their spirits when urban life became unbearably abrasive rohant was leaving tomorrow to spend his mourning year in a shrine miralys had built there his mind was already in retreat miralys wandered restlessly about the room digby had created for her lifting objects setting them down again over her shoulder she said who alls coming shadith kikun autumn rose theyll be here any minute now ah shadith came in moving with a crackling energy and impatience even her hair seemed about to explode from her head she wore traveling gear and her harpcase was slung across her back she dumped it on the floor beside a chair flung herself down well kikun unfaded kicked a hassock over and sat beside her he shared her impatience sat with his orange eyes fixed on digby as if by will alone he could bring this final conference to its end and be off about the matter that was troubling him now the freeing of his homeland from its invaders autumn rose walked in a moment later glanced quickly around and dropped into a chair beside the door sat gazing at her hands they had a newly pampered look manicured the skin creamed to a moist delicacy her tunic was avrishum a glowing dark bluegreen with fine white piping her trousers wide and flowing more like a long skirt she wore silver and takkaazul earrings matching silver and takkaazul bracelets like shadith she was ready to go shed booked passage on a gancha worldship leaving the transfer station later today back on the gamer circuit this is the last ill see of her for a while until she gets bored and is ready for a reality connection digby contemplated his guests and thought they looked like the seeds on a ripe and ready pfeffri plant primed to explode at a touch and scatter to the corners of the universe he crossed his legs tented his hands this my friends is the denouement where we tie off dangling ends and get on with our lives questions shadith scratched at her wrist tinoopa you said youd take care of her right tinoopa has been picked up and is on her way to her son one jao juhfeyn on arumdam rose leaned forward hes all right nothing went wrong for him the chom you know and mimishay rumors and tall tales thats all hes as prosperous as before no trouble rose she relaxed i liked him was a good game we played there shadith moved her shoulders did tinoopa give you any messages for me yes she says greetings to kizra thats you right she says theyve settled into peace at ghanar rinta after the last funeral a very sad thing to see a man in the full flower of his vigor wither and die in less than three months she says utilas sent his second son as guardian to the child he seems a mild intelligent youth with the wisdom to let the matja run things ah good you promised me the tale if i brought her out singer i dont have it yet shadith unzipped a pocket took out a flake case and tossed it onto the table beside her you do now thank you questions miralys glanced at rohant then stared down at her hands she smoothed the back of a claw along the velvet of her robe seyirshi got away have you heard anything about him not a murmur you nothing yet singer you spent some weeks with him splitting what do you think is he going after voallts again no just no he has a new project thats going to require all his attention for a while he calls it the fall of omphalos he told me about it because he likes the taste of those words one man i know what it sounds like crazy but dont you write him off i suspect fifty maybe a hundred years from now ginbiryol seyirshi will be peddling a new limited edition and scholars will be prospecting the debris of omphalos trying to discover what brought them down hmm digby dropped his hands on the curved arms of his chair seems to me omphalos and ginny deserve each other maybe so heres something else to think about ginny never forgets an injury she turned to the two dyslaera keep watch on omphalos rohant you and miralys when omphalos falls hell be back for you she straightened for all of us depressing thought lets end on a high note sing for us shadow what ive been jealous of every bogmakker and traveler whos heard you perform singer you have your harp and your friend sing a dream for us shadith worked her fingers looked down at kikun whod sat silent through all of this what do you think drum he said and smiled as digby created a small handdrum and dropped it beside him break the knots he said to shadith untie the ends and let us go all right the brushtunk of the drum lay down in the ground and beat in the blood while the notes of the harp were as lush as brilliant as the patches of crimson and sapphire emerald and amber the lamps light picked out from the paintings the deep greenblue glows in roses tunic the warm cream of miralys robe the brittle white that rohant wore shadow crooned wordless sounds her voice rich and flowing cool caressing magical like spring rain falling from clouds so high the drops seemed to come from the sun she had doubted herself she doubted no more they came from the shadows slender and angular black and silver similitudes of naya zayalla annethi itsays tallitt and sullan spinning threads from themselves in a weave more complex than any shed tried before spinning dreams for autumn rose for miralys and rohant even for digby dreams she didnt know couldnt know didnt want to know what she wanted was her own dream what she got was that and kikuns dream blended her sisters danced with pattering feet and busy handsa strange dance a dance she didnt know and gaagi raven came and danced among them black scales glittering black wings sweeping among them closing about each one in an oddly protecting embrace if it could be called an embrace when neither touched the other wings closing and spreading closing about naya then zayalla then annethi then itsays then tallitt and finally sullan the joy came then the purpose she sang laughter as she saw itsays wink at her saw naya smile and clap her slender hands saw zayalla shake her snaky hips annethi dance with sullan around and around kikun and touch his shoulders and bend to touch his hands and dance away in joy dance in circles about spashats and jadii gevas xumady and mask while the laellenox the grandmother ghost pranced in a tight little circle of her own shadow crooned wordless sounds her voice rich and flowing cool caressing magical like spring rain falling from clouds so high the drops seemed to come from the sun autumn rose saw herself in gold and diamonds and pure black avrishum under a crystal chandelier that gilded the delicate hairs on her ivory forearms she played vagnag and across from her her only mark was her grandfather the cards came and the dice leaped to her fingers she stripped him to his skin laughed at him and went walking out a man beside her a shadowy figure without a face who sheltered her and protected her and loved her miralys saw rohant and rohant saw miralys lissorn with baby sragis sitting on his shoulderdead baby golden babyshining in the hot yellow sun jesgejarn young and shining with the vigor of the young in a ring around them clan voallts the living and the dead arms on shoulders dancing in the sun on the savannah miralys and rohant danced with their children the dead children and the living danced the varavany about the carcass of a grand bull yrz digby saw moonlight on an ocean he knew in his cells the ocean into which he was born so many years ago hed long ago lost count moonlight on black sands and fans of land coral the shimmering blue water lifted and shaped into nine girls dancing nine glass girls with moonlight shining through them dancing on black sand shores that were glass and ash now on a world burnt to bedrock by the folly of his kind no water left no girls dancing it was pain to watch but sweet pain to see his sisters dancing and then it was done over rohant took miralys hand and they left eyes on elsewhere autumn rose came quietly to her feet and left shadith shut the harp in the case kikun set the drum aside and took her hand they left digby sat for a long time in his bubble in the empty room then he too was gone
