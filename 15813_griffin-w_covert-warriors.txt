w e b griffin covert warriors william e butterworth iv i one highway kilometers north of acapulco de juarez guerrero state mexico april oh shit the fucking federales the driver of the offwhite suburban said when he saw the roadblock ahead our esteemed associates in the unceasing war against drugs the man sitting beside him said try to remember youre a diplomat the driver of the car was chief warrant officer daniel salazar special forces us army the man sitting beside him was lieutenant colonel james d ferris also us army special forces the two men in the back of the white suburban were antonio martinez and eduardo torres both of whom were special agents of the us drug enforcement administration lieutenant colonel ferris was an assistant military attache of the united states embassy and mr salazar was an administrative officer of the office of the military attache of the embassy both held diplomatic passports and had been issued by the mexican government a carneta plastic card the size of a drivers licensefurther verifying this status martinez and torres did not have diplomatic status but had been issued a carnet identifying them as dea agents working in mexico with the blessing of the mexican government everyone was in civilian clothing ferris and salazar were armed both carried colt model a acp semiautomatic pistols in highrise holsters concealed by their loose cotton shirts they were also armed with fully automatic mm ara tactical carbines now resting on the suburbans third row of seats the mexican government didnt like at all the fact that americans were running around mexico armed with pistols and what were actually submachine guns but the laws of diplomacy are immutable diplomats are not subject to the laws of the country to which they are accredited martinez and torres were not armed the theory was that because the dea agents were working closely with mexican lawenforcement authorities including and usually the policia federal these agencies would provide them with all the protection they needed the subject of weapons had been a bone of contention between lieutenant colonel ferris and the honorable j howard mccann whom president joshua ezekiel clendennen had six weeks before appointed as his ambassador plenipotentiary to the mexican republic sympathetic to the feelings of the mexicans ambassador mccann had told the military attachecolonel foster b lewis mito make sure that lieutenant colonel ferris was made aware that he agreed with the mexican position that american diplomats should not go about armed absent a clear situation in which they might be in genuine danger when colonel lewis had a chat with lieutenant colonel ferris about this ferris replied in a somewhat blunt manner perhaps to be expected of a special forces officer fuck him i have no intention of getting blown away by some drug lords banditos without a fight colonel you have been informed of the ambassadors desires colonel if you order me not to be armed i will of course obey i will also get on the horn to general mcnab and request immediate relief colonel lewiss military superior was major general amos watts the defense intelligence agencys commander lieutenant colonel ferriss immediate military superior was lieutenant general bruce j mcnab the special operations command specopscom commander when lewis reported the substance of his conversation with ferris to ambassador mccann the ambassador considered the political ramifications of the impasse the most important of these being that general mcnab and secretary of state natalie cohen were if not friends then mutual admirers it had been the secretarys idearather than a proposal from one of her subordinatesto have army special forces personnel sent to mexico to train the mexican military and police forces so that they could better wage their war against the drug cartels ambassador mccanns predecessor had protested the idea as best he could and had been overruled the secretary was in love with her own idea ambassador mccanns predecessor had reported the substance of that conversation to mccann during the turnover she told me that she had learned from general mcnab that the primary role of special operationsdespite all the publicity that delta force and gray fox getis the training of indigenous forces to fight their own battles and their success in doing so is judged by the amount of fighting the trainers have to do themselves with no fighting at all being a perfect score she said that seemed to her exactly what the situation in mexico required she also told me that she had prevailed upon general mcnab to send her the best trainers he could and that he hadreluctantly were friendsagreed to do so so thats what ferris and his people are doing heretheyre on loan to the state department for ten months ferris has been down here three ambassador mccann had told colonel lewis ill give this matter due consideration and make a decision about it later although colonel lewis considered himself a loyal subordinate of ambassador mccann he could not help himself from thinking that that was the sort of response one could expect from a career diplomat never decide today that which can be put off until tomorrowor even later whenever lieutenant colonel ferris knew that he and danny salazar would be traveling through what he privately thought of as indian territory accompanied by members of the dea or sometimes the fbithe latter known as legal attaches and with the legal attache afraid to defy ambassador mccann they also went unarmedferris elected to arm himself and danny with aras in addition to theirs he had done so today when he headed for acapulco he reasoned that if they were bushwhacked by drug scum and the dea or fbi guys happened to pick up thes that he and danny happened to drop while grabbing their as and that extra firepower kept everybody alive he would hear nothing from ambassador mccann the roadblock on the highway ahead consisted of six blackuniformed federales operating out of a ford f l diesel crew cab truck which colonel ferris suspected had been paid for by us taxpayers one of the federales an ara slung from his shoulder stepped into the road and held up his hand ordering the suburban to stop theres a cd plate on this danny said jesus h christ a corps diplomatique license plate on a vehicle was usually enough to see the passengers therein waved through roadblocks make nice danny ferris said remembering that we are guests here in sunny mehhico danny slowed the suburban to a stop simultaneously taking from his shirt pocket his diplomatic carnet and holding it up ferris doing the same ordered carnet time guys smile at the nice federales the federale who had blocked the road approached the car good morning sergeant ferris said in spanish holding up his carnet what seems to be the problem out of the truck please the sergeant said sergeant i am lieutenant colonel james d ferris an assistant military attache of the us embassy get out of the truck colonel i demand to see the person in charge ferris said as he opened the door and stepped to the ground he saw a federale lieutenant standing with the others over there the federale said nodding toward him thank you ferris said everybody out the federale said ferris walked toward the teniente good afternoon comandante ferris began ferris knew that a comandante actually was a captain but he had learned over the years that people are seldom offended by a promotion even one given in error comandante i am lieutenant colonel james d ferris an assistant military attache of the us embassy the tenientes did not reply but three of his men two second sergeants and a corporal walked toward the suburban this is my carnet ferris said there was a burst of mm fire ferris spun around salazar and torres were on the ground martinez a surprised look on his face was on his knees holding his hands to his bleeding abdomen then he fell to one side you murdering sonsofbitches ferris shouted another second sergeant struck ferris in the back of his head with a pistol when ferris fell to the ground the second sergeant who had pistolwhipped him quickly pulled ferriss wrists behind him fastened them securely with plastic handcuffs and did the same to his ankles the teniente pulled a black plastic garbage bag over ferriss head and closed it loosely four of the federales picked up ferris and loaded him into the rear of the suburban the teniente and one of the second sergeants then got into the suburban and with the second sergeant driving made a uturn and headed in the direction of mexico city the others got into the ford f and followed the suburban two urgent secret april from amb usemb mexico city to personal

regarding this situation will be made available to you by secure telephone followed by message as they are learned respectfully submitted j howard mccann ambassador secret three office of the commanding general us special operations command fort bragg north carolina april there were two telephonesone black the other redand an open leather attache case on the desk of lieutenant general bruce j mcnab the small muscular ruddyfaced officer who sporting a flowing red mustache commanded specopscom the red telephone had both a buzzer and several lightemitting diodes leds the red one began to flash as its buzzer went off when mcnab grabbed it a green lightemitting diode illuminated indicating that the encryption system was functioning protocol required that persons privileged to have a command net telephoneone notch down from the white house switchboard networkanswer the telephone within thirty seconds a timer on the telephone base informed general mcnab that he had done so in seven seconds general mcnab he said this is the white house switchboard please confirm functioning encryption confirm mcnab said go ahead madam secretary the white house operator said bruce this is natalie cohen the secretary of state said then chuckled and said who has just decided to call you later yes maam mcnab said the leds had gone out by the time he replaced the handset he turned his attention to the attache case which held what looked like a normal hewlettpackard laptop computer and a device that looked like a blackberry they were cushioned in rubber foam with a small row of buttons and leds neither the laptop nor the blackberry was what it seemed to be the attache case was known as the brick a term going back to the first cell phones issued to senior officers that had been about the size and weight of a large brick he picked up that device that looked like a blackberry it was known to those who both were privileged to have one and knew the story as a caseyberry he knew that when secretary cohen said she would call him later she would do so immediately using the caseyberry in her brick as mcnab looked at his caseyberry a green led indicating an incoming call lit up as did a blue led indicating that the encryption function was operating those who believed the white house switchboard and its ancillary encryption capabilities were state of the art were wrong state of the art was really what aloysius francis casey phd termed prototype systems undergoing testing when for example the encryption system in the prototype undergoing testing brick that general mcnab held had all the bugs worked out it would be made available to the white house and to the national security agency at fort meade maryland in the meantime even if nsa intercepted the signals transmittedvia satellites miles over the earthbetween the afc corporations test facility in las vegas nevada and the bricks in the hands of a few more than a dozen people around the world they would not be able to break the encryption dr casey was sure of this because afc inc had designed installed and maintained the decryption computers at fort meade before he would turn over to the government mcnabs prototype undergoing testing brick with all the bugs worked out casey would ensure that mcnab and others on the caseyberry network had a newer prototype undergoing testing brick whose encrypted signals nsa could not crack general mcnab pressed the talk button mcnab he said bruce i just sent you a radio i just got from mexico city do you have it just came in he said the monitor of the laptop had illuminated and was now showing the message the secretary of state had received from ambassador mccann mcnab pushed three buttons on his desk simultaneously informing his secretary his senior aidedecamp and his junior aidedecamp that he required their services he still had his fingers on the buttons when the door burst open and captain albert h walsh his junior aidedecamp who was six feet two inches tall and weighed pounds quickly walked in just you al mcnab said then he made a pushback gesture to his secretary and his senior aide who were now standing behind walsh they turned and went away just got it mcnab said mcnab pointed to a chair and pushed the loudspeaker button on his caseyberry captain walsh sat down and took a notebook and ballpoint pen from the pocket of his desertpattern battledress uniform general mcnab finished reading ambassador mccanns message that had been sent to the secretary of state shit he exclaimed immediately adding sorry that was my reaction bruce the secretary of state said mcnab pushed one of the buttons in the attache case a printer on the sideboard behind his desk began to whir mcnab pointed to it and captain walsh quickly went to the printer something about this smells mcnab said danny salazar is no novice for that matter neither is ferris you know everything i do she said has the press got this yet they will half an hour after it gets to the white house can i call roscoe danton before that happens give him a headsup roscoe j danton was a member of the washington timespost writers syndicate why gut feeling we should hes almost one of us we owe him and we may need him does danton have a brick no brick mcnab replied a caseyberry aloysius likes him number fourteen ill call him and tell him to call porky but all hell have bruce is ten or fifteen minutes john david porky parker was president joshua ezekiel clendennens spokesman thats a long time sometimes bruce im really sorry about this i know mcnab said the leds went out mcnab put down the caseyberry picked up the black telephone and pushed one of the buttons on its base terry he announced a moment later i need you on my way sir major general terry otoole deputy commander of specopscom replied he was in mcnabs office fortyfive seconds later he was trim and ruddyfaced mcnab pointed to the printout otoole picked it up and read it shit he said and i gave jim ferris to you what you did general mcnab said was comply with my request for the name of your best fieldgrade trainer what i did was send him to dea so they could send him to mexico and i sent danny salazar with him to cover his back otoole looked at him mcnab went on and what youre going to say now is yes sir general thats the way it went down otoole met mcnabs eyes nodded and repeated yes sir general thats the way it went down mcnab nodded otoole said what happens now do you know colonel ferriss religious persuasion episcopalian al general mcnab ordered get on the horn to the eighteenth airborne corps chaplain tell him i want the senior episcopalian chaplain and the senior roman catholic chaplain here in fifteen minutes yes sir captain walsh said and went to a telephone on a side table and call my wife mcnab said same message here in fifteen yes sir what about your wife terry does she know mrs ferris may i use your telephone general otoole replied dont tell her who mcnab said i understand sir neither mrs mcnab nor mrs otoole would be surprised by the summons both had gone more times than they liked to remember to accompany their husbands when they went to inform wives that their husbands were either dead or missing mcnab picked up the caseyberry and punched in a number it was answered ten seconds later in what was known as the stockade delta force and gray fox were quartered in what had once been the fort bragg stockade the joke was that all the money spent to make sure no one got out of the stockade had not been wasted all of the fences and razor wire and motion sensors were perfectly suited to keep people out of the stockade the caseyberry was answered by a civilian employee of the department of the army who were known by the acronym dac his name was victor dalessandro a very short totally bald man in his late forties who held civil service pay grade gs army regulations provided that a gs held the assimilated rank of colonel before mr dalessandro had retired he had been a chief warrant officer drawing pay and allowances very close to those of a lieutenant colonel and before he put on the bars of a warrant officer junior grade dalessandro had been a sergeant major go mr dalessandro said by way of answering his caseyberry bad news vic general mcnab said danny salazar and two dea guys with him were whacked about noon fifty miles from acapulco they were in an embassy suv with colonel ferris the suv and ferris are missing shit what happened i want you to go down thereblackand find out mcnab said you and no more than two of your people by the time you get to pope the c will be waiting to fly you to atlanta by the time you get there you should have reservations on aeromexico to either acapulco or mexico city ill try to confirm while youre en route in a closely guarded hangar at pope air force base which abutted fort bragg were several aircraft including a highly modified boeing and a c the latter the military nomenclature of the israel aircraft industries ltdgalaxy aerospace corporation astra spx business jet the c had civilian markings ill take nunez and vargas your call whos paying for this mcnab who hadnt considered that detail gave it some quick thought there were two options neither of which would cost the us taxpayer a dime in dalessandros safe together with an assortment of passports in different names were two manila envelopes one marked tp and one charley each envelope held two inchthick stacks of credit cards american express platinum and citibank gold visa cards the names embossed on them matching the names on the passports and two businesssize envelopes each holding in used hundred fifty and twentydollar bills there had been a tp envelope in the safe for several years tp stood for those people those people were an anonymous group of very wealthy businessmen who saw it as their patriotic duty to fund black special operations missions when getting official funds to do so would be difficult or impossible the charley envelope was a recent addition to dalessandros safe charley stood for lieutenant colonel carlos g castillo special forces us army retired the amex platinum and citibank gold visa cards in the charley envelope identified their holders as officers of the lcbf corporation during a recent covert operationwhich went so far beyond black that mcnab had dubbed it operation march hare as in mad as a march harecastillo and mcnab had learned that those people had concluded that since they were making a financial contribution to an operation they had the right to throw the special operators under the bus when it seemed to be the logical thing to do considering the big picture one of the results of that was the lcbf corporations decision to provide general mcnab with the same sort of standby funding as those people provided it had not posed any financial problems for the lcbf corporation to do so the lcbf corporation already had negotiable assets of more than million when the director of the central intelligence agency handed mr david w yunglcbfs vice president financea treasury check for million in settlement of the cias promise to pay that sum free of any tax liabilities to whoever delivered to them an intact russian tupelov tua transport aircraft mr dalessandro had written charley on the lcbf envelope without thinking about it dalessandro had still been a sergeant major when second lieutenant castillo had first been passed behind the fences of the stockade and as good sergeants major do he had taken the young officer under his wing both dalessandro and general mcnab devoutly believed they had raised castillo from a pup general mcnab would have dearly liked to stick those people with the costs of dalessandros reconnaissance mission but decided in the end it would not be the thing to do now he would think of something elsea bayonet maybeto stick them with at a later time let charley pay for it vic he said ill be in touch dalessandro said and broke the caseyberry connection four the machiavelli penthouse suite the venetian las vegas boulevard south las vegas nevada april aloysius f casey phd chairman of the board of the afc corporation stepped off the elevator onto the upperlevel reception foyer of the machiavelli suite and then stepped to one side graciously waving out the two females from the elevator the first woman was mrs agnes forbison who was fiftyone grayhaired and getting just a little chubby mrs forbison was vice president administration of the lcbf corporation previously she had beenas a gsadministrative assistant to the honorable thomas hall secretary of the thennewly formed department of homeland security and after that deputy chief for administration of the nowdefunct office of organizational analysis second to get off the elevator was a stunningly beautiful woman with luxuriant dark red hair her passport identified her as a uruguayan citizen by the name of susanna barlow following senorita barlow off the elevator was lieutenant colonel carlos g castillo reta goodlooking sixfoot pound thirtysevenyearoldwho was the president of the lcbf corporation castillo was followed by an enormous black dog a bouvier des flandres who answered to max as castillo stood beside miss barlow she saidhissed perhaps would be more accurateyou remember i told you this was a mistake on castillos heels came mr edgar delchamps a nondescript man in his early sixties who was vice president planning and operations of the lcbf corporation he was retired from the central intelligence agency where he had served for more than thirty years as an officer of the clandestine service delchamps was followed by thirtythreeyearold david w yung jr who stood five feet eight and weighed pounds despite his obvious oriental heritage mr yung could not speak any of the languages of the orient he was fluent however in four other languages the vice president financial of the lcbf corporation was an attorney and previously had been a special agent of the federal bureau of investigation the final passenger stepped off the elevator his argentine passport identified him as tomas barlow he was about the same age as castillo and was built like him he was senorita barlows brother in a previous life they had been colonel dmitri berezovsky the svr rezident in berlin and lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva the svr rezident in copenhagen castillo walked to the edge of the upperlevel entrance foyer rested his hands on the bronze rail atop the glass wall and looked down to the lower level max went with him put his front paws on the rail and barked four menthree of them well even elegantly dressedwere standing there looking up at the upper level one of them was a legendary hotelier who owned four of the more glitzy las vegas hotels and three more in atlantic city new jersey and biloxi mississippi another was a wellknown perhaps even famous investment banker another had made an enormous fortune in data processing castillo knew him to be a us naval academy graduate the fourth man was a sort of mousylooking character in a suit that looked as if it had come off the finalclearance rack at goodwill all that castillo knew about him was that no one knew exactly how many radio and television stations he owned those people and the executive board of the lcbf were about to meet castillo turned and walked back to the people by the elevator door this is your show aloysius he said loudly enough for those people to hear you get to choose who gets thrown off the balcony first delchamps and tom barlow chuckled yung smiled casey shook his head and walked toward the head of the curving staircase leading to the lower level max trotted after him then turned to look at castillo as if expecting an order to stay when that did not come he went down the stairs ahead of casey headed directly for a coffee table laden with hors doeuvres and with great delicacy helped himself to a caviartopped cracker careful max castillo called theyre probably poisoned enough carlito senorita barlow ordered she then started down the stairs everyone followed casey last after castillo as if to ensure that castillo didnt get away annapolis as castillo thought of him waited at the foot of the stairs and put out his right hand thank you for coming he said we have to get this straightened out between us castillo took the hand with visible reluctance for the good of the country annapolis added we dont seem to agree on whats good for the country do we castillo replied i thought champagne would be in order hotelier said to toast the success of the latest operation what was it called he snapped his fingers and two waiters moved to coolers and began to open bottles of champagne i understand some people called it march hare edgar delchamps offered well whatever it was called it was one hell of a success radio and tv stations said the waiters quickly poured the champagne and then walked around offering it on trays to everyone i give you hotelier said raising his glass whoa castillo said two things before we do that if you please one why are we talking about such things with these fellows in here passing the champagne they work for me investment banker said they are trustworthy somewhat reluctantlyim paranoid on the subject of who gets to hear whatill give you a pass on that thank you investment banker said anything else colonel one more thing castillo said twogun give the nice man the envelope david w yung had earned the moniker twogun when he and edgar delchamps were about to pass through customs into argentina yung was at the time a legal attachethe euphemism for fbi agentaccredited to both argentina and uruguay and thus immune to laws regarding the carrying of firearms delchamps enjoyed no such immunity if found in possession of a weapon he would have been arrested the problem had been solved by his giving yung his colt officers model acp pistol to carry through customsthus resulting in yungs immediately being dubbed twogun yung walked to investment banker and handed him a large manila envelope it was fully stuffed and held together with thick rubber bands and this is investment banker said ive been told it contains two hundred thousand dollars in circulated currency castillo said i never opened it the funds we sent to you correct i wanted you to have them in case you were thinking your money had anything to do with the success of operation march hare did you really think you could put my carlos in your pocket for a miserable two hundred thousand dollars senorita barlow demanded senorita barlow annapolis said reasonably that was all that colonel castillo asked for score one for the navy sweaty castillo said during her association with the merry outlaws svetlana had quickly morphed first to svet and then even more quickly to sweaty annapolis pressed his advantage we stood willing to provide whatever was asked for he said yeah aloysius casey said but you thought you were buying something that wasnt for sale it seems to me investment banker said if i may say so that our problem has been one of communication i just told you what our problem was casey interrupted you thought you were buying something that wasnt for sale it seems to me if i may say so delchamps said sarcastically that the irishman has just put both thumbs on the problem you thought you owned us for two hundred thousand there was silence for a moment then investment banker said if i may continue gentlemen he interpreted the silence that followed to mean there was no objection and he went on if either of us had when suspicions arose contacted the other you were suspicious of us yung challenged sarcastically yes indeed counselor investment banker said perhaps i was being paranoid but when the locator suddenly showed colonel castillo to be halfway between budapest and viennaon a danube riverboat that has the reputation of being a floating brothelwhen last wed heard he was on the lopez fruit and vegetables mexico property i began to question dr caseys data and thought we might be having a problem i thought putting charley on the love boat was a nice touch delchamps said smugly casey explained we were just a little worried that one of you might tell montvale or maybe even clendennen that charley was in mexicoand where president clendennen recently had appointed charles w montvale to be his vice president he had previously been director of national intelligence to be completely honest annapolis said that path of action was discussed the phrase i used at the time was over my dead body and obviously i prevailed he looked at castillo i give you my word of honor colonel we have just knocked rings castillo thought a former member of the brigade of midshipmen of the naval academy has just given his word of honor to a former member of the corps of cadets at west point fully expecting him to take it and the funny thing is im going to do just that ill take your word castillo said operative word your to be completely honest youre the only one of your crew i trust some small progress is better than none at all hotelier said for your information colonel we take no actions of that sort unless there is unanimity among us castillo didnt reply without objection i will continue with the toast hotelier said ladies and gentlemen i give you the magnificent success of operation march hare champagne was sipped max took the opportunity to help himself to a baconwrapped oyster theres liable to be a toothpick in that sweaty said with concern max knows who were dealing with castillo said he looked carefully before he grabbed it he also sniffed for cyanide there were a few chuckles at this very droll investment banker said but if we are to continue working together and whatever gave you the idea that is even a remote possibility castillo asked because we share the same objective hotelier said of defending the united states from all enemies foreign and domestic i heard somewhere that patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel castillo said would you be interested in my take on you people i suspect were going to get it even if all of us chorused hell no annapolis said but id like to hear it you started out with good intentions castillo said and ill admit that the money youve provided to specopscomand i presume to the agency and othershelped them to do things that they wouldnt have been able to do because they couldnt get the funds from congress but thenhow did that englishman put it power corrupts if youre talking about john emerich edward dalbergacton first baron acton annapolis said what he said was all power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely thank you castillo said sweaty annapolis men always like to demonstrate their erudition delchamps laughed i tend to agree with the first part of that quotation annapolis went on is that what youre suggesting happened here bullseye admiral castillo said actually i was a commander annapolis said all right colonel were guilty as charged what would you have us do commit seppuku thatd work for you castillo said but i dont see any vfw buttons on your pals what are you talking about sweaty demanded seppuku my love also known as harakiri is what defeated samuraiwarriorsdo to atone for their sins it involves stabbing yourself in the belly with a sword and then giving it a twist but only warriors are allowed to do that delchamps chuckled i dont have a vfw pin colonel radio and tv stations said but i do have a baseball cap with the legend palm beach chapter vietnam helicopter pilots association embroidered in gold on it would you say that gives me the right to disembowel myself only if you didnt buy the cap at a yard sale castillo said radio and tv stations did not look anything like what comes to mind when the term warrior was used i got mine after i showed them my dd and gave them fifty bucks radio and tv stations said dd was the defense departments form that listed ones military service qualifications and any decorations you were a helicopter pilot in vietnam castillo asked but even as the words came out of his mouth he knew that was the case radio and tv stations met castillos eyes and nodded ill be a sonofabitch castillo said it gets better than that castillo annapolis said tell him chopper jockey id planned to tell you this at some time but not under these circumstances radio and tv stations said but what the hell i would guess youve heard of operation lam son castillo nodded i was shot downand woundedduring it radio and tv stations went on my copilot and i were hiding in a rice paddy wondering if we were going to die right thereor after the vc found us and put us in a bamboo cagewhen a pretty well shotup huey flew through some really nasty antiaircraft fire and landed next to us the pilot and his copilot jumped out threw us onto the huey and got us out of there i later learned the pilot was a young mexicanamerican from san antonio who had flown fiftyodd such missions before his luck ran out he became a posthumous recipient of the medal of honor he wasnt a mexicanamerican castillo said he was a texican a texan of mexican heritage you knew this man karl berezovsky asked unfortunately no castillo said dont stop there annapolis said tell him the rest radio and tv stations considered the order nodded and went on fast forwardwhat twelve thirteen years maybe a little longer i was in san antone on business i own one of the tv stations there an english fm station and one each spanishlanguage am and fm station i found myself with a little time to kill and finally remembering the man who saved my life just before he got blown away was from there thought they might have buried him there in the fort sam national cemetery i called them they said he was so i stopped by a florist and went to the cemetery and laid a dozen roses on the grave of warrant officer junior grade jorge alejandro castillo moh your father carlito sweaty asked softly castillo nodded who according to his tombstone had left this vale of tears when he was nineteen years old radio and tv stations went on which caused me to think what am i doing walking around with more money than i know what to do with and this mexicanexcuse me texicankid who saved my life is pushing up daisies inspiration struck what i could do to assuage my guilt was throw money at his family i even thought that might be the reason god or fate or whatever had let me make all the money so i could do something good with it so i called the guy who does security for my stationshes an excopand told him to get me an address for mr castillos family in ten minutes i had it so i told the limo driver to take me there great big house behind a twelvefoottall castiron fence the castillos were obviously not living on food stamps on the lawn a blond teenage boy and a great big fat mexican teenage boy were beating the hell out of each other i later realized that was probably you colonel and my cousin fernando also a texican castillo said so i called the security guy back and got the skinny on the castillo family they could buy and sell me so i told the driver to take me to the airport you didnt go in the house sweaty asked sweaty is it all right if i call you that svetlana considered that for a full ten seconds then nodded sweaty im a coward with an active imagination i could see myself introducing myself to mr castillos father and mother and maybe his kid telling them their dead son had saved my life in vietnam and then them asking so where the hell have you been for the past thirteen fourteen years you had more important things to do they wouldnt have done that castillo said my fathers copilotmy father kicked him out of his huey just before he took off and got blown awayis practically a member of the family hes a retired twostar like i said colonel im a coward radio and tv stations said what im hoping is that this trip down memory lane will convince you there were two of us who said over my dead body when it was suggested that turning you over to ambassador montvale so that he could turn you over to the russians was the best solution to the congox problem castillo looked first at sweaty who shrugged which he interpreted to mean maybe why not and then at delchamps who did the same thing and finally at annapolis who nodded okay castillo said two good guys out of four or are there any more of you theres more annapolis said the proponents of letting montvale turn you and sweaty and colonel berezovsky over to the russians felt their presence here today might be a little awkward castillo snorted and then asked how many more well counting aloysius and colonel hamilton dont count either one of us casey said hamiltons as pissed with you people as i am more he was the one who let me see how you regarded us as employees does that mean you are permanently shutting down our communications annapolis asked it means im with charley whatever charley decides how many others castillo pursued in all there are nine of us annapolis said which means that five of you wanted to throw charley to the lions mrs agnes forbison asked it was the first time shed opened her mouth unfortunately investment banker said five of us were considering that option but were dissuaded from doing so agnes said the question then becomes how can we be sure they can be dissuaded the next time a situation like that comes up the question mother forbison delchamps said is whether or not having indulged the irishman by coming here in the first place we decide weve heard enough give these people the finger and walk out of here is that what you want to do edgar castillo asked it was when i walked in here delchamps replied now im not so sure and neither to judge by mother forbisons question is she you want to discuss this privately castillo asked that was the first thing that popped into my mind delchamps said but ive sort of changed my mind about that too lets lay everything on the table go ahead castillo said giving the benefit of the doubt to the five of these people who were smart enough not to show up here today i understand where they were coming from they have been passing both money and information to people in the community for some time the money was really needed and the information was more often than not useful and the people who got it were grateful maybe pathetically grateful because it allowed them to do what theyre supposed to do and then the irishman got in the act and supplied these people with better communication than anybody else has it wasnt hard for the evil quintet to go from that to thinking they were really important and thus knew what was best for the community and from that to thinking they knew what was best for the country and theres a little of he who pays the piper calls the tune in that castillo was surprised at delchampss little speech he often thought that the veteran cia agent was as voluble as a clam and delchamps wasnt through a good idea went wrong that happens what you do when that happens is make the necessary adjustments such as castillo asked remove temptation delchamps said the information stream becomes one way they tell us only us what they know and we decide who if anybody also gets to know and they dont tell anybody what were doing unless we tell them they can i dont think the admiral here or the chopper pilot would have any problem with that he paused and looked at first radio and tv stations and then at annapolis and then asked would you no radio and tv stations said none at all annapolis said youre not going to ask me investment banker asked what you two and especially the evil quintet would have to fully understand is that whoever breaks the rules has to go what do you mean has to go investment banker asked delchamps shrugged i think you take my meaning he said my god hotelier said was that a threat i have never threatened anybody in my life delchamps said im just outlining the conditions under which we could have a continuing relationship dmitri berezovsky smiled they all know castillo thought that the cia establishment refers to delchamps and perhaps a dozen other old clandestine service officers like him as dinosaurs they were thought to be as out of place in the modern intelligence community as dinosaurs because to a man their operational philosophy had been a paraphrase of what general philip sheridan said in january visavis native americans the dinosaurs believed that the only good communist was a dead communist they all also know that delchamps is alleged to have recently applied this philosophy to the svr rezident in vienna and to a member of the cias clandestine service who had sold out the latter was found dead in his car in the cia parking garage in langley with an ice pick in his ear and the former had been found strangled to death with a hungarian garrote in a taxi outside the us embassy in vienna neither the fbi nor the austrian bundeskriminalamtgesetz was able to solve either murder and maybe proving that im a young dinosaur the truth is i wasnt at all upset that they had been unsuccessful the question then becomes how are these people going to react to delchampss outlining the conditions under which we can have a continuing relationship would you like a moment alone to discuss this delchamps asked so far as im concerned that wont be necessary annapolis said i can accept those conditions and if anyone else doesnt like it radio and tv stations said theyre out he looked at investment banker and hotelier in or out he asked i cant remember ever having been in a negotiation before even with the mafia hotelier said where the options were to go along or go away is that a yes or a no radio and tv stations asked i think what mr delchamps has proposed is reasonable under the circumstances im in i always look for the bottom line investment banker said and the bottom line here is that both parties need each other to do what we know has to be done and that no one else can do i accept the conditions ill deal with what did you call them mr delchamps the evil quintet radio and tv stations said thats what i call them when there are ladies present delchamps said when you deal with them you might mention that he looked at castillo your call ace he said youve heard the proposal okay by you castillo stopped himself just in time from saying im going to have to consult with my consigliere but he did just that by looking first at sweaty and then at her brother both nodded just perceptibly okay he finally said simply annapolis walked to him and offered his hand castillo shook it annapolis then offered his hand to sweaty as radio and tv stations walked to castillo with his hand extended wordlessly all of those people solemnly shook the hands of all of the merry outlaws i think another toast is in order hotelier said when that was over more champagne or something stronger i know not what course others may take but as for me give me a taste of that twentyfiveyearold macallan delchamps said pointing to a long row of whisky bottles on a bar ill go along with patrick henry agnes forbison said the two waiters quickly took orders for drinks and quickly and efficiently distributed them castillo wondered how much he could trust investment bankers waiters to forget what they had just heard well i think we can safely presume if they already dont know of edgars reputation hell tell them that should ensure their silence if i may hotelier said raising his glass to the successful conclusion of difficult negotiations and our success in future operations everybody sipped and if i may castillo then said to full understanding of the conditions of our new relationship and to the long long time its going to be between now and our having to put that understanding to the test everybody took another swallow i hate to rain on our happy little parade annapolis said but that time may be a good deal shorter than we all hoped when no one replied he went on just before you came in we were watching wolf news we recorded it i think you should have a look at it he waved at the long couch and at the armchairs around it there was a muted whirring and a screen dropped from under the upperlevel foyer and then another whirring as drapes slid over the windows looking down at the miracle strip when everybody had found a seat the lights dimmed and the stirring sounds of the fourth and final part of gioacchino antonio rossinis william tell overturesometimes known as the lone ranger themefilled the room a blond crewcut head filled the screen im j pastor jones the head announced its five pm in los angeles and eight in montpelier and time for the news it wasnt quite time there followed a ninetysecond commercial for undetectable undergarments for those suffering from bladderleakage problems and then came another ninetysecond commercial for those who suffered heartburn from eating spicy pizza and other problemcausing goodies this gave castillo plenty of time to consider that he disliked tv anchors in general and j pastor jones in particular jones reminded castillo of the teachers pets of his early childhood and the male cheerleaders of his high school years j pastor jones was not only from vermontwhich castillo thought of as the peoples democratic republic of vermontbut had appointed himself as a booster thereof hence the reference to montpelier which few people could find on a map rather than to boston new york philadelphia washington dc or miami which were also in the eastern time zone j pastor jones reappeared on the screen this time sharing it with c harry whelan jr who was a prominent and powerful washingtonbased columnist and a wolf news contributor there is bad news in the war against drugs j pastor jones announced very bad news indeed wolf news contributor the distinguished journalist c harry whelan has the details what happened harry c harry whelan jr now had the entire screen to himself it showed him sitting in what looked like a living room whose walls were lined with books we dont know much whelan announced pontifically but what we do know is this wolf news has learned exclusively that tomorrows washington timespost will carry a story by the distinguished journalist roscoe j danton that three american officers in mexico to fight the drug cartels were shot to death near acapulco at noon today they were according to danton antonio martinez and eduardo torres both of whom were special agents of the drug enforcement administration and chief warrant officer daniel salazar who was attached to the us embassy in mexico city shit castillo said according to danton the three murdered men were known to be traveling to acapulco with lieutenant colonel james d ferris an assistant military attache of the us embassy for a conference with mexican officials colonel ferris and the embassy vehicle a suburban bearing diplomatic license plates are missing according to danton oh jesus h christ castillo said danton has declined to reveal his sources even to me and roscoe and i have been friends and fellow journalists for years he has put his distinguished reputation on the line with this story and i believe him calls to the state department the pentagon and the us embassy by wolf news reporters have elicited only this response which i quote the alleged incident is under investigation wolf news will stay on top of this story and when we know more you will this is c harry whelan the screen now filled with the head of j pastor jones just as castillo was about to order that mr jones be cut off someone pushed the pause button castillo punched a button on his caseyberry and then the loudspeaker button i thought you might be calling charley roscoe j danton said thats odd annapolis said when i tried that i got a message not authorized he looked at aloysius casey that was before you and charley kissed and made up casey said whered you get the mexican story roscoe castillo asked from a lady friend in foggy bottom danton replied castillo had a quick thought nobody really believes the caseyberrys are as good as they are we talk on them as if someone might be listening you have anything more than we got from your buddy whelan on wolf news he asked i talked to your old boss he said vic is on his way down there danton replied and about twenty minutes ago there was an email from porky saying clendennen will have an announcement to make tomorrow at eleven keep me in the loop roscoe castillo said what about those people annapolis and radio stations are good to go castillo said im still making up my mind about the banker and the hotelier he thought and im glad investment banker and hotelier heard me say that let that sink in a while and then i will let them back in the tent you met with them yeah just now casey told me that was going to happen i thought maybe thered be an ap flash mass murder in sin city i was thinking of feeding them to the sharks in the aquarium in the mandalay bay but my merciful nature took over thanks roscoe well be in touch danton said castillo put his caseyberry away well if mcnab has sent vic dalessandro down there he said then until we hear from him i cant think of anything else that can be done to get ferris back from the goddamn drug cartels carlos berezovsky said what makes you think the drug people have your friend jesus i never even thought about that castillo asked am i permitted to ask thought about what investment banker said or are you still making up your mind if my word is any good why dont you and hotelier think of yourselves as being in a halfway house castillo said where one slip from the straight and narrow will turn you into shark food what ace didnt think about is that dmitris pal vladimir doesnt like being humiliated delchamps said and that vladimir vladimirovich might think a good way to get his hands on carlos berezovsky picked up would be to grab him when he gets on his white horse and gallops into mexico to rescue his friend from the drug people whos vladimir hotelier asked his last name is putin annapolis furnished carlito would have thought about vladimir sweaty said loyally sure i would castillo thought probably by a week from next thursday jesus and now that this has come up sweaty went on we have time to think about it carlito is right until we hear from vic dalessandro theres nothing we can do except remember what you and dmitri are always telling me castillo said putin always has a plan b i dont follow you ace delchamps said dmitri castillo asked one how many exspetsnaz does aleksandr have raking the sunswept beaches at the grand cozumel beach and golf resort two how many of same would he be willing to loan me right now to do what ace delchamps asked to provide a little extra security for the people at the lopez fruit and vegetables mexico i think putin knows about that too and i dont want them getting into the cross fire at least twenty berezovsky said i think aleksandr would give you say tenall that could fit into the gulfstreamright now more men as soon as they could be flown up from argentina you sound pretty sure castillo said carlito sweaty said not only does cousin aleksandr love you but he knows the best way to deal with vladimir vladimirovich is towhat is it edgar says cut him off at the balls for the record sweaty delchamps corrected her what i said is cut him off at the knees berezovsky took out his caseyberry and punched a key aleksandr im with charley in las vegas he said in russian vladimir vladimirovich has raised his ugly head again and we need some help to cut him off at the knees this is the problem ii one yadkin and reilly road fort bragg north carolina april the federal express truck pulled to the curb before a twostory brick house and the driver after first taking a fedex overnight envelope from where he had stuck it on the dashboard got out he took a quick look at the envelope as he walked around the front of the truck the overnight envelope sent by the mexicanamerican news service of san antonio texas was addressed to ltc bruce j mcnab yadkin and reilly road fort bragg nc the fedex driver had served in the army and knew that ltc meant lieutenant colonel and he had served long enough to know that lieutenant colonels do not live in large brick homes on what was known locally as generals row after a moment he decided it was a simple typo ltc was supposed to be ltg the abbreviation for lieutenant general a small wooden sign on the lawn of the house confirmed this analysis it showed three silver stars the rank insignia of a lieutenant general and below that was neatly painted b j mcnab the driver now convinced he was in the right place continued up a walkway through the immaculately manicured lawn toward the house he was almost at the door when a black chevrolet suburban cameconsiderably over the posted mph speed limitdown reilly road stopped and quickly backed up the driveway of the house doors opened the driver a young green beret sergeant in a camouflagepattern battledress uniform and a young green beret captain in dress uniform got out of the front seat the sergeant quickly removed a cover from a red plate bearing three stars mounted on the bumper and then rushed to open the passenger door he was too late the door was opened by a green beret colonel in a dress uniform who marched purposefully toward the house with the captain trailing him the driver stood beside the passenger door the front door of the house opened and general mcnab came through he was in dress uniform and wearing a green beret both breasts of his tunic carried more ribbons and qualification badges than the driver had ever seen on one man during his military service colonel max caruthers who was six foot three and weighed pounds and captain albert h walsh who was almost as large saluted crisply and more or less simultaneously barked good morning general general mcnab returned the salute and then turned his attention to the fedex deliveryman far be it from me to stay a fedex courier from the swift completion of his appointed rounds but curiosity overwhelms me he announced dare i hope that envelope you are clutching to your breast is intended for me it is if youre bruce j mcnab the courier said guilty general mcnab said the courier extended the clipboard for the addressees signature captain walsh snatched the overnight envelope from the driver handed it to the general and then signed the receipt on the clipboard general mcnab ripped open the strip at the top of the envelope and took from it an eightbyteninch photograph oh my he said in a tone similar to what a grandmother would use when her cake batter slipped from her hands and splattered over her kitchen floor oh my he handed the overnight envelope to captain walsh hold that by its edges al he ordered gloves would be better it will probably be futile but we will have tried something wrong general the fedex courier asked nothing for which you could possibly be held responsible general mcnab said and now although i would rather face a thousand deaths i must go treat with general naylor the courier looked confused colonel caruthers who recognized the remark as a paraphrase of what confederate general robert e lee had said immediately before leaving his headquarters to surrender the army of northern virginia to union general ulysses s grant failed to keep a smile off his face the courier started back to his delivery truck as general mcnab walked toward staff sergeant robert nellis who was standing by the open front passenger door bobby he said can you find pope air force base by yourself or would you rather that i drive ill drive general sergeant nellis said smiling its easy to recognize general mcnab said as he slid onto the seat just look for lots of airplanes and fat people in blue uniforms colonel caruthers and captain walsh quickly got into the suburban and they drove down the driveway and turned right onto reilly road as the suburban carrying general mcnab pulled into one of the reserved for general officers parking spaces beside the pope air force base operations building the glass doors fronting on the tarmac opened and a half dozen air force officers the senior among them a major general came out and formed a threeline formation the major general stood in front a major wearing the silver cords of an aidedecamp took up a position two steps behind and one step to the left of him the other four officers formed a line behind the aidedecamp according to rank with a brigadier general to the left then three full colonels all stood with their hands folded in the small of their backs in the position of parade rest seeing all that martial precision lieutenant general mcnab announced i am sorely tempted to go out there and give them a little closeorder drill his sergeant driver smiled his aidesdecamp did not they knew he was entirely capable of doing just that both were visibly relieved when mcnab got out of the suburban walked to the corner of the building and called good morning gentlemen beautiful day isnt it the major general turned toward him and saluted good morning general he said and then broke ranks to go to mcnab and offer his hand would you care to bet if el supremo will be on schedule mcnab asked for an answer the major general pointed down the runway where a cathe military version of the gulfstream vwas about to touch down as the sleek twinengine jet completed its landing roll the air force major general trotted back to resume his position in front of his officers general mcnab folded his arms on his chest the gulfstream v was painted in gleaming white on top and pale blue beneath there was no reference to the us air force in its markings although it carried the starandbar insignia of a military aircraft on its engine nacelles united states of america was lettered on the fuselage above the six windows an american flag was painted on the vertical stabilizer the plane stopped on the tarmac the whine of its engines died and the stair door behind the cockpit windows unfolded a tall erect officer with four stars gleaming on the epaulets of his dress uniform nimbly came down them he was general allan b naylor whomto his embarrassmentc harry whelan had accurately described to andy mcclarren of wolf news as the most important general in the world whelans argument was that since the chief of staff of the army no longer actually commands the armybut rather administers itand that since naylor as commander in chief of the united states central command directly commanded more army and marine troops more air force airplanes more navy ships and aircraft and more military assets in more places all around the world than any other officer that made him the most important general in not only the army but the most important officer in uniform even andy mcclarren who had been the most watched news personality on television for ten years and countingin large part because of his skill in being able to argue the opposite position of whatever position his guests tookcouldnt disagree with that general naylor exchanged salutes with the air force major general and then shook hands with him and all of the officers and finally turned to general mcnab who saluted good morning bruce general naylor said good morning general mcnab said and how are things on beautiful tampa bay the united states central command headquarters was on macdill air force base tampa florida generals naylor and mcnab had been classmates at the united states military academy at west point they hadnt liked each other as cadets and a number of encounters between them as they had risen in rank in their subsequent service had exacerbated that relationship general naylor didnt reply instead with a smile he motioned for mcnab to board the gulfstream mcnab in turn motioned for his aidesdecamp to get aboard when they had done so he followed them and when he had done so general naylor followed him the stair door started to close as the engines started when the gulfstream started to move the air force general called his formation to attention and saluted when the gulfstream was on the taxiway he turned to the brigadier general and softly commented that should be an interesting flight the friction between generals mcnab and naylor was well known to senior officers of all the armed forces and it went beyond isnt that interesting or what a shame the united states special operations command was subordinate to the united states central command and when at about the same time naylor was about to be named commander in chief of centcom and mcnab to be commanding general of specopscom it was almost universally recognized as one of those rare situations that would see the best possible man assigned to both jobs it was also just about unanimously agreed that making scotty mcnab subordinate to allan naylor was going to be like throwing lighted matches into a barrel of gasoline general mcnab took an aisle seat in the luxuriously furnished cabin as general naylor walked past him en route to the vip sectiontwo extralarge seats and a table behind the door to the cockpit which could be curtained off from the rest of the passenger compartmentmcnab held up his hand naylor looked down at him mcnab said general before they start the inflight movie theres something id like to show you you dont need an invitation to ride in front bruce and you know it naylor said he gestured for mcnab to follow him mcnab rose and gestured for captain walsh to follow him reaching his seat naylor took it and then when mcnab had taken the opposing chair asked what have you got captain walsh extended a pair of rubber gloves to general naylor naylor looked questioningly at mcnab gloves i dont think theyll be able to get fingerprints off that general mcnab said indicating the fedex overnight envelope but they may naylor took the gloves and pulled them on walsh handed him the envelope and naylor took from it a sheet of paper and an eightbyteninch color photograph the photograph showed a man dressed in a tshirt and khaki trousers he was sitting in a folding chair holding up a copy of mexico citys el heraldo de mexico on each side of him stood a man wearing a black balaclava mask over his head and holding the muzzle of a kalashnikov six inches from the victims head thats yesterdays newspaper mcnab said the sheet of paper obviously printed on a cheap inkjet printer carried a simple message so far hes alive there will be further communication who is he naylor asked calmly he looks familiar lieutenant colonel james d ferris mcnab said the officer whomwith great reluctance you will recalli detailed to dea from which he was further detailed to beovertlyone of the assistant military attaches at our embassy in mexico city covertly i have been led to believe he was ordered to advise the ambassador in his relentless and neverending attempt to reason with the drug cartels i can do without the sarcasm general naylor said ferris marches in the long gray line beside his classmates lieutenant colonel randolph richardson jr and our own lieutenant colonel c g castillo retired he has a wife at fort bragg and three children small world isnt it where did you get this naylor asked a fedex delivery man handed it to me just now when i walked out of my quarters to come here its addressed to ltc mcnab i noticed it may be a typo or it could be on purpose my gut feeling is that its on purpose to attract less attention naylor asked mcnab nodded ive been wondering if another was sent to me naylor finished for him mcnab nodded again captain naylor said politely would you ask colonel brewer to come up here please colonel j d brewer was naylors senior aidedecamp we have been cleared for takeoff the publicaddress system announced please fasten your seat belts no fedex overnight envelope or other communication relative to this at macdill general colonel brewer reported five minutes later as the gulfstream reached cruising altitude naylor looked at mcnab whats the plan at andrews mcnab asked a black hawk will take us to langley we meet the others there including natalie i have been led to believe the secretary of state will be there his tone made it clear that he thought general mcnab should not refer to the secretary of state by her first name i call her natalie because i like her general mcnab said shes my kind of gal and then he quoted the secretary of state you miserable goddamn shameless hypocritical sonofabitch it was what secretary of state natalie cohen had said to president clendennen in the situation room of the white house on february immediately after the president had announced that for the good of the country for the good of the office of the president i am inclined to accept ambassador montvales offer to become my vice president it was the first time anyone in the room had ever heard her say anything stronger than darn my god naylor said she calls a spade a spade mcnab said there arent many other people in foggy bottomoffhand i cant think of onewho do that naylor looked at mcnab as if he were forming his words when finally he said nothing mcnab went on we can ask her at the agency if shes been contacted and im sure that among lammelles gnomes is someone who can lift any fingerprints there might be on the envelope franklin lammelle was dci director of the central intelligence agency all right naylor said and the cia would be the most logical choice to deal with this situation right mcnab didnt reply mcnab youre not thinking of going down there to rescue colonel ferris are you general i would say that none of us has enough information to make any decisions on how to deal with this mcnab said but we can think about it while were at langley doing our bit to help the president get reelected is that how you think of it mcnab didnt reply directly instead saying having complied with action one of the sop by notifying my superior headquarters of the situation with your permission general i will now take action two general naylor nodded his permission al mcnab said to captain walsh would you please bring the brick up here sixty seconds later walsh laid the brick on the table it had been provided to general mcnab by the afc corporation free of charge the chairman of the board of the afc corporation dr aloysius francis casey had during the vietnam war been the communications sergeant on a special forces a team he credited that service for giving him the confidence to do such things as apply for admission to the massachusetts institute of technology without having a high school diploma and then shortly after being awarded his phd by that institution starting the afc corporation which quickly became the world leader in data processing and encryption like the jarheads say general he had told thennewly promoted brigadier general mcnab when he flew uninvited in one of afcs learjets to fort bragg once a green beanie always a green beanie and now its payback time the translation was that he was willing to provide the special operations community with the very latest in communication and encryption equipment free of charge when he left fort bragg that day he had taken with him brigadier general mcnabs aidedecampyou can call me aloysius hotshot casey had told thensecond lieutenant c g castilloso that castillo could not only select from afcs existing stocks of electronic equipment but could also tell what communications abilities delta force and gray fox wished it had general mcnab now opened the attache case a green led told him the system was in standby mode he flipped a few switches and other green leds illuminated one was encrypted voice communication one encrypted data communication and one encrypted scan general mcnab removed a device about the size of a cigarette lighter from the attache case put it to his eye aimed it at the fedex overnight envelope and then at the photograph and message it contained a red led illuminated briefly over the legend encrypted data transmission in progress and then went out general mcnab then picked up a telephone handset and pushed a button yes sir the voice of major general terry otoole deputy commander of specopscom came over the bricks speakers after bouncing off a satellite miles over the earth terry i just sent you what was handed to me as i walked out of my quarters this morning mcnab said im looking at it general otoole said load up your wife and get over to colonel ferriss quarters show her this tell her were working on it and to keep her mouth shut about it yes sir tell her as soon as i learn anything ill let her know yes sir ill be in touch yes sir mcnab replaced the handset and closed the attache case two apartment the watergate apartments i street nw washington dc april i would much rather drip ice water in his ear edgar delchamps said as he stood beside the bed of roscoe j danton but were a little pressed for time he picked up the foot of dantons bed raised it three feet and dropped it you sonsofbitches mr danton said upon being roused from his slumber he sat up suddenly and then pushed himself back against the headboard rise and shine roscoe david w yung jr said how the hell did you two get in here danton demanded and good morning to you too roscoe delchamps said the door was open yung said mr dantons door came equippedin addition to the locking mechanism that came with the knobwith two dead bolts both of which danton was sure he had set how did you get through the lobby danton challenged or into the garage there didnt seem to be anyone on duty delchamps said up and at em roscoe before we go out to langley i want to pick up a little liquid courage at the old ebbitt grill they serve a magnificent bloody mary im not going out to langley roscoe said and we have to talk about your million dollars yung said danton eyed yung what did he say roscoe j danton was a little embarrassed to privately admit that he was more than a little afraid of both men while he didnt think david w yung jr was capable of the sort of violence attributed to edgar delchamps on the other hand yungs peersthat was to say others in castillos merry band of outlawscalled him twogun and roscoe didnt think theyd just plucked that out of thin air time roscoe is of the essence delchamps said remember to wash behind your ears roscoe had some timenot muchto once again think his situation over during his ablutions he had come close to what president clendennen derisively called castillos merry band of outlaws in the practice of his profession which was to say running down a story that was a bona fide journalistic accomplishment he was the only journalist ever to do so and roscoe took some justifiable pride in his having done so among other things it had resulted in a pageone abovethefold story in the washington timespost brilliant intelligence coup sees major changes in white house by roscoe j danton washington timespost writers syndicate president joshua ezekiel clendennen today chose ambassador charles w montvale the director of national intelligence to be vice president less than twentyfour hours after secretary of state natalie cohen revealed that montvale had been the brains behind the brilliant intelligence coup that saw russias supersecret tupelov tua touch down at andrews air force base in washington with american intelligence operatives at the controls how the aircraftdescribed off the record by senior air force officials as years ahead of anything in the american arsenalcame into us possession remains a closely guarded secret but it is known that the central intelligence agency had a standing offer of million for the delivery of one into its hands montvale announced at andrews that the money would be paid to the two pilots who flew it into andrews they were identified only as retired officers with an intelligence background secretary of state natalie cohen pointing to montvales long and distinguished career in public servicehe has been a deputy secretary of state secretary of the treasury and ambassador to the european unionsaid she could think of no one better qualified to be vice president and hoped his selection to that office would put to rest once and for all the scurrilous rumors of bad blood between montvale and the president president clendennen immediately nominated truman c ellsworth who had been montvales deputy to be director of national intelligence that appointment according to white house insiders almost certainly was behind the resignation of cia director john powell although the official version is that powell decided it was time for him to return to private life the president announced that he was sending the name of cia deputy director for operations a franklin lammelle to the senate for confirmation as cia director lammelle who has worked closely with both montvale and secretary of state cohen is widely believed to have been deeply involved with montvale in the operation that saw the supersecret russian tupelov tua come into american hands presidential spokesman john david parker said the president would have nothing further to say about the intelligence coup stating that it was after all a clandestine operation and the less said about it the better the problem was that roscoe not only knew the backstory which he had not written about but had been part of it he knew for example that the president had been known to refer to montvale as ambassador stupid director of national ignorance he also knew that president clendennen shortly after taking office had ordered montvales red phonewhich provided instant access to the president and cabinet headsshut off and canceled montvales access to the white house fleet of limousines and gmc yukons in the hope that this would encourage montvale to resign so that he could appoint cia director john powellwho could in the presidents judgment find his ass with both handsto replace him he also knew for example that president clendennen had named ambassador montvale to be his vice president not as a reward for the intelligence coup or because of his admiration for him but because the alternative had been the virtually certain indictment of the president by the house of representatives quickly followed by an impeachment trial in the senate danton knew that the delivery of the tupelov tua into the hands of the cia had almost been a sideshow to what had really happened shortly before clendennen had become president on the sudden death of his predecessoran aortal aneurysm had ruptured the united states had launched a preemptive strike on a biological warfare manufactory in the congo the manufactory and everything within at least two square miles around it had been bombed and incinerated with every aerial weapon in the american arsenal except nuclear it was believed this action had removed all of an incredibly lethal substance known as congox from the planet this assessment was proven false when fedex delivered several liters of congox to the armys medical research institute of infectious diseasethe euphemism for biological warfare laboratoriesat fort detrick maryland this was shortly followed by the discovery of another several liters of the substance by border patrol agents just inside the usmexico border and this was shortly followed by the svr rezident in washington sergei murov inviting a franklin lammelle then the cias deputy director of operations for drinks at the russian embassys dacha on marylands eastern shore there he proposed a deal the russians would turn over all the congox in their possession in exchange for the former svr rezident in berlin colonel dmitri berezovsky and his sister lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva the former svr rezident in copenhagen who had not only defected with the assistance of lieutenant colonel c g castillo but had also spilled the beans to colonel castillo about the fish farm in the congo the russians also wanted colonel castillo when this proposal was brought to the attention of president clendennen he thought the deal made a great deal of sense and ordered that it be concluded when informed that colonel berezovsky and lieutenant colonel alekseeva were not in the hands of the cia but in argentina with colonel castillo who flatly refused to turn them over to the cia president clendennen ordered director of national intelligence montvale to send all the alphabet agencies of the intelligence community to find them and see that they were all loaded aboard the next available aeroflot flight to moscow frederick p palmer the united states attorney general later described this action as being of mindboggling illegality and suggested that if anything beyond president clendennens caving in to the russians was needed to convince the house of representatives that articles of impeachment were in order this would do it and the story would have come out the simultaneous offered resignations of secretary of state cohen director of national intelligence montvale general naylor and even presidential spokesman porky parker could not be swept under the rug even if a sense of duty might keep those resigning from making public why they could no longer serve president clendennen attorney general palmer however argued that the country could not take another impeachment scandal and that it was their duty to stay in office with the caveats that the president appoint montvale as vice president that the president ask for dci powells resignation and that he make other changes in the senior leadership that they considered necessary the president having no alternative but impeachment quickly agreed roscoe danton running down the rumor that lieutenant colonel castillo had snatched two russian defectors from the cia station chief in vienna had first encountered members of the merry band of outlaws in argentina during the time the alphabet agencies were looking for him without quite knowing how it had happened he had wound up in mexico embroiled in colonel castillos merry outlaws current operation castillo had learned that the congox the border patrol had found just inside the texasmexico border had been flown to mexico in a tupelov tua and that the aircraft presumably carrying more congox was on an air base on venezuelas la orchila island he launched an operation to grab both the aircraft and the congox roscoe j danton had been aboard one of the black hawk helicopters that landed on la orchila island he had not been sure then and was not sure now whether he was there as a courageous journalist following a story no matter where it led or whether he was a craven coward who believed the merry outlaws when they made their little joke now that you know that roscoe well have to kill youand actually might have done so had he not climbed aboard the black hawk danton had managed to convince himself before he had been so rudely awakened that he had been more the professional journalist than professional coward he had come to this conclusion after deciding that president clendennen was a miserable sonofabitch for trying to swap dmitri and sweatywho had also been on the black hawkand charley castillo to the russians after the island when he saw castillo and colonel jake torine preparing to fly the tupelov tua to andrews air force base he realized that he had been accepted by the merry outlaws as one of their own there were advantages to thisfor example he had been given a caseyberry over which the secretary of state had given him the scoop about the murders and kidnapping in mexicoand he could see a cornucopia of other news that would come his way in the future but there were manifold disadvantages to his being a professional journalist that he could see as well as roscoe pulled on his shorts in his bedroom he said guys i really dont want to go out there why wolf news will carry the presidents press conference from the first line of bullshit to the last youre going roscoe yung said charley wants you to go when you get down to it guys im really not one of you charley thinks you are yung said thats good enough for the executive combat pay committee for the what the executive combat pay committee delchamps replied twogun alex darby and me were the ones who pass out the combat pay yung added the committee asked charley what about roscoe and charley replied he was on the island wasnt he i was on the island as a journalist roscoe replied a neutral noncombatant observer but danton thought shit i dont believe that i was rooting for the good guys and i took the uzi that castillo said i might need if that was the case delchamps said wed have to kill you you know too much there he goes with that wed have to kill you bullshit again the trouble with that being im not sure its bullshit i do know too much and if we killed you then you wouldnt get the million yung said what fucking million i could set up a trust fund for your kids i suppose yung said thoughtfully what fucking million roscoe demanded as he rummaged through his tie rack shooters delchamps said roughly defined as everybody who went to the island get a million plus of course everybody who went into the congo charley sweaty and dmitri opted out my god theyre serious im being offered a million dollars how much would that be when the irs was through with me why am i asking pure and noble journalist that i am im of course going to have to refuse it what is this pure and noble journalist bullshit whats the difference between me taking free meals and booze from any lobbyist with a credit card and taking a million from the merry outlaws i write what i want period and i was on that island and i could have been killed roscoe had a sudden very clear flashback to what had happened several years before at the national press club somebody had jumped on frank cesno then high up in cnns washington bureauand a hell of a journalistabout the recent tendency of tv journalists to paint themselves as absolutely neutral when covering a war otherwise both sides would think of us as spies not journalists cesno had announced more than a little piously whereupon he had been shot out of the saddle by admiral stansfield turner who had been director of the cia under jimmy carter frank the admiral had said what do you think the russians or the north koreansor anybodythink when they look at someone like you noble member of the fourth estate or spy david roscoe j danton inquired how much of a bite would the irs take from that million three auditorium three cia headquarters mclean virginia april auditorium three unofficially known as the directors auditorium was a multipurpose room which could be used as a small theater capable of hosting forty people in theaterstyle seating and another eight in more elegant seats in the front row each provided with a small table and a telephone it could also be used as a dining room capable of feeding as many as sixty people with five tables each seating a dozen guests it was secure which caused it also to be known as the directors bubble which meant that great effort was expended just about daily to ensure that nothing said or seen in the room could possibly be heard or seen anywhere else that sort of security wasnt a consideration today where what was to be said by president joshua ezekiel clendennen would be heard and viewed in real time all over the world there was security of course not only was this the headquarters of the cia but the president of the united states was going to be there as were the vice president the secretary of state and other very senior officials there are so many secret service guys in here roscoe j danton thought as he entered auditorium three that theyre falling all over each other theyre competing for space with the state department security guysand galsprotecting natalie cohen the army security guys protecting naylor and the cias own security guys keeping an eye on both frank lammelle and the store in general edgar delchamps and twogun yung had dropped off danton at the main entrance saying theyd wait for him in the parking garage which caused danton to again recall the allegationwhich he believedthat delchamps had taken out a cia traitor in the parking garage by inserting an ice pick into his auditory canal thereby saving the agency from the embarrassment that trying the sonofabitch would have caused some of the white house press corps filled most of the seats in the auditorium there were far more members of that elite body than there were seats for them here today when roscoe had shown his white house press corps credentials to the first of three security pointsthe outside one near the main entranceone of lammelles security people had handed him another credential this one a plasticsealed card on what roscoe thought of as a beaded dog tag chain he looked at it it held his photo and the legend presidential press conference at cia headquarters april th youre on the reservedseating list mr danton the man said roscoe found this interesting because before he had been so rudely awakened he had had no intention of coming out here today and hadnt asked for credentials let alone a reservedseat reservation he knew the protocol for events like this at which there would be far more seats requested by members of the white house press corps than were available the hostin this case frank lammelleand porky parker would put their heads together and decide who got in and who would have to wait outside fuming roscoe intuited that he was on the reservedseating list because of lammelle not porky parker while he had no problems with porky porky could be expected to hand out reserved seats to the elite of the white house press corps and roscoe knew that he wasnt a member of that elite close but no golden ring and he further intuited that it was due to his new status as a memberhowever uncomfortableof the merry outlaws at the beginning frank lammelle had headed the cia delegation of the alphabet agencies looking for charley castillo lammelle even had an airpowered dart gun straight out of a superhero comic book jesus that would have made a great story if i could have written it with which he planned to tranquilize castillo so that he would be amenable to being loaded aboard the moscowbound aeroflot plane after vic dalessandrosurprise surprise had shot lammelle with lammelles own super agent whiz bang air gun in cancunwhere his pursuit of castillo had taken himlammelle had awakened in the middle of a desert in mexico at a secret airfield the merry outlaws had dubbed drug cartel international there when he saw what castillos merry outlaws were doing and compared it to what the president was trying to do to castillo lammelle had changed sides he hadnt gone to the venezuelan island but had made a large maybe even essential contribution to the operation if i have a caseyberry roscoe thought you can bet your ass castillo gave lammelle one and i can hear castillo calling lammelle on it and asking frank can you get roscoe into that press conference and that would neatly tie in with delchamps and yunghaving easily slipped through the watergates stateoftheart absolutely positively guaranteed security systemappearing in my bedroom this morning why the hell is it important to castillo that i hear whatever bullshit our beloved commander in chief is going to spew today when roscoe passed through two more security points and finally got into auditorium three a uniformed cia security officer took a close look at his new presidential press conference credentials and showed him to a seat where he was buried between fellow members of the white house press corps he had half expected to be seated in one of the vip seats in front he saw that andy mcclarren of wolf news and c harry whelan jr had been so honored roscoe glanced at the open laptop computer of his seat mate pierre schiff of lhumanite and helpfully suggested that for about ten bucks schiff could go to radio shack and buy a screen that would keep people from seeing what was on his laptop screen schiff gave him a smile that would have frozen hot chocolate roscoe looked around the auditorium and saw mostly what he expected to see there was a narrow stage holding a podium bearing the presidential seal against the curtain at the rear of the stage was a sea of american flags plus the cia flag those of the vice president of the united states the secretary of state the director of national intelligence the director of the central intelligence agency and two red flags one with four silver stars on it and one with three to the left and right of the stage and in the rear of the auditorium still and video cameramenplus half a dozen guys whatever they were called manipulating microphone boomswere crowded together preparing to send the images and sounds of the conference around the world and there was something roscoe was surprised to see a detachment of the rd infantrythe old guarddrum and bugle corps wearing revolutionary war uniforms the detachment was lined up without much room to spare to the left of the stage between the stage and the cameramen roscoe had just enough time to wonder about themthey had never been involved in a presidential press conference that he could rememberwhen the lights dimmed twice as a signal that something was about to begin the lights went upreally up to provide lighting for the camerasand a line of people filed onto the stage vice president charles w montvale came first followed by secretary of state natalie cohen montvale took up a position immediately behind the podium where he would be on the right of the president when he appeared and cohen took up a position to the left of the podium next came truman ellsworth the director of national intelligence and then a franklin lammelle the director of the central intelligence agency and finally generals naylor and mcnab they took up positions to the left and right of the podium presidential press secretary john david porky parker stepped to the podium and announced ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states everybody stood there came a roll of drums and the sound of fifes playing hail to the chief president clendennen marched purposefully onto the stage he was a short pudgy paleskinned fiftytwoyearold alabaman who kept his tiny ears hidden under a full head of silver hair as he marched past the dignitaries just how short he was momentarily was made clear he was shorter than even natalie cohen then he reached the podium and stepped onto a hidden platform that made him appear taller than everybody good morning the president said thank you for coming danton grunted softly good morning shorty wouldnt have missed it for the world the presidents voice was deep and resonant ill give him that he sounds like what people want a president to sound like and when hes standing on his little stool he looks presidential most of you the president began thanks to the zealous perhaps too zealousreporting of a distinguished journalist writing for one of our more distinguished newspapers are aware of a tragic incident that took place yesterday in mexico three of our fellow americans were found shot to death a fourth american is missing and who were these people did they have names what were they doing in mexico let me begin by stating that i have no more sacred duty as president and commander in chief than the protection of the lives of my fellow citizens wherever they might be aside from not getting impeached and maybe even getting reelected and let me confess as zeke clendennen private citizen that i am as outraged as anyone in our great nation about what happened outside acapulco yesterday i really understand and sympathize with those who thinkas did one of andy mcclarrens guests last night on the straight scoopthat we should send in the marines as we did to veracruz in and teach them a lesson they wont soon forget sure you do zeke but i am no longer zeke clendennen private citizen and as president and commander in chief i have a responsibility to our great nation as a whole there are parallelsas im sure you all knowbetween what happened yesterday near acapulco and what happened in tampico in most of the clowns in the white house press corps have no idea what happened in tampico or for that matter where it is and there are considerable differences no shit give me a forinstance zeke the nine american sailors arrested in mexico in were not arrested by a legitimate mexican government but by a mexican dictator a selfappointed general victoriano huerta president woodrow wilson publicly referred to huerta as false sly full of bravado seldom sober always irresponsible and a scoundrel it should go without saying that the united states did not recognize dictator huerta or his socalled government then how come we recognize hugo chavez isnt he a dictator whos false sly full of bravado seldom sober always irresponsible and a scoundrel the exact opposite situation exists in mexico today the president of the united mexican states my close personal friend ramon martinez a close friend zeke like those guys in matamoros who grab your arm and ask hey gringo you wanna fook my seester is a statesman recognized around the world for his lifelong dedication to the principles of freedom and honesty in government when this terrible incident of yesterday came to president martinezs attention the first thing he did was send a senior officer from the mexican foreign ministry to our embassy in mexico city to inform our ambassador then he called his good friend in the white househe calls me zeketo tell me what had happened and to apologize to the american people for what had happened he gave me his word officially and as a friend that he and every branch of the government of mexico will do everything possible not only to apprehend and quickly bring to justice those responsible for the deaths of our fellow citizens but to locate and safely return the missing officer to his family frankly zeke i am not holding my breath from what i saw in mexico every other cop is on the payroll of one of the drug cartels castillo even boughtfrom the damn federalesa black hawk the us gave them to help fight the drug cartels charley used it to fly us onto the island i wonder what happened to the black hawk after we flew it back to the uss bataan charley said that when the bataan got back to norfolk they should say nothing just unload the helo onto the wharf then let the mexican ambassador explain how it got there after the mexican government had told us it had been totally destroyed fighting the drug cartels i cant believe natalie cohen would go along with that but i thought it was a great idea we came very close in to going to war with mexico again im sure you will recall zeke that we also had one with them in you know like the marines sing from the halls of montezuma and we came close as you all know to war recently our late and beloved president faced with a very difficult choice decided it was his duty as commander in chief of our nation to launch a preemptive strike on what he believed was a factory in the congo manufacturing a dangerous substance that could have been used against us what he believed was a factory in the congo manufacturing a dangerous substance that could have been used against us where did your late and beloved predecessor get a wild idea like that was he supposed to take the word of the guy who runs our biological warfare lab and personally go to the congo to have a look like every other patriotic american i fully supportedperhaps even cheeredhis courageous decision i seem to recall you saying in front of a microphone you thought had been turned off that it was idiotic and reckless and then when god in his infinite wisdom took our commander in chief from us and i found myself in that role i came to understand how difficult the decision he had taken was for him where the hell are you going now mr president the president was a wise and knowledgeable man more than anyone else he knew how close his decision would bring us to a nuclear war and he knew full well that could have meant the end of the world i came out of my study my appreciation of what the president had done with two things first an even deeper admiration of his wisdom and character than i had had and second an awareness that i was ill equipped to step into his empty shoes and that without gods help i simply could not do so zeke baby you finally said something i agree with so i ask you my fellow americans to pray for me pray to god to give me the wisdom and the courage that he gave to our late commander in chief pray to god that when another problem challenges our country he will give me the strength to not act impulsively but rather with tempered wisdom i hate to tell you this zeke but getting god to give you tempered wisdoms going to take a lot of praying i was informed just before i came up here that there are matters requiring my immediate attention at the white house so i will not be able to take questions the vice president and others here with me today will answer any questions you may have thank you god bless you god bless the united states of america the president then stepped from behind the podium and walked quickly to the edge of the stage and down a shallow flight of stairs what the hell thats it before you take off zeke youre supposed to wait until one of your pals in the press corps cued by porky parker cuts off the conference by saying thank you mr president the cameras followed the president and recorded porky parker as he fended off the white house press corps as they shouted questions and tried to get close to the president roscoe looked at the stage and saw on the faces of the assembled dignitaries that they were as surprised by president clendennens sudden departure as he was secret service agents and the cia police kept the press corps from chasing the president and porky into the corridor the chasing press and those who hadnt chased the president now turned their attention to the podium and the podium was empty the dignitaries looked at one another in visible confusion until finally both dci a franklin lammelle and vice president charles w montvale at once began heading for the podium lammelle deferred to the vice president and stepped back into line montvale stepped to the podium and was under immediate assault by shouts of mr vice president from the press corps danton shook his head at the sight of the melee and thought this has turned into a chinese clusterfuck when everybody has calmed down vice president montvale began and then stopped when he realized his microphones were not working and his voice could not be heard over the shouts asking for his attention he first looked at the microphones in front of him for a switch and then finding none bent to look behind the podium to see if he could find a switch there lammelle broke ranks again and went to the podium to help unbelievable danton thought unfuckingbelievable cia functionaries uniformed and in suits came to the stage and the podium to help a moment later there came a piercing electronic scream quickly followed by a full volume broadcast of the vice presidents voice saying oh shit this served to almost quiet the room as the president has left the building the vice presidents voice came over the loudspeakers this press conference is over thats elvis has left the building montvale the vice president then stepped away from the podium and walked briskly off the stage the other dignitaries quickly followed him cia functionaries kept the press away from them the cia cant even make their microphone work and since this farce is on eleven zillion television sets around the world wait a minute im missing something here what the hell the glistening sikorsky vh white hawk helicopter known as marine one when carrying the president was waiting for the president beside the cia headquarters building supervisory secret service agent robert j mulligan a tall and stocky fortyfiveyearold came out of the building and quickly checked to see that everythingother secret service agents a fire engine and an ambulancewas as it should be and then signaled to the president that he was free to board marine one mulligan had been on vice president clendennens security detail but as one of the agents not as the supervisory special agent in charge when clendennen had suddenly become the president he announced he wanted mulligan to head his security detail when it had beenvery tactfullypointed out to president clendennen that there already was a supervisory agent in charge of the presidential security detail the president had replied i dont want to argue about this mulligan will do it got it president clendennen trailed by porky parker walked quickly to the white hawk and climbed aboard failing to acknowledge the salute of the marine in dress blues standing by the stair door mulligan quickly followed and reached for the switch that would close the stair door leave it open the president ordered and turn on the tv the screen showed the stage of auditorium three above a moving legend on the bottom wolf news breaking news the presidential press conference at cia headquarters langley va the image was of assorted people including the vice president trying to do something about the nonfunctioning microphone the voice of vice president montvale crying oh shit filled the passenger compartment of marine one oh shit presidential press secretary parker said softly the wolf news camera now turned to the vip journalists in the frontrow seats finally settling on c harry whelan jr who was shaking his head in disbelief the voice of the vice president announced as the president has left the building this press conference is over the camera quickly shifted to the podium just in time to see the vice president march away from it then it shifted to a shot of the dignitaries quickly hurrying after him mr president i have no idea what happened porky parker said but im sorry you should be the president said i never thought you had what it takes to be the presidents press secretary excuse me youre fired porky get off my helicopter what when i get back to the white house i will announce that i have accepted your resignation mr president i was in no way responsible for nobodys likely to believe that are they porky now get off my goddamn helicopter parker went to the door and down the door stairs mulligan threw the switch that caused the door stairs to retract well that took care of that disloyal sonofabitch didnt it bob the president asked i thought that everything went very well mr president mulligan said i owe you one the president said he pointed toward the cockpit tell him to get us out of here iii one auditorium three cia headquarters mclean virginia april roscoe j danton had decided without really thinking about it that he was going to have to write a think piece about this clusterfuck rather than just covering it other people simple reporters would cover the story but he was after all a syndicated columnist of the washington timespost writers syndicate his readers expected more of him his biography on the timespost website written by some eagereyed journalist fresh from the columbia school of journalism said mr danton joined the timespost immediately after his service in the us marine corps that was true though it hadnt happened quite the way it sounded roscoe had been a marine he had joined the corps at seventeen immediately after graduating from high school after boot camp at the marine corps recruit depot at parris island south carolina he had been transferred to camp pendleton california a week after arriving at camp pendleton a forklift had dropped a pallet of mm artillery ammunition on his left foot during landing exercises on the camp pendleton beach two months after that pfc roscoe j danton had been medically retired from the marine corps with a percent disability he returned to his home in chevy chase maryland and entered george washington university as a candidate for a degree in political science he also secured parttime employment as a copy boy at the washington timespost by the time he graduated from george washington he had acquired a fiancea childhood friend he had known since they were in third gradeand decided he had found his niche in life journalism this latter conclusion had been based on his somewhat immodest conclusion that he was smarter than threefourths of the journalists for whom he had been fetching coffee in the newsroom this opinion was apparently shared by the powersthatwere in the executive offices of the timespost who hired him as a fulltime reporter shortly after he graduated from george washington he married miss elizabeth warner two months later shortly after she found herself in the family way by the time roscoe j danton jr aged five was presented with a baby brotherwarner james dantonroscoe j danton had not only grown used to seeing his byline in the rag but had become one of the youngest reporters ever to flaunt the credentials of a member of the white house press corps things were not going well at home however elizabeth warner danton ultimately announced that she had had quite enough of his behavior you have humiliated me for the last time roscoe by showing up at church functions lateif you show up at alland reeking of alcohol make up your mind roscoe its either your drinking and carousing or your family after giving the ultimatum some thought roscoe had moved into the watergate apartments he concluded perhaps selfishly that there wasnt much of a choice between the interesting people with whom he associated professionally in various watering holes and the middlelevel bureaucrats with whom elizabeth expected him to associate socially at saint andrews presbyterian church in chevy chase alimony and child support posed a hell of a financial problem of course but he had a generous and usually unchecked expense account and legions of lobbyists were more than pleased to pick up his tabs at the better restaurants around town and with the lone exception of what divorce does to kids hed many times decided hed made the right decision and rising to being a syndicated columnist for the washington timespost writers syndicate was just one example now roscoe understood that if he was going to write a think piece on the clusterfuck he was going to have to find out how it had happened and the way to do that was get to presidential spokesman john david parker before ol porky returned from seeing the president off to reestablish some order and decorum roscoe quickly got out of his seat and left auditorium three he found parker almost immediately porky was leaning against the corridor wall just outside auditorium three looking roscoe thought more than a little dazed hes probably thinking hell soon have to face the famed wrath of joshua ezekiel clendennen dare i hope to have a moment of time with my favorite presidential spokesman make that expresidential spokesman parker replied you got canned over that royal screwup so soon parker nodded they wouldnt even let me back in there parker said nodding toward the uniformed cia security people standing outside the door to auditorium three and now you need a ride back to our nations capital right parker considered that a moment and then said yeah i guess i do you have a car indeed i do come on lets get out of here roscoe just then changed his mind about covering this story as a think piece the head wrote itselfpresidential spokesman firedand he had already composed the obvious lead in an exclusive interview with this reporter former presidential spokesman john david parker told it was almost sure to make page one above the fold the thing i have to do now is keep the rest of the media boys and girls away from him the lincoln town car with edgar delchamps at the wheel was parked very close to the entrance of the garage in a slot that a neatly lettered sign announced was reserved for assistant deputy director nussbaum i wonder if delchamps told the guard his name was nussbaum or whether the guard recognized delchamps and having heard the icepickintheear story decided that the agency dinosaur could park anywhere he chose to roscoe ushered parker into the backseat of the car and slid in beside him get us out of here roscoe ordered what the hell happened in there delchamps asked we watched it on the brick my pal is about to tell us john say hello to edgar and twogun i thought you looked familiar mr parker twogun said turning in the seat to offer his hand so the president said when i get back to the white house i will announce that i have accepted your resignation now get off my goddamn helicopter and i did parker finished and when you went back in the building they wouldnt let you in the auditorium david yung asked they even took my id badge parker said i dont suppose anyone cares what i think delchamps said but just off the top of my head roscoe i think your pal was set up otherwise the security guys wouldnt have been waiting for you to take your id badge so what do i do now parker asked and then answered his own question go back to my apartment and lick my wounds i guess if you go back to your apartment the press will be there for your version of what happened roscoe said and until we figure this out no matter what you tell them youre going to look like an incompetent who got fired for cause or a disgruntled former employee saying unkindand frankly hard to believethings about our beloved president or both probably both and i wont have a story so what do i do parker asked again when in doubt find a hole and hunker down until things calm down delchamps said go to a hotel or something parker asked or something roscoe is brother parker really a pal of yours hes a pal of mine roscoe declared did i say that because porky is a good guy whos always been straight with me or because i can see my story getting lost problem solved delchamps announced meaning what roscoe asked youll see two west boulevard drive alexandria virginia april the house which was large and could be described as a colonial mansion sat on an acre of manicured lawn well off west boulevard drive the landscaping on a grasscovered risea bermin the lawn prevented anyone driving by from getting a good look at the front door of the house there was a neat castbronze sign just inside the first of two fences lorimer manor assisted living no soliciting the first fence was made of fivefoothigh white pickets hidden on the pickets were small cameras and both audio and motion sensors the second fence closer to the house was of cast iron eight feet tall and also held surveillance cameras and motion sensors every twenty feet there were floodlights as edgar delchamps steered the town car up the drive a herd of caninesif herd is the proper term to describe a collection of six enormous jetblack bouviers des flandrescame charging around the side of the house they waited patiently for the substantial gate to open then when the lincoln rolled past they followed it gamboling happily like so many outsize black lambs whats with the dogs porky parker asked clinical studies have shown that having access to dogs provides a number of benefits to elderly people so we use them in our geriatric services program twogun yung replied that makes them deductible you have no idea how much it costs to feed those big bastards they also serve to deter the curious edgar delchamps added he stopped the lincoln before a fourdoor garage pulling it alongside one of the two black gmc yukons parked there everyone got out of the town car as one of the garage doors rolled upward a grandmotherly type in her early fifties appeared at a door in the rear of the garage her name was dianne sanders and she was listed on the payroll of lorimer manor inc as resident housekeeper the herd of bouviers des flandres gamboled on toward her she put her fingers to her lips and whistled shrilly the dogs stopped as if they had encountered a glass wall go chase a cat mrs sanders ordered sternly pointing out the garage door reluctantly but obediently the herd slowly walked out of the garage she looked at delchamps and said am i supposed to pretend i dont know who your friends are in addition to inside plumbing lorimer manor offers television think of that one delchamps said pointing at parker as a lonely stranger desperately needing the hospitality of friends and also some lunch if thats possible i thought you knew roscoe only by reputation she said you know hes one of us yung said i heard and now that you know that mr parker yung said well have to kill you oh jesus here we go again porky will go bananas may i ask whats going on here parker asked what is this place of course you can ask but as twogun just said what you know can get you killed delchamps said he smiled then added well lets go get some lunch in the house parker looked around plateglass windows across the back wall offered a view of an enormous grassy area there was a croquet field and a cabana with a grill beside an enormous inground swimming pool two of the bouviers their red tongues hanging and their stub tails wagging were looking in through one of the plateglass windows the rest of the herd was chasing birds on the grass and parker noted the residents first he saw four elderly men two in wheelchairs three of whom looking roughly as old as edgar delchamps there also was a very largesixfoottwo pound and very black man wearing aviator sunglasses who appeared to be in his late thirties and a woman who looked about sixty she had a chrome walker next to her chair at a large dining table that was covered with food in the center of the table was a centerpiece two dinosaurs each about two feet long faced each other there was a pink bow around the neck of one of them i think everybody knows who mr parker is delchamps announced to the residents everybody nodded he wants to know whats going on here delchamps said what this place is can i tell him is he a friend one of the men in a wheelchair asked roscoe vouches for him delchamps said and roscoein case you didnt knowis one of us in that case tell him sure tell him why not the elderly lady added as long as he understands that if he runs at the mouth oh no danton thought not the old woman too well have to kill him another of the men about delchampss age pointed at the centerpiece of dinosaurs and said that should make it quite obvious mr parker this is where us old dinosaurs come to die there were grunts and then came what appeared to parker and danton to be a regular war of words among the residents oh shit there he goes again with that crap jesus christ mac will you knock off with that cometodie nonsense speak for yourself john alden youve always let me have a shot at this dianne sanders interrupted mr parker everybody in this roomexcept those two and meis retired from the company she pointed to the enormous black man and to a man who looked to be in his late forties thats dick miller and tom my husband they used to run around the block with charley castillo and general mcnab until the army decided they were no longer able to play rambo and medically retired them i was a cryptographer and took my retirement too then came the glory days of the office of organizational analysis you both know what that was parker and danton nodded charley needed a safe house here and ooa bought this then uncle remusyou know who he is roscoe danton knew that uncle remus was the politically incorrectand some suggested racistname that only his close friends could call chief warrant officer colin leverette us army retired danton nodded porky shook his head hes the guy who took colonel hamilton to the fish farm in the congo delchamps clarified one of the better snake eaters tom sanders further clarified dianne and i were in our happy exciting retirement in fayetteville watching the mildew grow in the bathtub when uncle remus showed up and asked if wed be interested in running this place we were on the next plane up here then we thought wed be out of a job when ooa was broken up dianne picked up but when edgar said he needed a place to live now that he was retired he moved in as a temporary measure and then the other dinosaurs started moving in one by one the elderly lady offered we were scattered all around dc i was in the silver oaks methodist episcopal ladies retirement community in silver spring you can imagine how much i had in common with the ladies there so youre also retired from the cia danton asked thirtyfour years in the clandestine service she said with quiet pride dinosaurs porky parker asked thats what they call us at langley the elderly lady said we still believe that the only good communist is a dead communist so were dinosaurs to them and so one of the men in a wheelchair said with the not inconsiderable help of twogun we formed lorimer manor inc and bought this place from the lorimer charitable and benevolent trust when one of castillos merry outlaws needs to use a safe houseedgar twogun and gimpy stayed here last night for examplewe send a bill to the lcbf corporation gimpy danton thought must be the big black guy in the aviator sunglasses whats the lcbf corporation he asked thats whos going to pay you your combat pay roscoe delchamps said porky parkers eyebrows rose at that think of it as our basic corporate structure twogun amplified providing complete financial services to our little community all right david the elderly lady said a little impatiently now its your turn what the hell happened at langley this morning and so the president told me he was accepting my resignation and to get off his goddamn helicopter and then i ran into roscoe and he brought me here porky parker concluded i said and you all heard me one of the middleaged men said that there was something phony about that failed microphone what is that sonofabitch up to the elderly lady asked softly i have no idea parker said my question is what do i do now you stay out of sight delchamps said i already told you that maybe go to mexico with us youve got your passport my official passport is in my briefcase with my laptop parker said the last time i saw it was when i asked one of the secret service guys to watch it for me backstage in auditorium three i hoped you kissed itthem the passport and laptopgoodbye delchamps said my regular passport is in my apartment parker said outside of which members of the media can be counted on sitting roscoe said burning with desire to hear your version of your surprising and sudden departure from distinguished government service which will also screw up my exclusive interview with porky there was a buzzing sound our masters voice dick miller said as he took a caseyberry from his pocket and put it to his ear how nice of you to call he went on i just put you on conference charley roscoe saw delchamps and yung quickly put their caseyberrys to their ears he took out his own found the conf button and pushed it i didnt call to chat gimpy castillos voice announced i called hoping to hear that edgar has roscoe in the bag and that youre about to go wheelsup better yet that youre already in the air danton made a face roscoe in the bag what the hell does that mean ace roscoe is in the bag delchamps said what the hell are they talking about and he brought mr john david parker with him delchamps continued what the hell is that all about castillo said roscoe would you be so kind as to tell our leader what the hell thats all about the press is looking for him danton said why right about now the president is going to announce hes accepted his resignation danton replied because of that fuckedup press conference yes but porky didnt fuck it up danton said after a moment castillo replied got it and you arewhat is it you say chasing the story thats right so what are you planning to do with mr parker were trying to figure that out charley is mr parker also trying to evade the press roscoe or do you have him in handcuffs he doesnt want to see them either okay so bring him down here castillo said what bring him down here well work it out later castillo said got it edgar jawohl mein fuhrer delchamps barked spare me the sarcasm castillo said just call me when youre wheelsup i need roscoe and the mustang down here yesterday he needs me what the hell for and wheres down here jawohl mein fuhrer delchamps repeated a moment later roscoe seeing that everyone had taken their caseyberrys from their ears turned his off where is down here danton asked cozumel yung replied danton looked at him and thought if he says and now that you know that ill have to kill you ill throw this goddamn phone at him and he wants me to go down there danton asked incredulously yung looked at delchamps and said small problem mr parker doesnt have his passport i dont have my passport either danton said catch roscoe delchamps said and when danton looked at him delchamps tossed him a passport weve been through the i dont have my passport routine with you before delchamps said this was locked in my desk yes it was delchamps said what do i need my passport for parker said i dont want to go to cozumel i dont even know where that is not far from cancun on the yucatan peninsula yung furnished whats going on there parker asked your call mr parker delchamps said well drop you anywhere you want on our way to the airport john danton suggested reasonably going to cozumel would get you out of sight for a couple of days parker considered that for a moment and then shrugged why not he said finally i dont have any other clever ideas at the moment danton nodded and thought great for a couple of days ill have you all to myself back to mr parkers passport problem yung said where do you live mr parker the elderly lady asked the verizon its at seventh northwest i know where it is she said no problem twogun you take your friends to bwi by the time gimpy has the rubber bands on the citation wound up well meet you with mr parkers passport and a quick change of linen how are you going to get into my apartment past the press getting into your apartment would be easier mr parker if you gave me the keys she said as far as the press is concerned its been my experience that they pay very little attention to little old ladies who use a walker especially little old ladies being helped into a building by a kindly member of the clergyand accompanied by a snarling hundredtwentypound dog where are you going to get the kindly clergyman roscoe asked tom sanders stood he motioned with his right hand to form a cross then said bless you my children go and sin no more and just as soon as i get my clerical collar on and load one of the dogs into a yukon we can get this show on the road three the tahitian suite grand cozumel beach and golf resort cozumel mexico april vic dalessandro whose barrel chest and upper arms strained his shortsleeved floralprint hawaiian shirt walked onto the balcony of the penthouse suite and announced jesus it must be nice to be rich its way ahead of whatevers in second place vic fernando lopez said agreeably write that down lopez a very large man with a dark complexion was sprawled on a chaise longue with a bottle of dos equis on his chest he raised his right arm over his head without turning and offered his hand dalessandro walked to him and shook it castillo got off his chaise longue and walked to dalessandro they wordlessly embraced max sat on his haunches and thrust his paw repeatedly at dalessandro until dalessandro shook it lester bradley stood behind castillo hey dead eye dalessandro said its good to see you sir bradley said aleksandr pevsner tom barlow and stefan koussevitzky sitting on chaise longues in the shade of a striped awning stood dalessandro nodded to them then went over and offered his hand good to see you mr pevsner dalessandro said and you mr dalessandro pevsner replied this is our friend stefan koussevitzky you can be nice to stefan vic castillo called you guys went to different snakeeating schools i know you by reputation mr dalessandro koussevitzky said im pleased to meet you youre the guy who sweaty shot on that island right and call me vic koussevitzky smiled and nodded i was one of them she also shot general sirinov in the foot fortunately mine was a minor flesh wound in the leg with a thirtytwo fortunately for stefan svetlana always liked him tom barlow said she was never at all fond of the general so where is charleys redhead dalessandro asked shes having a bikini wax she should be up in a minute in her bikini castillo said lester why dont you get vic a dos equis after which he can tell us all about acapulco lester dalessandro said why dont you get your old uncle vic a double of that jack daniels yes sir dalessandro slid onto a chaise longue in the shade of the striped awning and sat on it is everybody familiar with the official version the message ambassador mccann sent to secretary of state cohen he began which she passed to roscoe danton giving him his scoop castillo said yeah vic were all familiar with that our guys in acapulcotheres threeand the dea guys there think that what happened is ferriss suburban was stopped by a roadblock manned by either federales or people wearing federales uniforms they got talked out of the suburban and the bad guys whacked everybody but ferris then they loaded ferris back into the suburban and took off for god knows where or god knows why supporting this theory is that ferris and danny salazarespecially dannyhad been around the block more than once had either ms or cars with them and would have offered some pretty skilled resistance to an ambush why wouldnt ferrisand again especially dannybe suspicious of a federales roadblock because they had good relations with the federales good relations being defined as sharing intelligence with them which is further defined as they tell us only what they want us to know and we tell them everything we know which they promptly pass to the drug cartels that bad huh castillo asked and ferris went along with this how well do you know jim ferris charley castillo shrugged not well ive seen him around people who know him well seem to respect him including me dalessandro said hes a hell of a teacher probably the best we have but you and ferris are different in several ways charley first youd be a lousy teacher youd also be a lousy instructor and theres a difference probably castillo admitted which mcnab being aware of this is why you never found yourself at mccall teaching snake eating to a class of wouldbe green beanies i always thought it was the press of my other duties castillo said sarcastically no it was because mcnab knewand i knew and uncle remus knewthat you would set a lousy example for the new guys you ever actually eat a snake charley no and i never bit the head off a live chicken running around in the hurlburt field swamps either castillo said butthe proof being youre still aliveyou performed satisfactorily in the real world huh and have all those medals to prove it where the hell are you going with this vic castillo asked more than a little testily you wanted to know who jim ferris is im telling you hes almost exactly your opposite he caught killed and ate snakes because thats what he was ordered to do and he taught a whole bunch of people to obey orders and eat snakes too you went into the swamps at hurlburt with two pounds of highprotein bars taped to your legs because you heard snake would be on the menu the point being that when jim ferris came down here he obeyed his orders from the ambassador to cooperate with the mexicans he argued with both ambassador mccann and the ambassador before mccann but he obeyed his orders what you would have said charley is screw this i was sent down here to get the drug guys and thats what im going to do castillo who did not look as if he took offense to that then said so youre suggesting the drug cartel had no reason to whack anybody because ferriss people werent causing them any trouble yeah and they must have known that killing three americans and kidnapping a fourth would bring a lot of attention tell me about the drug guys castillo said pacific coast operations are run by the sinaloa cartel which is headed by two guys joaquin guzman loera and ismael zambada garcia you ever hear of los zetas castillo shook his head loera and garcia needed a private army so they bought one they went to the mexican army and said if you come work for me bringing along the weapons the americans gave you i will pay you five times what the army has been paying you if you dont come we will kill you and rape your wives mothers and other female relatives shit castillo said these are really charming people charley and they have very deep pockets they have about a battalions worth of mexican soldiersofficers noncoms and privates and all the equipment we gave them los zetas are really bad guys charley and they could have been manning the roadblock either in mexican army uniforms or federales uniforms dalessandro answered which brings us back to why edgar thinks it had nothing to do with the drug cartels castillo said and alek agrees with him then what it has been suggested that mr putin on reflection has decided that an armistice is not the way for him to go tom barlow offered and that hes coming after svetlana and me again and after charley dalessandro added and me pevsner said not necessarily in that order jesus i guess i should have thought of that dalessandro said i will think about it now lester id think better after ive had a second taste of the jack daniels four cozumel international airport cozumel mexico april two glistening white yukons with the legend grand cozumel beach and golf resort painted on their doors and a much less elegant brown suburban with the insignia of mexican customs and immigration were waiting for the cessna mustang when the small twinengine jet was wanded to a parking spot john david parker was relieved to be on the ground not only had it been his first flight in a mustang until today he had thought that jet aircraft required the services of two pilots not only had there been but one pilotmajor dick miller us army retiredbut he had seen miller climb aboard the airplane at baltimore washington internationaland suddenly understood why they called him gimpy there clearly was something wrong with his left leg it didnt bend as knees are supposed to surprising parker not a little moments after miller had boarded the airplane the grayhaired elderly lady and the reverend father tom sanders had shown up with his passport as promised they had even packed a small bag with a change of linen and his toilet kit three minutes later they were airborne the trip was uneventful they went through immigration at new orleanss louis armstrong international airport and then flew across the gulf of mexico two men got out of each yukon one of thema burly fairskinned man wearing shorts kneehigh stockings and a white jacket with the logotype of the grand cozumel beach and golf resort on the chestcame onto the airplane as soon as the stair door was opened the man shook edgar delchampss hand and said something in russian hand him your passports as you get off delchamps ordered hell take care of the formalities it was a fiveminute ride from the airport to the grand cozumel which turned out to be an enormous luxury resort complex at the center of which was a twentyoddstory building surrounded by smaller buildings there were two golf courses acres of tennis courts and fronting the wide white sand beach lines of individual cottages parker was not surprised that the entire property was enclosed within a substantial fence but when they reached the main building and went down a ramp to an underground garage he was surprised at the steel barriers that were hydraulically lowered as they reached them they looked exactly like the barriers at the white house through whichhe had been told and he believedan m abrams tank would have a hard time crashing there was a line of elevators delchamps led them all to one marked the tahitian suite in lieu of an updown button it had a keyboard and what looked like a small television screen or computer monitor when delchamps keyed in a series of numbers the screen lit up showing the outline of a hand a moment after delchamps placed his hand on the image there came a ping soundand the elevator door slid open he waved everybody onto the elevator there were no floor numbers on the elevator control panel just up and down arrows when delchamps pushed up the opening bars of the blue danube came over loudspeakers after just a faint sensation of movement the door slid open parker thought that was quick were probably only going to the second floor they were on a circular foyer off of which were eight closed doors and one open double door a burly man in a white jacketa twin of the man at the airportstood next to the open doors holding an uzi submachine gun along his leg he ran his eyes among the elevator passengers and then sat down delchamps walked to and through the open doors with the others following him parker confused for a moment saw that rather than being on the second floor they were on a very high floor they were in a large room there were six men two were playing chess while a thirda very young man almost a boywatched a fourth was reading a spanishlanguage newspaper and a fifth was reading the wall street journal the sixth was working at a laptop computer on a glasstopped coffee table through wide plateglass doors parker saw two more menone of them a very large obviously latino man and the other a goodlooking sixfoot fairskinned man in his late thirties who looked americanhoist themselves nimbly out of a swimming pool and start to towel themselves dry a huge black dog like the ones at lorimer manor came trotting around the side of the pool with a white soccer ball in his mouth he dropped it at the feet of the swimmers and then shook himself dry it produced an explosion of water what the hell is it with these dogs a stunningly beautiful redheaded woman wearing a transparent flaming yellow jacket over a matching bikinitogether the garments left only negligible anatomical details to the imaginationrose gracefully from a chaise longue next to the pool and marched up to roscoe danton she gave him a little hug and offered her cheek for him to kiss then she put out her hand to porky and announced im sweaty welcome to cozumel what can i get you to drink that has to be a name parker decided because she damn sure doesnt smell sweaty she smells as if she just took a bath in the most expensive of perfumes chanel et cie has to offer ill be almost pathetically grateful for anything with alcohol in it porky said a whitejacketed waiter suddenly appeared scotch double rocks porky ordered twice roscoe said i dont think ordering a double scotch was the smart thing for me to do porky thought the last thing i need to do when i have to do some serious thinking is get bombed not only do i not know what im doing here im not even sure where the hell here is well gimpy i see you managed to cheat death once again the swimmer parker thought of as the american said please tell me you didnt bend my nice new bird gimpy gave the american the finger the american walked up to parker welcome to cozumel mr parker youre just in time for an argentine bife de chorizo which i believe loosely translates from spanish as food for the gods im charley castillo parker knew a good deal about charley castillo but this was the first time hed ever seen him up close and he was surprised at what he saw it showed on his face parker thought as a matter of fact the only time ive ever seen him at all was on television when he and the other guy whod stolen that tupelov airplane walked off it at andrews air force base i guessbecause of that castillo name and because hes a mexicanamericani expected if not zorro then that mexicanamerican actor antonio bandana or whatever the hell his name is this guy has blue eyes and lighter skin than mine and damn sure doesnt look like a super spook capable of stealing a russian airplane right from under hugo chavezs nose or for that matter stealing two russian defectors from the cia station chief in vienna oh jesus thats who the redhead is the russian defector the former svr rezident in copenhagen who president clendennen had been willinghell been trying desperatelyto swap to the russians something wrong castillo asked no i guess im a little shook up by everything thats happened the waiter put a glass in his hand and porky took a healthy swallow castillo gave his hand to danton thank you for coming roscoe he said i know its inconvenient but its important anytime charley danton replied he added mentally i always try to oblige people who are going to give me a million dollars and its not as if i had much of a choice is it mr parker can i call you porky castillo said john david parkerwho loathed being called porkyheard himself saying certainly castillo nodded then went on porky you ever hear what happens in las vegas stays in las vegas that applies here in spades you take my meaning i think so parker said roscoe thought porky took his meaning all right castillo didnt have to say otherwise well have to kill you porky figured that out all by himself okay castillo said introductions are in order youve met sweaty he pointed at a man who looked very much like himself thats her brother tom barlow and their cousin aleksandr pevsner and their uncle nicolai tarasovthey answer to alek and nick the fellow watching porn on his laptop is vic dalessandro dalessandro without raising his head from the laptop gave castillo the finger and thats my cousin fernando lopez thats stefancall him stevekoussevitzky and last but certainly not least gunnery sergeant lester bradley usmc retired roscoe knew who stefan koussevitzky was the last time he had seen him was on the island he then had been wearing the uniform of a spetsnaz major about the last picture roscoe had taken on the island as the tupelov taxied to the runway was one of koussevitzky sitting on the ground against a hangar wall applying a compress to his bloody leg sweaty had shot him with her tiny colt automatic how did he get here and what the hell is he doing here a man wearing chef s whites appeared at the door to the swimming pool and said something in what porky recognized as russian castillo then announced thats russian for the steaks are done and gestured for everybody to go onto the balcony a long banquet table had been set up around the corner of the building the man with the chefs hat and two whitejacketed waiters were lined up next to it there was a large charcoal grill against the balcony railing and a table loaded with bottles of wine against the building wall castillo took a seat at one end of the table and alek pevsner at the other sweaty sat at one side of castillo and delchamps sat across from her pevsner had tom barlow on one side of him and uncle nicolai tarasov on the other after everyone else filled the seats between the waiters stood ready to pour the wine pevsner picked up his glass took a large sip nodded his head as a signal to the waiter that it met his approval and then watched as the waiter emptied the bottle between his uncle nicolais and tom barlows glasses much the same thing happened elsewhere at the table then pevsner made an announcement or gave an order that surprisedperhaps startledboth roscoe and porky let us pray he said folding his hands piously before him closing his eyes and bowing his head he prayed in english dear lord and father of mankind we thank you for the bounty we are about to receive we thank you for the continued good health and safety of our families roscoe had a somewhat irreverent thought he sounds as if hes having a conversation with a friend who happens to be the almighty and our beloved friends we ask that you permit us to assist the archangel michael and the blessed saint george in their and your holy war against satan his wicked works and his followers we ask their and your help in rescuing whats his name again karl ferris colonel james d ferris castillo furnished colonel james ferris from the evil men who hold him for satans evil purposes and we ask that those who are about to do battle in thy name to this end be given the courage of saint george this we ask in the name of thy son our lord and savior jesus christ amen there was a chorus of amens what the hell was that all about both porky and roscoe thought more or less simultaneously pevsner went on now icily angry where the hell are the shrimp cocktails he then switched to russian and apparently repeated what he had said in english for both waiters hurried inside the building and quickly returned with trays of shrimp cocktails it doesnt get much better than this roscoe castillo announced the shrimp were floating around out therehe gestured toward the seanot six hours ago and the beef and the wine arrived with the exspetsnaz this morning from chile parker wondered with the what the exspetsnaz is that what he said charley why was it important that i come here roscoe asked id planned to get into this after dinner castillo replied but what the hell the thing is roscoe youre one hell of a reporter what is this soft soap from charley castillo watch yourself roscoe and i figured it was just a matter of time before you figured out that the kidnapping of colonel ferris and the whacking of the other three guys including my old friend daniel salazar probably has nothing to do with the drug trade and i wanted to ask you to hold off writing what you learned or intuited otherwise what otherwise well have to kill you do not pass go go directly to the cemetery and do not collect one million dollars are you going to explain that if its not connected with the drug trade whats it all about vladimir vladimirovich has a problem mr danton pevsner said who oh vladimir vladimirovich putin that and his ego is involved tom barlow said thats part of the problem pevsner agreed but his major problem is that everyone in the russian intelligence community and the diplomatic community and of course within the oprichnina within the what roscoe interrupted pevsner flashed him an icy glance and went on as if he hadnt heard the question is waiting for him to react he either reacts or what is carlos always saying there goes the old ball game reacts to what roscoe asked his gross underestimation of svetlana and her carlitos tom barlow said and laughed about sixteen months ago mr danton pevsner said vladimir vladimirovich thought he had the world by the tail the expression alek castillo interrupted is had the world by the balls delchamps chuckled pevsner glared at both of them and again went on as if he had not been interrupted but then a series of things went very wrong for him again quoting my friend charley cutting to the chase culminating in what happened two months ago roscoe quickly did the arithmetic and interrupted exactly two months ago today clendennen was persuaded to name montvale vice president is that what you mean this time pevsner chose to answer that had a bearing on it of course but what i was thinking of mr danton was what happened in the lobby bar of the mayflower hotel immediately before that happened dantons face showed his confusion pevsner went on there was a meeting there between sergei murov the svr rezident in washington and mr lammellewho later that morning would be appointed as head of the ciaand dmitri svetlana and charley the previous afternoon as you reported on wolf news charley landed a tupelov tua at andrews air force base on that pride of the russian air force were the last barrels of congox that vladimir vladimirovich and lieutenant general yakov sirinov had thanks to your journalistic discretion mr danton which we all deeply appreciate there was no mention of the congox or general sirinov either on wolf news or in the washington timespost but sergei murov of course knew about both and was thus naturally quite anxious to hear what mr lammelle and the others wished to say mr lammelle got right to the point he informed sergei that secretary of state natalie cohen had called the russian ambassador and told him that unless murov voluntarily gave up his post and returned to russia he would be declared persona non grata and expelled within fortyeight hours and i told him sweaty chimed in that when he left i had a little present for vladimir vladimirovich i wanted him to take with him a barrel of congox that had been rendered harmless and i also told him that if stefan koussevitzky and his family were not in budapest within seventytwo hours she would make sure castillo picked up the narrative laughing that every officer of the svr would know that what putin was doing behind closed doors when he was running the kgb in saint petersburg was write poetry for some reason i gather that saint petersburg poets are regarded with some suspicion visavis their sexual orientation tom barlow chuckled im not sure that pouring salt on an open wound was wise pevsner said i disagree nicolai said always press an advantage alek you know that and it worked koussevitzky said we were on our way to argentina via budapest the next day which caused you to decide that charleys offer of an armistice had been accepted pevsner said which we now know is not the case he let that sink in a moment and then went on it was a low point for vladimir vladimirovich mr danton he had dispatched general sirinov personally on the supersecret tua with the last stocks of congox confident that president clendennen would happily exchange svetlana dmitri and charley for the congox when sergeiwho had proposed the exchange to lammellewalked into the hotel bar to learn he was about to be declared persona non grata charleys march hare assault on hugo chavezs la orchila island had not only already taken the congoxand rendered it harmlessbut also had taken possession of the tua and taken general sirinov prisoner and under those circumstances aleksandr tom barlow said svetlana was right to rub salt in his wound and charley was right to propose the ceasefire and he accepted the ceasefire proposal didnt he pevsner countered sarcastically even going so far as to permit stefan and his family to leave russia unless of course he did that to lull us to sleep but according to your theory castillo said in our naivete we were already asleep so whats the hit and kidnapping all about wouldnt that wake us up i thought we were agreed charley pevsner said that we are all now wide awake touche castillo said i dont know about any of that charley vic dalessandro spoke up but everything i heard in acapulcocorrectionnothing i heard in acapulco makes me think danny and the others were whacked because they were causing the sinaloa cartel trouble so tom barlow said what do these peoplewhoever they arewant with this colonel ferris the last time we went down that road sweaty said we agreed well just have to wait and see on the other hand dalessandro said theres the possibilitywhich a couple of our guys your guys vic tom barlow said the special forces guys in acapulco as trainers dalessandro explained a couple of them suggested that they snatched colonel ferris to exchange him for somemaybe allof the sinaloa cartel guys we have in jail in the states and killed the others to make the point theyre willing to kill ferris if we dont go along castillo asked right thats possible vic delchamps said but i go along with alek i think his pal vladimir vladimirovich is behind this a prisoner swap may well be part of their game plan but my gut tells me theres more to it than that and do you agree with my suggestions as to how we should deal with the situation pevsner asked softly im a dinosaur alek you know that as well as what that means both parker and danton had sudden clear memories of what they had heard from the elderly lady with the walker at lorimer manor dinosaurs believe that the only good communist is a dead communist and you charley are you in agreement pevsner asked again softly it took a moment for castillo to frame his reply and then he said i would really have preferred the armistice but count me in of course this time danton thought theyre talking about killing people and this time theyre not kidding so as i understand our agreedupon plan we wait for vladimir vladimirovichs next move in the meantime putting in place certain precautions need i spell them out yeah you do castillo said just so everybody understands everybody else very well pevsner said i have already taken what precautions i think are called for here at the grand cozumel and in argentina what happened in acapulco might be a diversion and they might really start what theyre up to with me that said i agree with you charley that they probably are considering action against your grapefruit farm here or even against your familyespecially your grandmotherin the united states against that possibility the ten exspetsnaz stefan and i brought up this morning will be flown to the grapefruit farm at first light tomorrow by fernando and uncle nicolai once they are in place to hisand of course to fernandossatisfaction stefan will return here to handle the exspetsnaz another ten of them who will arrive on the peruairecargo flight the day after tomorrow fernando will stay at the grapefruit farm as long as he feels is necessary or return to the united states whichever he feels is best i will return to argentina tomorrow morning and see what if anything i can learn about vladimir vladimirovichs plans from my sources dmitri will stay here in the grand cozumel my instructions to the staff are that he speaks with my voice you and svetlana will go to san antonio to satisfy yourself about your grandmothers security pevsner met castillos eyes and added is that about it two things alek i dont care what you told your staff about tom he and everybody else are to understand that im calling the shots in mexico is that understood dmitri pevsner said is that satisfactory to you perfectly berezovsky replied but i wonder about you youre not used to asking anybody for permission to do anything i have given my word pevsner said thats good enough for me castillo said the agreement is that nobody takes any actionexcept in selfdefenseuntil it is discussed and agreed to by alek edgar dmitri and me and were all agreed right that that applies to snatching pavel koslov you know i dont agree with that sweaty said angrily we should grab him while we have the chance you made that point my love over and over and you were voted down they call that democracy her brother laughed whos pavel koslov danton asked the mexico city rezident delchamps furnished i think we ought to whack him tit for tat if he hurts colonel ferris but i agree with charley that snatching him now is not a very good idea castillo nodded then looked around and said is that it what do i tell mcnab charley dalessandro asked he said he wants to see me the minute i get back tell him everything castillo said i never lied to him before i dont want to start now and im certainly not going to ask you to withhold anything from him hes going to ask what youre going to want from him dalessandro said what do i tell him id like whatever intel he feels he can give me but aside from that im not going to need anything from the stockade except you of course got it uncle nicolai you about ready to fly vic to mexico city no ive been drinking but one of my pilots is standing by dalessandro walked around the table shaking hands and then disappeared past the sliding glass doors iv one office of the commanding general united states special operations command fort bragg north carolina april a substantial number of liaison officers was attached to the special operations command some of them were militaryfor example the liaison officers from the office of the chief of naval operations the office of the chief of staff usaf the commander in chief central command the defense intelligence agency and even the xviii airborne corps which commanded the physical assets of fort bragg as well as the nd and st airborne divisions there were also civilian liaison officers they included a state department liaison officer an fbi liaison officer and a cia liaison officer they all had staffs some of them as large as a dozen deputies and clerks the building in which they were housed was known jocularly as foggy bottom south others called it siberia most liaison officers felt that lieutenant general bruce j mcnab regarded them as spies for their superiors and that they were treated accordingly they rarely saw him in person after their first brief chat with him on their assignment they dealt with major general terrence otoole the specopscom deputy commander otoole had summoned charles d stevens the fbi liaison officer to his office two days before this is in connection with colonel ferris he said getting right to the point youre aware of the package the general received with ferriss photo stevens had nodded he knew about the fedex package he had learned of it through fbi channels not from anyone in specopscom neither the cia nor your laboratory at quantico was able to learn muchin fact anythingfrom it the fingerprints found on it were useless because it had passed through so many hands the general feels that the next communication from these people will come the same way that is via either fedex or ups he would like to get his hands on that package before it is handled by everybody and his idiot brother i understand general what the general would like to see the fbi do is to locate that package as soon as it enters the fedexups process the package would then be placed taking care to touch it as little as possible into another envelope and then sent on its way here do you think the fbi can handle that mr stevens the fbi will certainly try general the general feels that it is highly likely that the address on the package will be different from the address on the original package which itself was addressed to lieutenant colonel mcnab not lieutenant general mcnab probably to avoid undue attention so what you should be looking for is an overnight envelope addressed accordingly perhaps even addressed to someone in these headquarters not the general or to the home address of such people i understand the reasoning ill get right on it thank you keep me posted please fbi liaison officer stevens thought the chances of finding that envelope among the xmany million overnight envelopes that ups and fedex handle every day are right up there with my chances of being taken bodily into heaven this proved to be either unduly pessimistic or a gross underestimation of the enthusiasm with which employees of fedex or ups would respond to a request for assistance from the federal bureau of investigation fewer than twentyfour hours later stevens received a telephone call from the special agent in chargethe sacof the el paso fbi office william j johnson who happened to be an old friend im in the ups store in the sunland park mall in el paso chuck the sac said holdingvery carefully in my rubber glovesa ups overnighter addressed to sergeant terry otoole yadkin and reilly road fort bragg north carolina is this what youre looking for yadkin road and reilly street is known as generals row stevens said major general terrence otoole lives there next door to general mcnab say thank you bill the sac said you want me to open it thank you bill stevens said but dont open it general mcnab wants us to just put it into another envelope and send it on its way anyway i think opening it would be illegal two office of the commanding general united states special operations command fort bragg north carolina april lieutenant general bruce j mcnab wearing rubber gloves carefully opened the ups next day envelope and examined the two sheets of paper it contained vic dalessandro looked over his shoulder one of the sheets was a photograph of an unshaven lieutenant colonel james d ferris he was sitting on a chair holding a copy of the previous days el diario de el paso two men wearing balaclava masks stood beside him holding machetes this time its machetes dalessandro said is that an implied threat to behead him no more i would guess than the guy holding the kalashnikov the last time was an implied threat to blow his brains out mcnab said matteroffactly the second sheet of paper was the message so far hes still alive if you would be willing to return felix abrego to his family we would be willing to return colonel ferris to his place a classified ad in el diario de el paso as follows for the next four days always interested in mexican business opportunities write businessman po box el paso texas whos felix abrego i wonder mcnab said one of the drug guys we have in the slam seems likely dalessandro replied im sure the fbi will be able to tell us charley asked that you provide him with intel dalessandro said does this count as intel as you know lieutenant colonel castillo retired no longer has a security clearance mr dalessandro however i would suppose that one or more of his former associates in the special operations and intelligence communities would feel that the national security would not be seriously compromised if he somehow learned about this dalessandro nodded his understanding mcnab leaned forward and pulled the red telephone connected to the central command circuit toward himself he pushed and then the loudspeaker button there was the sound of three rings and then a somewhat metallic voice said general naylor bruce mcnab general i regret waking you at oh dark hundred but whats on your mind general the protocol requires that i immediately notify cinc centcom if something of this nature comes up and something has what have you got general there has been a second communication from the people who are holding colonel ferris this one was sent ups next day from el paso addressed to sergeant terry otoole it contained a photo of colonel ferris holding a copy of yesterdays el diario de el paso and a note offering to make an exchange for him shall i read it to you please mcnab did so who is felix whatever naylor asked we dont know as soon as i can get the fbi liaison officer in here im going to ask him to find out i would guess hes someone we have in prison probably naylor said this message reached you last night about fifteen minutes ago ups delivers at a little after ohfivehundred what i did general was ask the fbi to see if they could intercept any new messages as soon as they entered the ups or fedex systems and they were successful mr stevens the fbi liaison officer called last night to report that this message this envelope had been intercepted in el paso when it arrived in fayetteville vic dalessandro was waiting for it and what are your plans now general naylor asked what im planning to do general is first send you photocopies of the envelope and its contents then i intend to get the fbi liaison officer in here and turn the envelope and its contents over to him so that he can send it to the fbi experts in quantico i presume you will pass the photocopies of the envelope and its contents to the chief of staff who will presumably send copies to the secretary of defense the secretary of state the director of national intelligence et cetera and of course the office of the potus naylor interrupted yes of course we mustnt forget president clendennen must we spare me your sarcasm mcnab naylor snapped mcnab didnt reply directly after a moment he asked if i may continue general go on naylor said icily and that no further action by me is required at this time no further action is required of you that is correct thank you sir is there anything else sir naylor broke the connection without replying sometimes vic mcnab said as he reached for his brick and opened it as hard as this is to believe i dont think general naylor likes me very much he checked to see if the proper leds were glowing then pushed several buttons christ mcnab the voice of dci a franklin lammelle bounced off a satellite do you know what time it is i have a little gossip with which i thought you might want to begin your day mcnab said we have a new ally in our war against the evildoers who have snatched colonel ferris and who might that be castillo him too but i was speaking of aleksandr pevsner there was a moments hesitation then lammelle asked how reliable is that from the horses mouth so to speak whats that all about pevsner apparently believes putin is behind the whole thing and is after not only charley and the russians again but is against him too there was another just perceptible pause and you go along with that i dont dismiss it out of hand mcnab said vic dalessandro just came back from acapulco he says the drug cartel there whats it called vic the sinaloa cartel dalessandro furnished he raised his voice got you out of bed did we frank vic says the sinaloa cartel had no reason to kidnap ferris or kill the others ferriss people have been obeying their orders to cooperate with the federales which means the cartel knew what we knew thats pretty good information vic lammelle said i believe it dalessandro said tell him what else you learned mcnab said mr pevsner believes that the best defense is a good offense dalessandro said oh shit do you think we should tell natalie mcnab asked this time there was no hesitation on lammelles part no absolutely not you going to tell me why i had dinner with her after that fiasco in auditorium three lammelle said she pointed out to me something i kicked myself for not realizing what we no longer have the threat of impeachment we had hanging over clendennens head once we rearranged the cabinet to our satisfaction we lost it this time it was mcnab who hesitated for a momenta long momentbefore replying shes right he said as usual she says clendennen thinks were planning a coup first we get him to appoint montvale as vice president then we get rid of clendennen either by resignation or impeachment and montvale becomes president nice thought mcnab said but it never entered my mind until just now i didnt even consider montvale becoming vice president that was crenshaws idea stanley crenshaw was the attorney general of the united states and crenshaw being an honorable decent man did what you and i know better than to do he looked in the mirror mcnab knew lammelle was referring to what wouldbe intel officers are taught often on the first daycertainly within the first weekof their training never look in the mirror your enemy doesnt think like you do did she have anything to say about what happened at langley mcnab asked she said that porky parker was the first in the long line of people clendennen plans to knock off one at a time porkys disappeared by the way yesterday he and roscoe danton were in cozumel with castillo whats that all about i dont have a clue frank did natalie tell you what she plans to do yes she did she recommended that you and i not do anything at all that would give clendennen a chance to fire us she said she was going to talk with you i gather she hasnt no she didnt say anything about warning montvale or for that matter naylor i guess she figures both of them havent been looking in the mirror and if truman ellsworth haswhich i doubtmontvale will warn him so far as naylor goes i get the feeling that he wouldnt be grief stricken if clendennen relieved you i cant believe general naylor would be complicit in something like that youre looking in the mirror general naylor the soldier probably wouldnt but above a certain leveland naylor is way above itsenior officers have to be politicians and play by their rules mcnab didnt reply in this lammelle went on id say that both natalie and naylor really believe theyre doing what they dofor the country its not a personal ego tripbetter than anyone replacing them would do and theyre probably right they want to keep their jobs for the good of the country and will do whatever they think is necessary to keep them naylor thinks youre dangerous and you know it he wouldnt throw you under the bus but if somebody else did he would be able to put someone else in specopscom he could control again mcnab didnt reply i was there lammelle went on at drug cartel international when naylor suddenly decided to help and he even told us why if operation march hare failed that wouldve been worse for the country than if it succeeded is that why you changed sides frank for the good of the country no i changed sides because i realized i was being used by clendennen by montvale andmaybe especiallyby jack powell to do something i knew was wrong and im like you i guess john j powell was the former director of the central intelligence agency lammelle had replaced powell when he resigned two months previously what do you mean youre like me im a simple soul who sees things in black or white sometimes im a little slow in making the distinction but once i do i try to act accordingly mcnab didnt answer two things about natalie lammelle began then added why do i have a hard time using your first name its bruce use it two things about natalie bruce not only does she want to keep her job but she really believes the way to deal with mexicoand especially with this latest outrageis to talk about it and keep talking about it until reason prevails she was willing to resign over clendennens trying to swap charley sweaty and dmitri to the russians but charley waging a war in mexicoespecially with aleksandr pevsnerthats something thatll make her just as mad so you dont think i should tell her that charley just talked pevsner out of snatching the russian rezident in mexico city they decided to wait until they see if ferris is hurt then theyll whack him jesus christ the trouble with what you just told me frank is that it all makes sense it just took me a little timelike a decadeto figure it out watch your back bruce you too mcnab closed the lid of the brick and then met dalessandros eyes that was interesting wasnt it vic the word that comes to mind is scary dalessandro said three office of the fbi liaison officer united states special operations command fort bragg north carolina april when charles d stevens walked into his office his telephone was ringing since his secretary had not yet arrived he answered it himself fbi stevens max caruthers stevens where the hell have you been the generals been looking for you since ohsevenhundred no answer at your house and none at your office until now stevens had a mental picture of mcnabs huge senior aidedecamp i must have been driving to work stevens said you didnt answer your cell phone either caruthers accused stevens decided that caruthers would not be interested in his explanation for not answering his cell phone not only was talking on a cell phone while driving against the law he regarded it as dangerous too what can the fbi do for general mcnab colonel aside from getting that envelope you were asking for that should be delivered sometime this morning general mcnabs compliments mr stevens the general would appreciate seeing you at your earliest convenience in his office caruthers said paused and then finished where we have had that envelope since ohfivefifteen chuck stevenswho had willed himself to walk slowly from foggy bottom to the specopscom headquarters building im an fbi inspector not some pfc who has to run whenever his master whistlesarrived five minutes later in mcnabs office he found colonel j j tufts the liaison officer of the defense intelligence agency and colonel christopher dawson the uscentcom liaison officer already there and so was mr victor dalessandro about whom stevens knew very little except that it was rumored he had something to do with the ultrasecret gray fox unit about which stevens also knew very little and that dalessandro was sort of a confidant of general mcnab colonel max caruthers was not in mcnabs office which surprised stevens thank you for coming so quickly mr stevens general mcnab greeted him can we get you a cup of coffee no thank you sir stevens said well here it is mcnab said handing him a large translucent plastic envelope the envelope we have been looking for i place it in your capable hands confident that the fbi experts at quantico will find something useful for you thank you stevens said i have made photocopies of the contents i didnt think to ask permission first i hope that doesnt pose any problems i dont see why it should general stevens said as i was just explaining to these gentlemen mcnab said nodding toward colonel tufts and colonel dawson my official role in this whole affair is not much more than that of a spectator colonel ferris and warrant officer salazar were detached to the dea before they were sent to mexico i can only presume that those who kidnapped colonel ferris are unaware of this by which i mean they dont know that i have no authority even to reply to their messages the only thing i can do is follow the protocol laid down by uscentcom to deal with matters like this under that protocol i am required to immediately notify my immediate superiorthat is general naylorwhen something like thislike the envelope arriving hereoccurs i did so immediately after opening the envelope general naylor ordered me to transfer the envelope and its contents to the fbi and i have just done so he also directed me to give copies of everything to colonels tufts and dawson for their respective headquarters and he gave me permission to retain a copy therefore my official role in this is over at least until general naylor gives me further orders on a personal note however colonel ferris is a friend of mine and i would like to thank you personally mr stevens for your help im only too happy to do whatever i can general stevens said and really unofficially im personally curious to know who this fellow felix abrego is i suspect general that hes probably in a federal prison stevens said i can find out for you actually im curious myself i can have that information for you probably within the hour you understand thats a personal request not an official one understood not a problem you could find out yourself by going to the federal bureau of prisons website but i think i can get the information more quickly through my channels id really be grateful mr stevens mcnab said gentlemen unless you have something for me colonels tufts and dawson chorused no sir then thank you for answering my call so quickly mcnab said and stood and offered his hand when they had left his office and dalessandro had closed the door dalessandro turned to mcnab dont look so pleased with yourself when naylor and the dea cg hear how charming and modest youve been theyre going to smell the limburger mr dalessandro i have no idea what youre suggesting general naylor may even decide i have considered my wicked ways and have reformed dalessandro snorted mcnab opened his brick and took out the telephone handset activated the loudspeaker function and pushed a button aloysius bruce mcnab what can i do for you can you set up a net within the net to do what so that i can cut natalie cohen out of the loop without her knowing i thought she was one of the good guys she is shes so good its going to be a problem i suspect shes not going to like what she might hear who do you want on the net all the outlaws plus vic dalessandro and lammelle just them just them and you want the other net to still function thats it can do itll take me about an hour ill call you back when its up you will get your reward in heaven aloysius four arizona boulevard san antonio texas april dona alicia castillo was waiting for charley and sweaty when they walked into the breakfast room charleys grandmother was seated at the head of the table drinking a steaming cup of cafe con leche the table was set for four and on each plate was a grapefruit half topped with a maraschino cherry max trotted over to the dignified old woman and waited for her to scratch his ears good morning dona alicia said you slept well i hope charley and sweaty walked over to her and kissed her cheek abuela if she didnt snore like a backfiring john deere id have probably slept better his grandmother ignored him shall we wait for lester she asked i looked in his room castillo said he was sleeping like a cherub nobody was snoring in his room this earned him an icy flash from his grandmother id forgotten how beautiful this is sweaty said quickly gesturing past the windows to the garden what a beautiful lawn you wouldnt think it was so beautiful if you had to mow it castillo said carloss grandfather believed boys should earn their allowances dona alicia said he paid a dollar an acre castillo said why dont we eat dona alicia said we have so much to talk about would you say grace darling abuelas talking to you my love castillo said try to keep it under five minutes his grandmother shook her head dear god sweaty began we thank you for the bounty we are about to receive we thank you for our families and ask that you keep them safe we ask your protection for those who are prisoners and ask that they be soon safely reunited with their families we ask this in the name of jesus christ thy son and our lord and savior amen she turned to charley short enough for you my heathen he made a waving gesture with his hand suggesting she had more or less met his criteria you had colonel ferris in mind didnt you svetlana dona alicia asked sweaty nodded yes abuela what do we have to talk about so much castillo asked as he picked the maraschino cherry from his grapefruit and popped it into his mouth she gestured toward the windows well carlos why dont we start with those men walking around outside the fence charley and sweaty exchanged glances after a moment he said oh you noticed huh even before mr lafferty of gladiator security called me and said i had no cause for concern that there were six of them and a half dozen more could be here in less than five minutes if they were needed castillo took a moment to frame his reply while he was doing so dona alicia asked have you noticed svetlana dear that who me look on carloss face when you catch him with his hand in the cookie jar abuela castillo began carefully think of the security guys as me just being extracareful about what do you want me to tell her carlito sweaty said i wish you would dear dona alicia said i dont think youre nearly as good at getting around the truth as he is castillo gestured for sweaty to go ahead we have good reason abuela sweaty said matteroffactly to believe that the svr is behind the kidnapping of colonel ferris and the assassinations of the other americans that it is a diversion in their plans to get at carlito my brother our cousin aleksandr and me and youre worried that this might involve me dona alicia asked calmly yes maam castillo said what about billy kocian and otto gorner id think if i were at risk so would they be we think that whatever the svr tries castillo said it will be in mexico or here but just to be sure abuela i gave sandor tor a call and told him what we think is going on not otto he shook his head why not she asked it was not an idle question but rather more on the order of a rebuke two reasons castillo replied after the svr murdered that tages zeitung reporteri forget his name his name was gunther friedler dona alicia said evenly and you should be ashamed of yourself for not knowing his name he was one of your employees castillo looked at her a long moment then nodded yes maam youre right what i started to say abuela was that after herr friedler was murdered billy arranged for sandor tor to take over all security for gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh he told otto that if ottos security people had done their job herr friedler would still be alive so otto went along anyway i called sandorbilly and sandorand told them what we thought both agreed by the way with what we think it probably took no more than half an hour before sandors people were sitting on otto and his family you didnt call otto why not thats the second reason castillo said pointing to a leather attache case sitting on a sideboard otto doesnt answer his brick he thinks the cia listens to everything he says over it does it castillo shook his head and what do you think ottos going to do when he notices his extra security dona alicia asked and you know he will since otto also believes that both the germans and the russians listen to his telephone calls castillo said sarcastically and since he doesnt want to use the brick because the cia will be listening what he probably will do is hop in his new mustang and fly to budapest for a goulash lunch or if the mustang is in budapest invite billy to fulda for knackwurst mit kraut otto has a mustang like yours they have a mustang gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh has had a very good year but not good enough to be able to afford buying both of them a twopointsevenmilliondollar toy im surprised otto would permit something like that she said hes usually very frugal oh he protested bitterly castillo said it was as hard for me to talk him into it as it would have been for me to talk someone whos been wandering around the sahara desert for a month into having a glass of ice water she smiled and how do you justify your twopointsevenmilliondollar toy id rather not tell you you might decide that sweatys profligate my uncle nicolai has one abuela sweaty explained he uses it to flyhigh rollers right carlito back and forth to the grand cozumel from mexico city and miami castillo thought and for other purposes such as hauling suitcases full of hundreddollar bills out of drug cartel international to someplace where they can be laundered and when i saw the way carlito looked at it like a little boy watching an electric train in a store window she mimed this by opening her eyes very wide and letting her tongue hang out the side of her mouth dona alicia laughed i know the look dona alicia said when he and fernando were about twelve their grandfather showed them a pair of winchester model leveractions that he said he was sending down to hacienda santa maria dona alicia paused when sweatys face showed a lack of understanding the grapefruit farm castillo explained dona alicia went on the rifles were for keeping the deer from eating our grapefruit they were to be a christmas present for them but they didnt know that and both of them she opened her eyes wide and let her tongue hang out of the side of her mouth sweaty laughed then finished so i bought him a mustang grandpa told me that it was just as easy to fall in love with a rich girl as it was a poor one castillo said and i took his advice i dont know how you put up with him svetlana dear but on the other hand his grandfather was just about as bad and i put up with him for fortyeight years before the lord took him and then her face grew serious do you think the people at hacienda santa maria are safe she asked well thats a natural transition i suppose from a couple of model s as christmas presents for a couple of twelveyearolds to asking by implication if weapons are needed to protect our people at hacienda santa maria fernandos down there right now abuela making sure they are and how is he going to do that he took some security people with him castillo said from gladiator security was that necessary the police chief in oaxaca is an old old friend of ours and for that matter so is the chief of police in acapulco between them im sure abuela colonel ferris was kidnapped fifty miles from acapulco castillo said so you decided that people from gladiator security were needed not gladiator security the people fernando took to the hacienda are spetsnaz exspetsnaz russian green berets more or less theyve been protecting sweatys cousin aleksandr and his family in argentina and fernando took them there castillo nodded then he must take this threat very seriously she said he does you seem surprised he knows it will insult our people at hacienda santa maria she said abuela were trying to protect them why should they be insulted fernando knowsand you shouldthat hacienda santa maria has been in the family for centuries it was a land grant from the king of spain for all that time our people there have been fighting off people who wanted to do the hacienda harm indians all sorts of banditos even french soldiers when mexico had a french emperor and lately these despicable drug people they wont think they need any help well theyre wrong castillo said and getting back to where this conversation began she said neither do i ive been taking care of myself for a long time i dont need more people from gladiator than are already here wrong again abuela castillo said from now on you dont go anywhere without people from gladiator one of them will drive your car he paused and then added which will probably cause your insurance company to heave a huge sigh of relief she frowned at him and looked as if she were going to reply but then her expression changed to a smile as lester bradley walked into the breakfast room he was carrying a brick good morning lester dona alicia said did you sleep well good morning bradley replied of course he slept well castillo said nobody was snoring in his room this triggered a thirtysecond explosion in russian from sweaty which dona alicia could not translate but obviously understood castillo put up his hands in a gesture of surrender but did not really look very remorseful sit down dear dona alicia said and have some breakfast yes maam thank you lester said then turned to castillo colonel can i see you a moment lester were both retired that means i dont call you sergeant anymore and you dont call me colonel yes sir lester replied try your majesty on for size if that doesnt work how about charley bradley smiled i uh bradley said and looked at dona alicia whats up les castillo said mr casey called a couple of minutes ago bradley said to tell me net two is up and running if you want to use it punch two forward slashes and then the other numbers whats net two castillo asked mr casey said when you asked i was to tell you to call mr dalessandro he laid the brick in front of castillo and opened it castillo took out the handset two forward slashes and then the number bradley repeated castillo did so whats up vic put it on loudspeaker sweaty ordered castillo either didnt hear her or chose to ignore her their conservation was brief essentially onesided with castillo doing most of the listening and replying with short answers finally he said well be in touch and replaced the handset in the brick what is net two sweaty demanded immediately it took him a moment to frame his reply the reason we now have two casey networks is because we have to cut natalie cohen out of the original net and we dont want her to know that shes been cut that requires an explanation sweaty said let me tell you what she told frank lammelle castillo said natalie cohen said that president clendennen thinks we tried were trying to stage a coup detat first we get him to appoint montvale as vice president then we get rid of clendennen my god dona alicia said that never entered my mind castillo said maybe it should have but thats moot montvale and natalie and frank no longer have the threat of impeachment to hold clendennen in line so now its his turn to get rid of people that circus at langleyclendennens press conferencewas his first move he not only got rid of porky parker but he made the point to the others that he was coming after them just as soon as he could find a reason once they get the message he hopes they will resign they can leave his service with their reputations intact instead of getting fired for incompetence as parker was its clear to both lammelle and cohen that he plans to use this mess in mexico as the way to do it so natalie told frank their only defense against this is to not give him any excuse at all to accuse them of either incompetence or disloyalty making matters worse lammelle says that cohenkeep in mind that it was her idea to send ferris danny salazar and the other special forces people down there in the first placewill go ballistic if she even suspects what aleksandr pevsner plans to do in mexico which is dona alicia asked softly pevsner has decided that the best defense against what putin has in mind for us is a good offense and you carlos she asked how do you feel about that castillo hesitated just perceptibly before replying abuela taking into consideration both that putin has provedherr friedler was not the only man he had assassinatedthat hes willing and capable of murdering everybody he thinks is in his way im afraid pevsner is right you said taking into consideration both abuela putins already tried several times to assassinate me theres no question that hes coming after svetlana and i cant let that happen i wont let that happen dona alicia sighed oh my we have a very bad situation on our hands dont we castillo didnt reply for a long moment then he said we thoughtnaively thoughtthat we had bloodied his nose when we grabbed the tupelov and turned general sirinov over to the cia we offered him an armistice he didnt accept it so what we have to do now is bloody it again hard enough this time so that he gets the message she considered that for a moment and so what do we do now so what do we do now castillo parroted lightly sarcastic his grandmother stared at him icily until you lower me into my grave carlos i will continue to run this family never forget that sorry he said he saw sweaty looking at her with a smile of approval and what i am going to do now is have a word with senor medina dona alicia said she turned to sweaty senor medina has been running hacienda santa maria for us for thirty years and before that his father ran it and before him his father she paused then looked at lester she pointed at the brick on the side table that device you told me lester prohibits people from eavesdropping on conversations yes maam and fernando has one lester nodded and you told me carlos that fernando is at the hacienda yes maam lester would you bring that to me and show me again how to use it yes maam lester castillo said before the head of the family talks to him you better get him on the horn and explain net two to him yes sir castillo looked at dona alicia and when you get fernando on the brick then what i told you i want a word with senor medina about what im going to ask him to get in his car right now and go see senor torres who is i told you before an old and trusted friend who is commandant of the policia federal in acapulco then hes probably in up to his ears with the sinaloa drug cartel castillo said ill admit that possibility she replied but we dont know that carlos and he will believe me when i tell him that unless colonel ferris is released safely and immediately there will be much trouble youre going to threaten this guy castillo asked incredulously im going to explain the situation to him it cant do any harm carlos and if that doesnt work ill think of something else castillo glanced at svetlana and saw that she was once again smiling approvingly at his grandmother five the situation room the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc april supervisory secret service agent robert j mulligan who in addition to being appointed chief of the secret service presidential protection team now also seemed to be functioning as president clendennens personal assistant had telephoned vice president charles w montvale secretary of state natalie cohen secretary of defense frederick k beiderman director of national intelligence truman ellsworth cia director a franklin lammelle attorney general stanley crenshaw and fbi director mark schmidt summoning them all to a am meeting with the president in the situation room in each case he had insistedpolitely but with a certain arroganceon speaking personally with those being summoned rather than leave word of their summons with anyone else they all chose to arrive early which caused a notsominor traffic jam in the white house driveways and in the area where the white house vehicles were parked the vice president the secretary of state and the secretary of defense traveled in limousines all of them preceded and trailed by gmc yukons carrying their protection details the others did not have limousines everyone but director of national intelligence ellsworthwho rode in his personal car a jaguar vanden plastraveled by yukon with each preceded and trailed by yukons carrying their protection details by all the dignitaries had arrived in the underground situation room the president was not there nor was the usual coffeemaker and trays of pastry vice president montvale told one of the secret service agents guarding the door to see whats happened to the coffee and the agent hurried from the door the coffee and pastry had not arrived when special agent mulligan appeared at the door and announced the president of the united states everyone rose as joshua ezekiel clendennen entered the room and marched to the head of the table trailed by clemens mccarthy a crewcut man who looked younger than his fortytwo years and who had been named presidential press secretary following the resignation of john david parker usually the president said please take your seats before sitting down today he unceremoniously sat down and said well lets get started ive got a lot on my plate today after an awkward moment the vice president sat down and the others followed suit lammelle clendennen said i didnt find what i was looking for in my daily quote unquote intelligence briefing im sorry mr president what were you looking for sir the last developments in this mess in mexico lammelle there have been no developments in the last twentyfour hours mr president the director of national intelligence replied specifically i wanted to know if we have the bodies mr president secretary of state cohen put in i spoke with ambassador mccann just before i left to come here he told me he expects the remains to be released to us sometime today and then what the president asked then well send a plane to return them to the united states cohen said no the president said as clemens mccarthy stood and stepped toward him what were going to do madam secretary is he interrupted himself when mccarthy leaned over and whispered at length into his ear the president nodded then went on mccarthy pointed out that we were about to miss a nice photo opportunity so what youre going to do madam secretary is get on the phone to the ambassador and tell him to go to the airportwhats it called clemens general juan n alvarez international airport mr president clemens always has details like that at his fingertips the president said what youre going to do madam secretary is call the ambassador and tell him to get over to general juan n alvarez international airport right now tell him that a press plane will be coming there tell him to set up some sort of appropriate ceremony with the most senior mexicans he can get together for the loading of the bodies onto the airplane mr president secretary of defense beiderman said in situations like this the protocol is to have the bodies in body bags on stretchers with an american flag covering them thats not a very nice picture jesus christ the president said you tell the ambassador madam secretary to make sure that the bodies are in caskets nice caskets clemens mccarthy whispered in the presidents ear again and again the president nodded and tell him the president ordered to take his marine embassy guards with him dressed in their dress uniforms to carry the bodies in their caskets onto the airplane you said a photo op mr president secretary cohen said do you want the ambassador to try to arrange for that i also said madam secretary if you were listening that a press plane will be going down there clemens arranged it on it will be crews from wolf news and a couple of the unimportant ones and andy mcclarren who as clemens said he would was unable to turn down a chance to have tearfilled eyes on display for his many millions of viewers and does mr mccarthy have plans for the plane landing at san antonio secretary of defense beiderman asked san antonio the president asked yes sir all three men are from texas it is intended to bury warrant officer salazar in the national cemetery there plans for the dea agents have not been finalized mr mccarthy had made all the necessary arrangements with the press for the landing of the plane at andrews air force base the president said and for their interment at arlington the day after tomorrow mr president i spoke with general naylor about this mrs salazar wishes to have her husband buried in san antonio well call general naylor and tell him i said for him to tell her that her husband is going to be buried in arlington all three are going to be buried in arlington and youre all going to be there there will be a photo op i will make remarks mr president beiderman said i dont know what the families of the dea agents wish with regard to their interment i just told you mr secretary where they are going to be buried and im not sure that either of the dea agents is eligible for interment at arlington im not even sure theyre both veterans and as you know sir theyre running out of space at arlington clendennen looked at attorney general crenshaw correct me if im wrong mr attorney general but dont i as commander in chief have the authority to say who is eligible for interment at arlington you have that authority mr president crenshaw said subject closed the president said he turned to the dci lammelle i asked you what seems like a long time ago about what new developments there are mr president lammelle replied may i defer to the fbi the presidents face showed that he didnt like this answer but he turned to fbi director mark schmidt and asked well schmidt handed him a large manila envelope the president opened it withdrew its contents then asked what am i looking at photocopies of a ups next day envelope and its contents which were delivered early this morning to general mcnab at fort bragg the address on here says sergeant terry otoole the president said major general terrence otoole is general mcnabs deputy sir schmidt said in the belief that another message would be sent to general mcnab possibly using an address that would not attract attention but would nevertheless reach general mcnabthe first message from these people was addressed to lieutenant colonel mcnabthe fbi instituted a nationwide surveillance of both fedex and ups overnight packages we found that one last night in el paso if schmidt expected a compliment for the fbis success he was to be disappointed the fbi found this last night the president asked then why am i getting itwhy am i getting copies of it and not the originalnow why wasnt i informed of this last night why didnt i have the whole damn thing a lot sooner than now once we located the envelope we notified general mcnab and then put it back in the ups delivery process and then general mcnab notified general naylor of the packages arrival and then turned it over to the fbi liaison officer at specopscom he notified fbi headquarters and we sent a plane to pick it up as we speak mr president our forensic people at quantico are examining it to see what can be learned i ordered that a photocopy of everything be sent to me what your people in el paso should have done is sent it directly to you the less general mcnab has to do with this the better sir it was addressed to general mcnab the president slammed the envelope on his desk no it was addressed to sergeant terry otoole and if you had done that i would be looking at it a lot sooner than just now and ill tell you what i have learned from this without the help of your forensic experts these people want to swap colonel ferris forhe paused and dropped his eyes to the messagefor felix abrego who the hell is he hes a mexican national mr president fbi director schmidt said serving a sentence of life without the possibility of parole at florence admax in colorado what did he do dea agents intercepted a movement of drugs near el pasoin the united states near el pasoduring which this fellow shot and killed three agents the dea believes he is one of the leaders of one of the major drug cartels i would suggest its a moot point mr president attorney general crenshaw said what the united states has a longstanding policy of not negotiating in situations like this mr president policies change mr attorney general lammelle has the cia got anything to add sir both the dea people in acapulco and my man there feel there is something odd about the murders and kidnapping the relationship between the dea and the sinaloa drug cartel which controls that area isfor lack of a better wordamicable their compliance with the orders of the ambassador to cooperate with the mexican authorities has meant that the cartel almost certainly has not felt threatened by the dea in the area or by the special forces there is no reason for them to draw attention to themselves by doing something like this except of course that they want this fellow abrego back mr president they could have kidnapped colonel ferris in mexico city get to your point lammelle the president said impatiently raw intelligence data mr president as im sure you know is intelligence that has not been analyzed as to the source and the reliability of that source in short its unreliable you do have a point right the president asked this does not mean that raw intelligence data is not accurate mr president just that we cant determine whether it is or not why do i suspect lammelle that youre going to tell me that you have some raw intelligence data the accuracy of which you cant determine my raw data suggests the possibility mr president that putinthe russiansare behind what happened in acapulco what possible interest could putin have in whatsisname felix abrego my raw data suggests his interest is in colonel dmitri berezovsky lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva and lieutenant colonel castillo ahha well i can understand that nobody likes traitors mr president i must object to your characterization of colonel castillo as a traitor secretary natalie cohen said thats right the president said with a thin smile hes a hero isnt he a wellpaid hero the vice president and mr lammelle didnt waste very much time before handing him a check for a hundred twentyfive million of taxpayers dollars did they mr president vice president montvale said that reward for the delivery of a tupelov was authorized by both your predecessor and by senator johns of the senate select committee on intelligence the president ignored him in your opinion mr ellsworth the president said presuming that mr lammelles raw and unconfirmed intelligence that mr putins wholly understandable interest in getting his hands on his two traitors is true how is that going to affect our efforts to get colonel ferris back i have no idea ellsworth replied it seems to me that were going to have to wait until we see what the mexicans come up with the ball so to speak is in their court no the ball is in our court the president said they want to talk so well talk mr president attorney general crenshaw said youre not thinking of entering into negotiations involving exchanging this fellow abrego are you of course not the president said i wouldnt think of violating longstanding policy but one thought ive had running through my mind since ifinallygot a look at their message is that this fellow is a convicted murderer not a terrorist and i seem to recall that our policy speaks of not negotiating with terrorists correct me if im wrong the attorney general thought for a split second then said i believe youre correct mr president but i also believe that it is within my power to show compassion for example if senor abrego were discovered to have developed a terminal illness who could fault me for returning him to his native mexico to live out what little remains of his life he would then become the mexicans problem and if that somehow resulted in colonel ferriss being released crenshaw glanced out the windows as he composed his reply well the president said if you did that mr president it would have the same effect we have fifty people like abrego in our prisons once these drug cartels get the message that all they have to do to get any of them released is to kidnap we will deal with that when and if it comes up the president said you dont object to this to the point where youre considering offering your resignation are you mr attorney general crenshaws face tightened it was a long moment before he replied not at this time mr president good its nice to see i have at least one loyal member of my cabinet i think the fbi would be the best agency to establish contact with these people whoever they are do you agree yes mr president now since mr lammelle has brought up the possibility that this has something to do with these russian traitors it might be useful to know where they are anyone know there are interpol warrants out for them i believe in addition to being traitors theyre accused of stealing large amounts of money from their government those interpol warrants have been withdrawn mr president fbi director schmidt said i believe it was part of the armistice agreement colonel castillo made with putin the russian embassy sent me a document stating that not only had a full investigation of those charges against colonel berezovsky and lieutenant colonel alekseeva cleared them entirely but also they had been granted permission to leave russia and were no longer persons of any interest to the russian federation the armistice agreement colonel castillo made with putin the president parroted i thought it was illegal for an american citizen to do something like that could he be prosecuted for doing so vice president montvale said the quote unquote armistice was between castillo and putin mr president not between the respective governments i dont think it was even committed to paper it sounds as if my vice president approves of this armistice i do montvale said simply as do i mr president natalie cohen said it would appear to some people that colonel castillo may be angling for your job madam secretary how do you feel about that i feel thats preposterous mr president speaking of the colonel and the traitors where are they the president asked when no one immediately replied he went on there has been no contact with him no official contact mr president lammelle said but colonel castillo and i are friends you dont say he was recently in cozumel mexico i dont know if hes still there what was he doing there were the traitors with him i dont know about the russians lammelle said but he mentioned that mr parker was there and roscoe danton the president whose face showed he didnt like that looked as if he was going to say something but changed his mind and then said birds of a feather they say flock together no one replied well let me spell things out i intend with the cooperation of the mexican government to see that colonel ferris is released i will do whatever i think is necessary to accomplish that and i will not tolerate any interference from anyone and i dont want any assistance from castillo or his merry band of outlaws furthermore secretary beiderman i want you to personally inform general naylor that he is not even to contemplate any military action of any kind whatsoever with regard to colonel ferris and tell him i personally told you to make sure general mcnab is aware of this order yes mr president beiderman said thats it ill see you all at the interment in arlington mccarthy will furnish the details just as soon as hes set them up he suddenly stood and with mccarthy and mulligan following him marched out of the situation room the vice president turned to the attorney general dont look so unhappy stan montvale said he gave you the option of resigning the attorney general looked at the vice president for a moment and then gave him the finger he does tend to bring out the worst in people doesnt he secretary of state cohen said to no one in particular v one the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue nw washington dc april mr and mrs j herbert kramer and mr and mrs robert v dabney came out of what herb kramer described as the restaurant or coffee shop or whateverthehell it is off the lobby and took seats on two couches in the lobby from which they had a good view of both the entrance and the bank of elevators herb kramer was pleased with his breakfast of corned beef hash topped with poached eggs most of the time you get corned beef its hash fresh from a can herb observed that was homemade from real corned beef then he observed but they didnt give it away did they what the hell its deductible bob dabney said live it up herb and bob were in washington to attend the annual convention of the national association of wholesale hardware dealers both were in that business in missouri herb in st louis and bob in kansas city they had been pals since their days at the university of missouri where bob married kate the day after they graduated herb had married his delores some years later they were staying at the mayflower because of delores someone had told her that the best place in washington to see the big shots was in the lobby of the mayflower and delores generally got what she wanted she was far more interested in seeing the big shots up close than she was in seeing a bunch of old airplanes at the national aerospace museum which was high on herb and bobs agenda for their free time while in the nations capital they didnt have to wait long to learn that what delores had been told was true look delores whispered loudly as a group of ten men came down the lobby to the elevator bank theres whatsisname who herb asked in a normal voice the guy we see on wolf news all the time delores said impatiently roger danton kate furnished roscoe danton bob corrected her and theres the presidents press secretary express secretary herb said he got canned last week thats right isnt it what did he do bob shrugged or didnt do it sounded like incompetence well i will be damned herb said that was them sure as christ made little apples i wonder who the other ones are delores said as the men disappeared into an elevator bob and herb shrugged i wonder what theyre doing here delores went on they probably came to see monica lewinsky herb said with a straight face thats right delores said this is that place isnt it thats how they get away with charging so much for the rooms herb said what happened next three minutes later was even more exciting four large and muscular men strode purposefully into the lobby looked around suspiciouslyincluding at herb bob kate and deloresand then took up positions along the corridor one of them stood in the door of an elevator so that the door would remain open then another five men entered the lobby from the street and headed for the elevators two in front of and two behind the vice president of the united states they all got in the open elevator i will be damned herb said vice president montvale he probably wants to see ol monica too bob said grinning at his own joke will you stop that delores said thats the vice president and the parade of bigwigs was not over four peopletwo of them womenstrode purposefully into the lobby and did just about what the members of the vice presidents protection detail had done after looking carefully at delores kate bob and herb the men and one of the women took up positions in the lobby beside the protection detail men already there the second woman stood in an elevator door and kept it from closing next five people marched into the lobby two men and two women surrounding a third much smaller woman they marched to the elevator and got on my god that was the secretary of state kate said whats her name something cohen bob furnished and then added natalie cohen thats her name natalie cohen id really love to know whats going on up there delores said two suite the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue nw washington dc april suite which consisted of a sitting room two bedrooms and a small kitchenwas registered to herr karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger the washington correspondent of the tages zeitung newspaper chain and billed on a monthly basis to gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh of fulda germany which owned the tages zeitung chain and a good deal more when herr gossingerwho was also known as carlos guillermo castillo lieutenant colonel special forces us army retiredhad called the general manager of the mayflower the day before to announce that he not only would be checking in later that day but would require inroom lateafternoon cocktails with finger food for probably fifteen or twenty people and possibly inroom dinner for that many people later the gm had told herr von und zu gossinger not to worry that he personally would take care of everything when castillo lester bradley and major dick miller arrived at about they found that the general managerwho appreciated guests who not only did not question prices but also paid promptlyhad obligingly made the suite adjacent to available the suites were identical hotel staff had opened the double door between the two suites and converted the sitting room of into a dining room with bar when the door chimes bonged castillo pulled the door open a large middleaged irishman stood there youre welcome here tom even if i suspect youre here officially castillo greeted him come on in you want some coffee the vice presidents sixty seconds behind me charley supervisory secret service special agent thomas mcguire chief of the vice presidential protection detail said why do i suspect im not going to like what he wants to tell me castillo asked mcguire did not reply directly instead saying when we heard you were in washington we went to the house in alexandria they told us you were here did you ask personally tom or in your official capacity mcguire looked uncomfortable charley i work for him he said yeah i heard the chime bonged again castillo gestured for mcguire to open the door and he did so the vice president of the united states walked into the room and looked around he saw roscoe j danton john david parker lester bradley colonel jake torine major richard miller and cwo colin leverette all of whom he knew and in the sitting room and dining room maybe ten more men he didnt know no one was wearing a uniform but montvale correctly intuited they were all soldiers what the hell did castillo do montvale thought bring half of gray fox up here now that i think of it mr vice president castillo said i do seem to recall telling you that if you were in the neighborhood anytime you should feel free to drop in so welcome welcome what the hell is going on here castillo actually were getting ready to go to the interment of a friend you may have heard what i would like to know is how you heard did that goddamn mcnab tell you i have not had any contact with general mcnabto whom i presume you referfor some time now you can ask him yourself i presume hell be at arlington then how the hell the chime bonged again i wonder who else might be calling castillo said mr mcguire if youd be so kind mcguire opened the door the secretary of state stood there may i come in natalie cohen asked yes maam its always a pleasure to see you castillo said she took a quick look around the room and smiled at the few people she knew let me get right to the point charley she said youre not thinking of going out to arlington are you im going castillo said and gestured around the suite were all going that wouldnt be a wise thing to do charley she said have you considered that are you and vice president montvale here to try to talk me out of going to my friend mr salazars interment is there somewhere we can speak privately charley she asked he indicated the door to what turned out to be when she and montvale and castillo walked through it the master bedroom she closed the door then turned to the men and said what is said in here goes no further agreed both men nodded i understand youre aware charley of the meeting in which it became apparent that the president thinks we have been engaged in a coup detat that would see charles in the oval office castillo nodded the fact that thats absolutely untrue is really irrelevant thats what the president believes and its what we have to deal with understood castillo nodded again there was another meeting yesterday in the situation room thatshe glanced at montvalewith the vice presidents permission id like to tell you about all right charles montvale hesitated a moment and then nodded the secretary picked up on the hesitation and said would you prefer to tell him about it you tell him montvale said i dont think he trusts me true castillo said well youd better learn to trust him charley cohen said if we dont stick together the president is going to take us down one by one hes already gotten rid of john david parker and what is parker doing here as of a few minutes ago hes director of public relations of the lcbf corporation castillo said what the hell is that all about montvale asked keeping our names out of the newspapers and our faces off wolf news you were about to tell me about the meeting madam secretary tell me if i leave anything out would you please charles she then began to deliver a report of who had said what to whom which ultimately lasted ten minutes about a minute into it castillo realized it was almost a verbatim report of the meeting and moments after that almost hell its not only verbatim but with footnotes shes got a photographic memory no thats not right what she has is total recall if i asked her she could probably tell me what kind of a tie clendennen was wearing finally she finished and looked at montvale did i leave anything out she asked what kind of a tie was the president wearing castillo asked secretary cohen hesitated just a moment looked confused and then replied dark blue with what looked like crests on it whats that got to do with anything im awed maam with your powers of total recall castillo said dont be charley i was born this way she paused its the same sort of thing you have with languages an aberration you speak whatfourteen languages and i can recall things in great detail its a gift so its nothing to be proud of but it does give us a leg up in our professions doesnt it yes maam ive found that do you understand now why i think it would be unwise for you to go to arlington hed see you he hates youhe thinks youre involved in this coup detat fantasy of his among other things such as you wanting my joband seeing you there would likely set him off the one thing none of us should do now is do anything to make him lose control i want to be secretary of state castillo said secretary of state cohen made a face then nodded gently unbelievable but whats not unbelievable is that im going to mr salazars interment everybody out there is going to it im sorry if that causes any problems maam for christs sake castillo didnt you hear what she said vice president montvale snapped im sure you have your reasons secretary cohen said to hell with his reasons montvale exploded hes not going out there ill have the secret service confine him and the rest of them in the suite until the interments over if you do that mr vice president castillo said calmly it will be on wolf news and on the front page of the timespost you did see roscoe danton out there didnt you dont you threaten me you arrogant sonofabitch im the vice president of the united states get your temper under control charles natalie cohen said calmly charley why is this so important to you yesterday mrs salazar telephoned me how the hell did she know where to find you montvale demanded castillo ignored montvale if i may continue madam secretary he asked please ill answer mr montvales question for your background maam special operations special forces generally and especially delta force and gray foxand just about everybody outside who is or has been one or the other or bothis like a family we take care of each other we know how to find each other when there is a problem and mrs salazar had a problem secretary cohen asked she didnt want her husband interred in arlington castillo nodded she told me that general naylor had telephoned herand now i know where that order came fromand fed her a line about the great honor it was for danny to be interred in arlington with the president himself attending when she told him thank you but no thank youthat she wanted danny buried in san antonio where she could visit and tend his gravenaylor told her that the arrangements had been made that they were sending a plane to bragg to pick up her and the kids and that the president would be embarrassed if she refused his kind offer to plant danny in arlington so she went along but after she thought it over she went to see general mcnab general mcnab told herout of school hes part of the family i mentionedthat he had been ordered by general naylor not to talk to her about it and also incidentally that he had been ordered to stay away from arlington himself and then that sonofabitch told her to call you right montvale said no he didnt castillo said evenly and that was the last question you get to ask mr montvale if you open your mouth again im going to have to ask you to leave you cant do that montvale flared its his apartment charles secretary cohen said he has the right to ask you to leave and if youre thinking about your secret service guys castillo added a scrap between them and the guys outside would be very interesting it would also make a hell of a story for wolf news vice presidents protection detail gets their ass kicked in lobby of mayflower cohen said all right charley enough so what happened when mrs salazar called you well my first reaction to what she told me was to call my beloved uncle allan and tell him to butt the hell out of something that was none of his business but then calm reason prevailed the vice president snorted i realized that as much as i would love to embarrass the sonofabitch youre speaking of the president charley cohen said who tried to turn me over to the svr he met her eyes for a long moment and then went on i realized there would be unacceptable collateral damage to maria salazar and their kids they didnt need microphones being shoved in their faces which would have happened if i told her she didnt have to go along with the the presidents using dannys funeral to get himself reelected so i told her it was indeed an honor to be buried in arlington as its for national heroes and i told her id see her at the interment as i was telling her this i remembered its also an honor to be buried in the national cemetery in san antone my fathers buried there and then i wondered if anyone had thought to invite colonel ferriss wife to the interment i knew she would want to be there so i called her and she hadnt been invited so i spent the next hour or so on the telephone setting things up jake torine and dick miller who are almost as pissed about this as i am have been flying around the country picking up people who wantand have every rightto watch danny get his military funeral the guysand several womenare scattered between here and the willard mrs ferris and their kids are also in the willard about to get in the limousine that will take them out to arlington after the interment theyll come here were going to have a few drinks and then later dinner so madam secretary as much as i really hate to tell you no to anything you ask of me im going to be at arlington when dannys buried ill have you stopped at the gate to arlington montvale said shut up charles secretary cohen said she looked thoughtful for a moment then said i think its possible that mr mccarthy may have considered the possibility that there are some people the president would rather not come to arlington that would be another great story for wolf news and the washington timespost castillo said brawl mars funeral at gate to arlington some enterprising journalist might even dig into what it was all about how are you going to move your friends out there she asked we have four stretch limousines castillo replied in case some other friends of danny show up out there and need a ride back here and youre paying for all this she asked sorry i shouldnt have asked that the lcbf corporation is paying for everything we just turned a tidy profit selling an airplane we got for a bargain to the cia for a lot of money she smiled at him may i ask you a question i probably shouldnt ask castillo asked she nodded what ever happened to that mexican police black hawk that was found at sea and then unloaded on the dock at norfolk dare i hope you showed it to the mexican ambassador and asked him how he thought it got there she shook her head you know i couldnt do anything like that charley she said so what happened to it thats not any of your business and you know it but youre going to tell me anyway right is it still there frank lammelle wanted it for the cia i okayed it but i dont know whether hes done anything about it its probably still covered up on the dock or in a hangar somewhere she paused then asked charley did you ever consider the consequences if you had been caught stealing that helicopter from the mexican police i didnt steal it didnt frank tell you tell me what that the mexicans reported that the helicopter had crashedtotal lossin their unrelenting war against the drug trade no she said simply then how was it found at sea you mean how did i get it she nodded i bought it from an officer of the policia federal i think he thought i was in the drug trade and was going to use it to move drugs around he paused thats the question i hoped you were going to ask the mexican ambassador i thought you told us this helicopter had been totally destroyed how do you explain its miraculous resurrection i didnt know anything about how you acquired that helicopter she said but even if i hadwhat i am doing is trying to build better relations with mexicoi wouldnt have confronted him with something like that she thought for a moment then said why in the world did you buy it i needed it to go after the congox and the tupelov castillo said matteroffactly i thought you used special operations helicopters for that montvale said castillo gave him a dirty look then saw on cohens face that she was worried he was going to throw montvale out he decided that would be nonproductive i did but jake torine and i flew the mexican bird onto the island you and torine why cohen asked because on an assault like that the lead bird generally takes fire my original idea presuming that happened was just to leave it on the island which would then have had hugo chavez angrily asking the mexicans how come one of their policia federal choppers was on his island devious montvale said admiringly but then the night stalkers suppressed the antiaircraft and the mexican bird didnt get hurt so i decided to fly it back out to the bataan and told her captain to take it to norfolk where i would ask the mexican ambassador to the us i thought you reported this aircraft was totally destroyed cohen asked castillo looked at her smiled and nodded youre right charles he is devious maybe he should have been a diplomat or a politician devious and dangerous montvale said smiling what happened castillo thought have we kissed and made up no that smile is the smile of mutual admiration one shark gives to another turning to the problem at hand secretary cohen said which is that charley cannot be dissuaded from going out to arlington with all his friends how do we deal with that where are those limousines you mentioned charley montvale asked in the hotel garage waiting for me to call them which i am going to do in the next sixty seconds or so i think youre right natalie montvale said mccarthyand or mulliganprobably has people at the gate of arlington to keep out people who might embarrass the president but i think theyll just wave our convoy through so we put charleys limousines in our convoy she asked that makes sense montvale walked to the bedroom door he opened it and then looked around until he found tom mcguire tom may i see you for a moment after the secretary of state had disappeared into the lobby elevator nothing much happened in the next ten minutes herb kramer announced he was going to stretch his legs ill go with you bob dabney said stay out of the bar delores said you dont want to go to the ways and means committee smelling of alcohol im going to go outside and have a puff on a cigarette herb said you cant smoke in here he pointed to a no smoking sign to make his point and then he and bob walked down the lobby toward connecticut avenue they had just about reached the revolving door when two things happened almost at once a burly man in a business suit stepped in front of the door to keep them from using it and another burly man came out of one of the elevators and quickly walked down the lobby toward connecticut avenue he looked as if he were talking to his lapel im going down there delores said to kate somethings going on the burly man who had been talking to his lapel went through the revolving door but when delores and kate approached it the burly man who had kept herb and bob from going outside stepped into their path he flashed some sort of credentials in their face united states secret service would you ladies please stand over there for just a minute he pointed to where herb and bob were standing looking through a window beside the revolving door onto the sidewalk kate and delores moved beside them after a moment kate tapped herb on the shoulder and he politely let her move in front of him so that she could get a better look there was a taxi stand on connecticut avenue with four cabs lined up in it a uniformed policeman gestured impatiently for them to move when they had done so a yukon with red and blue lights flashing behind its grille pulled up not into the space just vacated but into the lanethe streetjust outside it then another yukon with flashing lights pulled into what had been the taxi lane followed by two limousines which also had flashing red and blue lights behind their grilles what had been the taxi lane was now filled next came another limousine this one a stretch limousine without flashing lights it pulled into the space reserved for vehicles discharging or picking up passengers a burly man spoke into his lapel and then opened the rear door of the limousine a moment later a line of men came through the revolving door and quickly entered the limousine theres ten of them delores announced i counted them i wonder who they are bob mused aloud the burly man closed the door and the stretch limousine pulled away from the curb what happened next occurred so quickly that no one but delores could keep up with it limousines and yukons kept pulling up to the curb and then backing out of itor going forward onto connecticut avenue and then backing up as passengerssome of them women and some of them carrying submachine gunsgot into the various vehicles and then sometimes out of them you know what that looks like herb bob said that automated packagedistribution machine fedex showed us in kansas city except this is for people you know bob it does herb said thoughtfully he then gestured with his hands miming fedexs automated system which had apparently impressed him with its ability to move a lot of things in different directions at the same time the vice president came through one of the revolving doors and was hustled into one of the limousines with the flashing lights and then the secretary of state came through the revolving door and was hustled into hers there was a wail of sirens and then it was suddenly all over all the vehicles were gone and so were all the secret service people i will be damned herb said that was something and you didnt want to stay here delores said you said it was too expensive three the presidents study the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc april when the vice presidents car reached where we were standing mr president just outside the main gate secret service special agent mark douglas reported it stopped and the rear window went down vice president montvale said the four limousines are with me so i let them pass did you see who was in them president clendennen asked yes mr president to doublecheck so to speak i stopped each one and opened the door and had a look and the president asked impatiently there were eight men mostly caucasianmostly latinos i judgedand some afroamericans in each of the first two limousines the third one had mr dantonthe reporter from the washington timespostand mr parker in it just them the last limo was empty and then what happened the convoy moved directly to the grave site to the road near it and everybody got out and the vice president and the secretary of state got out and walked to where you and the other dignitaries were standingwhere you were waiting for the whatchamacallit the caisson with the casket to come down the road and the people in the limousines mr danton followed the vice president and secretary cohen and mr parker the president asked softly i didnt see him there anymore i guess he didnt get out of the limousine i did see him later get to later later the president interrupted him what about the people in the limousines yes sir mr president well they got out of the limos and arranged themselves in a line where they could watch what was going to happen at the grave while they were doing that a woman with a couple of kids walked up to them they all knew her and gathered around her and did you learn who this woman was yes sir when i told supervisory agent mulligan about the limousines he told me to find out who they were i went there and asked and they said they were he interrupted himself to consult a notebook from the american legion from china post number one of the american legion the guy who told me that showed me his american legion card and did you have a chance to overhear any of their conversations no sir i mean i stuck around to do that but they werent speaking english chinese probably i guess but they called the woman mrs ferris and i put that together shes the wife of the officer who was kidnapped in mexico when the guy they buried got shot they all spoke chinese im not sure if it was chinese mr president but it certainly wasnt english a couple of them started speaking spanish supervisory agent mulligans orders to me were to stick around find out where they went but one of thema guy they called colonelpointed to me and they stopped speaking that and went back to chinese or whatever it was and when the interment was over what happened as soon as you gave mrs salazar the flag they got in the limousines and left mrs ferris and the kids went with them they didnt stay for my remarks no sir they got in the limousines and left like supervisory agent mulligan told me to do i got in one of our yukons and followed them where did they go to the mayflower hotel sir that was where i saw mr parker again he and mr danton were with them and did you follow them into the hotel yes sir mr president they went to the tenth floor after a whilei didnt want them to know i was following themi went up there they were in roomi guess suite when a couple of waiters started rolling in carts of food i got a look in it was them all right did you manage to learn who was registered in suite yes sir mr president i got that from the waiters special agent douglas consulted his notebook again suite is registered to a german guy his name is karl von und zu gossinger the waiters told me he lives there i mean he keeps the suite all the time anything else like supervisory agent mulligan told me to i got him on the radio and he said to come here that you wanted to talk to me and i did indeed you did very well agent what did you say your name was douglas mr president special agent mark douglas special agent douglas would you wait outside for a moment i may have a few more questions yes sir mr president supervisory special agent mulligan followed douglas to the door and closed it after douglas had gone through it special agent douglas is not a nuclear physicist is he the president said how the hell did he get in the secret service he was a new jersey state trooper mr president mulligan said hes not too swift i admit but hes reliable i was thinking he might be useful now that we know what i suspected was going on is going on and they dont seem to care that i know do they montvale himself that sonofabitch and cohenim a gentleman and i wont say out loud what i think of heractually took those special forces people to arlington he paused and shook his head as if in disbelief and then went on where they walked out before i made my remarks an insult and they damn well knew it goddamn and they had colonel castillo with them that was him right yes sir that was castillo and colonel torine was there too mulligan clemens mccarthy asked who is this german man whats his involvement in this his real name is castillo clemens the president answered for him or maybe his real name is goldfinger or whatever mulligans rocket scientist said as to his involvement in whats going on hes up to his ears in it he probably thinks president montvale will make him director of national intelligence or secretary of defense but back to my original thought do you agree mulligan that your man who looks to me like he has a strong back takes orders and can keep his mouth shut would be useful to us yes i do mr president well then get him back in here and see if schmidt is out there director schmidt is out there mr president mulligan replied i saw him just now you want him to come in when im through with dumbo the president said yes mr president special agent douglas said your first name is mark right yes sir would you mind if i called you that id be honored mr president sir well mark supervisory special agent mulligan tells me that hes had his eye on you for some time and mr mccarthy agrees with me that you did a fine job today showing high intelligence discretion and perseverance special agent douglass face colored and we need someone with those characteristics around here right around me clendennen said the first thing i require of people in my intimate circle mark is loyalty or phrased another way i absolutely cannot stand disloyalty you can have the other things i mentioned but if loyalty is not your strong point i can understand that mr president douglas said supervisory special agent mulligan tells me he thinks you have that loyalty understand the need for it so im going to take a chance on you yes sir from this moment mark you are relieved of all your normal duties you will be reporting directly to supervisory special agent mulligan who will explain to you what your duties will be nowand this is important markfor a number of reasons we want to keep your special assignment from becoming public knowledge im sure you can understand that yes sir mr president clendennen rose and offered douglas his hand welcome aboard mark we all expect great things from you i will try my best mr president thank you mr president okay mark you can wait for mr mulligan in the outer office and while youre out there you can tell mr schmidt he can come in good afternoon mr president fbi director mark schmidt said did you see those people standing with colonel castillo at arlington the president asked without any preliminaries the ones who looked like they just might be special forces maybe even delta or gray fox schmidt replied smiling yes i did mr president and did you see them insult their commander in chief by getting in their limousines and driving off before i had finishedhell before i had started to make my remarks no sir im afraid i didnt tell him clemens the president said they got into their limousines and left before the president had a chance to even begin his remarks the press secretary said mr president i just dont think it was an intentional insult i cant believe theyd knowingly much less purposefully theres a good deal going on here mr director that youd have trouble believing if i told you they went from the cemetery to the mayflower where a couple of minutes ago they were in suite what did dumbo say the room number was mulligan tenohtwo mr president what i want you to do mr director is get a team of your people over there right now with cameras movie cameras would be better but if that cant be arranged on such short notice the regular kind will have to do try not to be seen of course i want a picture of every last one of those sonsofbitches i want each picture to show when and where it was taken in such form that will stand up in court and of course i want to have each of them identified name rank serial number where theyre assigned schmidt looked at him in disbelief mr president may i respectfully suggest that you may be overreacting i dont want to argue with you about this mr director what i want you to do is say yes sir then do what i tell you to do yes sir schmidt said and when you have assembled all these photographs and the information i want you to personally bring them here and give them to mulligan ill get right on it mr president schmidt said and i dont want this spread all over the j edgar hoover building i dont want anybody who is not directly involved to know anything about it got it yes mr president schmidt said now what have you done about el paso did you place the advertisement those people asked for the fbi has a very good man in el paso mr president schmidt said the sac the what the special agent in charge mr president his name is william johnson hes the man who intercepted the second message to general mcnab and instead of sending it to washington sent it to mcnab i didnt see it until the next day i dont want that to happen again mr schmidt there was a brief hesitation before schmidt went on sac johnson placed the classified advertisement in el diario de el paso the spanish language newspaper did you hear what i said about wanting any messages addressed to general mcnab that the fbi discovers to be sent to me immediately mr president what i can do should another fedex or ups envelope addressed to general mcnab be uncovered is immediately photocopy the envelope and its contents and send those to you i dont want copies i want the real thing mr president there is no provision in the law permitting that well you and attorney general crenshaw are clever people in his case maybe a little too clever and im sure youll be able to find a provision schmidt did not reply having decided he was going to drop this in the lap of attorney general crenshaw and let him deal with it he went on what sac johnson also did mr president is investigate the post office boxpo box mentioned in the kidnappers first message when he learned that it had not been rented he rented it its possible the kidnappers knew that box had been rented hes looking into that which postal employees would have knowledge of that perhaps the kidnappers intend to send further communications to po box on the other hand it may be just a coincidence whatever means these people use to communicate with us i want to see whatever they send immediately you understand that schmidt nodded yes mr president i intend to get this colonel ferris back and i have no intention of letting anyone get in my way whether through stupidity or ineptness or anything else yes mr president schmidt said that will be all thank you the president turned to mulligan just as soon as the director has gone get the secretary of defense on the phone four office of the commanding general us special operations command fort bragg north carolina april when the red telephone on his desk buzzed and a red led on it began to flash lieutenant general bruce j mcnab put his hand on it i wonder what message general naylor is about to relay to me from the deity he said to colonel max caruthers and then he pushed the loudspeaker button before picking up the handset and putting it to his ear mcnab i have just been on the telephone with secretary beiderman general allan b naylor announced without any preliminaries yes sir general i am not in any mood to tolerate any of your wit sarcasm or more important obfuscations if i were you id keep that in mind yes sir ill keep that in mind may i inquire into what you think i have done to displease secretary beiderman you will answer my questions general i will take none from you yes sir you will recall my telling you personally as a result of secretary beidermans orders to me to do so that you were not even to contemplate any military action with regard to freeing colonel ferris yes sir i remember your personally telling me that mcnab parroted and do you also recall that i ordered you not to attend the interment of warrant officer salazar yes sir i remember that very well may i say that i have not even been contemplating any action with regard to freeing colonel ferris mcnab parroted and that i did not attend mr salazars interment instead you send a delegation of delta force and gray fox personnel does that about sum it up i did not send a delegation of delta force and gray fox personnel anywhere general mcnab parroted again this time naylor picked up on it goddamn you mcnab dont you mock me its hard to resist allan goddamn you how dare you use my first name thats twice that youve cursed me allan mcnab said wouldnt you agree thats conduct unbefitting a general officer and a gentleman the flashing red led on the telephone died indicating the connection had been broken mcnab replaced the handset and looked at colonel caruthers ninety seconds he said maybe a little less caruthers shook his head in disbelief or maybe admiration sixtytwo seconds later the red telephone buzzed and the red led started flashing mcnab took a lot longer to pick it up than he had the first time but finally put the handset to his ear mcnab please accept my sincere apologies general mcnab naylor said i will providing you start acting like one old soldier talking to another old soldierand a classmate which puts us on a firstname basisand tell me exactly why beiderman chewed your ass to the point where you lost your cool there was a long pause and colonel caruthers had just about decided the led was about to stop blinking again when general naylor said bruce charley was at arlington im not surprised danny salazar was on the first a team charley ever commanded but i didnt send him up there allan i havent talked to him since before these mexican slime murdered salazar and i didnt send the others either i didnt even know they were going and then they all drove away just when the president was about to deliver his remarks naylor said and their departure was on wolf news for the whole world to see thanks to andy mcclarren whats the president pissed off about that they were there or that they walked out on his speech both and its worse than that are you alone max caruthers is here there was another long pause i hope that silence doesnt mean you dont trust max mcnab said finally no offense intended colonel caruthers naylor said actually what i was doing was rethinking whether i wanted to tell general mcnab what im about to tell you both which is the president seems to believe that whatever happened that saw ambassador montvale named vice president was the first step in a coup detat thats absurd i admit that it has a certain appeal but that anyone was planning a coup is simply not true mcnab said people believe what they want to believe naylor said do i have to say whom he views as coconspirators where did you get this allan mcnab asked softly and again there was a long pause before naylor replied natalie cohen he said finally and i ran it past frank lammelle he confirmed it hes insane mcnab said not lammelle clendennen naylor didnt reply to that what natalie suggests is that all of us do nothing that could possibly give him a chance to ask fordemandour resignations natalie always keeps her head natalie suggests that his plan is to get rid of us one by one and says that john david parker was the first one to go that seems pretty clear mcnab said it seems pretty clear bruce that youre next on the list naylor said beiderman made it obvious that he would support me if i relieved you at specopscom or even announced your retirement what does he think of this coup detat nonsense i dont know if he knows about it or not or if he does know his reaction to it i think his primary motivation is to keep his job which brings us to what do i tell him about charley and your people being at arlington where they walked out on the presidents speech to get me out of here would require that you have proof i did something i should not have done or not done something i should have done and my skirts are clean here allan i have not been in touch with charleyi told you this beforesince before danny salazar was murdered i did not suggest that he go to arlington i knew he probably would be there sure but i had nothing to do with his going bruce what about the delta force people how do i explain to beiderman that fifteen or twenty of your people showed up there without your knowledge when all else fails tell the truth those mensome of them commissioned officers some of them warrant officers and the rest senior noncomsare not pfcs who have to knock on the orderly room door to ask the first sergeant for a pass so long as they are available for dutydepending on their alert statusimmediately or on one hours notice or six hours or twentyfour hoursthey are free to go anywhere they please now i dont know this and you might not want to tell beiderman this but what i strongly suspect happened here is that after you shoved burying her husband at arlington down mrs salazars throat that was not my idea bruce the president to use your phraseology shoved it down secretary beidermans throat and he shoved it down mine whereupon you obediently shoved it down mrs salazars and after you did i think that she called charley and charleynever forget hes one of us allandecided that the best thing all aroundfor the good of the service comes to mindwas to resist what must have been a hell of a temptation for him to tell her to tell you and the president to go to hell and insist that her husband be buried in san antonio national cemetery he probably told her he was going to be at arlington and that if any of the people in the stockade wanted to go hed have them picked up at the fayetteville regional airport by jake torine or dick miller and flown back there when the interment was over he has several airplanes and the wherewithal to charter more so i suspect that the reason they left arlington right after the funeral was to get to the airport so that they could come back here after a long silent moment naylor said ill buy everything but hurrying to the airport what they did was go to that suite charley keeps at the mayflower theyre having sort of a wake as we speak according to beiderman the partys still going on and again according to beiderman roscoe danton and john david parker are among the mourners which will tend to convince the president even more of the coup detat conspiracy mcnab said precisely well thats what i will tell the secretary of defense that you knew nothing about charley castillos presence at arlington and havent been in touch with him since before this mess started i dont have much hope that hell believe me your skirts are clean allan you issued the orders you were told to issue and made sure they were carried out it isnt that blackandwhite though is it naylor asked thoughtfully very little is ever either black or white allan there was another pause and then naylor said you said something before what you suggested the president was insane oh for christs sake that was a figure of speech and you know it naylor didnt reply i have allan on many occasions going all the way back to our unhappy days at hudson high called you chickenshit you knew i didnt think you were really fecal matter excreted from the anus of a gallus domesticus when i accused our lunatic president of being crazy i was what if he is bruce naylor asked softly mcnab took a long time to reply well that would certainly explain a hell of a lot wouldnt it jesus h christ colonel caruthers said softly if you think about it not only this coup detat nonsense mcnab said but i think we had all better stop right here naylor said that wont work im afraid allan mcnab said youve let a very ugly genie out of your bottle hes not going to go back in there was another long pause and then mcnab said allan i dont think id mention this part of our conversation to secretary beiderman what i think we should all do is wipe the last ninety seconds of this conversation from our minds naylor said that wont work either im afraid mcnab said for two reasons first i dont think any of us could second weve all taken an oath to defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and i think a president who has done what this one has doneis doingcan be fairly characterized as a threat to the constitution another long pause ensued before naylor asked for the time being can we agree this conversation goes no further than it has yes sir mcnab said yes sir caruthers said thank you naylor said the red led stopped blinking vi one hacienda santa maria oaxaca province mexico april as soon as castillo took off his headset lester bradley who was sitting with max in the backseat of the cessna mustang handed him the headset from castillos brick castillo put it to his ear yeah frank something wrong with the net the new net lammelle asked it took me almost four minutes to get you to answer i try not to talk on a cell phone when im flying fifteen feet above the ocean castillo said it tends to distract me where the hell are you i just landed at the family ranch in mexico about fifty miles from acapulco whats up you free to talk nobody here but sweaty and lester and they both know allwell almost allof my secrets i have to know why were you flying fifteen feet above the ocean because that way the radar at xoxocotlan and bahias de huatulco international airports cant see me landing at the family ranch next question makes sense lammelle said my answers generally do now is there something else youd like to chat about before i get out of my airplane mark schmidt came to see me just now he needed my help he said to identify some of the people in the pictures his intrepid agents took on the tenth floor of the mayflower yesterday afternoon and early this morning the fbi took pictures of people at the wake what the hells that all about the president ordered it schmidt is to identify everyone who was in the hotelemphasis on the guys from braggdown to name rank serial number and organization and deliver samewith their picturesto the president personally and to tell no one correct me if im wrong but the last time i heard being at a private party is not against the law i dont know what clendennen is up to charley the point here i think the reason schmidt came to me was not to get me to identify anybody but to let me know what the president had ordered him to do follow castillo thought a moment and then said i have never been able to really figure schmidt out he wanted me to know about this nutty order but he didnt want to tell me anyway i identified you and torine and miller and other people i would be expected to know but i couldnt seem to recognize any of the gray fox or delta guys it just occurred to me that clendennen will now have an unclassified box of pictures of about a third of the guys in the stockade i dont like that if you can figure it out let me know but speaking of picturesthis is the real reason i calledthere is a new senior cultural affairs officer at the embassy of the russian federation in bogota his name is valentin komarovski oh the reason theyre calling him the senior cultural affairs guy is that he will supervise their cultural affairs guys in venezuela panama costa rica nicaragua honduras and guatemala so who is he really frank sergei murov i believe you know him are you sure senor komarovski traveled to his new duty station via havana on iberia where his picture was taken by a disaffected castroite and passed on to our guy in the uruguayan embassy our guy wondered why a senior russian dip didnt travel aeroflot to miami and make his connection therecatch the colombian airline aero republicainstead of waiting ten hours to catch the next cubana flight to bogota maybe he didnt want to pass through miami and be recognized castillo grunted lammelle went on so by the time senor komarovski arrived in bogota our guy at the airport there had plenty of time to make sure the lighting was in place to take pictures of him arriving the images were here minutes later and one of the guys in the lab recognized him from murovs days as the rezident here he brought the pics to meis that who i think it is just to be sure i ran them through the comparison lab its murov all right or the russians are now cloning people so you have your headsup charley i dont think he likes you and i know he doesnt like your girlfriend im more worried frank about the pictures of the guys from the stockade getting out id really hate to think i was responsible for that happening you cant do anything about that charley you cant stop the president from doing anything he wants to with those pictures what the hell does he want them for hes too smart a politician to try to punish a bunch of soldiers for holding a wake for one of their own he doesnt want roscoe going on wolf news with a story like that i dont think anyone knows what clendennen will do next or why lammelle said but in this case i think maybe hell show them to the secretary of defense get beiderman to lean on naylor to get rid of mcnab who commands the people who a went to arlington when he had made it clear he didnt want that and b insulted potus by walking out on his speech that doesnt make any sense a good deal potus does doesnt make sense if you think about it charley castillo didnt reply well as i said youve got your headsup about murov stay in touch whoa castillo said natalie cohen told me she told you that you could have that policia federal black hawk that miraculously appeared on the dock at norfolk why do i think im not going to like what comes next could you move it to a secure locationnot too securein texas near san antone maybe what are you planning charley at the moment not a thing but life is full of surprises isnt it you never know whats going to happen do you goodbye colonel castillo retired nice talking to you ill take that as a yes thank you frank im beginning to understand why clendennen wanted to load you on an aeroflot flight to moscow the led stopped flashing two hacienda santa maria oaxaca province mexico april the sprawling redtileroofed house with a wide shaded veranda all around it sat on a bluff overlooking the pacific ocean a circular drive led to it from the acres of grapefruit trees running as far as the eye could see to the east the house was known as don fernandos house but the reference was to don fernando lopez the elder rather than to the don fernando lopez who now sat on the veranda facing away from the pacific holding a bottle of dos equis beer in his massive fist beside him on cushioned wicker couches and chairs were his cousin carlos castillo don armando medina a swarthy heavyset sixtyoddyearold who was el jefethe boss and general managerof hacienda santa maria sweaty stefan koussevitzky and lester bradley they were allexcept for lester who had a cokedrinking wine a cabernet sauvignon from bodegas san felipe which happened to be a subsidiary of hacienda santa maria max lay beside sweaty gnawing on a grapefruit he held between his paws fernando lopez and carlos castillo were grandsons of don fernando castillo who had married alicia lopez hacienda santa maria had been her dowry don fernando and dona alicia had had two children maria elena who had married manuel lopezno relationand jorge alejandro who had been killed in the vietnam war as a very youngnineteen years oldman manuel and maria elena lopez had three children fernando graciella and juanita don fernando castillo had strained relations with the lopez family into which his daughter had married but had been exceedingly fond of his grandson fernando he and dona alicia had agreed that on their deaths hacienda santa maria would go to fernando and everything else would be given to charity and the alamo foundation i dont want to spend all of eternity spinning in my grave thinking of the lopez wetbacks squandering all our money he declared all of that had changed a quarter century before when an army officer thenmajor allan b naylor appeared in dona alicias office in the alamo foundation building with the photograph of a twelveyearold blond blueeyed boy and said there was good reason to believe he was the outofwedlock son of the late warrant officer junior grade jorge alejandro castillo don fernando castillos first reaction to this was that some kraut frauleindon fernando had been major f j castillo of combat command a rd armored division during world war ii and had had some experience with kraut frauleins in the immediate postwar periodhad learned who the castillo family was and intended like the lopez wetbacks to get her hands into the castillo cash box by passing off somebody elses bastard son as the fruit of their jorges loins dona alicia had had no such doubts one look at the boys eyes had been enough to convince her that she was looking at a picture of her grandson on hearing from major naylor that the boys mother was in the final stages of pancreatic cancer she picked up the telephone and called lemes aviation ordering them to ready the company learjet so that she and major naylor could make the pan american flight from new york to frankfurt late that same afternoon not two weeks later equipped with a us passport in the name of carlos guillermo castillo karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger arrived in san antonio a week after that his mother died and he became the sole heir to the vast business empire known as gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh the new situation required modification of the last will and testaments of don fernando and dona alicia legal counsel informed them that there would be problems if carlos were to inherit half of hacienda santa maria mexican law did not permit foreigners to own property in the united states of mexico don fernando was aware of this when maria elenas time had come she had flown to mexico city where fernando had been born he himself had been born on hacienda san dominic the castillo farm near guadalajara and dona alicia on hacienda santa maria not a problem don fernando announced theyre like brothers theyll work it out between them carlos and fernando had almost immediatelyfrankly surprising both their grandparentsbecome close and inseparable fernando called carlos gringo and carlos called fernando fatso fernando and charley were sitting with svetlana stefan koussevitzky lester bradley and don armando medina on the veranda as two brown suburbans with policia federal insignia on their doors kicked up a dust cloud coming up the road through the grapefruit groves to the house the front doors of both vehicles opened simultaneously a trim neatly uniformed federale holding a car in his hands as if he knew what to do with it got out of the lead vehicle well castillo thought despite what don armando said about us being old friends i wouldnt have recognized juan carlos if id fallen over him a stout balding man in civilian clothing a thick black cigar clutched firmly in his teeth got out of the second suburban a colt model a in a skeleton holster was on his belt who the hell is he ill be damned thats juan carlos last time i saw him he looked like a model in an advertisement for mens cologne now he looks like well a fat mexican cop juan carlos pena el jefe of the policia federal for the province of oaxaca waved cheerfully and with the cigar still in his mouth called in perfect american english carlos you sonofabitch how the fuck are you then he walked quickly onto the veranda and the moment castillo stood up wrapped him in an affectionate hug castillo saw that fernando was smiling and knew it was not at the display of affection but rather at castillos discomfiture good to see you juan carlos castillo said where the hell did he get that cologne and what did he do pour it on how the hell long has it been juan carlos said too fucking long thats for goddamn sure how about a glass of wine juan carlos castillo asked in spanish or something stronger a little jack daniels would go down nicely juan carlos said continuing in english but not until after i meet the girlfriend youre right fernando shes spectacular swe susanna say hello to an old friend juan carlos pena hola sweaty said nice to meet you susanna barlow and this is stefan koussevitzky castillo said and this is lester bradley my grandmother sent him down to see if he can straighten out the haciendas computers max instinctively stood up sweaty laid a gentle hand on the dogs back and in hungarian said its okay baby what the fuck is that juan carlos said ive ridden smaller horses meet max castillo said juan carlos looked at svetlana what was that language you was speaking hungarian im uruguayan but my parents immigrated there from hungary juan carlos nodded i noticed the funny accent im surprised you dont know theres three kinds of spanish juan carlos castillo said castilianspanishspanish southern conethe spanish spoken in uruguay argentina and chile and the spanish spoken in mexico central america and the rest of south america susanna speaks the southern cone variety i heard that juan carlos said uruguay huh is that where you two met yeah castillo said a maid appeared and fernando told her to bring whiskey so juan carlos asked what brings you to hacienda santa maria senorita barlow before she could reply juan carlos added barlow doesnt sound very hungarian if you dont mind my saying so it used to be borocz sweaty said which no one could pronounce much less spell in spanish so we changed it you were telling me what youre doing here juan carlos said stefan and i are looking at those sweaty said pointing to the grapefruit grove when carlos told us his family was in the citrus businessi have some pastureland im thinking of convertingand then that he was coming here i imposed on his hospitality really imposed on it i brought a half a dozen citrus experts with me stefans the experts expert i didnt know they grow grapefruit in uruguay juan carlos said they dont grow much but some maybe i can change that and your experts expert is another hungarian koussevitzky doesnt sound like hes a native of uruguay actually im israeli koussevitzky said or was now im an uruguayan citizen they grow grapefruit in israel all the citrus fruits ourtheirbiggest market is italy and france koussevitzky said ill be damned i never heard that juan carlos said and then asked what were you doing in uruguay carlos i was an assistant military attache of the american embassy assistant military attache huh juan carlos parroted sounds pretty snazzy its what the army does with officers who are not going to get promoted and dont have enough time in to retire castillo said they send them to an embassy until they have enough time the only good thing about it was that i met susanna in montevideo so youre retired now juan carlos said the maid came to them with a bottle of jack daniels and accoutrements on a tray when she poured the tennessee whiskey into a glass juan carlos gestured for her to add more jack daniels is like sex he announced you can never get enough so is gold sweaty said juan carlos looked at her and smiled i like her carlos he said raising his glass and taking a healthy swallow what i cant figure out is what a redhead like that sees in a skinny gringo like you its been a long time juan carlos castillo said but i think i can still kick your ass juan carlos looked at him for a moment and then smiled and said ill bet you could you know im just kidding red right carlos wasnt sweaty said he considered that for a moment smiled and said so youre retired now huh for a couple of months i was thinking that the last time i saw you was when you had just graduated from west point you were a second lieutenant about to go to flight school i guess thats right castillo said he thought my ol pal juan carlos didnt come here for auld lang syne he came here to find out whats going on here at hacienda santa maria he may have even heard about the exspetsnaz citrus experts heard about but not seen fernando flew them here onto our strip and stefan told them to keep out of sight which means they did which means im being interrogated does juan carlos think i dont know that or doesnt care if i do and now youre a retired colonel retired lieutenant colonel castillo said i got passed over for promotion to colonel twice that was when they sent me to uruguay so what brings you to hacienda santa maria i think you know juan carlos i dont have a fucking clue carlos the army officer who was kidnapped jim ferris is a west point classmate of mine an old friend i thoughtfernando told me youre the commandant of the policia federal in oaxaca provinceyoud be the guy who would know maybe even tell me how i could help to get him back you want some good advice carlos thats what i came here for get in your airplane and go home better yet go back to uruguay before you and your friends get hurt you dont want to fuck with these people carlos theyre really bad news so ive heard fernando told me but i figured my old friend now a heavyduty federale could protect me your old friend has a tough time protecting himself juan carlos said you saw lieutenant gomez the guy with the car castillo nodded theres two more guys with cars in my suburban and four more of them in the other suburban i call them the american expresscause i never go anywhere without them dont you read the papers youre talking about the drug cartel people you bet your fucking ass i am ive been in uruguay theres drugs in uruguay the cops down there dont run around with cars pena looked at him as if he couldnt believe castillos naivete or stupidity or both well carlos let me tell you about the drugs here juan carlos said as opposed to in uruguay where the fuck is uruguay anyway on the other side of the river from buenos aires got you now juan carlos ol buddy rule seven in the uncle remus list of rules for the interrogation of belligerent bad guys make them think youre stupid and then let them show you how smart and knowledgeable they are let me try to sum it up this way carlos juan carlos said this stuff starts out when some campesino in bolivia or wherever the fuck sticks his knife in a flower a poppy and collects the goo that comes out or boils down the coca leaf the last stop is when some junkie in the states either sucks it up his nostrils or sticks it in his vein by then its either cocaine or heroin what are you telling me you think i dont know juan carlos held his now empty whiskey glass the maid took it put enough in it this time he said in spanish and then switched back to english shut your mouth for a fucking minute carlos and ill tell you what you dont know at every step from processing that shit so it becomes heroin or cocaine the price goes up way up you do understand that i wasnt born yesterday juan carlos you could have fooled me now the same thing is true in every step between the fields and the junkies nose the price goes up way way up by the time it gets close to the states now the people in this business as you can imagine are not very nice people dona alicia would not invite them to dinnerand on that subject thank you very much but i cant stay for dinner why not we havent even started walking down memory lane castillo said i got things to do carlos the only reason im here is to try because we go way back to warn you what youre fucking around with and to try to keep you alive i can keep myself alive thank you very much will you shut your fucking mouth and listen jesus christ castillo hoped the look he made indicated his feelings had been hurt proof that he had been successful came immediately for christs sake carlos im trying to help you juan carlos said almost compassionately sorry okay now except for what the junkies in the states pay for their one ounceor lesslittle bags of this shit its most valuable just before its sent over the border into the states by then its in bricks generally weighing a kilothats a little over two pounds some of the people taking it across the border after buying it at a stiff price from somebody who brought it from venezuela or colombia and running the risk that wed catch them while they were moving it from south mexico to the border decided it would be safer and a hell of a lot cheaper to just steal it from some other trafficker and the way to do that was just kill the other trafficker let their bosses just guess who stole it and the way to keep the police from interfering with the movement do one of two things pay off the policecarlos you have no fucking idea how much fucking money is involved here we grab some of these people with two three hundred grand sometimes more in their pockets and then they realized that it would be cheaper to kill the police who were getting close than to pay them off no shit castillo said wonderingly no shit so what we have is war here carlos one ground of drug moversthey call themselves cartelskilling each other to steal or protect the product whether its cocaine or meth or heroin and all of them perfectly willing to kill the police i dont know where its going to end i know the good guys aint winning now as to your friend i heard two stories and i dont know which one to believe the first is that they just got in the way by that i mean theyd been responsible for usthe policia federal or the american dea or border patrol grabbing shipments since these shipments are worth hundreds of thousands of dollarssometimes millionsthis made them mad so they had to be killed the second story i heard is that they want to swap your colonel for a man named felix abrego hes doing life without the possibility of parole in that maximumsecurity prison of yours whats it called the words florence maximum were almost on castillos lips when he caught himself shrugged and asked leavenworth no juan carlos said sorry i was a soldier not a policeman but i do know juan carlos that its firm american policy not to do something like that the taliban tried it on us in afghanistan and it was decided that if we florence juan carlos interrupted him the florence admax its in colorado never heard of it what they do there carlos is lock you up alone around the clock except for one hour a day when they let you out of your cell to exercise alone in what looks like a dog kennel you get a shower every other day sounds like fun what do you have to do to get sent there abrego shot a few dea agents juan carlos said in the states near el paso they caught him he didnt get the death penalty i always thought if you killed a cop you got the electric chair well ill explain to you how that works in real life carlos we havent had the death penalty in mexico since if a mexican in the states gets the hot seat thats bad for our friendly relations mexican politicians fall all over themselves rushing up there to save him and we dont extradite peopleneither do the french by the wayto any place that executes people so the way it works here if senor abrego had shot one of my people and got caughtthat happens every once in a whileand he got tried and convictedthat also happens every once in a whilehe would have gotten life and in a couple of years after a lot of money changed hands he would escape so to speak jesus castillo said hoping he sounded as if he was shocked to the depths of his naive soul juan carlos nodded so the way its worked out is that your judges sentence mexicans who deserve the electric chair to life without parole in florence that keeps the bad guys off the streets almost as well as the electric chairnobody has ever escaped from florenceand keeps mexican politicians from making members of your congress unhappy getting the picture i never heard any of this before castillo said i never would have guessed juan carlos said sarcastically look carlos there is some good news you dont fuck with these people they dont fuck with you what im saying is theres not a goddamn thing you can do for your friend the colonel except get yourself killed let whoever deals with things like swapping prisonersthe fbi maybe or dea try to get him back you start nosing around youre going to get yourself killed and probably him too can you understand that yeah i guess i can castillo said reluctantly but juan carlos if you could find out anything sure if i hear anything ill let you know by mail i suppose if i sent a letter to arizona boulevard san antonio texas i remember dona alicias address ive got a good memory for addresses and numbers things like that shed get it to you right im sure she would even with you in uruguay which is really where i hope youll be whats your address down there anyway shit now what i dont have an address in uruguay rule onethe first and great commandmentin the uncle remus list of rules for the interrogation of belligerent bad guys never ever underestimate the bad guy if youre going to send a letter to carlos down there sweaty said send it in care of mesenorita susanna barlow golf and polo country club km panamericana pilar buenos aires province argentina wait let me write that down he took a notebook and ballpoint from his shirt pocket then he asked argentina i thought you said uruguay we farm in uruguay sweaty said we play polo in argentina its only half an hour in the plane from uruguay polo huh you play polo carlos frankly sweaty said hes not very good at it barlow is spelled barlow you want the phone number the country code is zero one one i wont be calling juan carlos interrupted it probably costs ten dollars a minute to call down there closer to seven dollars actually sweaty said juan carlos put his notebook back in his shirt pocket well like i said i have things to do he said he drained his glass nodded at everybody and then draped his arm around castillos shoulder pay attention to what i told you carlos i really want to keep you alive i know castillo said its just that i wanted to help if i could the best way for you to help is go to uruguay or argentina go work on your polo game in argentina carlos juan carlos pena punched castillo painfully in the upper arm shook fernandos hand nodded at the others then quickly walked off the porch and got into his suburban ninety seconds later both policia federal vehicles had disappeared in a dirt cloud down the road through the grapefruit orchards castillo filled his wineglass then said comments solicited a dangerous man former svr major stefan koussevitzky said but i think he really likes carlos former svr lieutenant colonel svetlana alekseeva said that makes him less dangerous koussevitzky challenged i didnt say that she said are you interested in what i think don armando medina asked of course castillo said some of the things he said were absolutely true if you dont get in the way of the drug cartel people they leave you alone we have had no trouble with them they arent stealing our grapefruit castillo quipped one of their bricks of cocaine is worth more than an eighteenwheeler trailer load of grapefruit thats another thing juan carlos said thats true the amount of money involved is nearly unbelievable i was hoping i could get him talking more about the people involved he suggested everybody involved is mexican he came here to tell you as little as possible beyond butt out or die fernando said and thats just what he did you think our ol buddy is in with the drug people hes alive isnt he then why did he come here at all like sweaty said he likes you and he was probably curiousprofessionallywhy you showed up here and do you think i convinced him im just an old soldier trying to help out an old classmate yeah fernando said after a moment dont let this go to your head gringo but that was quite a performance you stefan and sweaty were pretty convincing looking stupid is easy for me castillo said but sweaty sweetheart i could have kissed you when he asked for an address in uruguay and you came up with golf and polo ive got a good memory for addresses and numbers things like that sweaty quoted you can kiss me later so now what now we get in the mustang and go to cozumel and catch tomorrows peruairecargo flight to chile why are we going to do that i want aleksandr to understand that whacking sergei murov or any of his people without asking me first is not one of his options youre going to have trouble with that koussevitzky said hes convinced the best way to protect himself is to eliminate anybody vladimir vladimirovich sends over here if he takes out anybody ferris will die castillo said stefans right sweaty said aleksandr will be genuinely sorry about that but hell think of your friends passing as unavoidable collateral damage well ill just have to talk him out of thinking that way castillo said sweetheart your call we either leave right now or very early in the morning why cant we have dinner first and then leave she asked because i suspect juan carlos is going to have the radar operators at bahias de huatulco international airport report to him when any airplanes take off from here if we take off after dark hell know the runway is lighted and i dont want him to know that then dinner here looking down at the ocean sweaty said without hesitation afterward we can walk on the beach holding hands are you going to take stefan and his citrus experts with you don armando asked castillo nodded stefan yes but if you dont think the citrus experts pose a danger to hacienda santa maria id like to leave them here i may need them later on three the presidents study the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc april fbi director mark schmidt presidential press secretary clemens mccarthy and supervisory secret service agent robert j mulligan were already in the room when secretary of defense frederick k beiderman walked in beiderman nodded at them and said good morning mr president weve been waiting for you president joshua ezekiel clendennen said as he rose from his small working desk he walked to a library table on one side of the room take a look at what we have to show you clendennen gestured to mulligan who handed mccarthy a large manila envelope mccarthy walked to the table opened the envelope and took from it a sheaf of eightbyteninch color photographs as if laying out a hand of solitaire he laid them one at a time side by side in four rows on the table when he was finished the table was nearly covered clendennen gestured for beiderman to examine the pictures he did so then raised his head and asked exactly what am i looking at mr president these photographs were taken yesterday afternoon outside suite in the mayflower hotel mccarthy said they were taken by fbi photographers so they will stand up as evidence in court if it ever comes to that clendennen amplified yes sir who are these people mr president dont tell me you couldnt pick anyone you know from them well sir i of course recognize roscoe danton and colonel castillo retired lieutenant colonel castillo you mean yes sir and what about my former press secretary porky parker did you recognize him yes sir of course but i dont recognize any of the others you didnt see any of them at arlington the day before yesterday maybe as they got into their limousines and drove off just as i was beginning my remarks i didnt make that connection sir who are they sir and what were they doing at the mayflower theyre soldiers five of them are commissioned officers seven of them are warrant officers and the remaining ten are senior noncommissioned officers they are all assigned to general mcnabs special operations command at fort braggto the delta force and gray fox components thereof yes sir as to what they were doing at the mayflower they were having a party the host was lieutenant colonel castillo retired i dont think i understand mr president beiderman said what i want you to do mr secretary president clendennen said is take these photographs to general naylor tell him to show them to general mcnab as proof that we know what hes up to sir please dont interrupt me beiderman the president said unpleasantly tell naylor to show these photographs to general mcnab and to tell mcnab that if he immediately applies for retirement that will be the end of it the end of what mr president mccarthy thinks the less we put into words at this time the better the president said for reasons that should be obvious to you im afraid theyre not mr president beiderman said frankly i dont understand any of this i think you do the president said icily the only thing i understand is that you want general mcnab to resign correct presumably in connection with this party in the mayflower mcnab will understand when general naylor shows him these pictures and aware that i am repeating myself tells him he can end this whole thing by immediately retiring and that will be the end of it the end of what whole thing sir if you give it some thought as youre traveling to centcom to see general naylor im sure it will come to you mr secretary call me the minute naylor has mcnabs request for retirement in hand clemens mccarthy bent over the table slid the photographs together stacked them neatly together and handed them to mulligan who returned them to the envelope and then handed the envelope to secretary beiderman president clendennen didnt seem to notice when beiderman left the room four office of the commander in chief united states central command macdill air force base tampa florida april colonel j d brewer pushed open the door and formally announced general naylor the secretary of defense naylor was out of his chair and on the way to the door before beiderman was halfway through it beiderman offered his hand mr secretary im a little uncomfortable not having been at the field dont be silly beiderman said i told colonel brewer i would prefer that you not meet me the less fuss about this the better yes sir wont you please sit down thank you beiderman said and looked askance at colonel brewer naylor caught that and said that will be all colonel thank you brewer left and closed the door behind him the implication was that secdef and cinc centcom were now alone the truthwhich really made naylor uncomfortablewas that he had ordered his senior aidedecamp to go into the sergeant majors office and listen to and record whatever was going to happen in his office can i offer coffee sir or something to eat or ask you to join me in my mess for lunch thank you no i had a sandwich on the plane general let me get right to it yes sir beiderman opened his attache case and took out a large manila envelope have a look general he said as he handed naylor the envelope the president gave me those just before he ordered me to come down here naylor took the sheaf of color photographs from the envelope and looked at each before raising his eyes to beiderman the president desires general beiderman said that you personally show those photographs to general mcnab tell him the president knows what hes up to and that if he immediately applies for retirement that will be the end of it naylor didnt reply i suggest the best way to accomplish the presidents desires is for us to immediately fly to fort bragg in separate aircraft once you have done what the president desires and have general mcnabs request for retirement in hand i will take it to the president and you can come back here and that will be the end of it again naylor didnt reply i will entertain your recommendations as to a replacement for general mcnab at specopscom beiderman said but i suspect the president has someone in mind for the post and once more naylor didnt reply did you understand what i just told you general naylor no mr secretary im afraid i didnt what didnt you understand general for one thing mr secretary the photographs who are they of and what are they supposed to show they were taken by fbi agents the day before yesterday in the mayflower hotel in dc they show a number of members of delta force and gray fox they were taken after these individuals walked out on the presidents remarks at arlington they were at a party given by retired lieutenant colonel castillo and what is the connection with general mcnab sir my god naylor general mcnab commands gray fox and delta force hes responsible for them mr secretary i have already discussed the presence of these soldiers at mr salazars interment with general mcnab he denies having anything to do with their being there he also tells me that he has not been in touch with colonel castillo since before mr salazar was murdered and colonel ferris kidnapped and you believe him yes sir i believe him nevertheless the president desires that general mcnab retire is that clear to you mr secretary may i speak freely of course mr secretary correct me if im wrong but wasnt there an implied threat in what you said before you said that if mcnab asks for immediate retirement that will be the end of it the end of what mr secretary if general mcnab declines to ask to be retired then what beiderman didnt reply for a long moment then he said general it is our duty to work together to get through this awkward situation that doesnt answer my question mr secretary then i suppose the president will fire him mr secretary did you see the photographs of mr roscoe danton in that stack beiderman nodded and of the presidents former press secretary mr parker beiderman nodded again mr secretary do you think potus has considered the very real possibility that if what he desires actually occurs then it will be a frontpage story in the washington timespost and all over wolf news and all over all the other media thanks to mr parker when beiderman didnt reply naylor went on wolf newsthe press generallywill have a field day with that mr secretary president clendennen fires top green beret because green berets walk out on his remarks at arlington funeral beiderman looked stricken mr secretary i suggest that you and i have a duty to protect the president from something like that both president clendennen personally and the office of potus wouldnt you agree yes of course are you open to suggestion mr secretary beiderman nodded if you and i fly to fort bragg right now mr secretary and comply with the presidents order to show mcnab these photographs and then offer him the opportunity to immediately resign the president didnt order me to go to fort bragg general beiderman interrupted he ordered me to come here to give you those goddamn pictures and order you to deal with general mcnab i beg your pardon sir you realize naylor that if a story like that comes out and since roscoe danton was at that goddamn party its a given that it will come out then you know who the president is going to blame sir apropos of nothing whatever im sure you will agree that when people lose their tempers they sometimes act irrationally what are you driving at general i wouldnt want to be quoted on this sir but while i can certainly understand the presidents anger at having mcnabs people walk out on his remarks there are those who might say his reaction to the insult was a bit irrational i dont like where this conversation appears to be going general sir when people anyone has a little time to think things over to realize that when they were angry they did some things said some things in the heat of anger that they wish they hadnt done or said jumping to the bottom line youre suggesting that in a day or two the president will cool off okay he probably will so what do we do today when you arrived here mr secretary i told you that i would comply with the presidents desires the moment general mcnab returned from afghanistan which should be in the next few days mcnab isnt in afghanistan he can be on his way to afghanistan in a very few minutes beiderman looked at him with his eyebrows raised when you call the president you could tell him that naylor said that general mcnab is on his way to afghanistan secretary beiderman considered that for a fullvery longthirty seconds and then said slide me the red phone sir why dont we wait until general mcnab is actually on his way to afghanistan that would be thirty seconds after i call him secretary beiderman considered that for anothervery longthirty seconds then he said make your call general naylor naylor picked up the headset of the red telephone and pushed one of the dozen buttons on its base put it on loudspeaker the secretary of defense ordered naylor said yes sir damn he thought the phone was immediately answered mcnab general naylor general yes sir are you alone general yes sir secretary beiderman is with me general yes sir potus sent him here with a stack of photographs of delta force and gray fox personnel at colonel castillos party in the mayflower after they walked out on the presidents remarks at arlington yes sir secretary beiderman has been ordered by potus to order me to show them to you general and then inform you it is the presidents desire that you immediately request retirement and that if you do that will be the end of it the end of what sir naylor hesitated and then said i think it would be best if you heard this from secretary beiderman general beidermans look of surpriseeven shockquickly turned into one of resignationhe had been had and he knew itand then into one of hate and loathing for a moment he just sat there and then he exhaled and leaned toward the red phone general the president seems to think you are involved in a conspiracy that will see him resign which would put vice president montvale in the oval office there was a long moment and then general mcnab said very softly mr secretary would you please repeat that i want to be absolutely sure i heard you correctly my god naylor thought mcnab knew right away not only whats going on but how to deal with it thank god after a moment beiderman repeated general the president seems to think you are involved in a conspiracy that will see him resign and would put vice president montvale in the oval office another pause and then mcnab said and you mr secretary do you think i have been or that i am involved in a coup detat such as you describe no of course i dont beiderman snapped but thats what the president apparently believes and thats what we have to deal with first mr secretary mcnab said let me categorically deny that i am now or ever have been involved in something like that and with equal emphasis let me say that i have no intention of requesting retirement at this time the president hasand for that matter as you well knowyou and general naylor havethe right to relieve me of command of specopscom at any time but for me to resign under the circumstances you have laid out would be a tacit admission that i have been involved in a coup detat and thats treason mr secretary now calm down general the secretary of defense said no ones accusing you of treason naylor began general mcnab treason is a violation of the uniform code of military justice mcnab interrupted him with cold anger in his voice i demand a courtmartial naylor thought please god mcnab dont get carried away no ones talking about a courtmartial general mcnab he said i am general what secretary beiderman and i have been talking about is that when potus has a chance over a few days to reconsider what must be honestly described as an overreaction to what happened at arlington and the mayflower an overreaction its insane thats what it is watch your choice of words general naylor ordered sharply youre speaking of the commander in chief yes sir mcnab said after a moment as i was saying secretary beiderman and i have been discussing the possibility that after a few days potus may reconsider and possibly even regret what can only be described as his loss of selfcontrol beiderman put in get out of dodge so to speak for a few days until this thing has a chance to blow over and where should i go for a few days until this thing this outrage this insanity blows over mcnab demanded if you were not at fort bragg general naylor said if you were not at fort bragg when secretary beiderman and i arrived with the packet of photographs go to afghanistan for christs sake beiderman snapped confer with your people there just be unavailable after a moment mcnab said yes sir mr secretary congratulations mr secretary naylor thought you are now a coconspirator the flashing led on the red telephone stopped flashing what the hell beiderman demanded incredulously did he hang up on us naylor held up his hand and then extended his arm and looked at his wristwatch precisely sixty seconds later he pushed a button on the red telephone the led began flashing specopscom a new voice come over the circuit general otoole speaking sir this is general naylor let me speak to general mcnab please sir im sorry hes not here where is he beiderman demanded sir hes on his way to afghanistan as soon as you can get in touch with him otoole have him call me naylor ordered that will probably take about an hour sir as soon as possible naylor said and hung up he met beidermans eyes and said done and now otoole knows all about this beiderman said no otooles the specopscom deputy commander mcnab would have to tell him he was going to afghanistan including the circumstances these circumstances beiderman asked so what do we do now general we wait to see what happens when potus gets his temper under control and if he doesnt if this makes him even more angry god naylor if he ever finds out what you and i just did if potus doesnt get his irrational behavior under control which is a possibility im afraid then you and i and the other rational people around him are going to have to worry about how to protect the country from that after a long moment the secretary of defense said very softly ive been wondering who would be the first to actually say that out loud five el tepual international airport puerto montt chile april as the peruairecargo taxied down the runway toward the refrigerator warehouses castillo saw that there were two other boeings on the field both were identical to the aircraft on which they had flown from cozumelall boeing lrs just about the last word in heavy longhaul transport aircraft one bore the insignia of peruairecargo and the other the paint scheme of air bulgaria which castillo could not remember ever having seen before but i will bet my nexttolast dime that it too belongs to aleksandr pevsneror one of his several dozen wholly owned subsidiaries the air bulgaria freighter is about to carry a load of argentine beef and chilean salmon to europe maybe not towhat the hell is the capital of bulgaria sofia but to somewhere in eastern europe the peruairecargo is almost certainly about to fly a hell of a lot of the same to san francisco or to chicago and maybe on the way home stop by birmingham to pick up a load of nearly frozen alabama chickens for the german market ol alek seems to have a lock on the international movement of perishable foodstuffs and the international movement of god only knows what else that god only knows who wants moved very discreetly from hither to yon and is prepared to pay whatever it costs despite his protestations that hes absolutely through doing that sort of thing where the hell is the lear there were no other fixedwing aircraft on the tarmac castillo had expected to see pevsners learjet the only aircraft visible besides the huge cargo jets were two bell l helicopters both painted with the legend chilean helicopters sa they were probably used to ferry the crews here from santiago or wherever the hell else they were whooping it up between flights but where the hell is pevsners lear i dont see the lear castillo said to his seatmate who was in the process of applying lipstick an act he found quite erotic they were in the small section of a dozen seats behind the bulkhead that separated them from the flight deck alek knew when we would arrive sweaty said it will be here the massive stopped moving max who had spent just about all of the flight sound asleep now awoke he sat on his haunches and looked expectantly at the cabin door one of the crew came into the passenger compartment there were seven men all russians on the crew all of them wore wings five of them wore the fourstripe shoulder boards of captains and the other two the threestripe shoulder boards of first officers the ranks didnt seem to matter as one of the captains functioned as the steward cooking and serving lunch and making drinks and the last time castillo walked into the cockpit to see where the hell they were over south america one of the first officers was occupying the pilots seat he had come first to the conclusion that russians did things differently and then idly wondered what kind of passports the crew was carrying and then decided that they more than likely had a selection of passports from which to choose depending on where they had landed as a stairway mounted on a pickup truck was backed against the fuselage the captain worked open the door when there was the light bump of the stairway contacting the aircraft max jumped to his feet effortlessly shouldered the captain out of the way and ran down the stairway isnt that sweet castillo said he cant wait to see his babies hes been on this plane for nine hours i know what he wants to do sweaty said then immediately stopped realizing that she had been had i better get down there before those two guys at the bottom of the steps see max and wet their pants castillo said and started to get out of his seat my god koussevitzky suddenly said its blatov and koshkov koussevitzky beat castillo to the door castillo got there in time to see the two men salute and heard one of them say kapitans blatov and koshkov reporting for duty sir koussevitzky ran quickly down the stairs and the three men embraced castillomoving slowlymade it all the way down the stairs before they broke apart when they did he saw tears running down all of their cheeks colonel castillo may i present kapitans blatov and koshkov late of vega group two both blatov and koshkov snapped to attention and saluted castillo returned it in pavlovian response and then put out his hand koussevitzky saw the lack of understanding on castillos face it was general sirinovs plan carlos koussevitzky said that should something go wrong on la orchila island a second tupelov based in cuba would fly in our reserve force but by the time we got there podpolkovnik castillo kapitan koshkov said all we found was major koussevitzky resting against what was left of the hangar wall drinking emergency liquid against the pain of the wound podpolkovnik alekseeva had given him castillo looked at him and thought emergency liquid what the hell is that emergency liquid he asked vodka carlos koshkov explained with a smile one knows when one has been really accepted as a spetsnaz when the officer inspecting your equipment before a mission does not inspect your two water bottles to make sure one of them doesnt contain emergency liquid kapitans koshkov and blatov then snapped to attention again and raised their arms in a salute well what have we here tom barlow asked offering his hand a veterans convention it is good to see you again polkovnik berezovsky blatov said and then quickly added as sweaty came off the stairs and you podpolkovnik alekseeva sweaty extended her hand koshkov and blatov bent over it and kissed it unless both of them had really been into the emergency liquid i dont think a us army female light colonel has ever had her hand kissed by two captains how did you get out sweaty asked it was only a question of time podpolkovnik alekseeva until they got around to deciding we were involved in the la orchila island disaster thats not what i asked we are spetsnaz podpolkovnik alekseeva koshkov replied we can do anything castillo pushed back a grin as he thought years ago when i was a bushytailed special forces captain we used to say green berets can do anything immediately the impossible takes a little longer he took another closer look at captains koshkov and blatov and decided presuming they could speak english theyd fit right in in the stockade either of you speak english castillo asked in english about as well colonel koshkov answered in english as you speak russian i once studied to be a poet in saint petersburg castillo said both smiled broadly so i understand did vladimir vladimirovich blatov said thats the word going around what are you doing here koussevitzky asked were going to take you to casa en el bosque koshkov said in those castillo asked indicating the bells koshkov nodded theyre really very nice little helicopters he said very nice little helicopters my ass the factory calls them long rangers but theyre better known as super rangers highinertia twobladed rotors lots of power just the thing to fly through the andes as darkness falls presuming you have the knowhow to fly them say a hundred hours under a good instructor i wonder where alek pevsner got them how much time do you have in them captain castillo asked koshkov thought a minute shrugged then said about ten hours ten hours max interrupted his thought by walking up to koshkov sitting on his haunches and offering his paw max likes him ill be damned koshkov stiffened his face showed fear he confirmed this by announcing im not a friend of dogs well you better shake that ones paw or hell eat you castillo said with great reluctance koshkov stooped and took maxs paw get in the chopper max castillo ordered gesturing max dutifully trotted to the closest helicopter and jumped inside koshkov was visibly relieved when castillo got to the bell there was a man in the copilots seat a good pilotsay one with a hundred hours under a good instructorcould fly a super ranger by himself but a copilot even one presumably with less than ten hours in the bird was a nice thing to have may i sit there please castillo asked politely the copilot didnt like that but koshkov signaled for him to give up his seat and he did so once he was seated in the copilots position a quick look at the interior of the bellespecially at the paneltold castillo that it was brandnew the forward and sidelooking radar screens the gps screen and the radar altimeter bore the logos of the afc corporation and that translated as damn the cost get the best he strapped himself in and put on the helmet that the copilot had reluctantly turned over to him test test he said through the throat microphone loud and clear koshkov reported ready one thing captain koshkov castillo said if at any time during this flight i put my hands on the controls and say ive got it and you dont instantly take your hands off the controls i will order max to pull you out of your seat by sinking his teeth into your throat and then when we get on the ground i will tell him to eat you starting with your penis and testicles it did not produce the reaction he expected koshkov smiled at him and said if at any time during our flight the copilot desires to take control of the aircraft the pilot will be honored to turn it over to the author of light helicopter operation in extreme altitude and mountainous terrain conditions where the hell did you see that by major c g castillo chief flight examiner th special operations aviation regiment koshkov finished i used it to teach the subject when i was at the spetsnaz aviation school i will be damned when we land you can tell me how i did koshkov said picking it up now the bell lifted gently off koshkov lowered the nose and then made a running takeoff vii one casa en el bosque san carlos de bariloche rio negro province argentina april at just about the moment the afc gps showed that they were over the estate floodlights came on illuminating the polo field which was castillo judged about meters from the mansion as koshkov brought the super ranger in for a smooth touchdown with the second chopper following castillo saw there was a welcoming party standing in front of the stablewhich also served as a hangarwas a large welcoming party aleksandr pevsner his wife anna and their three children elena sergei and aleksandr elena held one of maxs pups in her arms janos pevsners huge hungarian bodyguard stood where castillo expected him to be three feet behind pevsner standing three feet away was berezovskys wife lora and their daughter sofya who was holding another fruit of maxs loins in her arms and to one side stood four women three with small children in their arms who had to be the wives of the pilots if it werent for those dozen or more guys all armed with kalashnikov rifles standing behind everybody trying to be as discreet as possible this would be a touching scene if this were december it could be home for christmas howd i do koshkov asked as he braked the rotors not bad for someone who obviously has no natural flying talent at all castillo said koshkov smiled and shook his head max seeing his pups was first off the super ranger with some trepidation first elena and then sofya put their nowsquirming pups on the ground in attack mode the dogs raced toward their father together they weighed about half as much as max max instantly rolled on his back with his paws in the air in surrender mode the pups began to gnaw on his stomach and ears i shudder to think aleksandr pevsner said as he shook castillos hand that the childrens animals will eventually reach his size the kissing ritual began anna kissed castillo sweaty kissed pevsner and then anna castillo was not surprised when anna kissed lester bradleyher husband was alive because lester had put a round in the forehead of pevsners wouldbe assassin and from then on he was considered a member of the familybut he was surprised when both blatov and koshkov got into the line of people waiting to swap kisses with the laird of karinhall and his lady more relatives castillo asked sweaty she nodded kiril and anatoly she replied arelet me seesecond cousins once removed aleksandr is kirils godfather and that would make kirils baby what castillo said a third cousin twice removed or just a second cousin twice removed sweaty considered the question seriously for perhaps thirty seconds before realizing she was being teased you will pay for that my love she said which means theyre oprichniks in good standing he pursued im getting sorry i ever told you about the oprichnina sweaty said yes or no of course sweaty said they couldnt have become spetsnaz officers otherwise every spetsnaz officer is an oprichnik i didnt say that sweaty said yes you did castillo said he sensed aleksandr pevsners eyes on him very impressive alek castillo said indicating the men with the kalashnikovs but wheres the band the band i sort of expected a brass band to welcome us or at least somebody playing the volga boatmen on a balalaika pevsner shook his head resignedly lets go down to the house and have dinner he said afterward we have a lot to talk about would you like to freshen up the laird of karinhall the perfect host asked or after a drink give me ten minutes sweaty said there was nothing in her reply or tone of voice that suggests she has anything more romanticor carnalon her mind than freshening up damn oh i know its because i mocked the family and the oprichnina ill have a little of the emergency liquid please castillo said smiling at kiril koshkov and indicating a bottle of vodka encased in a block of ice oh thats right you heard about that didnt you koshkov said with a smile kirils been telling me how undisciplined you spetsnaz are castillo replied pevsner was also smiling broadly as he generously poured the literally icecold vodka into a chilled glass what the hell are you smiling about alek you never were spetsnaz and i dont think you even know what were talking about epiphany time youre smiling because you know that even one drink will make me one drink stupider when we have our little chat with a little luck i will be twoor moredrinks stupider when we have the chat the thing for me to remember about you alek ol buddy is that you were svr and while you can take the boy out of russia you cant take the svr out of the boy not a problem i will have two or more drinksafter that flight through the andes im entitled and we will have our little chat in the morning not tonight it was fifteen minutesduring which time castillo had two substantial belts of vodkabefore sweaty rejoined the family and then everyone went into the dining room not surprising castillo at all were both another frosty glass of chilled vodka and a bottle of saint felicien cabernet sauvignon waiting for him at his place at the enormous table sweaty was seated beside him i waited for you sweaty said quietly really what did you want she said its not important her eyes told him carnal was off the table for tonight and maybe for the next day too what was on the table for tonight was a feast of chilean seafoodabsolutely marvelous oysters and enormous lobsters about half a bottle of cabernet sauvignon later castillo was watching when former gunnery sergeant lester bradley usmc stopped cracking the claw of an enormous lobster pushed his chair away from the table picked something up from the floor and discreetly put it on his lap castillo knew what had happened when lester rose in the morning he stuffed a theoretically invisible fleshcolored speaker into his ear canal when a call came to his closed brick and there was no answer it spoke a number into the earpiece identifying the person who was having trouble getting through castillo naturally wondered who was calling he learned who it was only after lester pushed back from the table took a handset from the brick walked over to castillo and handed it to him the illuminated leds on the handset told castillo that the brick was in category i encryption status and showed him the number castillo put the handset to his ear castillo he said there was a very brief period during which the system compared the digital interpretation of his voice with its database found a percent match and illuminated the number on the calling partys handset telling a franklin lammelle the director of the central intelligence agency that he was now connected with lieutenant colonel c g castillo us army retired where the hell have you been charley lammelle began the conversation ive been calling every five minutes for the past half hour i was occupied doing what that you couldnt answer for most of that time i was dodging rockfilled clouds in a helicopter flown by a guy who finished flight school six weeks ago in sevastopol i dont take calls under those conditions he exchanged smiles with koshkov lester didnt think i should have gotten on the phone either otherwise he would have handed it to me rockfilled clouds where the andes what the hell are you doing down there the locators not working i turned it off castillo replied adding at the moment eating lobster why do i suspect youve been at the sauce youre perceptive would that explain it jesus christ charley the last thing i need is you smashed right now the last thing charley needs is charley smashed whatever this is lammelle is excited about it why the hell did i drink that goddamn vodka frank calm down consider the possibility that im pulling your chain you sonofabitch you have a sick sense of humor so i have been told castillo said he saw sweaty making an exaggerated punching motion with her index finger he knew what it meantturn on the loudspeaker functionand ignored her so are you going to tell me whats so important or not castillo asked there was a pause suggesting lammelle was getting his temper under control fortyfive minutes ago i had a call from general mcnab he began hes on his way to afghanistan so half of specopscom is in afghanistan he goes there all the time i think maybe i should start at the beginning lammelle said yeah why dont you the people you had at arlingtonand you toowalked out on the presidents remarks actually we got in our limos and went to the mayflower so what you having those delta and gray fox guys at arlington pissed the president off and then you walked out on his remarks that pissed him off even more and your party at the mayflower pushed him over the edge what does that mean i told you before in the last conversation we had that clendennen sent the fbi to the mayflower to take pictures of everybody there and among those there were porky parker and roscoe danton and that really pissed him off and do you now know why he did that so that he would have proof of what you sound as if youve been at the sauce after fbi director mark schmidt had personally identified each and every partygoer for him it wasnt a party for christs sake in our last conversation you will recall i told you it was more like a wake we stood around drinking telling danny salazar war stories i remember lammelle interrupted him and then went on he gave them to beiderman with orders to give them to naylor with orders for naylor to show them to mcnab and tell him that hethe presidentknew quote what mcnab was up to close quote but that if mcnab applied for immediate retirement it quote would be the end of it close quote what does he think mcnab was is up to he apparently believes mcnab is in a conspiracy to get him out of the oval office and montvale into it if i have to say this he thinks youre a coconspirator thats crazy please remember later if you are asked under oath that i did not introduce that word into this conversation you did jesus christ castillo muttered then exhaled audibly and said the first thing that comes into my mindunwilling as i am to accept crazyis that hes into the bottle a secret tippler was our beloved commander in chief sober when he did all this yes he was hes a teetotaler the boozers in his family are his mother and motherinlaw where are you getting all this frank general mcnab made the point to me that he has not spoken with you since before salazar and the others were murdered and colonel ferris kidnapped he hasnt castillo confirmed which of course suggested to me that he wanted me to bring you into the loop especially in view of the fact that the other players are not liable to the other players being thus far naylor and beiderman so after speaking with general mcnab i spokeseparatelywith both general naylor and secretary beiderman they agree with your crazy theory i dont have a crazy theory charley write that down in blood on your forehead they agree with the hes out of his mind theory they talked around it but yeah theyre worried what happened when beiderman or naylor told mcnab the president wanted him to retire it didnt get that far beiderman told mcnab to get out of dodge before he had to show him the pictures he did for mcnab to retire would be an admission that he was involved in this nutty coup detat scenario he wouldntcouldntdo that hed demand a courtmartial thats precisely what mcnab told them just before beiderman told him to go to afghanistan before he could show him the pictures and deliver the retire now ultimatum both beiderman and naylor are hoping the whole thing will pass when clendennen has a couple of days to cool off that looks to me like pissing into the wind frank yeah agreed did my name come up when you talked with naylor and beiderman oh yes either one of them think im involved in this conspiracy no but when your name came up the phrase beiderman used was loose cannon in the phrase the one thing we dont need in these circumstances is a loose cannon like castillo and naylor didnt rush to my defense no he didnt so what happens now we wait to see if this coup detat theory of the president goes away when hes had a few days to cool off and if it doesnt lammelle was silent a long moment then he said i dont know charley then when castillo didnt reply for maybe thirty seconds lammelle asked any questions just one wheres my helicopter im not sure i should tell you come on frank lammelle took another long moment of silence before he said okay charley in a move i regretted before i finished hanging up the phone i ordered it loaded onto a truck and taken to martindale army airfield at fort sam for indefinite storage despite what everybody says about you frank on certain occasions you can be a good guy im not asking what youre going to do with it because i dont want to know the green led on castillos handset went out so long frank he said to the dead headset its always a pleasure to hear from you he handed the headset to lester picked up his lobster fork then glanced around the table all eyes were on him anything wrong charley aleksandr pevsner asked with a smile you looked very unhappy while you were talking nothing i cant handle in the morning alek when time will have taken the emergency liquid out of my system excuse me i thought you knew that i never discuss serious things when ive been drinking not even with family especially not with this family castillo said that earned him smiling lips and icy eyes from pevsner when he looked at sweaty he knew she wouldnt be smiling and he expected to get the same icy glare from her blue eyes instead he got a faint smileof approval he realized with some surprise after a momentand then as he moved a chunk of lobster from a bowl of melted butter to his mouth she groped him tenderly under the tablecloth the feeling of euphoriaor at least carnal anticipationlasted until they were in their room castillo had waited maybe a second after sweaty had gone into the bathroom before getting naked and under the sheets he had been lying on his back with his fingers laced behind his head waiting for her to join him when his world crashed around him epiphany stop thinking with your dick james bond what you thought about good ol alek is also true of sweaty you can take the girl out of russia but only a fool thinking with his little head would believe you could take the svr out of former podpolkovnik svetlana alekseeva the most important thing to any of them is family andor the oprichnina and you are not family and certainly not an oprichnik they told meand i believe itthat the way theyve survived since ivan the terrible is by doing whatever was necessary the translation of that is being as ruthless as necessary and shes smart god is she smart when juan carlos pena wanted my nonexistent address in uruguay she came up with the golf and polo club in the next breath which means she had no trouble at all figuring out that im likely to pose problems in their current battle with their former comrades in the svr i told her i was going to make it clear to pevsner that i wasnt going to let him whack anybody without my permission and when i got into it with pevsner just now i never discuss serious things when ive been drinking not even with family especially not with this family it had to be obvious to her that i was not going to be a good little boy and do whatever wise ol uncle alek thinks i should do so what to do about that they cant whack mealthough that remains a possibility for the futurebecause right now they need me she knew that i was talking to lammelle on the phone even from the one side of the conversation i let her hear so just as fast as she came up with the address for juan carlos when she saw that i was already challenging pevsners authority she decided the way to deal with the situation was in bed she could control me there and why shouldnt she think so less than twentyfour hours after we first met she was in my bedand has been leading me around by the wang ever since so she grabbed hold of it under the table here and i cant even get really pissed off at her she is what she is and what she is is a fourthhell maybe sixthgeneration soviet spook can i be pissed at mejames bond junior sure because james bond junior is acting not like even a junior spookone six months out of fort huachuca or the farmbut like some seventeenyearold with raging hormones who just got laid for the first time and is convinced there has never been love like this since adam screwed eve in the garden of eden and because its humiliating having to face proof of my gross stupidity sweaty came out of the bathroom holding a towel by its edges showtime she said and dropped the towel that has to be the most beautiful woman in the world she walked on her toes to the bed quickly and with exquisite grace and got in beside him she laid her body half across castillo making him think that she had the most wonderful breasts he had ever encountered by any standard he could think of you play the fool so well she said that sometimes i forget that youre not a fool at all he could feel her breath against his ear flattery will get you everywhere he said but what specifically do you have in mind aleksandrs face when you told him you never discuss business when youre drinking especially with this family was priceless well here it is the schmooze starts beware of russians bearing booze is my motto baby and why didnt you tell me youre a legend who said i was kiril when i said thank you for letting carlos fly as your copilot he said i was glad to have him i dont think anyone knows more about flying in the mountains than he does he even wrote a book about it hes a legend in the american army why didnt you tell me modesty she pinched his nipple well shes a good schmoozer i almost believe her can i ask you a personal question he said no what kind of dontgetpregnant medicine do you take he pursued then thought where the hell did that come from did alek put a little sodium pentothal in that vodka i should have known she said with a sigh youre not answering the question you really want to know i really want to know why not like it says on the cias wall in langley ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free when i stopped living with evgeny i stopped taking those onceaday pills you were on that stuff when you were married to evgeny why i didnt want his baby obviously charley thought and since you certainly dont want mine he said and now when i knew dmitri and i were going to try to get out i went to a danish gynecologist and she gave me a shot what kind of a shot i dont know what it was called but she said it would keep me from getting with child for a year in case you just happened to meet somebody who could be useful if you let him into your pants right like me which was enough i didnt mind dying but i didnt want the bastard child of an svr interrogator what the first step when breaking down a senior female traitor is to rape her sweaty said matteroffactly multiple times different men over a fortyeighthour period i could handle that but i didnt want a child coming into the world that way if they shot me it wouldnt have been a problem but they could haveprobably would havejust kept me in prison where i would wind up giving birth to the bastard child so i got the shot from the danish doctor update on the epiphany shes not making this up jesus h christ two weeks later i met you sweaty went on and sure enough the shot kept me from being with child for a year actually for fourteen months so what are you going to do now she met his eyes and after a moment said in seven months were going to have a baby i told you i was going to give you a son sons didnt you believe me he stared into her ice blue eyes now genuinely warm and thought calling charley castillo a miserable lowlife sickly suspicious sonofabitch is the monumental understatement of all time then taking him absolutely by surprise his chest started to heave and his eyes teared oh god he said in anguish oh sweaty i thought youd be happy she said confused sweetheart i am so happy i think im going to have a heart attack two the breakfast room casa en el bosque san carlos de bariloche rio negro province argentina april aleksandr pevsner tom barlow nicolai tarasov stefan koussevitzky kiril koshkov and anatoly blatov were sitting around the long table when castillo and svetlana walked in holding hands trailed by lester bradley his arms full with two laptops and a brick janos was in his usual place sitting in a chair against the wall a maid and one of pevsners exspetsnaz waiters were clearing away the breakfast dishes i knew alek was going to play king of the hill sooner or later and that just wont work better settle it once and for all right now sweaty i dont think the reichsmarschall plans to feed us castillo said in english do you think we could possibly have annoyed him in some way the reichsmarschall pevsner replied sarcastically didnt know how long it would be beforeor even ifromeo and juliet could bear to be torn apart so we decided wed better start without you castillo looked around the table tom barlow was smiling the others were stonefaced nice try hermann but no brass ring castillo said starting without me would be what kiril anatoly and i would call really flying blind and you know it or you should pevsner stared at him icily but didnt reply castillo turned to the waiter and switching to russian ordered set places for us put me at the head of the table where mr pevsner is now sitting podpolkovnik alekseeva will sit to my right and mr bradley to my left the waiter looked at pevsner for direction he got none your house alek your call castillo said you either stop behaving like you think youre ivan the terrible and im a second lieutenant of your household cavalry or were out of here were out of here pevsner parroted sarcastically eta of jake torine and the gulfstream at san carlos de bariloche international is twelve fifteen castillo said unless you agree that im the best man to deal with our mutual problem ill just get on it and leave you here to deal with your problem by yourself then get on your goddamn airplane and go pevsner said where carlos goes i go svetlana said pevsner shot back then both of you get on the goddamn airplane and go i will deal with the problem this family faces aleksandr nicolai tarasov said i think you should listen to what podpolkovnik castillo has to say pevsner looked at him in disbelief ill go further than that tom barlow said you have to listen to what carlos has to say or what pevsner snapped or when carloss airplane leaves lora sofya and i also will be on it presuming of course carlos will take us of course we will svetlana said youre family family family what it looks like to me is that my family is betraying me and taking the side of this goddamn american svetlana snapped you goddamn fool you are alive because of this goddamn american castillo thought she sounds like an svr lieutenant colonel and if not for carlos tom barlow added svetlana lora sofya and i would never have gotten out of vienna and you really would be handling this family problem by yourself before this family starts doing to each other what vladimir vladimirovich wants to do to us tarasov said can we at least listen to what podpolkovnik castillo has to say pevsner glared at each of them ill listen he said after a moment how gracious of you castillo said his tone dripping sarcasm may i presume that i have the floor i should have killed you on the cobenzl pevsner said evenly i guess i dont castillo said yes you do tom barlow said aleksandr i just figured your odd behavior out you just cant face the fact that carlos can deal with this problem better than you can carlos was rightagainto say that you think youre ivan the terrible and were in russia youre not and were not i say thank god for carlos so do i anna pevsner put in castillo snapped his head around he had been unaware shed come into the room what pevsner snapped will anyone join me in giving thanks to the lord for bringing carlos into the family anna said as she bent her head and put her hands fingertips touching together in prayer castillo thought that svetlana would be agreeable to involving the deity but he was genuinely surprised when nicolai tarasov and stefan koussevitzky got to their feet bowed their heads crossed themselves put their hands together and waited for anna to continue and really surprised when aleksandr pevsner did the same thing ninety seconds later after everyone had joined anna in saying amen castillo suddenly found himself facing an expectant audience and so i have the floor the way im going to do this is with what the us army calls a staff study he began if we can get laptops in here for everybody lester has my staff study on a thumb drive you heard podpolkovnik castillo aleksandr pevsner barked at the waiter what are you waiting for bring the goddamn laptops and immediately serve their breakfast as was ordered three the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc april go see whos out there douglas president clendennen ordered i called this meeting for half past eight and thats what time it is yes mr president replied secret service special agent mark douglas who now saw himself as the guardian of the presidents door he went through the door into the outer office the president pointed at clemens mccarthy the presidential press secretary and at supervisory secret service agent robert j mulliganboth seated on simple chairs against the walland motioned them toward the armchairs and couches to which senior officials felt entitled we dont want these disloyal bastards to feel too comfortable in here do we the president asked rhetorically douglas came back into the office and announced the secretary of state the attorney general and the fbi director are out there mr president look at your watch and in precisely five minutes let them in the president ordered yes sir and the secretary of defense mr president and general naylor are out there i didnt send for them clendennen said secretary beiderman said he is aware he doesnt have an appointment mr president douglas said he said he will await your pleasure clendennen considered that a moment and then said let them in with the others yes sir five minutes later secretary of state natalie cohen led attorney general stanley crenshaw fbi director mark schmidt defense secretary frederick k beiderman and centcom commander in chief general allan naylor into the room since i didnt send for you secretary beiderman the president said whats on your mind lets get that out of the way first mr president i regret to have to tell you that general naylor was unable to speak with general mcnab as you requested why not general mcnab was on his way toby now is inafghanistan beiderman said and waited for the explosion it didnt come clendennen didnt say anything at all beiderman went on it was our intention mr presidentgeneral naylors and mineto speak with general mcnab together but when general naylor called general otoole the deputy specopscom commander reported that general mcnab was on his way to afghanistan the president considered that for a moment and then said well well just have to deal with that issue at a later time wont we yes sir beiderman said and the photographs i have them right here mr president give them to mulligan the president said we wouldnt want them to disappear would we yes sir beiderman said i mean no sir we wouldnt still standing and thus somewhat awkwardly he opened his attache case took out the manila envelope that held the photographs and handed it to supervisory special agent mulligan will that be all mr president beiderman asked no stick around i think you should hear what were going to do about colonel ferris you too general naylor yes sir they replied speaking on top of each other natalie cohen although she had not been invited to do so sat down in one of the armchairs after a moment attorney general crenshaw sat on one of the couches and a moment later fbi director schmidt sat beside him beiderman and naylor remained standing so where do i start the president asked rhetorically and then answered his own question with you schmidt yes sir how are things going in el paso has that classified advertisement our mexican friends have asked for been published yet yes sir yesterday the first time yesterday it will run for four days and when do you think there will be a reply today or when mr president my sac therewilliam johnsoni told you about him sir hes one of my best thats nice to hear but it doesnt answer my question the president interrupted i was about to say sir that sac johnson has determined that the average time for delivery of a letter deposited in a post office to be delivered to a post office box in the same building is a minimum of six hours and may take as long as twentyfour youre telling me it takes our postal service at least six hours to move a letter from the in slot to a box yes sir and thats presuming the letter would be placed in a mail drop slot in the post office building itself if it were placedas it very likely would bein one of the drivepast post boxes outside the post office that could add as much as two hours to that time mail is collected from the outside boxes every two hours from eight am to midnight it is collected only once from there from midnight until eight am and of course if a letter were deposited in a mailbox not immediately outside the main post office that time would be further increased as the mail is picked up from there usually only twice a day and if it were mailed in ciudad juarezright across the border from el pasothat would add at least another twentyfours to the time and if it were mailed in say in san antonio it i get the picture schmidt the president said cutting him off there is a very unlikely possibilityon the order of a miraclethat if our mexican friends went to the main post office in el paso yesterday their reply could be in our box right now if that isnt the case we have no idea when well hear from them if a letter had been deposited in post office box mr president wed know about it sac johnson has agents all over that post office fbi director schmidt announced more than a little proudly not only are there surveillance cameras inside and outside the building schmidt went on but agents male and female are constantly rotated through the lobby additionally there are agents in the working area of the post office physically checking each piece of mail as it is dropped in a slot other agents go through mail coming into the post office from all sources then schmidt suddenly got carried away with his recitation of sac johnsons accomplishments mr president the fbi has got that post office covered like flies on horseshit president clendennen did not seem very impressed he said so what happens if somebody drops a letter addressed to box whatever box mr president schmidt furnished and an agent sees him do it or someone comes into the post office and goes looking in box what then in the first case mr president two things will happen the envelope will be opened and the contents photocopied sent to the fbis san antonio office and immediately forwarded to the j edgar hoover building where agents are standing by to bring it here meanwhile the letter dropper will be surveilled to see where he goes same surveillance will be placed on anyone going to box what if he heads for mexico the president asked he will be arrested if he tries that mr president no president clendennen said he will not be arrested sir and you tell your sac that if this happens and the person being surveilled even looks like he suspects he is being surveilled your sac will be fired got it yes sir im going to get this colonel ferris back the president said and this is how im going to do it first step get on the phone right now schmidt and tell your sac what i just saidthat he is not to arrest anybody without my permission and if anyone he is surveilling in this situation even suspects were watching him you will transfer him to alaska yes sir go do it the president ordered as he pointed to the door to the outer office mr president i can contact sac johnson on my cell phone it has encryption capability well then take your cell phone with its encryption capability in there and call him he waited until schmidt had reached the door and then turned to secretary of state natalie cohen has ambassador mccann proved to be as capable as i thought he would be madam secretary more important how close has he managed to get to president martinez ambassador mccann is both highly capable mr president and has already established a good relationship with president martinez i want you to get on the horn to mccann madam secretary and tell him to see martinez right now and get him to send me a letter sir give it to her clemens the president said mccarthy handed cohen a sheet of paper or words to this effect the president said read it aloud madam secretary so everybody will be on the same page cohen took the sheet of paper glanced at it and began this is apparently a draft and then read the letter aloud draft draft draft draft draft draft draft draft draft draft this would be better on martinezs personal rather than official stationery date my dear friend zeke i come to you to ask for an act of christian charity and compassion as a devoted father and family man yourself you know that once in a whileperhaps more often than we realizeevery family produces a worthless son even a murderer such is the case with the abrego family a thoroughly decent family who work a small farm in oaxaca state they have had two daughters and a son felix according to bishop need a name a truly wise and christian man whom i have known for years and who brought this to me felix started to go bad when he was twelve and despite every prayerful thing his mother and father and his priest tried to do for him kept moving ever faster on the path to hell bishop whatsisname knows this because earlier in his career he was the abrego family priest and as a wholly honest man bishop whatsisname is as willing as i am to admit that guilty as charged felix abrego fully deserves the punishment laid upon him by an american court for brutal acts of murder he is currently imprisoned for life without the possibility of parole in your federal prison in florence colorado senora abrego his sixtysevenyearold mother has been diagnosed with a particular nasty cancer get a name for the cancer and has less than four two three months to live she is confined to her bed and can get around only in a wheelchair obviously she cant travel to colorado and she wants to see her son for a last time before she dies im imploring you to help me arrange that what i propose is this there are at least a half dozen open policia federal warrants involving felix abrego they have not been actively pursued because it was reasoned that since he is already confined without the possibility of parole it would be a waste of time and money to try to convict him of something else i have been told there is a provision in us law whereby a prisoner like felix abrego may be released from prison into the custody of the us marshal service and taken for interrogation to a foreign country such as mexico in this case if you would use your good offices to approve a request from the policia federal to bring abrego to mexico for interrogation your marshals would transport him to the oaxaca state prison where they would turn him over to prison authorities this would permit the policia federal to interrogate him and it would also permit senora abrego to visit her son for the last time before her death once that inevitably happens abrego could either be returned to the united states to complete his confinement or alternatively tried here in this case there are so many charges against him here that he would almost certainly be sentenced to spend the remainder of his life in a mexican prison if in your good judgment something can be worked out please call me at your convenience and we can work out the details with warm regards your friend ramon well the president asked when she had finished mr president what is it you wish me to do with this secretary cohen asked i told you get it to mccann and have him take it to president martinez mr president attorney general crenshaw said the longstanding policy of the united states has been never to negotiate with terrorists whos negotiating with terrorists clemens mccarthy replied for the president what president clendennen is going to do is send a convicted criminal for interrogation in mexico which has the added benefit of permitting a terminally ill woman to see her son for the last time if that also results in the release of colonel ferris whats wrong with that its bullshit mccarthy thats whats wrong with it crenshaw said theres a lady present mr attorney general the president said watch your mouth i beg your pardon madam secretary crenshaw said obviously mr attorney general the president said you have some objections to my plan to secure the release of colonel ferris yes sir i have a number of im not interested in what they might be mr attorney general this is the plan of action your commander in chief has decided upon my question is whether your objections will keep you from carrying out my orders to see that what i want done is done that would depend mr president on what orders you give me fair enough the president said if i ordered you to have this fellow abrego moved from his present place of confinement to the la tuna federal correctional institution would your conscience permit you to carry out that order mr president are you aware that abrego has been adjudicated to be a very dangerous and violent prisoner requiring his incarceration in the florence maximumsecurity facility so clemens has told me and that la tuna is a minimumsecurity facility what they call a country club for the incarceration of nonviolent whitecollar offenders are you going to be able to obey my orders or not the attorney general looked at the secretary of state and saw on her face and in her eyes that she was afraid he was going to say no mr president if you order me to move abrego from florence admax to the la tuna minimumsecurity facility ill have him moved good i like what the military calls cheerful and willing obedience to my orders to my loyal subordinates president clendennen turned to secretary of state cohen i presume that you are also going to cheerfully and willingly obey my orders to you madam secretary visavis having ambassador mccann deliver clemenss brilliant letter to president martinez i will take the letter to ambassador mccann mr president but im not sure he will be willing to take it to president martinez and i have no idea how president martinez would react to it if he does mccann will do it because he works for you madam secretaryalthough actually since i appointed him hes my ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary and knows who butters his breadand martinez will go along with it what my good friend ramon wants to do is not antagonize the drug cartels any more than he has to and to keep the tourists and retireesand all those lovely us dollars going to acapulco and those other places in sunny mexico my plan will allow him to do both he turned to defense secretary beiderman and general naylor now as far as you two are concerned i presume that you two as loyal subordinates of your commander in chief will both cheerfully and willingly obey this direct order i dont want any involvement by the military in this period none either of you have any problems with that no sir beiderman said no mr president naylor said okay the president said thats it thank you for coming in douglas show them out yes mr president special agent douglas said attorney general crenshaw caught up with secretary of state cohen as she was about to get into her limousine in the driveway natalie were going to have to talk not now she replied as she slid onto the backseat i tend to make bad decisions when i am so upset that i feel sick to my stomach we cant pretend this didnt happen he insisted give me twentyfour hours to think it over she said and then pulled the limousine door closed four united states post office boeing drive el paso texas april a very short totally bald barrelchested man in a crisp tan suit leaned against the post office wall puffing on a long thin black cigar while reading el diario de el paso a man in filthy clothingwith an unshaven and unwashed face and sunken eyessidled up to the nicely dressed man if profiling was not politically incorrect he might have caused many police officers and border patrol officers to think of him as possibly an undocumented immigrant or someone suffering from substance abuse or both the wetback junkie looked around as if to detect the presence of law enforcement officers and then inquired hey gringo you wanna fook my seester your wife maybe the welldressed man replied but the last time i saw your sister she weighed three hundred pounds and needed a shave the junkie then shook his head smiled and with no detectable accent said you sonofabitch theres a starbucks around the corner the welldressed man said dressed like this wheres your car in the next parking lot the welldressed man said and nodded across the street walk down the street ill pick you up the welldressed man walked away to the left and the junkie to the right five minutes later sitting with the junkie in a rented lincoln parked five blocks from the post office on boeing drive vic dalessandro punched the appropriate buttons on his brick and fifteen seconds later was rewarded with the voice of a franklin lammelle the director of the central intelligence agency and how vic are things in scenic el paso pics coming through all right im looking at them now lammelle said who am i looking at thats the guy who dropped a letter addressed to box into the slot in the post office the fbi told you that lammelle asked no the junkie offered but when thirty seconds after this guy dropped his envelope into the slot half a dozen fbi guys inside the lobby started baying and going on point like so many llewellin setters we took a chance hey tommy how are you lammelle said very well mr director sir cia agent tomas l diaz replied how are things in the executive suite mr director sir you dont want to know lammelle said so what happened next he walked back to his car more or less discreetly trailed by the aforementioned llewellins and a dozen unmarked vehicles including so help me god frank a model a hot rod jesus lammelle said so he cleverly deduced he was being followed im sure he expected it diaz said he didnt try to lose anybody until he was in mexico and then he became professional he didnt have to the fbi stopped at the border but you didnt lose him its been a long time since i did this frank but its like riding a bicycle once you learn how you didnt lose him lammelle pursued he changed cars three times i dont know about the first two but youll notice the dip plate on the mercedes i noticed you get a gold star to take home to mommy tommy these arent drug guys frank this is too professional svr who else mexican intelligence is an oxymoron maybe cuban maybe even some of chavezs people but id go with svr castillo thinks this whole thing is an svr operation lammelle said and then asked tommy did the fbi make you no they were too busy falling all over each other to look for something like that id love to know what was in that envelope lammelle said so would i dalessandro said but once it went into the slot it was firmly in the clutch of the fbi we couldnt get close and i didnt think i should ask for a look can you find out ill try where are things now diaz said vics got half a dozen guys standing by in juarez who vic lammelle interrupted china post on castillos dime hewedidnt want to use anybody from the stockade lammelle knew that american legion china post in exile enjoyed among its membership certain retired special operators and he knew that castillo often hired the highly skilled warriors and what are they doing now things that i could not do without getting my cover blown diaz said and now we have both the dip license plate and the photos of the peopleall of the people not

federal bureau of investigation the j edgar hoover building pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc april an unexpected pleasure frank fbi director schmidt said as he offered his hand to dci lammelle what can i do for you how do you turn off the recorder mark excuse me turn it off mark i dont want this recorded for posterity after a just perceptible hesitation schmidt pointed to a door ive got sort of a bubble in there he said fine providing you swear on your honor as an eagle scout that the recorder in there is shut off lammelle then held up his right hand palm outward center fingers extended thumb and pinky crossed over the palm in a gesture signifying scouts honor frank i dont thinking mocking scouts is funny i was an eagle scout i know i know a lot about you mark and so that you know a little more about me than you apparently do i was also an eagle scout is that recorder going to be turned off scouts honor the recorder will not be turned on schmidt said lammelle wagged the hand that made the scouts honor and raised his eyebrows schmidt sighed then made the sign with his right hand and said scouts honor as they both put down their hands schmidt asked whats this all about why dont we wait until we get in your bubble schmidt waved him through the door into a small windowless room equipped with a library table four chairs a wallmounted flatscreen television and an american flag there were two telephones on the table one of them the red instrument of the white house telephone network when schmidt had closed the door behind him lammelle laid his attache case on the table opened it then sat down and took from it a manila envelope beware of spooks bearing gifts mark schmidt took the envelope removed a stack of photographs and examined them this is the guy who dropped the letter in the post office in el paso schmidt said two hours ago how the hell did you get this a friend gave it to me do you know this guys name no not yet im working on it is that why youre here you want to know his name his name is jose rafael monteverde lammelle said hes the financial attache of the embassy of the republica bolivariana de venezuela in mexico city you sound pretty sure i am sure and how about a little tit for tat show me what was in the envelope i shouldnt even be talking to you about this and you shouldnt have been nosing around el paso christ you could have blown the fbi surveillance i hate to tell you this mark but my friends said your surveillance guys were about as inconspicuous as two elephants fornicating on the white house lawn not that it mattered because they didnt follow senor monteverde across the border into juarezlammelle pointed at the photographswhere most of those were taken schmidts face had tightened at the fornicatingelephants metaphor and now he appeared to be on the verge of an angry reply but then he shrugged and instead said the dont follow anybody across the border order came from the president he does have a tendency to micromanage doesnt he hes determined to get colonel ferris back from the drug cartels i cant fault that the drug cartels dont have him mark lammelle pointed at the photograph of jose rafael monteverde theres the proof this guy could be tied to the cartels before he joined the venezuelan foreign service he did three years with the cuban direccion general de inteligencia even if that were true its true mark how could i go to the president with that i think hed want to know where i got my information dont go to the president with it just face the real problem which is you know exactly what im talking about are you going to close your eyes to it schmidt met his eyes but didnt reply and ive had this further discomfiting thought lammelle said maybe hes right maybe montvale does want to move into the oval office have you heard anything lammelle shook his head but one way for him to get there would be to allow clendennen to get a lot of egg on his face trying to swap felix abrego for ferris schmidt didnt reply directly instead he said the president has ordered the attorney general to move abrego from florence to a minimumsecurity prison la tuna which is twelve miles north of el paso youve already heard from the quote unquote drug people lammelle asked schmidt went to his desk worked a combination lock opened a drawer and took from it a folder from that he pulled out a single sheet of paper and a photograph and handed both to lammelle the photograph showed colonel ferris much as the first two photos of him had he was sitting in a chair two men with kalashnikov rifles stood next to him ferriss beard showed that he had not shaved he was holding a dayold copy of el diario de el paso in front of him lammelle read the message which like the first two messages had been printed on a cheap computer printer delighted that we can do business to prove that senor abrego has been moved from florence please arrange for el diario to publish a photograph of him taken in an easily recognizable location near el paso from which he can be quickly moved to the exchange point which will be made known to you once we have examined the photograph clendennen has his own channel to these people lammelle asked that came in after the president ordered abrego moved schmidt said where is abrego now i dont know i dont think theres been time to move him to la tuna find out for me lammelle said i want to know where he is minute by minute why because when the merry outlaws launch their plan to rescue ferris abregos location is intelligence castillo has to have the president doesnt want castillo anywhere near this i know which means youre going to have to make up your mind whether youre going along with clendennenshow do i put this logically challenged notions of how to deal with this which will probably result in ferriss being dead the president really going over the edge and vice president montvale convening the cabinet to vote on clendennens quote unquote temporary incapacity requiring him to assume the presidency or going along with castillo castillo has a wellearned reputation for leaving bodies all over do you really care how many svr bodies or drug cartel bodies castillo leaves anywhere schmidt considered the question for a long moment as if it confused him and then he said frank when i consider the option of montvale taking over i have to admit that i dont viii one the lobby lounge llao llao hotel and spa avenida ezequiel bustillo bariloche rio negro province argentina april castillo sweaty bradley tom barlow kiril koshkov and stefan koussevitzky were sitting around an enormous round table with a wood fire burning in its center when a whitejacketed bellman pointed them out to the four men hed just brought from the airport they were colonel jacob torine us air force retired major richard miller us army retired former captain richard sparkman us air force and cwo colin leverette us army retired castillo stood and addressed torine good afternoon colonel sir i trust the colonel had a nice flight torine eyed him suspiciously why am i afraid of what comes next torine asked then went to svetlana and kissed her cheek i believe the colonel knows colonel berezovsky castillo went on and he may remember major koussevitzky indeed i do torine said hows the leg major it only hurts when i move colonel koussevitzky replied good to see you again sir and this is kiril koshkov late captain of the spetsnaz version of the night stalkers castillo went on kiril stefan these distinguished warriors are colonel jacob torine captain richard sparkman and mr colin leverette the men shook hands im afraid to ask torine said but why are we being so military max walked to torine sat beside him on his haunches and thrust his paw at dick miller until he took it max i hate to tell you this miller said but as i came through the door there was a sign in at least four languages that says no dogs not a problem max knows the owner castillo said you were telling me colonel torine said why we are being so military i spent the morning playing general castillo said i gave a powerpoint presentation of a staff study that i am forced in all modesty to admit was brilliant svetlana shook her head in resignation how so torine asked smiling dont shake your head at me podpolkovnik alekseeva castillo said did i or didnt i convince ivan the terrible junior that his plans for this problem wouldnt solve it what were his plans torine asked they did have ill admit the advantage of simplicity castillo said what he wanted to do was whack anyone who he suspected was svr i finally managed to convince him that vladimir vladimirovich has more svr operators than we have bullets and that a wiser less violent solution was called for which is torine asked smiling as he beckoned to a waiter im still working on that castillo said little problems keep popping up you managed to talk pevsner out of whacking everybody in sight and letting god sort it out leverette asked incredulously without having a plan b i was impressed tom barlow said thats just what he did i didnt think he was going to get away with it castillo smiled at svetlana and said pay attention to your big brother sweaty what makes either of you think you really got away with it sweaty replied no plans at all charley leverette asked more questions than plans castillo said he pointed at the laptop in front of bradley lester show uncle remus uncle jake and gimpy the letter that the president wants president martinez to send to him the three bent over the laptop and read the letter whered you get this torine asked what is it miller asked thats the letter the president ordered natalie cohen to give to ambassador mccann so that mccann can go to president martinez with it and have martinez send it back she sent it to lammelle and he sent it to me so torine said he wants to swap the guy doing time in florence for ferris we knew that uncle remus has that pained look on his face that shows hes thinking castillo said that or he smells a rat both leverette said go on the president wrote this himself leverette asked the president told natalie that clemens mccarthy wrote it castillo said he told natalie he thought it was brilliant your marshals would transport him to the oaxaca state prison where they would turn him over to prison authorities leverette quoted i too found that interesting i dont understand torine said castillo nodded then said question one why would the president be specific about where abrego was to go to be exchanged question two why the oaxaca state prison its way south not near the us border there must be a state prison near our border oaxaca is closer to venezuela uncle remus asked that mayprobably doeshave something to do with it i have no idea what but there is a reason you just said mccarthy wrote the letter miller said same questions castillo said where are you going with this i dont know i just started thinking about it castillo said okay here goes a lot of people are beginning to realize that clendennen is losing or has lost his marbles thats what everybodyincluding methought when we heard his paranoid suspicions that we were staging a coup detat to get him out of the oval office and montvale in theres considerable proof that hes not playing with a full deck for example he staged that business at langley and fired porky parker for disloyalty then he went bananas because we walked out on his speech and then he started this swapabregoforferris business but leverette asked the possibility exists that hes not being paranoid about a coup detat jesus christ miller said who would be behind that charley torine asked dubiously and then had an additional thought and incredulously asked montvale castillo nodded miller said jesus christ are you serious charley i may be wrong i hope i am wrong but yeah the more i think about it the more serious i become how long have you had this dangerous idea miller asked when i smelled something wrong in that letterwhere the president wanted martinez to tell him where he wanted abrego to be sent what the hell is that all about he didnt torine argued mccarthy wrote that letter even worse castillo said how could mccarthy know about the oaxaca state prison hes been on the job only a couple of days so where did he get it supervisory secret service agent mulligan probably knew about it youre suggesting mulligan had a hand in writing that letter leverette said yeah i am when montvale was director of national intelligence he had the secretary of homeland security in his pocket and the secret service is part of homeland security i dont think its much of a stretch to wonder if he had this mulligan character keeping an eye on clendennen for him and if mulligan did slip oaxaca state prison into that letterwhy would he do that unless montvale told him to why charley torine asked try this scenario on for size castillo said abrego is taken to this prison in the middle of nowhere in mexico by us marshals i dont know whether theyre planning to exchange him for ferris or allow him to escape it doesnt matter the plan blows up abrego gets away and ferris is whacked they find him with his head cut off or hanging from a bridge overpass in acapulco or both the press starts to run down the story the letter from martinez is leaked he paused in thought then went on going off on a tangent clendennen is pushed over the edge at this point he publicly accuses crenshaw and cohen of betraying him since they havent betrayed him they deny it clendennen starts looking like a lunatic by this point the press is hot on the story they learn from the bureau of prisons that they were ordered by the attorney general to take abrego from florence to the oaxaca state prisonsomething that is against longstanding us policy and has never been done the attorney general says clendennen ordered it over his objections and that natalie cohen not only was there when he did it but was also given a letter by himthis letterwhich set up the whole thing at this point either clendennen resigns or impeachment proceedings start in the congress orand i think this is what montvale is shooting forclendennen really starts frothing at the mouth which will cause whatever authorities make decisions like thisthe cabinet to conclude that his mental condition is such that he cannot discharge his duties as potus whereupon jake torine finished whereupon the vice president steps forward and says he is forced to assume the presidents responsibilities until such time as the poor man recovers his faculties and what happens then leverette asked uncle remus we cant let it get that far castillo said so how do we stop it leverette asked we follow that military adage of when you dont know what to do doing anything is better than doing nothing are you going to translate that charley leverette asked all i can think of is snatching ferris or abrego or both of them before during or after the exchange escape or whatever at oaxaca state prison and then wait to see whobeside the mexicanscomes out of the woodwork looking for them and how are you going to do that torine asked and how does all this tie in with your scenario that the whole ferris business is an svr plot to get you and the other russians leverette added the other russians castillo parroted sarcastically you know what i mean leverette said uncle remus i dont know how it fits in i dont even know if the svr is really after me and the other russians and i cant explain the business about the oaxaca state prison truth to tell im flying blind okay leverette said so now that we know that whats the plan torine laughed castillo then said i recently ran into an old acquaintance juan carlos pena el jefe of the policia federal for the province of oaxaca he came to hacienda santa mariathe grapefruit farmand out of the goodness of his heart told me to get the hell out of dodge before i got hurt these drug people juan carlos told me are very dangerous and you suspect he might be pals with them leverette asked that thought has run through my mind castillo said i think id better have another talk with him a nice talk or the other kind leverette asked castillo didnt reply directly he instead said what i hope i can do is get juan carlos for auld lang syne to a tell me all he knows about the involvement of the venezuelanswhich means the svrin this and b keep me up to date on the plans for senor abrego at the oaxaca state prison thats a tall order charley torine said yeah i know okay leverette said lets say that works you know that abrego is going to be at the prison at a certain time then what then i offer whoever was going to let abrego go more money than the venezuelans are offering and grab him andor grab ferris when they take him to oaxaca state prison and there you are near this prison in the middle of nowhere with either or both of them leverette said what are you going to do with them load them on my black hawk castillo said leverette looked askance at castillo before i ask you where youre going to take them in your black hawk where in hell are you going to get a black hawk i already have a black hawk castillo said by now or certainly by tomorrow it will be at martindale army airfield at fort sam the one you stole from the mexican cops leverette asked the one i bought from the mexican cops castillo said natalie cohen didnt want to embarrass the mexican ambassador by asking him to explain its miraculous resurrection from the total destruction he said it suffered in the war against the drug cartelscomplete with its weaponry and policia federal markings intactso she gave it to lammelle and asked him to get rid of it while making up his mind about the best way to go about it he had it trucked from norfolk to fort sam for storage did he just do that or did you ask him to torine asked i asked him then his neck is on the line torine said all of our necks are going to be on the line with this jake castillo said im not going to line everybody up and ask for volunteers to take one step forward but ill understand if come on charley dick miller interjected you damn well know better than that castillo met his eyes then started to say something but apparently couldnt find his voice he offered his hand to miller who shook it then castillo stood up and wrapped his arms around miller ill let you hug me too charley leverette said but if you think im going to kiss you dont hold your breath two office of the warden united states penitentiary administrative maximum facility adx florence colorado april j william leon warden of the florence admax facility was a large sixthree pounds redhaired man known behind his back to his staff as willy the lion or sometimes simply as the lion he was generally recognized within the federal prison community as the most senior of all prison wardens in the united states there were federal incarceration facilities which the federal bureau of prisons part of the department of justice called institutions leons status as the most senior warden was de facto if not de jure he ran florence admax that said it all he was de jure subordinate to a number of people in the bureau of prisons bureaucratic hierarchy but de facto answered only to harold m waters the director of the bureau of prisons howard kennedy had begun his executive career working under leon when leon had been the assistant warden of federal correctional institution allenwood in montgomery pennsylvania he often said that everything valuable that he had learned about the incarceration business he had learned from willy the lion and that willy the lion was the best warden in the bureau period leon had joined the federal prison system as a trainee shortly after graduating from college and the first time he had ever been inside a prison was the day he reported for work he had needed a job and his decision to join the incarceration profession had almost been as a larkwhat have i got to lose it might be interesting ten years into his careerthen a captain at the united states penitentiary in leavenworth kansasleon had been offered a chance to move into the administrative side of the bureauin other words out of working with prisoners and into an office in washington a bright future was foreseen for him and everybody thought he had made a mistake when he turned down the job offer he had decidedthis time not impulsivelythat he liked working with prisoners a good deal more than he would have liked working at a desk in the bureau of prisons headquarters in washington what he meant by working with prisoners was the challenge he faced making them behave the lion had believed that the question of whether anyone belonged in prison or not had been decided in the courtroom and was none of a wardens business and he quickly decided that rehabilitation was mostly bullshit willy the lion had concluded that a wardens business was confining a prisoner in decent conditions in such circumstances that he or she did not pose problems for the guards fellow prisoners or him or herself and the way to accomplish this was simple establish rules that were fair and made sense and then see that they were obeyed his rise through the warden hierarchy was slow at first but grew quickly as his superiors came to realize that he was not only good at running a prison but even better at straightening out a prison in trouble and trouble in prisons was not caused only by the inmates the staff also contributed willy the lion earned the reputation among them of being fair and reasonable but not a man to cross no one was surprised when the lion was first named assistant warden at florence admax facility or a year later when he was named warden after it had proved too much to handle for its first warden once he took over there had been no further problems period and shortly after that happened he demonstrated that he had another skill one that no one suspected and one that surprised even him willy the lion could handle the press from the handwringers convinced that the bureau of prisons spent most of its time figuring out ways to violate the civil rights of the prison population to the heavy hitters from the television news networks who had long known that covering bloody prison riots attracted as many millions of viewers as did the sexual escapades of movie stars and politicians once willy the lions skill at handling the press became known to the upper brass of the bureau of prisons whenever there was troublea riot or allegations of guard brutality or corruptionthat was likely to draw the national press to the gates of a prison when the fourth estate showed up they very often found that willy the lion the warden of the toughest prison in the world had coincidentally been there when the trouble started willy the lion was a story by himself so they dealt with him and he was truthful with them and they learned that he neither coddled the prison population nor made any effort at all to cover up malfeasance on the part of the warden or his guards with rare exceptions the press left the site of the story convinced that the federal bureau of prisons had one hell of a tough job to do and most of the time did it well and in those few instances where somebody fucked up there were a large number of peoplelike willy the lionstanding ready to make things right director of the bureau of prisons harold m waters sometimes thought that willy the lions public relations role was almost as important as his proven skill at running florence admax no onenot even director watersknew that for the past nine months willy had a personal problem with one of the prisoners in florence admax one felix abrego register number a federal court in houston texas had convicted abrego on three counts of firstdegree murder the victims were all special agents of the drug enforcement administration and one of the three was willy the lions eldest sisters youngest boy clarence who had been twentytwo years old and on the job just over a year when felix abrego had stood over him and fired four shots into the groin area of his body and then a fifth shot into his face abrego had been sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole the sentencing investigation had turned up his record as a hit man for the mexican drug cartels and that he had been sent to florence admax from the federal detention center houston immediately after his trial this caused willy the lion for the first time in his adult life to consciously violate the regulationswhich of course have the force and effect of lawof the federal bureau of prisons for obvious reasons a warden should not be in charge of the incarceration of a prisoner to whom he is related or who has committed a crime against the warden or a member of the wardens family ordinarily this poses no problem such a prisoner is assigned to a prison where the warden has never heard of him the problem here for willy the lion was that if ever anybody deserved to spend twentythree hours of every day for the rest of his life in a cell furnished with a pouredconcrete bed a sink and toilet a television screen providing educational and religious channels only and windows that permitted a limited view of the sky it was the miserable mexican sonofabitch who had murdered clarence sending felix abrego to any other prison would give him a better life and he did not deserve a better life on the other hand if abrego were incarcerated at admax willy the lion would have to leave he could not see the justice in that why should he have to give up being warden of florence admax not only had he earned that job no one could handle it better than he could so he said nothing if he got caught he would watch abrego being sent in shackles somewhere else or he would retire and until something happened abrego would be treated exactly like every other prisoner a judge had sentenced to life without the possibility of parole and sent to florence admax assistant warden administration kurt grosch a stocky nearly bald fiftyfiveyearold stood in the open door of the wardens office and waited to be noticed willy the lion finally looked up from a thick sheaf of paper on his desk saw grosch and raised his eyebrows ive got something i thought i better show you warden leon waved him in what have you got dutch leon asked what grosch had was an order to transfer prisoner signed by kenneth l brackin deputy director us bureau of prisons ordering the transfer of felix abrego register number from florence admax to la tuna federal correctional institution in anthony texas this has got to be a mistake dutch willy the lion said la tuna is a country club i know so what do i do nothing ill call brackin and get him to tear this up before waters hears about it waters would shit a brick and brackins a pretty good guy what do i tell the marshals what marshals theres four of them and they more or less politely ask that we hand this guy over to them as soon as we can fit that into our busy schedule like right now todays wednesday leon said the next jpats flight is next monday right the department of justice operated several boeing passenger jets to move prisoners between bureau of prisons institutions andprimarilyillegal aliens about to be deported to the border it was commonly known by the acronym jpats the marshals arent using jpats they have a doj jet a little onehe searched his memorya gulfstream at butts butts army airfield served fort carson colorado a short distance from florence admax what the hell is going on here dutch i was hoping youd tell me willy the lion reached for his telephone and punched in a number from memory director waters please warden leon calling after a moment waters came on the line good afternoon mr director im fine thank you yourself dorothy and the kids im really sorry to bother you but something has come up four marshals have shown up here in a doj gulfstream with a transfer order signed by ken brackin moving a lifewithoutparole prisoner named felix abrego to the la tuna facility in texas is there a problem yeah theres a problem this guy abrego murdered three dea agents why is he being transferred to one of our more comfortable country clubs because the attorney general said so jesus christ harry whats he thinking i understand well if its out of your hands its out of mine ill send mr abrego on his way he put the handset into its cradle and looked at grosch you heard that dutch grosch nodded leon shook his head in disgust waters said the question is not open for debate and that this is one of those times when i have to smile and say yes sir jesus what the hell give abrego to the marshals dutch as soon as you can yes sir leon watched as grosch left the office and then rose from behind his desk and walked to the door called no calls doris to his secretary and then closed the door he knew what he wanted to do but had learned it was always better to think things over for two or three minutes when he was really pissed he took off his wristwatch and laid it on the desk in a position where he could see the sweep of the second hand he watched as the hand made three revolutions then he went to his laptop computer clicked on his address book found the name he wanted and punched the number in his personal cell phone roscoe he said into the phone a moment later this is bill leon the warden of the admax prison in colorado do you remember me three apartment the watergate apartments i street nw washington dc april roscoe j danton of the washington timespost writers syndicate and john david parker the newly appointed director of public relations of the lcbf corporation had tested their theory that the presidents firing of his press secretary was now old news and that it was therefore safe for porky to move about washington without having to dodge the white house press corps by having a drink at the old ebbitt grill there had been half a dozen members of that elite body in the bar refreshing themselves after mr clemens mccarthys afternoon briefing only two of them had even acknowledged porkys presence with so much as a nod porky was indeed yesterdays news that test had told them that it was safe for porky to go back to his apartment in the verizon which had the added benefit that he would no longer be roscoes roommate it wasnt that roscoe didnt like porky surprising to both of them was the fact that they had become quite close since president clendennen had ordered porky off his helicopter and roscoe had offered him a ride home from langley but porkys presence in the apartment obviously prevented roscoe from entertaining overnight female guests as roscoe thought of it he was a lover not an exhibitionist so after having a second bloody mary in the old ebbitt they had taken a cab to roscoes apartment in the watergate so that porky could pick up his things the phone was ringing when they walked in what the hell was that all about porky asked when roscoe had hung up i was about to say id tell you but then id have to kill you that would be a lot funnier if i hadnt heard it before porky replied but then i realized youre sort of a probationary member of the merry outlaws roscoe went on so i guess you get a pass that was j william willy the lion leon hes the warden of the admax prison in colorado and roscoe told him what willy the lion had told him so what are you going to do roscoe consulted his cell phones address book and dialed a number roscoe j danton of the timespost for the attorney general well im sorry hes not available at the moment when he becomes available will you be good enough to tell him i tried to call him before i went on wolf news to tell j pastor joness three million viewers the attorney generals version of the story ive got that he personally just moved a guy doing life without parole in florence admax for killing three dea agents to a country club in texas yeah ill hold for a minute roscoe met porkys eyes porky grinned knowingly as roscoe then said and how are you this afternoon mr attorney general what have i got ill tell you he did so you know i cant tell you where i got that mr attorney general that would be what they call revealing a source i dont do that whether you find it hard to believe or not mr attorney general i know its true i even have the prisoners name one felix abrego will i do you a favor that depends on the favor yeah as a favor youve always been straight with me i can sit on this for a couple of hourssay until andy mcclarrens straight scoop goes on wolf news at ninewhile you get to the bottom of this let me give you my cell phone number he broke the connection and turned to porky parker whatever it is porky i just touched a nerve do you have to call me porky if i didnt id have to kill you danton said oh shit parker replied four april warden leon this is stanley crenshaw warden leon im glad i caught you you just barely did mr attorney general i was about to call it a day warden have you been talking to roscoe danton to who mr attorney general roscoe danton roscoe j danton the washington timespost reporter the one whos always on wolf news oh yeah i know who he is you have been talking to him no sir mr attorney general i was trying to say i know who he is has he been trying to talk to me ive been in the office all afternoon is something wrong what do you know about the transfer of felix abrego from florence admax to the la tuna facility in texas oh now i understand so there was a mixup excuse me when that transfer order came in i thought there was something not quite kosher transferring someone like abrego from here to a country club like la tuna so i called director waters and asked him he assured me that everything was hunkydory that you had personally authorized the transfer so i told my assistant warden to turn the prisoner over to the us marshals you sent out here and when will this prisoner actually be transferred warden leon hes on his way to the la tuna facility as we speak mr attorney general warden leon if mr danton or any other journalist calls you out there dont be available refer them to me you understand yes sir dont answer any questions dont say anything at all yes sir mr attorney general five april the attorney general began his conversation with the director of central intelligence with no preliminaries whatsoever frank roscoe j danton just called me and after i was very nice to himdamn near groveled at his feethe gave me until five minutes to nine to explain why felix abrego is being transferred from florence admax to that country club prison in texas otherwise at nine tonight he goes on wolf newson andy mcclarrens straight scoopwith what hes got i wonder how he found out the dci mused the attorney general of course had already given that question a good deal of thought after talking with warden leon he had decided it wasnt leon then who his suspicions finally settled on the us marshals he had sent to florence admax for one thing since they were transferring abrego they knew about it for anotherthe us marshal service was the oldest federal law enforcement agency it had been founded in and its members had an unfortunate tendency to regard themselves as the knights templar of federal law enforcementthey often tattled to the attorney general on what they thought of as less than pure activities of other agencies since they couldnt tattle on the man himself who had ordered abregos very questionable transferthe attorney generalthey had gone to roscoe j danton who would certainly recognize a damn good story when one was dumped in his lap i have no idea stanley crenshaw said all i know is that he knows and is about to go on wolf news and tell the world what do i do i just had a thought frank lammelle said im not supposed to know that abrego is going to be swapped for ferris the president told you and natalie cohen and maybe schmidt but i guess he doesnt think i have the need to know that raises the question did he tell montvale or truman ellsworth keep that it mind when youre talking to him okay so im telling you now and now that you know what should i do are you sure you want to tell me stanley clendennens liable to consider that a breach of trust the attorney general considered that for a moment okay i didnt tell you who did tell you if i answered that that would be a breach of trust shit the attorney general said and broke the connection six april the presidents line agent mulligan this is stanley crenshaw mulligan is the president available does the president expect your call mr crenshaw please tell the president i have to speak to him ill see if hes free a moment later there was another voice on the line this is clemens mccarthy mr crenshaw the president is not available at the moment he asked me to take a message and hell try to get back to you im the attorney general of the united states when i call the president i want to speak to him not his goddamn press agent actually mccarthy we might not have to bother president clendennen with this this is really in your area of responsibility what would that be mr crenshaw roscoe j danton called me just now and gave me until five minutes of nine to tell him why felix abrego is being transferred from florence admax to the la tuna facility near el paso otherwise he says hes going on the straight scoop with andy mcclarren at nine with what hes got and what does he think he has that the convicted murderer of three dea agents is being transferred to a minimumsecurity institution how does he know that i have no idea im just telling you what i know and asking what i should do about mr danton just a moment please twenty seconds later the president of the united states barked what the hell is going on crenshaw the attorney general told him i want to know who told that sonofabitch danton about the transfer i have no idea mr president well some disloyal sonofabitch obviously did and i want to know who mr president i have no idea goddamn it you should youre the attorney general youre in charge of the fbi i dont care what you or mark schmidt have to do just find out what disloyal sonofabitch did this to me yes sir and what would you like me to say to mr danton mr president the president considered the question for a long moment im going to let mccarthy handle that he said finally but you and schmidt get your asses over here right now mccarthy might need you the president hung up seven april good afternoon madam secretary the dci said and how were things in sunny mehheeco why does your ebullience worry me frank natalie cohen replied the problem of swapping colonel ferris for felix abrego may be solved i just got off the phone with stanley crenshaw he is probably at this moment telling the president what he told me which was roscoe j danton gave him until five minutes to nine tonight to explain why ol felix has been transferred to the la tuna country club otherwise he goes on the straight scoop with andy mcclarren and tells the world cohen didnt reply i take back all the unkind things i ever said about devious diplomats lammelle said that was pure genius what are you talking about she said well clendennen cant send abrego to mexico now can he how did danton find out she asked what is that credible deniability your secret is safe with me natalie i didnt tell danton if thats what youve been thinking then who the hell did thats a very interesting question natalie who knew besides stanley and me and possibly mark schmidt i was not taken into the presidents confidence in this matter i heard it from schmidt do you think schmidt told roscoe no that would be committing career suicide he said and he likes being director that leaves stanley and that doesnt make sense did montvale know or truman ellsworth ive learned from painful experience that charles montvale often knows more than one presumes he does the secretary of state said and thats equally true of mr ellsworth who would actually move abrego the fbi the bureau of prisons the us marshals lammelle said and when montvale was director of national intelligence he was over the marshal service but why would montvale tell roscoe danton to embarrass the president she was silent a moment then offered montvale would tell dantonbut after if something went wrong then to embarrass the president hed leak it to him after so were back to then who i dont know frank but i think it behooves us to make a serious effort to find out i wouldnt be surprised if there was a connection with the coup detat business ill see what i can find out eight april mental telepathy frank charley castillo said i was just this moment thinking of calling you to tell me a little late that you told roscoe that clendennens moving abrego to the la tuna facility outside el paso no shit i didnt know that who the hell told roscoe when lammelle didnt answer castillo said well what i was going to ask is what i should tell the cops if im arrested stealing my black hawk back what before i thought it might be nice to have in case i needed it now i know i have to have it preferably late tomorrow afternoon when i get back to the states why do you have to have it lammelle said and immediately regretted it what i should have said is sorry charley forget that helicopter frank i dont think you really want to know do you yes i do charley why dont you tell me whats on your mind who told roscoe what roscoe called the attorney general about an hour ago and gave him until five minutes before andy mcclarren goes on wolf news tonight to explain why felix abrego is being transferred from florence admax to a minimumsecurity prison near el paso okay ill ask again how the hell did roscoe hear about that until just now i thought maybe you told him not me natalie cohen no the suspect right now is montvale but why would he do that if that story gets out clendennen cant send abrego to mexico castillo said thoughtfully because it would be irrational right think that through charley jesus castillo said and a moment later asked frank that letter clendennen wants president whatsisname of mexico martinez lammelle furnished notice what natalie and i arent quite sure what to think about it didnt either of you think there was something strange in clendennen wanting martinez to tell him he wanted abrego sent to the oaxaca state prison that went right over my head lammelle said after a moment and natalies too or else she would have said something whats that all about whats so special about the oaxaca state prison for that matter where is it in the middle of nowhere in oaxaca state not anywhere near the usmexican border but not far from the guatemalan border where there is a new cultural affairs officer of the russian federation valentin komarovski aka sergei murov castillo furnished which means what somebodys planning for something to happen at that prison who what there are threeat least threethings going on here frank one is that the drug people want their guy abrego back and kidnapped ferris so they can swap him we dont know if theyre doing that by themselves or whether its being orchestrated by the russians its possible that there is some sort of coup detat going on natalie said that mccarthy the presidents new press secretary wrote that letter and we dont know if the president was responsible for the send abrego to oaxaca clause or whether that was put in by mccarthy clendennen either didnt see it or did see it and didnt smell the limburger but who told mccarthy to put that in and why it couldve been sergei murov but thats a stretch or maybe montvale which also is a stretch but one scenario there has that whatever is going to happen at that prison will go wrong that the letter will be leaked to the press and clendennen will be in trouble and that raises the question of who told roscoe and why that seems to point at montvale natalie said hed do that after something goes wrong not before and since she is smarter than you and me combined shes probably right lammelle grunted his agreement then said and while all this is going on schmidt and the fbi are dealingor are about to dealwith the drug cartels if they are the drug cartelsand not the russians curiouser and curiouser after a moment the dci said charley do you really believe the russians are after you and your friends absolutely and where do they plan to do you in my scenario there is even more vague than anything else i would suspect that it would happen around the oaxaca state prison but so far my name hasnt come up so how do they get me to oaxaca is that a diversion so that they can whack aleksandr pevsner and company here in argentina interesting so what are you going to do charley go with what ive got im going to put people on the ground near the prison im going to have another talk with an old frienddelete thatold acquaintance who just happens to be the chief of the federales in oaxaca state to see what he knows what id like to do is grab either abrego or ferris or both when they show up at that prison and see who that brings out of the woodwork he paused and then added what i really would like to do is get my hands on sergei murov when lammelle didnt respond castillo went on and to do any of the foregoing im going to need that black hawk and how would you suggest i let you have that black hawk without finding myself in jail ive been thinking about that castillo said what i need is either a set of cia credentialsbetter yet a cia agent who knows his way around and can be trusted to keep his mouth shut and what could a cia agent who knows his way around and can be trusted to keep his mouth shut do he goes to martindale army airfield at fort sam asks for the rotarywing maintenance officer waves his credentials at him says the us of a is going to give the black hawk to the mexican cops and he would really appreciate it if they could fuel it and have an auxiliary power unit standing by when the pilots come to pick it up for a test flight and then you show up and fly away with it dick miller does he and a guy named kiril koshkov who the hell is koshkov exspetsnaz castillo replied and when the black hawk is at hacienda santa maria dick will call you and then you call your guy and he calls martindale and tells the maintenance officer it flew so well that they decided there was no point in bringing it back to fort sam so they took it to mexico and thanks so much for your courtesy since that black hawk was destroyed in the war against drugs and natalie cohen told you to get rid of it whats hacienda whateveryousaid a grapefruit farm thats about thirtyfive minutes black hawk flight time from the oaxaca state prison it belongs to my family and what makes you think you canor miller and your russian buddy canfly a black hawk across the border and then all the way to your grapefruit farmjesus christ a grapefruit farm without being seen by either the border patrol and five thousand mexicans many of them wearing police uniforms because the flight will be at night and napoftheearth that means just off the ground mr director miller can do that before he dumped his black hawk in afghanistanactually he didnt dump it they took an rpg hithe was very good at it and kiril with whom i just flew through the andes at night is just as goodmaybe better this sounds insane charley even coming from you you realize that the other option is dick and me sneaking onto martindale at night and just stealing it the odds against getting caught are better if you have some spook you can loan me or maybe make up a set of cia credentials for miller and me and fedex them to me one question charley lammelle said cutting him off have you been talking to vic dalessandro lately no why is that the truth boy scouts honor why because vic is in el paso watching the post office with the help of a clandestine service guy named tomas l diaz general mcnab does not know that vic is there and i dont know that tommy diaz is there getting the picture i think so hell be expecting to hear from you you will get your reward in heaven frank will that be before or after we both go to leavenworth leavenworth hell florence admax he chuckled this is not the sort of excitement i thought id get when i joined the cia then he hung up nine the presidents study the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc april you sure took your own sweet time to get here president clendennen said to attorney general crenshaw and fbi director schmidt when secret service agent douglas had passed them into the presidents study i didnt think it would be wise to come here with sirens screaming mr president crenshaw said i thought it would make people wonder whats going on the president glared at him but didnt reply directly lets start with you director schmidt whats going on in el paso sac johnson is standing by at the la tuna prison mr president waiting for the marshals to deliver abrego once he arrives and is taken into the prisonin other words comes under the authority of the bureau of prisons againhe will be outfitted in civilian clothing and taken to the magoffin home what the hell is that the president interrupted its the former home of the magoffin family mr president now a museum its a large adobe structure a wellknown el paso landmark in other words president clendennen interrupted again yes sir then why didnt you just say that i dont need the chamber of commerce bullshit yes sir photographs of abrego shaking hands with sac johnson will be taken what the hell is that all about sac johnson will be identifiedunder another nameas an officer of the magoffin home foundation and abregoalso under another nameas a contributor to the magoffin home foundation sac johnson has arranged for the photo to be published in tomorrow mornings el diario de el paso this sac johnsonand ifeel will satisfy the cartels requirement quote to publish a photograph of him taken in an easily recognizable location near el paso close quote the next move will be up to them okay the president said so who told that sonofabitch roscoe j danton that were moving abrego to texas mr president i have no idea neither does the attorney general president clendennen said looking at crenshaw so i have the director of the fbi and the attorney general telling me that they have absolutely no idea of the identity of the treasonous sonofabitch whose meddling is interfering with the foreign policy of the president of the united states would either of you find it hard to understand why i find that unacceptable crenshaw cleared his throat then said mr president i have begun an investigation somehow that doesnt reassure me the president snapped so tell me what you have on this sonofabitch danton excuse me ten apartment the watergate apartments i street nw washington dc april how the hell did you get in here roscoe j danton demanded of edgar delchamps and david w yung when they walked into his kitchen danton and john david parker were sitting at the kitchen table sharing a pizza the door was open delchamps said i didnt think youd mind i locked that door very carefully danton said how they hanging porky delchamps said ignoring the challenge what the hell do you want danton demanded charley wants to talk to you twogun yung said then why doesnt he call he said it would be better if edgar and i were here when you had your little chat yung said so we could clear up any misunderstandings that might come up can i have a slice of that delchamps asked as he reached for the pizza yung took his caseyberry from his pocket punched a number and then handed the instrument to danton leave it on speakerphone he ordered danton held up the cell phone danton he said my favorite journalist came castillos voice from the speakerphone how are things in our nations capital whats going on charley in the very near futurein the next couple of minutes probablyyou will get a telephone call from the white house unless theyve already called the white house has not called i expect them to well when they do theyre going to ask you not to go on the straight poop with andy mcclarren thats straight scoop roscoe corrected him in a pavlovian response forgive me as i was saying they are going to ask you not to go on mr mcclarrens widely viewed program tonight with the story of the attorney general ordering the movement of felix abrego from florence admax to the la tuna facility or they are going to threaten you with all the terrible things they will do to you if you do how the hell do you know about that the question roscoe is who told you about it a confidential source danton said again responding in a pavlovian reflex first roscoe well deal with what you say when the white house calls handle it any way you wantenjoy yourself and make them grovel whateverbut in the end you will agree that you will not go on the straight scoop tonight got that the hell i wont nobody tells me what to write or what to say on the tube wrong i can and in this case i have to edgar is porky there sitting right across from roscoe delchamps replied roscoe if i told you that your going on the straight scoop tonight would probably get colonel ferris killed would this change your mind i cant believe youre serious danton replied twogun you have the cias whiz bang super duper air pistol castillo asked yung went into his attache case and came out with what looked like a glock semiautomatic pistol except that the slide was perhaps twice as large got it yung said youre not actually going to threaten me with that gun danton said twogun shoot porky castillo ordered yung raised the pistol and squeezed the trigger there was a pfffffft sound john david parker suddenly screamed ouch shit he looked down at his shirtfront a plastic thumbsize dart had penetrated the shirt pocket and then his skin the darts feathers hung limply on his chest sorry porky castillo said dont worry youll wake up in about fifteen minutes i had to make the point to roscoe that i am about as serious as i ever get and i just dont have the time to get into an esoteric philosophical argument about journalistic ethics with him john david parker now with a dazed look on his face suddenly slumped forward his upper torso landing on the kitchen table with a thump twogun yung bent over porky and removed a slice of pizza from under parkers forehead were not playing games here roscoe castillo said evenly am i getting through to you on that jesus christ castillo do you understand what youre to do when either the attorney general or clendennens press agent or maybe clendennen himself calls yeah i understand good now back to my original question who told you about abrego getting moved by the attorney general its important that i know and if i refuse to reveal my source then i will be very disappointed in you and you will wake up in the basement of lorimer manor where edgar will sooner or later get you to tell us i need the name danton didnt immediately reply i presume twogun that youre locked and cocked castillo said it was more an order than a question twogun delchamps put in helpfully wait until i move the rest of the pizza out of the way dantons eyes widened considerably willy the lion leon he said quickly who the hell is he castillo said warden of florence admax why did he tell you one of the three dea guys abrego shot was his nephew did he know why abrego was being transferred no roscoe when the white house calls you can get on your journalists high horse and refuse to divulge your source lets keep them guessing yes sir danton said sarcastically thats more like it castillo said once you take the kings shilling youre supposed to yes sir to the man in charge kings shilling what the hell are you talking about you took a lot more than a shilling roscoe edgar delchamps said dont tell me you forgot danton looked at delchamps and thought jesus christ when he and twogun waltzed in here past the famed impenetrable security of the watergate the day of the presidential press conference at langley they said i was going to get a million dollars in combat pay for going to the island with them i thought it was more of their bullshit and then completely forgot about it how the fuck could i forget a million dollars no wonder theyre pissed would you believe i completely forgot about that that would be a stretch for me castillo said for me too delchamps said even though im willing to believe just about anything about someone in your line of work i believe him twogun said tell me why castillo said there was a stack of mail on a little table by the door when he came in my fbi training took over one envelope which roscoe had not yet opened was his bank statement and theres a milliondollar deposit danton asked it shows that deposit and a wire transfer to the irs of three hundred ninetyfive thousand dollars taxes i thought it best to take care of that for him prompt payment of ones taxes tends to keep the irs off ones back your call edgar castillo said do we scratch up roscoes initial lack of cooperation to his being an ungrateful prick or consider him a bona fide outlaw with a mindboggling disdain for a million dollars after what roscoe considered a very long moment delchamps said my sainted mother always told me even the worst scoundrel deserves a second chance okay stick around until the white house or crenshaw calls and then let me know how he handled it you got it ace delchamps said as he looked at the passedout porky parker then glanced at his watch weve even got time to order a couple more pizzas porkys no doubt going to wake up more than a little groggy and hungry eleven the presidents study the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc april somehow that doesnt reassure me the president said so tell me what you have on this sonofabitch danton excuse me schmidt i am in no mood to hear a recitation about the purity of the goddamn fbi as you damn well know j edgar hoover was the most powerful man in this town because he kept dossiers on the character flaws of everybody of importance dont ask me to believe that the fbi has stopped doing that now tell me what you know that we can hold over the head of this goddamn roscoe j danton to keep him off wolf news tonight the director of the fbi looked uncomfortable for a full thirty seconds as a matter of fact mr president just before i came over here i asked to see what we know about mr danton and actually sir mr danton doesnt seem to have many character flaws hes not homosexual so far as we have been able to learn and the affairs he does have are with single women i dont believe that sonofabitch is a saint schmidt there is only one thing and i dont know what to make of it the fbi director said tell me what it is and ill decide what can be made of it the day of your press conference at langley mr president there was an unusual deposit to his bank account how unusual it was a wire deposit mr president of one million dollars who wired it the lcbf corporation mr president who are they i dont know mr president the wire was from their account in liechtenstein and the same day of the deposit there was a wire transfer to the irs of three hundred ninetyfive thousand dollars and what do you make of this the wire transfer to the irs was a tax payment mr president it suggests to me that he wants to keep the irs from getting curious i can run with that mr president crenshaw said ill get mr danton on the phone and tell him that unless he wants the irs investigating not only this suspicious million dollars but everything else to stay off wolf news tonight why dont you give mr danton a call mr attorney general the president ordered ix one hacienda santa maria oaxaca province mexico april the two brown policia federal suburbans drove rapidly up the road through the grapefruit orchard to the big house two policemen got out of the lead vehicle carrying kalashnikov rifles at the ready they looked around suspiciously and seeing nothing more threatening or suspicious than el jefes gringo friend the gringos girlfriend and several other gringos on the veranda signaled that it was safe for el jefe to get out of the second suburban juan carlos pena commander of the policia federal for oaxaca state did so and walked quickly to the veranda what the hell are you still doing here carlos he demanded good morning juan carlos castillo replied can i offer you a cup of coffee i dont want a fucking cup of coffee i want to know what the fuck the emergency is you called me about and why the fuck youre still here castillo shrugged you might as well have some coffee youre going to be here for a while he gestured toward the orchard there was a line of a dozen men walking out of the orchard toward the house they were wearing black coveralls their faces were covered with balaclava masks and they were all armed with kalashnikovs what the fuck juan carlos exclaimed and turned back to castillo he now saw that another half dozen men similarly clothed and armed had come onto the veranda from inside the house your american express is outgunned juan carlos castillo said i think youd better tell them to lay down their weapons i dont want to kill them but thats your other option pena thought your american express is outgunned he wouldnt dare try killing my bodyguards he said what the fuck is going on here the weapons please juan carlos castillo said and then we can have our little chat youre not actually threatening me you know who i am youre the man whos going to tell your men to put their weapons down because otherwise theyll be dead youre out of your fucking mind if you think im going to let you get away with this pena said and then switched to spanish and ordered his bodyguards to lay down their weapons castillo then issued an order in russian to the men in the balaclava masks pena looked at him with wide eyes that was russian juan carlos castillo said what i did was tell them to restrain your men that means they will put your men in plastic handcuffs take them to the back of the house sit them on the ground in a circle and then handcuff them together i have no intention of hurting themas a matter of fact im hoping we can become palsbut for the moment thats whats going to happen a maid appeared from inside the house pushing a wheeled cart holding a coffee service toward a table where svetlana sat in one of the upholstered wicker chairs ah and heres our coffee castillo said pena watched in furious fascination as his visibly terrified bodyguards were efficiently cuffed and led around the side of the house you will not be harmed pena called out to them in spanish his bodyguards appeared anything but convinced four of the blackclad men then gathered the policia federal weapons took them to one of the suburbans unloaded and disassembled them and then put roughly half of the parts in the second suburban then they emptied the magazines of their cartridges left the magazines in the first suburban and put the cartridges in the second castillo issued a second somewhat shorter order in russian pena looked at him what i told them to do now was go in the kitchen and get lemonade and give it to anyone who is thirsty castillo said and i suspect most of them will be when the russians were in hungary i learned from the allamvedelmi hatosagthe hungarian secret police probably the best interrogators in the world better even than the mossadthat terror causes unusual thirst and your american express certainly looked terrified just now wouldnt you agree pena barked youre going to spend the rest of your life in the oaxaca state prison you realize if you live long enough think that through juan carlos are you really in a position to threaten anyone the guys with the guns get to do the threatening you might want to write that down i dont scare carlos you might want to write that down i really hope thats true castillo said two of the men in black got into the suburbans and drove them out of sight into the grapefruit orchard speaking of the truth castillo began and then interrupted himself but before we get into that why dont you sit down and drink your coffee fuck you and your coffee pena said are you saying that because you dont like coffee or to prove youre not terrified and arent thirsty fuck you pena repeatedbut couldnt restrain a slight smile go on have some coffee castillo said taking a seat beside sweaty we used to be pals and who knows maybe we can be again oh for christs sake pena said he sat in one of the upholstered wicker chairs across from castillo and svetlana and reached for the coffee max walked up to him sat on his haunches and thrust his paw at him pena shook it whats a nice dog like you doing hanging around with a crazy gringo he asked castillo thought max you better be right please god let max be right i have a confession to make old buddy castillo said i have not been exactly truthful with you no shit pena said as he scratched maxs ears castillo gestured with his coffee cup at koussevitzky the last time you were here i told you that my friend stefan koussevitzky here is an israeli citrus expert actually hes not an israeli and he really doesnt know much about citrus no shit then what is he hes a businessman associated with the lcbf corporation and before that he was a major of spetsnaz he gestured toward the blackclad men you know about the spetsnaz juan carlos right ive heard the term pena said and i told you that senorita barlow owns an estancia in uruguay thats true but before she bought the estancia she was known as svetlana alekseeva and she was an svr podpolkovnik thats a lieutenant colonel juan carlos pena studied her then said you wont mind red if i find that very hard to believe i wont mind but youd be a fool if you didnt she said and finally i told you that lester here is a computer expert thats also true but what i didnt tell you is that hes my version of your american express this kid is your american express pena said castillo smiled looks can be deceiving mi amigo say hello to gunnery sergeant lester bradley usmc retired pena shook his head then eyed lester hes your bodyguard he said incredulously come on carlos you dont really expect me to believe that youd better if we were keeping score it would be lester six svr zero im dying to know why youre trying to lay all this bullshit on me pena said im hoping that now that im telling the truth youll tell me the truth first why dont you tell me the truth about you what the fuck is this all about well first why dont you tell me the truth about yourself think carefully before replying juan carlos when you came here the first time and told me to get the hell out of dodge before i got hurt by the drug cartels what was that all about meaning what okay did they send you or maybe youre part ofmaybe even runningone of the cartels and decided it would be smarter to get me out of town than to kill me which would cause all sorts of publicrelations problems fuck you pena exploded you expect me to believe that youre one of the two honest cops in mexico castillo pursued goddamn you weve been friends since we were twelve pena said coldly furious how could you even ask me something like that hector garciaromerocastillo paused until pena acknowledged the namehes been dona alicias lawyer for thirty years maybe longer and hes in the drug business up to his ears why not you pena met castillos eyes and was quiet a long moment how the hell did you learn that about garciaromero pena then demanded castillo shrugged signaling that pena was not going to get an answer okay you sonofabitch pena said i came here the first time to keep you alive i didnt thinki still dontthat you knew what the hell you were getting yourself into i take that as meaning yeah im one of the two honest cops in mexico theres a few more than two of us now you tell me what the hells really going on around here take a look at this juan carlos castillo said and handed him a copy of el diario de el paso it was folded so that page was exposed what am i looking at what do you see a picture of some guy who laid a bunch of money on the magoffin home pena said then looked at castillo is that what you mean you didnt recognize felix abrego ill be goddamned pena said after a second look the other guy is the fbi sac in el paso castillo said the people who whacked the dea agents and my friend danny salazar and kidnapped colonel ferris your friend danny salazar castillo nodded we went back a long way so you were special forces too not a military attache you said too castillo said smiling he shook his head then asked how did you know danny was special forces after we became friends he told me you were friends yeah we were friends is that so hard to believe castillo hesitated a moment before saying now that were now telling each other the truth no danny understood how things work here and how do they work here like i told you the first time i was here the bad guys are winning anybody who thinks the drug cartels can be defeated is a fool the best that me and people like meand the other three or four honest copscan do is fuck them up from time to time danny and i hit it off right away when i first met him as pena spoke castillo glanced at max and thought how could i ever have doubted your infallible ability to judge human character and believed me when i told him how things are after that from time to time i used to slip him information between us we caused the bad guys to lose a lot of money they locked eyes for a moment i believe him one of the reasons i wanted you out of dodge carlosaside from keeping you aliveis that i didnt want you getting in the way of my dealing with the guys who whacked him castillos eyes narrowed you know who the sonsofbitches are pena nodded the zambada cartel they used to be in our special forces the cartels run by a really nasty guy named joaquin archivaldo i was surprised that joaquin was in on the whack kidnappinghe likes to keep his distancebut he was and i think i know why and so was his number two another nasty guy by the name of ismael quintero how are you going to deal with them more important if you know who they are why havent you locked them up because if i did they would escape within two weeks and then come after me with even more enthusiasm than they are coming after me now so how are you going to deal with them how do you think carlos just as soon as i can set it up so that somebody else gets the blame when castillo didnt reply pena said am i shocking you carlos hes wondering what will happen to colonel ferris svetlana put in after you eliminate these people that too sweetheart castillo answered but also why juan carlos wants to take these people out because danny trusted me and because he did now hes dead somehow archivaldo found out what danny and i had goingi may have done something stupid or he just put two and two togetherand decided to whack him and once he decided to do that he figured what the hell ill try to get my old pal felix out of florence while im doing that and then i will go after juan carlos pena im not going to let him get away with either one castillo exchanged glances with svetlana tell him carlito she said tell me what red pena asked everything svetlana said tell him everything carlito or i will castillo looked at her for a long moment i dont have any choice i know both that look and that tone of voice shes made her decision that juan carlos is telling the truthand that he has to be told told everything and right now what i think about doing that doesnt matter why epiphany because when he made that crack the best that me and people like meand the other three or four honest copscan do is fuck them up from time to time he sounded like the mexican chapter of oprichnina international thats the way the good russians the christians have dealt with every vicious bastard from ivan the terrible to vladimir vladimirovich they fucked them up from time to time shes decided that juan carlos is a kindred soul please god let her be right you have the floor podpolkovnik alekseeva he said finally it took svetlana about five minutes to tell juan carlos everything at first there was a cynical expression on penas facei recognize bullshit when i hear itbut it changed as she spoke and when she was finished he nodded as if in approval okay red he said i now believe you were an svr colonel she nodded but didnt say anything which leaves us where juan carlos asked what do you want from me to make up your mind whether youre going to help us or not she said it looks like i dont have much choice do i i hope thats because you think were right she said as opposed to what knowing your other option is you and your men being found as carlitos friend and the dea agents were found and having this man joaquin archivaldo try to figure out who did it pena looked between castillo and svetlana for a moment he said and because im willing to believe red is exsvr i guess im willing to believe shes capable of doing exactly that where the hell did you find this woman carlos actually my brother and i found him svetlana said matteroffactly it didnt turn out the way we expected we planned to eliminate him and almost did what happened god showed us another path she said somehow i dont think youre being sarcastic juan carlos said im not ill be damned pena said i was beginning to think i was the only christian left on earth except for the pope theres a few of us christians left she said and im working on carlito good luck with that pena said which brings us back to my original question where are we as my heathen carlito would put it juan carlos are you in or out you already know the answer to that dont you colonel pena said svetlana raised her voice and issued an order in russian one of the spetsnaz popped to attention saluted and motioned to two of his men who followed him as he trotted around the side of the house hes going to free your men she explained and bring them here after you have explained the change in the situation well give them their weapons and then carlito will show you the helicopter and ask your suggestions visavis how it should be used what helicopter juan carlos asked a policia federal black hawk castillo said simply and sipped his coffee as he watched penas face change expression two the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc april supervisory secret service agent robert j mulligan pushed open the door and announced mr president his excellency raul vargas ambassador of the united states of mexico to the united states and secretary of state natalie cohen president clendennen rose from behind his desk and with a cordial smile and his hand extended walked toward vargasa tall oliveskinned elegantly dressed man with a carefully trimmed pencilline mustacheand the secretary of state how nice to see you again mr ambassador he said the pleasure is entirely mine mr president vargas replied secretary cohen tells me youre carrying a letter for me yes i am mr president vargas said he took a businesssize envelope from his jacket pocket and handed it over please have a seat mr ambassador while i read what my friend ramon has to say he indicated one of the couches turned to clemens mccarthy and ordered get the ambassador some coffee mccarthy mccarthy in turn gestured more than a little imperiously to mulligan who in turn gestured even more imperiously to special agent douglas may i sit mr president secretary cohen asked clendennen waved in the general direction of the couch as he sat down at his desk but did not otherwise respond the president then tore open the envelope took out the letter it contained and began to read it ramon manuel martinez mexico city df april my dear joshua ambassador mccann was kind enough to personally deliver your letter of th april and i hasten to reply i am of course anxious to do what i can to see that colonel ferris is returned safely to his family i fully agree with your belief that interrogation of felix abrego by mexican law enforcement authorities will be quite helpful in identifying those responsible for his kidnapping and the murder of the other american officers to this end i have instructed the oaxaca state prison officials to be prepared to receive felix abrego when he is delivered there by your marshals and to make him available for interrogation by mexican officials further as soon as i can contactat the moment hes not availablesenor juan carlos pena chief of the policia federal for oaxaca state i will direct him to call ambassador mccann to coordinate with your marshals the moving of abrego to the oaxaca state prison and to personally supervise his interrogation if there is anything else i can do please let me know with warm personal regards ramon when clendennen had finished reading the letter he looked at ambassador vargas and started to say something the secretary of state who had seen president martinezs letter thought hes about to lose control mr president vargas spoke first there is something elseanother message really clendennen asked coldly yes sir president martinez thought it best under the circumstances that it be delivered privately and verbally rather than commit it to paper privately clendennen asked then said madam secretary would you give us a moment in privacy mr president vargas said secretary cohen is familiar with the contents of the message president martinez suggested that she be with me when i deliver it to assure you of its accuracy well then mr ambassador why dont you deliver the message president martinez doesnt want committed to paper yes sir quote i am sure you will understand that what i propose is the best i can do under the circumstances at this time end quote cohen thought if he didnt lose control a moment ago he will now he didnt president clendennen considered that calmly for a moment and then politely asked madam secretary is that the message you understand president martinez wanted the ambassador to verbally deliver yes it is mr president cohen replied thank you mr ambassador the president said theres no point in keeping you from the press of your duties any longer please be good enough to pass to president martinez both my gratitude and my best wishes it will be my pleasure mr president vargas said madam secretary clendennen asked politely may i have a few minutes more of your time yes of course mr president the president waited until the door had closed behind vargas and then stood up holding martinezs letter have you seen this fucking thing he asked furiously yes sir i have cohen said may i see it mr president clemens mccarthy asked the president threw it at him mccarthy tried and failed to catch it in the air it fell to the carpet in front of the presidents desk and then floated out of sight under the left pedestal of the desk mccarthy got on his hands and knees and tried to retrieve it that is not the letter i asked that sonofabitch to send me the president said no sir it is not cohen agreed what happened to my letter the one i wanted him to send me i delivered it to president martinez sir she said and told him what you were asking i told you to have ambassador mccann do that the president said ambassador mccann thought it would be best if i went with him and i agreed she remembered exactly what mccann had said i am not going to martinez with that crazy letter is clendennen out of his mind thinking that he can push martinez around like that ill go with you but thats it otherwise you can have my resignation and clendennen pursued president martinez asked us to wait mulligan clemens mccarthy interrupted get me something so i can get this goddamn letter what should i get mr mccarthy an umbrella a ruler just something thatll reach the fucking letter the president looked from mccarthy to cohen and and about fortyfive minutes later he called us back into his office and gave us the letter ambassador vargas gave you he then told us ambassador vargas was on the telephone he told vargas that i was going to bring a letter he wished vargas to give to you and that verbal message then almost as an afterthought he asked me if i would accompany ambassador vargas here to verify the verbal message but you have seen the letter she glanced at mccarthy on his knees digging for the letter then looked back to clendennen yes sir ambassador vargas showed it to me on our way here from the mexican embassy that miserable ungrateful sonofabitch clendennen exploded after all ive done for him millions of dollars in aid ten fucking black hawk helicopters pretending i dont know whats going on at the border not one word about his being blind to that secret drug cartel airport and all i wanted him to do was provide me a little cover in case something goes wrong cohen didnt reply and what is this bullshit about taking this abrego character to a prison the ox something he looked to where now both mccarthy and mulligan were on their hands and knees trying with a letter opener to get the letter from under the desk just pick up the fucking desk and move it out of the way for christs sake the president ordered they immediately tried it proved too heavy for both of them jesus christ the president said douglas get them some help i want that goddamn letter special agent douglas went to the outer office and returned with the two secret service agents who guarded the outer office as mulligan douglas mccarthy and one of the latter took a grip on the desk one of the outeroffice secret service agents fashioned a hook from a wire clothes hanger and as they lifted he managed to stab the letter with it then pull it out from under the desk he extended it to the president who snatched it tearing it on the makeshift hook of the clothes hanger the president looked at the letter and found what he wanted mccarthy walked quickly to him and read over his shoulder whats this business about taking abrego to the how the hell do you pronounce this prison secretary cohen furnished the correct pronunciation of oaxaca to the president never heard of it the president said or anything about us taking abrego there thus i know goddamn well it wasnt in my letter to martinez he looked at mccarthy was it he asked no mr president it wasnt mccarthy said cohen thought yes it was whats mccarthy up to i read the draft letter aloud right here in the oval office then where the hell did it come from possibly from the fbi mccarthy asked innocently thats probably it mr president supervisory special agent mulligan chimed in no telling what the fbi said to those people or viveahversa secretary cohen thought thats vice versa you cretin not viveahversa then she thought so mulligans part of whatever is going on here what the hell is going on here and then she noticed that mccarthy was looking at her carefully as if he expected her to say im sorry but in the letter i took to president martinezthe one he said you wrote mr mccarthythere were specific references to taking abrego to the oaxaca state prison she said nothing get schmidt and crenshaw in here the president ordered right now i want to know what the hell is going on you dont want to talk to them on the telephone mr president special agent douglas asked if i did douglas the president replied sarcastically i would have said get schmidt and then crenshaw on the phone yes sir douglas said and walked to a telephone on a sideboard to summon schmidt and crenshaw the president turned to the secretary of state you dont know anything about this oaxaca prison cohen was aware that mccarthy seemed very interested in what her reply would be just what ive heard and seen here mr president she said then i dont see any point in taking any more of your valuable time madam secretary if i need you later ill call thank you mr president cohen said and stood up and walked out of the oval office when the door had closed the president asked mccarthy do you think shes telling the truth i have no reason to believe shes not mr president mccarthy said but i just thought it might be wise to ask her to keep what she heard here to herself yeah the president said should i bring her back in here mr president no you can tell her as well as i can that she goddamn well better keep what she just heard in here to herself mccarthy caught up with the secretary of state as she was about to get in her limousine madam secretary mccarthy called a moment please she turned to face him but didnt speak the president asked me to tell you he hopes you understand that what took place in the oval office just now has to be kept between us cohen nodded but didnt reply and let me say i appreciate your wisdom in not getting further into the business of what was and what was not in the letter you took to president martinez mccarthy said again she didnt reply but her eyebrows rose in question none of us want him to go off the deep end just now do we madam secretary now would be a very bad time for something like that to happen now she asked and then before he had a chance to reply said good morning mr mccarthy got into the limousine and gestured to the state department security officer who was holding the door open to close it three the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc april it took you two long enough to get here president clendennen greeted attorney general stanley crenshaw and fbi director mark schmidt as they walked into the oval office mr president crenshaw said we quite literally dropped what we were doing when we got douglass call saying you wanted to see us right away and what exactly was it that you quite literally dropped when douglas called a discussion of the latest development in el paso let me get this straight clendennen said schmidt there has been a development in el paso that you were discussing with crenshaw yes mr president werent you listening when i told you i wanted to hear immediately of anything that happened mr president i work for attorney general crenshaw schmidt said uncomfortably you work for me goddamn it the president said furiously mr president im responsible crenshaw said i told director schmidt to make me well the president interrupted what is this latest development that you were going to tell me about when you finally got around to it its this mr president crenshaw said and handed him a sheet of paper the president took it and read it transfer instructions at april put your guest and no more than two us marshals aboard an el paso police helicopter at el paso international file a local aircraft test flight plan and take off no later than at contact ciudad juarez international with the message necessary to make a precautionary landing your aircraft will be met on landing and the exchange of your guest for ours will be accomplished at that time your aircraft will then be free to return to the united states what the hell is this the president asked where did it come from according to sac johnson mr president it was handed to one of the fbi agents on stakeout in the el paso post office schmidt said which suggests to me that the fbi agent didnt succeed in being inconspicuous the president said who handed it to him may i see that mr president clemens mccarthy asked the president handed him the letter try to keep it from going under the desk mccarthy the president said and then turned his attention to schmidt im waiting a boy mr president a boy twelve years old latino handed it to one of the fbi agents he said that a man gave him five dollars and told him to hand thatit was in an envelope addressed to the fbito him i mean he indicated to whom the boy was to hand the envelope and that man do we know who he is is it too much to hope that he was detained for questioning by the time they started looking for him mr president schmidt said the man had gone a regular james bond huh the president said with a snort and then asked do either of you have any idea whats going on here i dont understand the question mr president crenshaw said that doesnt surprise me at all the president said schmidt and i were discussing how to deal with the exchange when you called what do you mean by that we were thinking of sending fbi agentsinstead of marshalson the helicopter for the exchange jesus h christ the president exploded let me tell you what would happen if you sent fbi agents on that helicopter they would land at that airport and be greeted by say a dozen mexicans all armed to the teeth who would relieve them of this fucking mexican murderer and then wave byebye they would not get colonel ferris who is probably five hundred miles from ciudad juarez i know what they think of your intelligence but im surprised they think im also that stupid neither crenshaw nor schmidt replied what we are going to do gentlemen is go along with president martinez that ungrateful sonofabitch he wants abrego turned over to this mexican copwhats his name mccarthy pena mr president mccarthy furnished juan carlos pena chief of the policia federal for oaxaca state for interrogation which means to be turned loose the president picked up so were going to do just that were going to take this goddamn murderer to the oaxaca state prison and exchange him for ferris hell be taken there gentlemen not by us marshals not by the fbi but by as many of those super green beretswhat do they call them mccarthy the delta force mr president mccarthy asked his confusion evident in his voice no goddammit i said super green berets gray fox mr president attorney general crenshaw asked and his confusion was equally evident in his voice right the president said gray fox as many of those gray fox people thatll fit on three black hawks theyll either get ferris back when they get there or theyll bring the goddamn mexican back and throw him in his florence cell i dont think a goddamn mexican cop is going to want to get in a fight with twenty twentyfive gray fox guys get general mcnab on the phone general mcnab is in afghanistan mr president mccarthy said then get his deputy that irishman whats his name mccool something like that otoole mr president major general terrence otoole mccarthy said well get major general terrence otoole on the phone and tell him to get up here and while youre at it get naylor and beiderman in here too ill teach that bastard martinez he cant fuck with joshua ezekiel clendennen four office of the director central intelligence agency mclean virginia april an unexpected pleasure madam secretary dci a franklin lammelle said if i had known you were coming there would have been a brass band can we dispense with the clever repartee frank natalie cohen replied im really in no mood for it i tend to hide behind clever repartee when i have problems lammelle said whats yours recording devices turned off he nodded i usually turn them on only when the enemy is at the gates he replied then realized that might qualify as clever repartee and added sorry she nodded accepting the apology i just came from the oval office she said with the unnerving suspicion that there may be something to president clendennens conspiracy theory he raised his eyebrows made a give it to me gesture with his hands and said now quite serious tell me all about it martinez didnt buy that draft letter she began and after i had been dismissed she concluded mccarthy caught up with me as i was getting in my car in the portico told me the president had sent him to tell me to keep my mouth shut and then said quote i appreciate your wisdom in not getting further into the business of what was and what was not in the letter you took to president martinez end quote when i didnt reply he added quote none of us want him to go off the deep end just now do we madam secretary now would be a very bad time for something like that to happen end quote so now youre willing to buy in on the coup detat theory lammelle asked im not sure im willing to go that far but something very unsavory is going on here frank would you say the situation is desperate he asked im not sure id go that far either but iwehave to get to the bottom of it time to get off the fence natalie what does that mean the situation is or is not desperate this is not one of those times when you can put off making that decision why am i getting the idea that you know something i dont maybe because im the dci we have a reputation for knowing things and doing things that other people dont know about or dont want to know about natalie said after a moment where are you going with this frank you havent answered my question is this situation desperate desperate enough to require taking desperate action she considered that for a long moment and then said ill listen to what you have to say not quite good enough sorry what is it exactly you want from me frank your word that after i offer my suggestion and tell you what i know that you wont take any action of which i disapprove thats too much to ask then good luck with your problem natalie i dont like this at all i didnt think you would im the secretary of state you are required by law to provide me with any intelligence you have that i might find useful in the discharge of my duties spoken like a true dip lammelle said big words meaning nothing in real life you want to walk that scenario through you go to truman ellsworthdo you really want to go to ellsworth and you tell him im not giving you information youre entitled to by law he tells me to give you what you want and i tell him i dont have any idea what youre talking about so he goes to president clendennendo you really want ellsworth going to president clendennen about this and he says lammelle she held up her hand to shut him off tell me again what it is you want me to give my word about she said that after i tell you what i know you wont go any further with itthats sort of moot because if you did that id deny itand also that you take no action of any kind without my approval i dont know why im surprised she said you didnt get to be dci by being a nice guy did you frank i got here by doing what i had to in what i thought were the best interests of the united states what was it that samuel johnson said frank on that april night in something about patriotism now i get the history lecture lammelle said chuckling he was talking about false patriotism natalie when he said it was the last refuge of the scoundrel not the real thing false is when it doesnt cost you anything my kind is expensive you can be disgraced you can go to prison you can even lose your life are you feeling just a little selfrighteous frank after doing something you know you shouldnt have done okay conversation over is there anything else i can do for you before you go the secretary of state was in deep thought a moment then said okay you have my word when he didnt reply she said maybe you should have gone in the foreign service frank youre really a tough negotiator i have your word he asked i said that you did all right what charley castillo plans to do is grab abregoand he hopes ferriswhen either of them shows up at the oaxaca state prison and see who that brings out of the woodwork how could he possibly manage that the president has personally ordered general naylor to see there is absolutely no us military involvement at last count hes got about forty exspetsnaz where did he get exspetsnaz from aleksandr pevsner who believes that this whole kidnapping business is connected with vladimir putins plan to take out him and his family pevsners original reaction to hearing that the new russian cultural affairs officer for venezuela panama costa rica nicaragua honduras and guatemala is valentin komarovskiwho of course is really our old pal sergei murov the svr rezident herewas to whack anybody pevsner even suspected was svr until putin got the message oh my god castillo has managed to talk pevsner out of this for the time beingwhich means until castillos able to snatch abrego andor ferris at the prison and then see what the interrogation of whoever comes out of the woodwork turns up we know the venezuelans are involved the guy who dropped the kidnappers letter in the post office slot in el paso is jose rafael monteverde the financial attache of the embassy of the republica bolivariana de venezuela in mexico city how do you know that secretary cohen asked a friend of mine happened to be in the el paso post office when he did it i will refrain myself from commenting that the cia is expressly forbidden by law from operating within the united states she said anyway charleys got people from china post sitting on this guy i think theyre going to want to talk to him china post the mercenary employment agency charley prefers to think of them as former comrades in arms lammelle said wheres he getting the money to pay for all this she asked and then quickly added dont tell me i think i know those people so far i think hes picking up the tab himself or aleksandr pevsner is but that las vegas money is going to be available if he asks for it if castillo kidnaps this venezuelan diplomat president martinez what wont like it wont let him get away with it both and you know it so what if he doesnt like it lammelle said hes done nothing and you know it to get colonel ferris back or get the people who murdered salazar and the dea agents and as far as not letting castillo get away with what hes doing how is he going to do that with the policia federal come on natalie frank you dont really expect me to look the other way at any of this i expect you to do what you can to prevent a coup detat we dont know whos behind that the only ones im sure are not are generals naylor and mcnab and we can count on their help once we find out whos behind it but we have to find out whos behind it whether the russians or montvale or truman ellsworth you think that ellsworth might be involved i think its possible the only thing i know for sure is that the only one who can find out is castillo and if he breaks a few laws finding out i have no problem with that she considered that a moment and then said dont interpret this as a sign that im considering going along with any of this but as a practical matter how is he going to i guess kidnap is the word ferris andor abrego from the mexican authorities or the kidnappers or for that matter the us marshal service i told you he has the exspetsnaz he got from pevsner and the people from china postplus of course the merry outlaws and how as a practical matter frank is he going to move them around mexico with the entire policia federalplus the kidnappers the drug cartels and possibly even the svrlooking for them well he has the helicopter thatll help youre not talking about that black hawk he nodded you actually turned that helicopter over to him persons representing themselves as officers of the cia went to fort sam and flew it away lammelle said they told fort sam officials they were returning it to mexico you actually sent your people to fort sam to steal that helicopter for castillo what i said was people representing themselves as officers of the cia and it was never stolen though there wasnt exactly a bill of sale charley did buy it for a million plus so it could be argued its actually his chopper my god youre insane natalie youre the one who told me that the mexicans reported that black hawk was destroyed in president martinezs war on the drug cartels how can you steal something that doesnt exist she shook her head in disbelief anyway apparently these persons have gotten away with their deception there have been no reports to anyone about anything unusual happening at fort sam and how does he plan to get the black hawk into mexico its already there as we speak hes showing it to a man he describes as one of the four honest cops in mexico i was just talking to him i hung uphe pointed to the brick on his deskas you were coming through the door does this honest cop have a name she asked im sure he does but youre not going to tell me castillos going to do what hes going to do natalie what you have to decide is whether youre going to help him or not whether in other wordsthis is the choice naylor had to make when he knew there was nothing he could do to stop charley from going to la orchila islandcharleys failure would do more harm to the country than his success get him back on the brick she said he may not want to talk to you why not i think hes as much afraid that your high moral standards will demand that you do the right thing as youre afraid hes about to start a war with mexico youre saying he doesnt trust me i dont believe that im saying he thinks you have a different agenda one probably in conflict with his he paused then went on natalie im betraying a confidence when i tell you this but i think you should know there are now two nets on the brick the old one which you have on your brick and the new one youre not on the new one neither are those people charley doesnt entirely trust them either so where does that leave us i just realized it puts me in a somewhat uncomfortable position lammelle said what the hell he reached for his brick took out the handset put his index finger in front of his lips as a signal to cohen and then pushed one of the direct connect buttons and the speakerphone key yeah frank castillos voice came over the loudspeaker what would you say if i told you that natalie cohen knows what youre up to and wants to talk to you about helping id say you have a dangerously loose mouth and have been smoking an illegal substance what the hell is this all about i thought you liked natalie and trusted her i like her very much do i think she wants to help no if she knows what im doing and wants to talk to me its to talk me out of what im doing and goddamn you frank if you did tell her there was a buzzing sound cohen and lammelle looked at each other until they realized the buzzing was coming from the secretary of states brick hold one charley lammelle said cohen opened the leather attache case and took out the handset she saw which number was illuminated and mouthed crenshaw see what he wants lammelle said see what who wants castillo demanded impatiently who are you talking to frank lammelle cut the connection natalie cohen she said if there was ever any question in your mind that the president is acting irrationally forget it the attorney general said what are you talking about schmidt and i just left the oval office crenshaw said the president just decided to send three black hawks loaded with gray fox operators to the oaxaca state prison to exchange abrego for ferris and from his attitude i dont think he cares if theres a firefight with the policia federal in fact i think hes hoping for one why would he want oh the word is irrational natalie and thats a euphemism let me get this straight hes going to send gray fox to deal with this policia federal officer juan carlos pena crenshaw said thats going to take him at least twentyfour hours maybe fortyeight before they can leave right mcnab is in afghanistan so clendennen sent for mcnabs deputy general otoole and for beiderman and naylor thatll take some time of course let me get back to you stanley she said she met lammelles eyes and added i realize this is a desperate situation requiring desperate measures let me see what i can do she broke the connection you say this no longer works to talk to castillo you still can talk to him on it you just wont know whats being said on what were calling net two she punched a number on her handset hello madam secretary castillos voice came over the loudspeaker charley what do you know about a policia federal officer named pena juan carlos pena rude question but necessary he replied why do you want to know because the president is about to send three black hawks loaded with gray fox special operations to exchange abrego for ferris at the prison this man operates in oaxaca state he doesnt operate the prison hes the head of the policia federal for oaxaca state so you do know him yeah i know him castillo said why dont you go back to the beginning with this so i know what youre talking about all right she said this is the problem x one andrews air force base prince georges county maryland april general allan b naylor was walking from the vip waiting room in the base operations building towards his cathe military designation for the gulfstream vwhen colonel j d brewer his senior aidedecamp who was walking beside him took his signal corps brick from his tunic pocket he glanced at it to see who was calling and then handed it to naylor secretary beiderman general he announced naylor stopped walking and put the device to his ear general naylor mr secretary where are you allan at andrews about to get on my plane brussels and nato are going to have to wait beiderman said mulligan called me just now and said the president wants to see you and me right away okay naylor said he also wanted to know when mcnab will be back from afghanistan i told him id have to ask you as i recall we told mcnab to get out of dodge and stay there until the president got his temper under control does this mean that hasnt happened i dont know beiderman confessed well if the president has ordered him back do you want me to handle that i already have hell be leaving over there as soon as he can get on a plane you realize i hope that he was dead serious when he said if he is relieved over that nonsense at arlington hell demand a courtmartial can he do that demand a courtmartial hes not going to be punished reduced in rank or anything like that just relieved i dont know it would depend on the circumstances what he could dowhat he probably will dois go to roscoe danton and argue his case in the court of public opinion in other words on the front page of the washington timespost and the television sets tuned to wolf news and the president will lose that battle danton loathes the president and thinks mcnab walks on water the secretary of defense grunted and then said wouldnt it be nice if we could say screw him let him make an ass of himself like that but we cant can we were in the uncomfortable position of having to defend the presidency against the luna naylor heard what he was about to say and stopped midword you can say it allan beiderman said we have to defend the presidency against the lunacy of the president have you got any good ideas on how we can do that no but ill try to think of some on my way over there there wheres there the white house andrews ill pick you up in ten fifteen minutes you dont have to do that what i dont want to do is walk into the oval office all by myself are you going to have room for my people colonel brewer and mulligan said the president wants to see you and me only beiderman said ive got a car why dont i just meet you at the white house beiderman considered that then said okay but if i get there before you ill wait come now done naylor said and broke the connection two the presidents study the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc april when secret service agent mark douglas showed beiderman and naylor into the room supervisory special agent robert j mulligan press secretary clemens mccarthy and the president were standing before a map board it held a map of mexico what the hell is mcnab doing in afghanistan the president greeted them less than warmly i need him here now as you know mr president naylor responded a substantial portion of general mcnabs command is in afghanistan he spends a good deal of his time there what about this other special forces guy mccool is he any good if you are referring to general mcnabs deputy general otoole mr president okay otoole is this otoole any good general otoole is a fine officer mr president naylor said the president looked between beiderman and naylor and said id rather have mcnab but you go with what youve got right yes sir naylor and beiderman said almost simultaneously i had clemens call otoole and tell him to drop everything and get up here clendennen said whens he due clemens he should already have landed at andrews mr president mccarthy said well while were waiting for him let me bring you up to speed on whats going on around here and how im going to deal with it the president said the sound of helicopter rotors penetrated the soundinsulated walls of the white house that has to be him the president decided out loud well wait i hate to explain things over and over major general terrence otoole was shown into the presidents study he was wearing a somewhat mussed camouflagepattern battledress uniform he saluted and said pardon my appearance sir you look general the president said as if youre ready to go to work no apologies are necessary so thats the plan gentlemen the president said what do you think mr president i think its brilliant clemens mccarthy promptly said what you think mccarthy the president immediately shot him down is irrelevant youre a press agent what is it they say you might want to write that down mr president general naylor said with all possible respect sir i have a few questions possibly because i missed some things as you laid out your plan i expected you and mccool here to have questions general im the commander in chief but im not a soldier what didnt you understand as i understand the situation mr president there are two sites for the exchange of this fellow abrego for colonel ferris no theres only one at the oaxaca state prison he turned to the map using a ruler as a pointer he aimed it at the map here clendennen said its apparently in the middle of goddamn nowhere naylor said excuse me sir but i thought i understood you to say that there has been a message from the kidnappers stating they wanted the exchange to take place at the juarez international airport and i thought i had made it perfectly clear that if we did that wed play right into their hands the helicopter would land there the two us marshals on it would find themselves outnumbered by mexican banditos who would take this man abrego from them and then either wave byebye or kill them too as he looked around the room at everyone he added the exchange will take place at the oaxaca state prison clear yes sir naylor pursued but may i respectfully suggest that these people do expect the helicopter to appear at the juarez airfield at ohninehundred tomorrow ifwhenit does not then what then they will figure out that they havent made a sucker out of joshua ezekiel clendennen that may put colonel ferris at risk mr president naylor said carefully hes already at risk isnt he general clendennen responded you ever hear what patton said general or was it macarthur im afraid i dont follow you mr president never take counsel of your fears is what one of themnow that i think about it it was macarthursaid you never heard that im familiar with it sir naylor said mr president may i make a suggestion general otoole asked thats what youre here for general the president said as i understand your plan sir it is your intention to send us marshals to establish contact with the mexican police chief pena the president nodded and gestured for otoole to get to his point i think it might be best to send a special operator to do that sir in addition to setting up the schedule for the exchange he would be able to reconnoiter the terrain that would be valuable in case there was trouble presumably you have a specific special operator in mind general yes sir otoole said looked at naylor then went on i dont know if general naylor would agree with sending a special operator or with my recommendation of who that should be thats moot general the president said im making the decisions here i think sending a special operator instead of a marshal is a good ideahell send in all of gray fox now what you have to do is convince me that the man you want to send is the right one i was thinking of mr victor dalessandro mr president mister dalessandro that sounds as if hes a civilian i dont want anybody from the goddamn cia involved in this or from the dea or any other place like that hes a retired chief warrant officer mr president now a daca department of the army civilian employeeworking for specopscom and in your opinion he would be the best man to send yes sir i concur mr president naylor said well thats nice to know the president said sarcastically weve really had entirely too much dissension in the ranks around here lately clendennen let that sink in and then went on okay then this guy dalessandro goes mulligan get secretary cohen on the phone tell her hell tell her to get over here she cant be kept out of this she already knows too much mulligan picked up the red presidential circuit telephone but thats all the president said i dont want every idiot and his twin brother involved in this nobody else is to learn of it unless i personally clear it he looked around the room again everybody got that mr president naylor said do i correctly infer that you dont plan to tell the dci what youre going to do correct and the director of national intelligence mr ellsworth naylor pursued correct and vice president montvale especially not montvale clendennen flared and you damn well know why im afraid sir that i dont know what youre talking about naylor said the hell you dont the president snapped sir i dont both naylor and beiderman were about convinced that naylor had just pushed the president over the edge clendennens face tightened and whitened and he opened his mouth as if to speak and then changed his mind when he finally spoke he apparently had himself under control i dont know why im arguing with you about this general the president said the decision whether to involve the vice president in this is mineand mine aloneto make i have decided not to tell him clear yes sir there is a precedent clendennen then said reasonably i dont think anyone would argue that my trying to get colonel ferris back from those who hold him captive is anywhere near as important as the atomic bomb still president roosevelt didnt think vice president truman had the need to know we had the atom bomb and elected not to tell him and i dont think vice president montvale has the need to know about what were about to do and i have elected not to tell him any questions general no sir naylor said okay now lets get to the nuts and bolts of this operation how are we going to get this civilian whats his name again dalessandro mr president otoole furnished victor dalessandro how are we going to get this man dalessandro from where he isand by the way where is he shouldnt he be here to the oaxaca state prison after a moment otoole realized the presidents question was not rhetorical sir i would recommend the use of a black hawk to get mr dalessandro from where he isel pasoto the prison otoole said why not fly him there in a regular airplane the president challenged theres an airport right by it he picked up the ruler again and pointed at the map with it right here how the fuck do you pronounce that again clemens mccarthy correctly pronounced xoxocotlan for the president what is that inca incan the president asked thats certainly what it sounds like mr president mccarthy said the president turned to otoole im waiting general sir for you to tell me why whatsisname is better off flying to the prison in a helicopter instead of using an airplane to fly to the airport with the unpronounceable name yes sir sir for the same reason i gave before it will permit him to reconnoiter the area he can do that better in a black hawk yeah i suppose he can the president conceded now where are we going to get the helicopter i would suggest sir that since were going to use night stalker birds to carry the gray fox night stalker birds the president interrupted what the hell are they is that its how we refer to the rotary wing aircraftthe helicoptersassigned to the th special operations aviation regiment sir i see that im going to have to get used to the terminology you people use im the commander in chief and i should know it but sometimes i think you and general naylor are speaking a foreign language i can see where it might be a little confusing sir otoole said okay ive got several questions what kind of a helicopter are we talking about uhfs sir theyre specially modified black hawks for missions like this and they have the range to fly to this prison from el paso yes sir i believe they do you believe they do dont you know i always like to consult the experts mr president otoole said who would that be colonel arthur kingsolving sir the th regiments commander well why isnt he here naylor offered we can have colonel kingsolving here in flight time from fort campbell mr president see thats what i mean the president said i sometimes think youre speaking a foreign language what the hell does flight time from fort campbell mean colonel kingsolving can be here sir naylor said in the time it will take him to fly from fort campbell the th is stationed at fort campbell sir why arent they stationed at fort bragg with specopscom the president asked what the hell are they doing way out in kansas fort campbell is in kentucky mr president naylor said the president knows where fort campbell is general mccarthy said answer the question general clendennen snapped i wasnt privy to the decision to station the th at campbell sir naylor said it was made by the chief of staff and he didnt even ask you or otoole here where you thought such an important organization should be stationed no sir he did not did youor general otoolecomplain when the chief of staff put this organization in the middle of kentucky instead of fort bragg where it should be no sir why not it was in the nature of an order sir soldiers are expected to obey their orders not protest them an admirable philosophy clendennen said i wish i knew how to instill it in the people around me he paused okay so where are we we were talking about getting colonel kingsolving here mr president naylor said no thats already been decided the question is how is there any reason he couldnt come here in a black hawk no sir the flight time would be longer sir otoole said id already figured that out general believe it or not the president said get him on the phone and tell him to come here in a black hawk id like a good look at one mulligan clear it for him to land on the west lawn yes sir mr president naylor said i would recommend having a black hawk sent to el paso from fort campbell to take mr dalessandro to the prison do it clendennen ordered and that would raise the question of mr dalessandros orders sir how is he to deal with this mexican police chief if this fellow is as good as you and otoole say he is he should be able to figure that out himself wouldnt you say sir as general otoole pointed out he will have two missions the first he will have to know about that that is the arrival of abrego at the prison thats the overt mission the covert mission is to determine the best way of liberating colonel ferris how much do you want otoole to tell him about that the president gave that question thirty seconds of serious consideration i was about to say leave that to general otooles good judgment he has experience in these matters but then i realized i want general otoole here with me to answer the questions about this and that ones that will inevitably arise so what i think we should do general naylor is have you go to el paso to give this man dalessandro his marching orders general my appearance at fort bliss would raise questions who said anything about fort bliss i want you to go to el paso sir fort bliss abuts el paso there is an army airfield there biggs army airfield if i went into el paso international instead of biggs questions would be raised well you dont have to travel in that gulfstream of yoursgoing there on a regular airline would be one way of avoiding attention wouldnt it yes sir if you think its best i can go commercial no the president then said there would be questions about that too why you werent traveling in your gulfstream besides it will be quicker going and coming if i need you back here so heres your marching orders general get down to el paso general otoole will have this man dalessandro waiting for you and he will have arranged for a black hawk to take him to meet this mexican cop you will give dalessandro his marching orders and as soon as hes on his way to mexico you come back here got it yes sir and after mr dalessandro meets with the mexican policeman what should i tell him to do tell him to go back to el paso and await further orders well cross that bridge when we get to it yes sir ill leave right away yeah the president said have a nice flight general thank you sir three office of the director central intelligence agency mclean virginia april and what can the cia do for the most important general in the world today a franklin lammelle answered his telephone you know i dont think thats funny frank general allan b naylor said it was a perfectly serious question you can tell me where i can find vic dalessandro two questions lammelle said what makes you think i would know and why do you want to know lammelle held the commander in chief of the united states central command in the highest possible regard in terms of ability and integrity but he didnt like him very muchand sometimes not at all naylor was deeply into the west pointers creed of duty honor country and while that was certainly commendable naylor lammelle had decided over the years just went too goddamn far with it the best example of this was naylors relationship with charley castillo he had known charley since he was a child charley and naylors son had been a year apart in a private elementary school in germany when charleys mother suffering from terminal cancer announced her desire to find charleys father she had told mrs naylor her friend that shed been impregnated at seventeen by a dashing nineteenyearold army chopper jockey whod then disappeared mrs naylor pressed her husband thenmajor naylor to find the boys only living relative naylor had been happy to do it he was a highly moral man who really loathed officers who knocked up young german women and never made the slightest effort to meet their responsibilities visavis their love child castillos father hadnt been hard to find he was buried in the fort sam national cemetery beneath a headstone onto which had been chiseled a representation of the medal of honor charleys status changed from that of a poor german bastard who had been shamefully treated by a us army officerwhose ass naylor intended to burninto the son of an officer who had been awarded the nations highest award for valor on the battlefield the first thing naylor had done was set in motion the legal wheels which would keep charleys substantial inheritance from being squandered by his newfound family when that hadnt proved to be necessarycharleys fathers family turned out to be as well offstinking rich to put a point on itas his mothers uncle allan as naylor had quickly become now turned his efforts into getting charley into the long gray line his fathers medal of honor gave him a pass into west point and at west point he would be imbued with the duty honor country philosophy which had guided naylor all of his life a franklin lammelle knew that that had almostbut not quiteturned out the way naylor had planned charley had graduated from the military academy toward the top of his class and been commissioned into armor five generations of generals named naylor had been cavalry and then armored officers the naylor plan for carlos g castillo was working most of naylors plans for anything worked he was by then already a threestar general and serving as general stormin norman schwarzkopfs operations officer for desert storm but then the plan went off the tracks some publicity conscious brass hats had decided it would be good public relations if the son of a moh helicopter pilot also flew as a helicopter pilot in the upcoming desert war i a training slot at fort rucker was found for him and castillo was sent there to learn how to fly the bell hu helicopter on his second day at the aviation school it was learned that not only did castillo already know how to fly but had more than hours as pilotincommand of the twinengine version huey one of the subsidiaries of castillo enterprises was castillo aviation which serviced oil wells in the gulf of mexico castillo had begun flying for castillo aviation as soon as he acquired his commercial rotary wing pilots license which he had done when he was sixteen and a high school junior the brass had regarded this as a fortuitous circumstance the hero pilots son could go into operation desert storm once he finished transition training flying the armys glamour machine the apache ah attack helicopter once he got to arabia and realizing the twentyoneyearold second lieutenant was not qualified to fly the apache the brass did the best thing they could think of to keep him alive he was assigned as copilot to the most skilled and experienced apache pilot in the unit that plan went awry too two hours into desert storm the apache on a mission to take out iraqi antiaircraft weapons was struck the pilot blinded and castillo wounded castillo was faced with the choice of landing the shotup helicopter and waiting for help or trying to get the pilot medical attention he flew the smoking and shuddering apache at fifty feet above the desert back two hundred miles general naylor learned for the first time that second lieutenant castillo was not where he was supposed to beat fort knox undergoing basic officers course trainingwhen castillo was marched into desert storm headquarters so that he could receive the impact awardsin other words get the medals immediatelyof the distinguished flying cross and purple heart medals from the hands of general schwarzkopf himself appropriate counseling was given to the officers who had put castillo in the cockpit of an apache he was clearly unqualified to fly but that left the problem of what to do with second lieutenant castillo loading him on the next airplane for fort knox would suggest that castillo had done something wrong and that was clearly not the case and so would taking him off flight status checking the roster of units assigned to desert storm naylor thought he had found just what he needed the rd civil government detachment it was commanded by colonel bruce j mcnab a classmate of naylors he hadnt liked mcnab at west point thought him to be an inferior officer and was not surprised that he was still a colonel commanding an insignificant civil government unit but the roster showed that the rd had half a dozen hueys assigned to it naylor called mcnab and told him the story and said he was sending castillo to him and mcnab was expected to keep the young officer out of harms way just have him fly you around mcnab nothing more mcnab had said yes sir the next time naylor saw castillo was just after the iraqi surrender when colonel mcnab showed up at desert storm headquarters with castillo at the controls of mcnabs heavily armed huey they were there to personally receive from the hands of general schwarzkopf impact awards of the distinguished service cross mcnab silver star castillo and purple heart both medals mcnab also had the star of brigadier general and castillo the combat infantry badge pinned to their tunics by general schwarzkopf naylor had learned only then that the civil government detachment part of the rds unit designation was disinformation its actual role in desert storm had been the direction under the central intelligence agency of covert special operations naylor had been quietly furious that he had been kept in the dark even more furious that castillo had not been kept out of the line of fire and had almostbut not quitelost control when mcnab told him he was taking castillo whom he described as a natural warrior with him to fort bragg as his aidedecamp as far as a franklin lammelle was concerned what mcnab had done to castilloturned him over the years into a legendary special operatorwas the real source of the friction between mcnab and naylor there was something in naylors makeup that made him hate unconventional warfare and its practitioners and in lammelles judgment it was naylors close personal relationship with castillo that made charley unwilling on two significant occasions to accept that his uncle allan had been perfectly willing to throw him under the bus when ordered to do so the first instance had been when castillo by then an army lieutenant colonel heading up the presidents secretive office of organizational analysis had embarrassed the cia by flying two senior svr defectors out of vienna to argentina under the noses of vladimir putin and the cia station chief in vienna charles w montvale then the director of national intelligence was not interested in castillos explanation that he had done so because the russian defectors had good reason to believe the svr was waiting to grab them in viennas westbahnhof station and that he had been unaware the cia station chief in vienna had been trying to set up their defection for some time what concerned montvale was that the cia station chief had gone to syndicated columnist c harry whelan jr with the story that the president was illegally operating his own private cia headed by castillo and that presidential agent castillo had snatched the defectors montvales solution to that potential embarrassment to the president and the cia was simple castillo would be retired from the army for psychological reasonsthat would explain his erratic behaviorand then turn the defectors over to the cia general naylor seeing the protection of the president as his primary duty had gone along with montvale castillo the unconventional warrior molded by bruce mcnab had to be shut down and he sent one of his adjutant general corps colonels to buenos aires with montvale to order castillo sign here youre now retired dont let the doorknob hit you in the ass on your way out castillo refused the russian defectors had told him that the svr and others were operating a biological weapons laboratory and factory in the congowhat the cia had dismissed as being only a fish farm castillo saw it as his duty to prove or disprove what the russian defectors said and managed to convince mcnab by then a lieutenant general commanding specopscom that the allegations deserved to be investigated mcnab put his own career at risk he arranged for a gray fox team to secretly infiltrate the fish farm in the congo taking with them the armys preeminent expert in biological warfare colonel j porter hamilton mc hamilton reported to the president that the situation was even more dangeroushe called it an abomination before godthan the russians had said the president immediately launched a preemptive strike against the fish farm using every airdeliverable weapon in the us arsenal except for nuclear weapons that solved the problem of the incredibly lethal substance called congox but it did not solve the problem of presidential agent c g castillo the political damage of having the world learn that the president had brought the nation to the cusp of a nuclear exchange on the word of a lowly lieutenant colonel would destroy his presidency so he gave castillo a final order go fall off the edge of the earth and dont ever be seen again castillo had barely arrived in argentina when word came that the president had suddenly died of an aortal rupture castillo had just begun to adapt to his new status of having fallen off the edge of the earth when he learned that the armys biological warfare laboratory had receivedvia fedexa container of congox while that development was being evaluated the svr rezident in washington invited the cias deputy chief for operationsa franklin lammellefor drinks at the russian embassy compound outside washington there he offered a deal if the americans turned over to russia the two russian defectors and lieutenant colonel c g castillo then the russians would turn over what stocks of congox they had and give their solemn word that was all of it and none of it would ever appear again the new president joshua ezekiel clendennen thought this to be a satisfactory solution to the program and ordered director of national intelligence montvale to start looking for castillo and the russians and then load them on an aeroflot plane for moscow he also ordered general allan naylor to participate in the search and exchange a franklin lammelle knew all this because the cia director also ordered him to assist montvaleand by the time lammelle found castillo he had decided that what clendennen was trying to do to castillo was unconscionable he wanted no part of it and this became the second time that lammelle found naylor blindly prepared to throw castillo under the bus when naylor finally found castilloand was prepared to order him to return to the united states there to hold himself in readiness to obey what orders the president might have for himcastillo and his merry band of outlaws had already learned how the congox had reached the united states and were in the final stages of planning an ad hoc assault on a venezuelan island where the remaining stock of congox could be found despite this naylor delivered his orders whereupon castillo very politely placed him under arrest lammelle had witnessed the surreal exchangeand what followed naylorconcluding that the assaults failure would be more damaging to the united states than its successfinally decided to help he provided a navy helicopter carrier and three th black hawks that probably guaranteed the success of the assault naylors change of heart had nothing to do with castillo attempting the obviously right thing to do in the circumstances and it certainly had nothing to do with their personal relationship lammelle understood that naylors decision could easily have gone the other way lammelle had then decided that it was a case of not if but when they faced another situation where castillo was going to try something of which naylor might not approve and naylor would decide not to help or worse that naylors duty was to prevent castillo from doing what he planned to dothus once again throwing him under that proverbial bus this was one of those times lammelle now decided when he didnt like general allan b naylor at all and that meant he wasnt going to tell him anything at all that might in any way hurt charley castillo when naylor did not immediately respond to lammelles questions about why he thought lammelle would know where vic dalessandro was and why did he want to know lammelle asked a third why dont you ask terry otoole where he is vic works for him general otoole doesnt know where he is thats why im asking you lammelle that brings us back to my original question why do you want to know we have a mission for him an important mission im sorry but thats all i can tell you thats all you want to tell me allan and thats not enough potus made it clear that he doesnt want the cia involved in any way in this mission which is when naylor didnt immediately reply lammelle went on im sure you find this distasteful general but once in a while you have to disobey an order particularly an order from clendennen who we are agreed is not playing with a full deck youre speaking lammelle of the president of the united states yes i am there was a long pause i was going to begin this by saying this has to go no further naylor finally said but that would be a waste of my breath wouldnt it general what i try to do is live up to my oath to protect the us from all enemies foreign and domestic naylor ignored that he said the original communication from the kidnappers ordered us to take this fellow abrego by helicopter from the la tuna prison to juarez international airport just across the border accompanied by two us marshals this was to be tomorrow morning the exchange was to take place then the president feels that if this plan were followed they would be met by an overwhelming force who would relieve them of abrego andthe phrase he used was wave byebyewith the result being they would have abrego and we would not have colonel ferris that makes sense so whats plan b this is what the president does not want the cia involved with in any way involved with what president martinez sent him a letter saying that abrego should be taken to the oaxaca state prison for interrogation by the chief of the policia federal for oaxaca state a man named juan carlos pena and hes going to do this martinez said contact should be established with this man pena and you want to send vic to make contact yes now where is he lammelle was quiet a moment then said i dont think youre telling me everything allan why should clendennen be worried about me knowing about something as simple as sending vic to see this cop thats all i can tell you naylor said ive already told you more than i should but not as much as youre going to tell me if you want me to put you in touch with vic so you do know where he is naylor snapped im the head of the cia allan i know everything what else have you got to tell me lammelle could hear naylor exhaling audibly before naylor said when abrego is taken to the prison after we establish that ferris is there the president is sending three black hawks loaded with gray fox operators with him they will free ferris gray fox lammelle asked incredulously hes set up a command post in his study naylor said general otoole is there with him colonel kingsolving has been sent for and once they grab ferris how are they going to get him out of mexico that prison is in southern mexico almost to the guatemalan border why do i think you know more than youre telling me allan vic is in the el paso marriott on airport boulevard registered as jose gomez if youve got a pencil ill give you the number if you know something i should frank the area code is hold one naylor said okay give me that number again lammelle gave it to him and then said give me five minutes allan and ill call him and tell him youll be calling what have you got him doing down there its always a pleasure to talk to you allan lammelle said and hung up four hacienda santa maria oaxaca province mexico april well frank life is full of surprises isnt it castillo said over the speakerphone of his brick the last i remember is clendennen trying to think of some way to stand gray fox against a wall for walking out on his speech at arlington im having a little trouble remembering who knows what lammelle said what did you tell natalie cohen about your pal pena i told her that juan carlos pena wasnt too smart but from what i heard he was reasonably honest that caught the attention of juan carlos pena he was sitting opposite castillo and svetlana on the veranda of the big house he had a bottle of dos equis resting on his stomach he turned to castillo and gave him the finger and what should i tell vic that juan carlos is not too smart but may be honest the one thing we cant afford is for anybody to even suspect were pals you may have heard that the more people that know something the sooner everybody does you got the satellite photos of the prison yeah thanks i wouldnt like to be a guest of that place we just flew over it juan carlos and i have been talking about grabbing abrego and ferris conclusion make sure ferris is there then grab him quick before anybody knows whats happening what about abrego in the best of all possible worlds getting the both of them would be nice and if we cant get ferris then well grab abrego and see who that brings out of the woodwork in addition to his drug cartel pals i mean you can do that with only a dozen exspetsnaz lammelle asked doubtfully plus uncle remus castillo said itll be like old times when i talked to vic just now he told me your china post guys have lost jose rafael monteverde how lost they were sitting on his apartment in mexico city they saw him go in saw the lights go out when he presumably went to bed sat on all possible points of egress and access to the place all night and waited for him to go to work in the morning when he didnt appear they went and had a look he was not in his apartment and there were no signs of anything that looked suspicious i dont like that frank castillo said well nobody i know has ever accused the cuban direccion general de inteligenciaor former members thereofof being incompetent it sounds as if he knew he was being surveilled castillo said yeah lammelle said it does so what are they doing about it did anybody think about the venezuelan embassy according to vic they were of course sitting on the venezuelan embassy i will not tell vic that you asked that question castillo grunted i guess what im supposed to say now is well these things happen yeah you are so what happens now is that naylor is en route to fort blissel pasoto give vic his marching orders at least oneredundancy you knowblack hawk is by now en route from fort campbell to el paso to take vic to meet pena and as soon as natalie gets to the white house i think it reasonable to presume she will be ordered to have ambassador mccann ask where that meeting will take place or will be told to do that herself yeah castillo agreed and whats going to happen tomorrow morning when abrego doesnt show up at juarez international i suppose well just have to wait and see i was asking what do you think theyll do to ferris same answer except that dealing with these people he may already be dead we could demand proof of life before the exchange i dont think he is castillo said and as long as hes alive hes a bargaining chip in what they are really after whacking pevsner and c castillo and his girlfriend lammelle said well just have to wait and see speaking of pevsner where is he so far as i know hunkering down on the shores of beautiful lake nahuel huapi that doesnt sound like him lammelle said well the one thing you can safely say about aleksandr pevsner is that you never know what hes up to that brings us back to well just have to wait and see doesnt it ill be in touch charley lammelle said and broke the connection castillo looked at svetlana franks right my darling she said doing nothing is not how aleksandr operates but he promised to do nothing without asking me first castillo said what he promised was to do nothing without telling you she countered theres a big difference castillo raised an eyebrow well baby at the risk of repeating the phrase i guess well just have to wait and see wont we five the presidents study the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc april general naylor called while you were gone mr president clemens mccarthy said as the president led colonel arthur kingsolving and secret service supervisory special agent mulligan into his study the president held up his hand to silence him as he walked to the window pushed the drape aside and watched as the mhk black hawk lifted off from the white house lawn you seem perfectly comfortable in turning your night stalker bird over to your copilot colonel the president said kingsolving recognized the statement as a question every th pilot is fully qualified as an mh pilotincommand sir kingsolving said general otoole put in having said that mr president major humphreys will now crash that one into the washington monument on his way to andrews the president considered that for a moment and then laughed you people are really something he said i guess it comes with the territory well let me tell you im really impressed with that helicopter and i thank you for the ride it was my privilege sir kingsolving said the only thing i didnt like about it is that it made me realize the secretary of state talked me into giving a half dozen of them to the goddamn mexicans the president said sir kingsolving said the mexicans didnt get that one the mhk thats a special configuration for the th how specially configured the president asked among other thingsstateoftheart avionics for exampleit has an inflight refueling probe kingsolving began the president held up his hand to silence him and turned to mccarthy well he demanded sir you said general naylor called while we were gone yes sir he did and did he call just to say howdy or did he have more on his mind than that general naylor said that he has established contact with dalessandro explained the situation to him that the helicopter from fort campbell was expected momentarily and that as soon as we tell him where dalessandro is supposed to go hell send him on his way where is dalessandro and the helicopter thats expected momentarily in el paso sir whats the status of that the president asked the status of what sir finding out where my friend martinez wants dalessandro to meet the mexican cop i dont know sir we havent heard from secretary cohen about that well clemens how about getting her on the phone and asking her yes sir on second thought douglas you call her the president ordered clemens here seems to be having trouble keeping up with all this yes sir if she hasnt heard from my friend martinez tell her to call the sonofabitch yes mr president special agent douglas said i want to get this show on the road and i dont want any surprises the president said and ive got a couple of questions which occurred to me as we were flying over the pentagon has it ever occurred to anyone else that the more youre told the more you learn the more questions come up ive had that experience mr president general otoole said okay now colonel kingsolving told me that while the night stalker birds can make it from el paso to this prison they dont have the range to make it back without being refueled okay tell me how thats going to happen there are several options mr president otoole began to answer for kingsolving i was asking colonel kingsolving the president cut him off sorry sir the first option sir is the simple one kingsolving said they will refuel at xoxocotlan airfield which is the closest airfield to the oaxaca prison i was just starting to be awed by your allaround knowledge the president said that answer just blew that i can see a number of problems with that starting with how do we know there would be enough fuel at xoxocotlan airfield to fuel four black hawks even if they were willing to do so that is a problem sir obviously we dont other options inflight refueling sir have one or more kcj tankers rendezvous with the black hawks shortly before they reach oaxacaxoxocotlan the black hawks then would have full tanks on landing and be prepared to fly back to the states that strikes me as almost as stupid as option one the president said what do you think the goddamn mexicans are going to think when they see one or more whats the nomenclature of that tanker kcj sir thats that great big airplane with propellers right not jet engines thats correct sir what do you think the goddamn mexicans are going to think when they see four black hawksinstead of the one they expectflying over their country with a couple of great big aerial gas stations jesus im glad i brought this up another option mr president otoole said if i may lets hear it another option would be to refuel the black hawks before or after the exchange using a navy assault vessel such as the uss bataan in international waterssay fifty miles outoff the coast this is what castillo did when he made the assault on la orchila island general otooles face flushed as he heard what he had just said the president looked at him coldly thats what lieutenant colonel castillo retired did before he almost got us in a war with venezuela yes sir id like to know who authorized the use of that vessel the president said was that you general otoole no sir but under the circumstances it was in my judgment the right thing to do fortunately you are not in a position to make decisions like that if it wasnt you who was it that mustachioed idiot mcnab i dont believe general mcnab was involved mr president and certainly not able to give orders to the captain of a navy vessel well that narrows it down somewhat doesnt it mccarthy make a note for me to discuss this with general naylor at the earliest opportunity yes sir and with secretary beiderman and incidentally where the hell is he hes at the pentagon sir mulligan said get him on the phone and get him over here the president said yes sir well since we will not be using a us navy vessel operating fifty miles off the mexican coast to fuel the black hawks does that mean were out of options jesus h christ talk about going off half cocked there is one more option sir otoole said a submarine it would rendezvous with the black hawks off the mexican coast a submarine the president parroted incredulously yes sir we have been experimenting with the technique in our tests a black hawk can be refueled on the high seas in about ten minutes sir the president did not reply otoole said one problem with using a sub go on otoole drop the other shoe whats the problem with this option im not sure a submarine could be equipped with the necessary equipment in time for this operation ill tell you this general the president said a submarine will be equipped in time for this operation or well have a new secretary of defense a new secretary of the navy and a new chief of naval operations yes sir xi one hacienda santa maria oaxaca province mexico april with all possible respect senor diputado procurador general juan carlos pena said with a smile in his voice you dont really want to know what im going to do tonight ill meet you in the diamante at nine and i promise not to ask what you did tonight he laughed at the deputy attorney generals response and then hung up whats the diamante castillo asked will he trace the call here svetlana asked oh she is a professional isnt she pena observed he might sweaty and i will handle that by walking into the restaurant tomorrow morning with a case of hacienda santa marias finest grapefruit for him he will then conclude that i was here checking your security which means to pick up the envelope what envelope svetlana asked the envelope containing the small token of don armandos appreciation for my keeping the bad guys away from hacienda santa maria pena said don armando medina the general manager of hacienda santa maria chuckled don armando youre actually paying protection money to the federales castillo demanded jesus christ carlos pena replied i cant believe you actually asked that does that mean were paying you or not castillo pursued it means my naive old buddy that its important that people such as manuel jose guzman diputado procurador general de la republica think youre paying me otherwise manuel jose might suspect that im honest and we certainly couldnt have that could we sorry castillo said carlos i knew dona alicia called her tia alicia long before i met you i said i was sorry castillo said i wasnt thinking thats a problem for you isnt it juan carlos svetlana said he said he was sorry what did this man have to say unless im wrongand i very seldom am thats why im still aliveat nine tomorrow morning in the restaurant of the diamantefull title camino real acapulco diamante one of the better hotels in acapulcohe will explain to me when and how felix abrego will manage to escape from the oaxaca state prison and then because he knows how ashamed i will be because of senor abregos escape from my custody he will give me an envelope to assuage my pain the deputy attorney general is working for the cartels castillo asked surprised with i would say not for abrego has many friends carlos and most of them have lots of money if nobody has anything more to say castillo said i think i will have a little grape before we have dinner its been a busy day and its long past my normal wine time as if on cue someone had something to say castillos brick buzzed hand me the sonofabitch please lester castillo said and well see who is trying to keep me off the sauce bradley handed him the handset castillo looked at it its your cousin aleksandr sweaty charley said then put the handset to his ear sweaty stood up and leaned over the brick and pushed the loudspeaker button and how are things on the shores of picturesque lake nahuel huapi aleksandr castillo asked in russian speak english sweaty ordered yes maam castillo said glancing at her are you alone pevsner asked clearly no and svetlana wants you to speak english whats that all about pevsner asked in english i can only guess that she wants her new buddy to hear what you have to say and he doesnt speak russian whos her new friend juan carlos pena chief of the policia federal for oaxaca state have you been drinking not yet but make whatever this is quick will you please im about to start i gave you my word that i wouldnt take any of several actions until i first told you without my permission is the way i remember that im not in the habit as you are well aware of asking anyone for permission to do anything why dont you tell me whats going on down there on the shores of lake nahuel huapi im in cozumel how soon can you get here if you can convince me this is important and nothing happens between now and say nine tomorrow morning i can be there in time for lunch i mean tonight tonights out of the question i cant take off from here without letting the local airportand this means the policia federalknow my airfield is capable of night operation and i dont want to throw away that tactical advantage i thought that you were friends with the local police stand by a moment aleksandr svetlana said she motioned for castillo to give her the handset and when he had she held it against her breast to muffle the microphone you understand carlitos concern juan carlos she asked he nodded who besides you would learn the field is capable of night flight if charley were to take off right now nobody juan carlos replied and you can keep it that way pena nodded she moved the handset from her breast to her ear if i have your word that youll do nothing until carlito approves svetlana said we can take off from here in about fifteen minutes you have my word that i will take no action until i tell him what i am going to do and why pevsner said and svetlana remember who you are how dare you talk to me that way ill tell you who i am aleksandr svetlana said the woman who will tell my carlito to fly over there or to stay here and if we stay here you will be free to do whatever you wish and i can only hope that you will realize that you will be doing it alone there was a long silence whats his name juan carlos asked aleksandr castillo furnished can you hear me aleksandr pena asked raising his voice i can hear you pevsner said the policeman actually im a little more than a policeman pena said but i used to be and when i was i learned that there are some women you just dont fuck with and your cousin sweaty is one of them i wouldnt cross her if i was you pay attention aleksandr castillo said laughing there was a twentysecond pause then i will expect to see you in a little over three hours pevsner said during which time you have my word that i will take no action that could possibly displease either my friend charley or you my dear svetlana the leds on the brick went out pevsner had ended the call why do i think aleksandr is annoyed with us castillo asked rhetorically then said you going to acapulco tonight juan carlos or do you want to spend the night here neither im going with you juan carlos said ive been hearing about that sonofabitch for years not only do i want to hear what hes got planned and for who i want a look at him i can assure you juan carlos svetlana said dead serious that aleksandrs parents were married you are speaking of my mothers sister and she was not a bitch ill keep that in mind sweaty pena said no offense intended watch your mouth in the future si senorita juan carlos said contritely two the tahitian suite grand cozumel beach amp golf resort cozumel mexico april when they had landed at cozumel international castillo had seen the other cessna mustang the one used to fly high rollers to the grand cozumel casino and drug money to be laundered out of mexico so he was not surprised to find former svr colonel nicolai tarasov sitting on the balcony of the twentythirdfloor penthouse suite beside former svr colonel aleksandr pevsner max delighted to see pevsner ran out onto the balcony reared on his hind legs draped his paws over pevsners shoulders and affectionately lapped his face cant you control your goddamn animal pevsner demanded he likes you castillo said be grateful his other mode is rip your throat out very interesting juan carlos said maybe youre not the allaround son bas evil person everybody says you are castillo laughed when he saw that juan carlos was applying his when meeting someone cutthroat attack to put them on the defense theory of how best to deal with dangerous people who expect to be treated differentially sweaty said youre learning juan carlos youre the policeman obviously pevsner said carlos has been telling me that max is an infallible judge of character juan carlos said i tend to agree we hadnt known each other ninety seconds when he was begging me to scratch his ears and if i may be permitted to say so senor pena pevsner said i am not at all surprised that you and karl are friends you share not only a very odd sense of humor but a complete inability to take things seriously thats it svetlana snapped stop she walked to her uncle nicolai and allowed him to kiss her cheek introduce me to your friend svetlana juan carlos this is my uncle nicolai sweaty said nicolai tarasov juan carlos pena id forgotten you know lester dont you how could i forget mr bradley tarasov said and patted lester on the back tarasov and pena shamelessly examined each other as they shook hands and tell me what brings the chief of the policia federal for oaxaca state so far from home tarasov said well not much was happening at hacienda santa maria pena said so i thought i might as well come over here and arrest somebody castillo chuckled i said stop that and i meant it svetlana said all right aleksandr whats so important that you couldnt tell us on the brick before we get into that do you suppose i could have a glass of wine castillo said it would be better if you were sober when i tell you what i have to tell you i said a glass aleksandr not a damn bottle humor me thats unusual he usually tries to feed people hes dealing with all the booze he can get into them what the hell is this all about a waiterwhose starched white jacket did not entirely conceal the mini uzi on his hipappeared bring wine some of that cabernet sauvignon for my guests pevsner ordered then he turned to castillo the reason i didnt open this subject on the brick is i didnt think youd believe me what makes you think ill believe you now get to it aleksandr svetlana ordered he looked at her and nodded vladimir vladimirovich doesnt want to exterminate us he said unless of course that should prove to be convenient while hes doing what he set out to do in the first place it took me a long time to figure that out of course he wants to exterminate us svetlana said for all the reasons you know listen to me carefully svetlana pevsner said if he can eliminate us while hes doing what he set out to do in the first place hed be pleased but eliminating us is not his highest priority castillo looked at pevsner where the hell is he going with this then what is he said we misjudged him we thought of him as what we think he is rather than what he believes he is which is castillo asked tsar of all the russias vladimir the terrible cast in the mold of ivan the terrible chosen by god to restore russia to its former magnificence youre serious arent you castillo asked there was not a hint of sarcasm in his voice perfectly absolutely pevsner said where did this come from aleksandr castillo asked your notion that putin thinks of himself as ivan the terrible reincarnate the first time i thought of itand dismissed itwas during the funeral the imperial familys funeral pevsner nodded the waiter pulled the cork from a wine bottle with a popping sound and poured a little for castillo to taste i probably shouldnt take this but what the hell you know saint petersburg pevsner asked castillo nodded and pevsner went on renamed petrograd from saint petersburg in then renamed leningrad in and then back to saint petersburg in after the soviet union became the russian federation castillo vaguely remembered seeing photographs of the funeral he hadnt paid much attention to it on july eighty years to the day after the tsar and his family were executed by the bolsheviks they were interredas the royal martyrs tsar nicholas ii and his beloved familyin the royal vault of the cathedral of saints peter and paul his holiness patriarch alexis came from moscow to preside and president boris yeltsin represented the government of the russian federation the arrangementsmoving what was left of the bodies from where they had been tossed down a well in yekaterinburg some nine hundred miles east of moscow and dna examination of the remains to prove it was indeed the tsar and his family were handled by one vladimir vladimirovich putin then the kgbs man in saint petersburg now thats interesting castillo interrupted who was very visible during the interment pevsner finished yeah svetlana said that caught my attention too i thought he was being blasphemous and that was my initial reaction too pevsner said but then as i said i dismissed it deciding that either possibility was improbable either possibility that he was being blasphemous as svetlana thought or that he had gone back to the lord but i began to think of it again a few days ago in san carlos de bariloche pevsner said when i was trying very hard and failing to see how vladimir vladimirovichs intention to eliminate us tied in with the kidnapping of colonel ferris when i finally realized it had nothing to do with thatthe kidnapping had nothing to do except possibly as a diversion with eliminating useverything suddenly began to be clear tell me how castillo said who is vladimirs greatest enemy i dont think anyone would argue its not the united states can he engage in a war against the united states no if he could he would can he at virtually no cost to himself cause the united states trouble weaken it yes he can and is and thats what hes up to castillo asked pevsner nodded mexico is the battlefield for one thing the mexicans hate the united states the united states took most of the southwest away from mexico in the war of and the mexicans have never forgiven them for that mexicans by the millions illegally enter the united states while the mexican government not only looks the other way but actively encourages them if those people arent in mexico not only dont they have to be fed and hospitalized and educated but they send moneybillions and billions of dollarsto their families in mexico that seems a little farfetched aleksandr castillo argued it wont if you give it some thought pevsner said but illegal immigration isnt the point here and neither is the drug trafficboth of which weaken the us which is fine with vladimir vladimirovich but what hes really after is the destruction of the united states government and how does he plan to do that off the top of your head friend charley tell me what were the greatest threats to the stability of the united states government in your lifetime i dont know castillo admitted and then after a moment asked youre talking about nixon before nixon resigned there was rioting in the streets you needed armed troops to protect the pentagon and later the impeachment of clinton castillo added thoughtfully and now you have a president who should be in a room with rubber walls pevsner said who told you about that castillo asked and what makes you think putin even knows about it oh he knows pevsner said and issued an order in russian put two chairs there he said pointing and bring them out two folding chairs were set up and then two menstark naked showing signs of having been severely beatenshuffled onto the patio their hands and their ankles bound together with plastic ties janos pevsners hungarian bodyguard brought up the rear of the procession i wondered where janos was the waiter offered castillo more of the cabernet sauvignon no thank you castillo said politely ive had quite enough for the time being youve met sergei i understand pevsner said but i dont think youve met jose rafael monteverde both men looked at castillo monteverde looked terrified murov castillo decided after a moment seemed resigned to his fate whatever that might turn out to be untie their hands janos castillo ordered in hungarian lester get them water and a cigarette if they want one janos looked at pevsner for guidance pevsner nodded lester went to the wet bar for water where is colonel ferris castillo asked neither man replied i dont know about you mr monteverde castillo said in hungarian but youre a professional mr murov you know what options you have you either answer my questions or janos will slowly beat you to death castillo looked at janos what have you been using on him janos flicked his wrist and a telescoping wand appeared in his hand he flicked it back and forth it whistled thats the one with the little ball of shot at the end castillo asked janos extended the wand to show castillo the small leather shotfilled ball at the end of his wand very nice castillo said its been some time since ive seen one as one professional to another colonel castillo can we get this over with quickly murov asked in russian do you speak hungarian mr monteverde castillo asked in hungarian monteverdes face showed he did not pity castillo said in russian hungarian seems to have become the lingua franca of interrogations like this now you wont know what mr murov and i are talking about will you monteverdes face showed he understood this castillo then said in hungarian as a matter of personal curiosity mr murovthough it doesnt really matterwhen did you become aware of president clendennens mental instability before or after he became president it wasnt much of a secret was it colonel murov replied lester wheres the cigarettes i asked for for these gentlemen castillo asked janos gave a quick order in hungarian and the waiter walked to lester and handed him a package of sobranie cigarettes bradley looked at them dubiously those are sobranie les castillo explained i dont know whether those are russian made or the ones they make in london huh lester said cigarettes are very bad for your health lester i wouldnt smoke one of those if i were you no sir i hadnt planned to bradley said everyone on the patioincluding murov and monteverdelooked askance at the exchange lester walked to murov and monteverde handed them cigarettes then lit them for them thank you monteverde said beware of either americans or hungarians bearing gifts castillo said in hungarian especially counterfeit russian cigarettes pevsner and tarasov smiled and shook their heads monteverde eyed his cigarette suspiciously its soaked with sodium pentothal of course castillo said in spanish my protocol is to use that before pulling fingernails and doing other things like that monteverdes face showed that he was perfectly willing to accept that i think ive got him tell me senor monteverde castillo then went on in spanish when you were in cuba did you happen to run into major alejandro vincenzo monteverdes face showed that he had and was surprised that castillo knew of the cuban direccion general de inteligencia officer no he said he got in a gun fight with lester in uruguay castillo said conversationally right out of the ok corral lester put him down with a head shot offhand from at least one hundred yards thats why we call him dead eye monteverde looked at castillo as if he couldnt believe what castillo had just said well those things happen in our line of business dont they castillo said sometimes people just dont make it he let that sink in for a moment and then said lester why dont you take mr monteverde back where he came from what were going to do next is see if colonel alekseeva and chief pena cant talk senor monteverde into making the right decisions tonight before things get unpleasant he paused you heard me monteverde stand up he ordered unpleasantly monteverde did so and then as he was again suddenly aware he was naked he put his hands over his crotch not necessary senor monteverde castillo said colonel alekseeva is also a professional thats not the first dingdong shes ever seen although i dont think shes ever seen one quite thathow do i say this unappealing you have an accident or something or is that the way it usually looks flushing from his forehead to halfway down his chest monteverde allowed himself to be led shuffling in his plastic ankle ties off the patio pena and svetlana walked after him castillo waited until monteverde was out of hearing and then turned to murov well what brilliant psychological weapon do i use on you sergei threaten to have saint petersburg poet chiseled on your tombstone pevsner and tarasov chuckled despite himself murov smiled now i know aleksandr murov said why you wanted him here hes a master at this isnt he no i am but a simple novice sitting at the feet of master pevsner castillo said but this much i know sergei when you get over your humiliation at being grabbed by aleksandrs people you will decide yourself that you dont have any choice but to tell me everything i want to know or janos will beat me to death with his wand or ill leave you tied up on the steps of the russian embassy in mexico city and let vladimir vladimirovich decide how painfully you should die he looked around and caught the waiters eye yes thank you i will have another sip of that lovely cabernet sauvignon while im waiting ten minutes later svetlana came back onto the patio and somewhat imperiously signaled to the waiter for a glass of wine when he delivered it castillo held up his glass how much of that have you had she challenged castillo caught her eye try to get this straight you may ask that only after were married and if you keep asking now your chances of that happening diminish exponentially she glared at him but did not respond well castillo asked how did you do with senor monteverde hell be out in a minute she replied hes cleaning himself up when juan carlos was dangling him from the balcony monteverde threw up all over himself dangling from the balcony castillo parroted juan carlos hung him by his foot from the balcony she said using a sheet for a rope when he was swinging back and forthshe demonstrated with her handsjuan carlos took another sheet and ripped it it made a sound loud enough for monteverde to hear then juan carlos let the sheet rope drop another couple of feet monteverde thought he was about to die it would then be safe to presume that senor monteverde is going to be cooperative oh yes she said your colonel ferris is being held in retainhuled guatemala its about fifty miles from the border whos holding him castillo asked venezuelan drug traffickers under the direction of the svr she said matteroffactly which brings us to the senior officer of the svr involved in this what are we going to do with you sergei id say thats in the hands of god wouldnt you svetlana murov replied actually its in my hands castillo said and im not nearly as nice as god dont blaspheme carlito svetlana said and then added he pretends to be a heathen sergei but hes really not you want to take a chance betting on that sergei castillo asked lets start over before i tell janos he can start up again with his flyswatter heres where we are monteverde is going to tell me everything he knows and you know that but what he doesnt know and what i want from you is the names of the people you have in the oval office and i will do whatever i have to find out and you know i cant tell you that murov said i have given my vow to god and whatever happens to me is in his hands whatever happens to you in is my hands castillo said but i digress i want those names and will do whatever i have to do to get them that includes guaranteeing you asylum in the united states or anywhere else youd like to go and a hell of a lot of money opening bid one million murov shook his head how could i shave in the morning colonel castillo looking out on some caribbean beach knowing that the price of my being there was my family in the basement of the lubyanka prison just as soon as vladimir vladimirovich finds out you fucked up again thats where vladimir vladimirovich is going to put them and you know that too the matter is in gods hands murov repeated doggedly jesus christ you people make me sick are you listening to yourself murov you sound like a character in a very bad russian novel in the first place committing suicide is not noble im not sure but i strongly suspect in this religion all of you keep spouting its also a sin im not committing suicide murov said what would you call it and youre the one who put your beloved wife and kiddies in a lubyanka cell murov you dont try to hang that on vladimir vladimirovich thats the rules of this game we play and you damn sure know them as well as i do murov was silent okay murov for the sake of argument after janos literally beats you to death with that thing of his you nobly refuse to tell me what i want you pass out you open your eyes and there you are inside the pearly gates saint peter looks down at you tell me my son why the fuck didnt you at least try to get your beloved wife and kiddies out of lubyanka what are you going to say sergei nothing i could do pete it was in gods hands jesus carlos youre blaspheming svetlana said butt out sweaty castillo snapped you just dont get people out of lubyanka colonel and you know that murov said maybe not but a manparticularly a christianwould fucking well try for his family castillo fumed and what are you going to say when good ol saint pete asks carlos stop svetlana said stay out of this svetlana nicolai tarasov said sharply hes blaspheming she said i dont think so tarasov said what it looks like to me is that hes trying to save sergeis soul the support came as a shock to castillo he forgot what he had been saying where the hell was i castillo said aloud okay so what are you going to say to saint peter saint sergei when he asks why the hell wouldnt you tell castillo what he wanted to know i know hes a heathen but what was he doing wrong were the americans about to nuke moscow maybe drop a couple of barrels of congox on it did you really believe as well educated as you are as widely experienced that the americans were planning to attack holy mother russia for that matter anyone fuck you colonel castillo murov said and may god forgive you castillo saw that svetlana had tears running down her cheeks i am still in charge here aleksandr castillo said but it was a question pevsner nodded janos castillo then ordered put some clothes on him and take him back where you found him and leave him youre still going to interrogate him svetlana asked no my love im through interrogating him he wouldnt tell me the truth anyway you heard him god is on his side and i wont give the miserable bastard the satisfaction of having janos beat him to death threell get you ten hes already into selfflagellation get him out of my sight janos janos castillo noticed did not look this time to pevsner for permission to carry out the order janos went to where murov was seated pulled him to his feet and started marching him out of the room hand me the wine my dear and spare me your comments castillo ordered svetlana complied docilely colonel castillo murov called castillo looked murov and janos were at the door janos had his arms wrapped around the struggling naked man castillo made the sign of the cross bless you my son he called go in peace and sin no more amen carlos svetlana said in almost a whine its clemens mccarthy

with juan carlos pena and two of penas bodyguards following immediately two policia federal suburbans pulled up under the portico to where they were standing why dont you get in the back mr dalessandro pena suggested you dont have to do this chief dalessandro said i can take a taxi you never heard of mexican hospitality pena asked get in one of the policia federal officers opened the right doors slide over to the middle mr dalessandro pena ordered so my men can get in on each side of you dalessandro obeyed he found himself sitting between two large policia federal officers the suburbans moved out from under the portico dalessandro felt something hard and cold against the base of his neck and had just decided whatever this was they werent going to kill him at least not here and now when a voice inquired hey gringo you wanna fook my seester juan carlos pena laughed out loud surprising dalessandro for pena hadnt so much as cracked a smile during the meeting with guzman she gives a discount for undersized penile apparatus the voice said now without a mexican accent like yours charley you sonofabitch dalessandro said welcome to sunny mehheeco castillo said how did things go with guzman slick dalessandro said he should be a usedcar salesman and obviously i misjudged senor pena pena turned from the front seat and offered dalessandro his hand call me juan carlos when no ones looking vic pena said carloscharleyand i go back a long way he says nice things about you which may or may not be a good thing you are going to tell me whats going on here right dalessandro asked on our way to general juan n alvarez international were going to plan how to snatch ferris from the bad guys castillo said thats presuming guzman went along with having ferriss picture taken standing in front of the oaxaca state prison how the hell did you hear about that i have a lady friend in foggy bottom castillo said well did he yeah you know where ferris is yeah all juan carlos had to do was dangle senor monteverde from the twentythirdfloor tahitian suite of the grand cozumel beach and golf resort on a bedsheet and he quickly volunteered to tell us ferris is being held by drug guys working for venezuelans under the direction of the svr youre talking about murov hes disappeared too didnt your mommy tell you its not polite to interrupt people castillo asked then went on in retainhuled guatemala which is a small town about fifty miles from the border now their plan murov juan carlos and i think murov dalessandro interrupted you know where he is hes in the suburban behind us involuntarily dalessandro turned to look all he could see was the darkened windows of the following suburban hes in that suburban dalessandro asked incredulously all right well go down that road ol sergei has had a religious experience he has seen the light and is now prepared to fight the good fight against the forces of evil when you get back to biggs army airfield frank lammelle will be there to meet him with open arms and a briefcase with one million dollars in it which im sure sergei will count carefully on his way to wherever frank intends to stash him you turned murov for a million dollars thats peanuts jesus christ charley hes putins number two was putins number two castillo said but then he had the religious experience i mentioned which caused him to examine the downside of committing suicide castillo let that set in for a moment and then went on as i was saying before i was so rudely interruptedwell get to the few remaining loose ends when i finishsergei juan carlos and i are agreed that their most likely plan is to take ferris to the prison and thenwhen you and abrego arrivewhack everybody that scenario occurred to me dalessandro said drily so what we are going to do is grab ferris before that as hes being transported from retainhuled to the prison whos we and how castillo told him pity you wont be there vic it will be like old times tell me about the few remaining loose ends dalessandro said offhand i can think of say fifty but id rather hear them from you well for example i havent made up my mind about the million dollars whether i should let the cia pay it or those people thats not what i meant charley and i havent made up my mind how we should handle the two svr people looking over clendennens shoulders you know who they are castillo nodded what i havent decided is who i should tell if anybody or what to do about them im not anybody charley dalessandro said evenly no youre not and i havent figured out how to get ferris out of mexico after we grab him thats what they call changing the subject dalessandro said yeah castillo agreed i guess it is well after a brief moment castillo said clemens mccarthy and a secret service agent named douglas i never heard of him clendennen calls him dumbo dalessandro said youre sure i got it from murov who said this whole exercise is designed to prey on clendennens instability to create another impeachment crisis nixon and clinton dalessandro considered that a moment have you told frank castillo shook his head sometimes charley despite the old saw that any action is better than none the best thing to do is nothing at least for a while were almost at the airport juan carlos said how do you want to handle this well load murov and vic on their black hawk castillo said and wave byebye and then lester and i will get in the mustang lesters here vic said sitting on sergei castillo said jerking his thumb toward the following suburban i thought you said murov had seen the light i dont want him committing suicide by policia federal im sure hes figured out that we cant let him go free so he knows if he runs he gets shot how are you going to stop him juan carlos has told his guys not to shoot and i gave lester an old winchester pump of mine with which he will shoot sergei in the leg or legs i figured if that proved necessary he wouldnt bleed to death before you got him to the states hes in pretty bad emotional condition dont tell me remorse thinking of his wife and family in lubyanka thatll do it dalessandro said they pulled close to the us army uhf sitting in a remote corner of the airfield charley i didnt mention this before because its lunacy on its face clendennens got everybody running around getting a submarine ready to refuel the fs he plans to send to the shootout at the prison if we snatch ferris there wont be a need to send fs to the prison castillo said i dont think freeing ferris will stop that mission clendennen is now in love with gray fox find out where the sub will be and when and get me the radio call signs that may be a tall order charley naylor will want to know why i want to know and he doesnt know what youre up to do you want him to no tell him nothing castillo said but see what you can find out about the submarine please five km national road near huixtla chiapas state mexico april the small convoy that had crossed into mexico at tapachula a little after eight consisted of a somewhat battered suburban a mercedes s that appeared nearly new a suburban in better shape a mercedes c and a ford f pickup truck the policia federal roadblock they encounteredno surprise on that stretch of roadconsisted of a suburban and a ford f pickup it was near the crest of a small rise when it became visible to the passenger in the front seat of the large mercedes he leaned over and sounded the horn and then motioned the driver to pass the suburban in the lead the federales would know who he was he reasoned and they could get through the roadblock quickly especially if he handed to whoever was in charge a sheaf of united states hundreddollar bills he did not want the federales to start asking for identification when he got close he saw that the man in charge was a policia federal second sergeant who would he thought be more grateful for the little gift he was about to give him than a more senior policemansay a first sergeant or even a comandantewould be he was a little annoyed when the second sergeant didnt immediately walkor trotto the mercedes as he expected him to do but finally the second sergeant came from the barrier and walked to the mercedes trailed by a dozen other federales they walked to the vehicles behind the mercedes and took up positions on either side of them good morning the passenger in the front seat of the mercedes said would you step out of the car please the second sergeant asked politely what for this is a check for drugs the second sergeant said do i look like a drug dealer the man asked no sir you dont this wont take a minute senor the man got out of the front seat forced himself to smile and handed the second sergeant the sheaf of us hundreddollar bills a little something for the wife and kids he said the second sergeant examined the money smiled and tucked it into his shirt pocket the man convinced that the nonsense was now over turned and started to get back in the mercedes when
