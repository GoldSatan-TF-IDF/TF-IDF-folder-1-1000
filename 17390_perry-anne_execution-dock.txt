anne perry execution dock book in the william monk series one the man balanced on the stern of the flatbottomed lighter his wild figure outlined against the glittering water of the thames hair whipped in the wind face sharp lips drawn back then at the last moment when the other lighter was almost past him he crouched and sprang he only just reached the deck scrambling to secure his footing he swayed for a moment then regained his balance and turned he waved once in grotesque jubilation then dropped to his knees out of sight behind the closepacked bales of wool monk smiled grimly as the oarsmen strained to bring the police boat around against the outgoing tide and the wash from barges on their way up to the pool of london he would not have given orders to shoot even were he certain of not hitting anyone else in the teeming river traffic he wanted jericho phillips alive so he could see him tried and hanged in the prow of the boat orme swore under his breath he was a grizzled man in his late fifties a decade older than the lean and elegant monk who had been in the thames river police force only half a year it was very different from the force ashore where his experience lay but more difficult for him was taking over the leadership of men to whom he was an outsider he had a reputation for brilliance in detection but also for a nature ruthless and hard to know or to like monk had changed since then the accident eight years ago in which had wiped out his memory had also given him a chance to begin again he had learned to know himself through the eyes of others and it had been bitterly enlightening not that he could explain that to anyone else they were gaining on the lighter where phillips was crouching out of sight ignored by the man at the helm another hundred feet and they would draw level there were five of them in the police boat that was more than usual but a man like phillips might require the extra strength to take him down he was wanted for the murder of a boy of thirteen or fourteen walter figgis known as fig phillips was thin and undersized which might have been what had kept him alive so long his trade was in boys from the age of four or five up to the time when their voices changed and they began to assume some of the physical characteristics of adults and they were thus of no use in his particular market of pornography the police boats bow sliced through the choppy water fifty yards away a pleasure boat went lazily upstream perhaps eventually towards kew gardens colored streamers blew in the wind and there was the sound of laughter mixed with music ahead of them nearly a hundred ships from coal barges to tea clippers were anchored in the upper pool lighters plied back and forth and stevedores unloaded cargoes brought in from every corner of the earth monk leaned forward a little drawing in breath to urge the oarsmen to even greater effort then changed his mind it would look as if he did not trust them to do their best anyway but they could not possibly want to catch phillips as much as he did it was monk not they who had involved durban in the louvain case that had eventually cost him his life and it was monk whom durban had recommended to take his place when he knew he was dying orme had served with durban for years but if he resented monks command he had never once shown it he was loyal diligent even helpful but for the most part impossible to read however the longer monk watched him the more he realized ormes respect was necessary to his success and more than that he actually wanted it the thought jarred inside him he could not remember ever before having cared what a junior thought of him the lighter was only twenty feet ahead of them now and slowing as it made way for another lighter crossing its bow which was laden with casks of raw sugar from a schooner moored fifty yards away the ship was riding high now with its load almost gone its huge canvases furled spars bare and circling gently as it rocked the police boat plunged forward and to port as the other lighter crossed to starboard the first man leapt aboard then the second pistols drawn phillips was the one case durban had not closed and it had remained even in his last notes a stillbleeding wound in his mind monk had read every page since he had inherited them from durban along with the job the facts were there dates times people questioned answers conclusions resolutions as to what to pursue next but through all the words the letters sprawled and jagged burned the emotion there was an anger far deeper than the mere frustration of failure or the injured pride at being outwitted there was a deep scalding fury at the suffering of children and a pity for all the victims of phillipss trade and whether monk wanted it to or not it scarred him too he thought about it when the day was ended and he was at home it invaded the peace of mealtimes it intruded into his conversations with his wife hester very little else had ever done that he sat rigid in the stern of the boat now aching to join the men on the lighter where were they why had they not reappeared with phillips then he understoodthey were on the wrong side phillips had judged it exactly knowing they would have to pass to port to avoid ramming the other lighter he had gone to starboard and jumped again it was risky but he had nothing to lose when they caught him he would be tried and there could be only one verdict three sundays later he would be hanged get the men back he shouted half rising from the seat hes gone to starboard on the other lighter they must have realized it too orme took the other oar unshipped it and began to pull hard to bring the boat astern of the first lighter the two men returned leaping down sending the boat rocking violently this was no time to change places with orme the other lighter was already twenty yards away and heading towards the dock if phillips made it before they caught him he would disappear among the boxes and bales the tea chests rum and sugar casks the piles of timber horn hides and pottery that crowded the quayside monks body was rigid the wind blowing in his face sharp with the smells of salt and fish on the outgoing tide catching phillips was the one thing he could still do for durban it would justify the trust durban had placed in him after knowing him only a few weeks they had shared nothing of daily life and routine only one case of a horror almost beyond imagination the lighter ahead passed out of sight for a few moments hidden by the stern of a fivemasted schooner monk watched intently it seemed to take far too long to reappear was phillips catching a loose rope calling out for help from the stevedores anything to board the ship if so monk would have to go back to the station at wapping and get more men anything could happen in that time orme must have seen the possibility too he hurled his weight behind his oar shouting at the other men the boat leapt forward and the lighter appeared again still comfortably ahead of them monk swiveled to stare at the hull of the schooner but there was no one on the ropes over its sides the stevedores on the deck were still bentbacked hauling casks up out of the hold relief swept over monk as they closed on the lighter another minute or two and they would have phillips the long chase would be over with him in custody it would only be a matter of waiting for the law to take its course the police boat came alongside the lighter again two armed men boarded and came back moments later bleakfaced and shaking their heads this time monk swore phillips had not gone up the sides onto the schooner he was certain of that no matter how agile a man could not climb the ropes swiftly enough in the few minutes he had been out of sight no lighter had passed them going to the north bank it could only have been to the south angry rowing with tightknotted shoulders the men sent the boat straight around the stern of the schooner into the wash of a stream of barges going upriver they bucked and veered slapping hard down into the water and sending up spray monk clung on to the sides snarling between his teeth as he saw another lighter going south to rotherhithe orme saw it at the same moment and gave the order they wove through the traffic a ferry crossed swiftly in front of them passengers crouched against the wind a pleasure boat sent snatches of music into the air this time the lighter made it to the dockside only twenty yards ahead of them and they saw phillipss agile figure hair and coattails flying jump from the stern as they passed the east lane stairs he landed on the lowest step which was slimed over from the tide he teetered for a moment arms wheeling and then fell sideways hard against the stone wall green with weed it must have hurt but he knew the police boat was not far behind him and fear must have spurred him to scramble to his hands and knees and clamber upwards it was a maneuver utterly without dignity and a couple of lightermen jeered at him but it was extremely rapid by the time the police boat jarred against the stone phillips was at the top on the dry surface he sprinted towards the fore and aft dock with its crates of pottery from spain dumped haphazardly amid dark brown barrels and lighter piles of unfinished timber the stench of hides was thick in the air mixed with the sickening sweetness of raw sugar and the heady aroma of spices beyond that was the bermondsey road and a whole network of streets and alleys dosshouses pawnshops chandleries taverns and brothels monk hesitated only a moment fearing wrenched ankles the howls of laughter from the dockers and lightermen if he actually fell into the river and how idiotic he would feel if phillips escaped because his own men had had to stop to fish him out there was no time for such weighing and judging he stood up felt the boat pitch sideways and launched himself towards the steps he landed awkwardly his hands hit stone and weed but his one goal kept him going he slipped on to one knee cracking it hard on the ledge of the next rise pain shot through him but no numbness to prevent him from straightening up and climbing behind phillips almost as if he had meant to land as he did he reached the top of the steps and saw phillips thirty feet ahead running towards a stack of dark wooden barrels and the winch beyond it the lumpers unloading more from a lighter below took no notice at all some of them were barechested in the sun skin glistening with sweat monk ran across the open space then he hesitated when he reached the barrels knowing phillips could be just behind them at best with a length of wood or pipe at worst a blade instead he swung around and went along the length of the stack and around the farther side phillips must have counted on exactly that he was climbing the long barrier of a pile of bales going up it as an able seaman might climb a spar hand over hand easily he looked back once his mouth pulled wide in a sneer then heaved himself over the top and stopped just for an instant before dropping down the far side monk had no choice but to follow or lose him phillips might leave his wretched boat find some hovel on the bank for a while then reappear in half a year and in the meantime god knew how many more boys would suffer or even be killed monk shinned awkwardly up the bales more slowly than phillips and reached the top with relief he crawled over to the far edge and looked down it was a long drop perhaps fifteen feet phillips was in the distance making for more mounds of cargo casks of wine cases of spice or tobacco monk was not going to risk the jump a broken ankle would lose him phillips altogether instead he lowered himself clung for a moment by his hands then let go and fell the rest of the way he turned and sprinted reaching the casks of wine just as phillips bolted across an open patch of stone towards the shadowed overhang of a cargo ship moored close up to the wharf its ropes were trailing a crane beside her a load of timber being lowered as they watched a horsedrawn wagon moved closer wheels rumbling on the uneven stone a gang of lumpers was walking towards the crane a couple of idlers argued over what looked like a piece of paper everywhere there was noise men shouting the cry of gulls the clang of chains the creak of wood the constant slap of river water against the stone there was the incessant movement of the sun reflected on the water sharp and glittering the huge moored ships rose and fell men in grays and browns toiled at a score of tasks smells filled the air river mud thick and sour the harsh cleanness of salt the sickly sweetness of raw sugar the stench of hides and fish and ships bilges and a few yards ahead the bewitching perfume of spices monk took a chance phillips wouldnt try for the ship he would be too exposed as he went up the side like a black fly on a brown wall he would head the other way and disappear into the alleys or would he bluff double bluff orme was on monks heels monk headed towards the alley entrance between the warehouses orme drew in a breath and then followed him the third policeman stayed on the quayside he had done this sort of thing often enough to know men could double back he would be waiting the alley which was no more than six feet wide went down steps then twisted one way then the other the stink of urine was sharp in monks nose there was a chandlers shop to the right its narrow doorway surrounded by coils of rope ships lanterns wooden cleats and a bucket full of hardbristle brushes it was not far enough into the alley for phillips to hide monk went past it there was a paint shop next he could see through the windows that it was empty inside orme was on his heels next alleys blind orme said quietly he could be up that waiting for us it was a warning phillips had a knife and would not hesitate to use it hes facing the gallows he went on the moment we get the manacles on its the beginning of the end for him he knows that monk found himself smiling they were close now so very close i know he said almost under his breath believe me ive never wanted any villain more than i want this one orme did not reply they walked forward slowly there was movement ahead of them the sound of scratching on the stones ormes hand went to his pistol a brown rat shot out of a side passage and passed within a yard of them there was a gasp somewhere ahead then a curse phillips there was no stirring in the air it was dark and the smell was growing worse with the mix of stale beer from a nearby tavern monk moved more quickly phillips would not be slowed by any of this everything he had to fear was behind him the alley divided the left going back towards the quayside the right into a further warren of byways there was a dosshouse to the right a man slouched in the doorway one eye blind his stomach bulging over his trousers an old top hat balanced crookedly on his head would phillips have gone in there monk suddenly realized how many friends phillips might have in these places profiteers dependent on his business suppliers and hangerson no orme said urgently putting his hand on monks arm holding him with surprising strength we go in there well not come out monk was angry he wanted to argue even in the play of shadows across ormes face his resolve was unmistakable dockside isnt the only place thats got patches police cant go he said quietly dont tell me reglar police goes into bluegate fields or the devils acre cause we all know different its us against them and we dont always win monk shook his arm free but he didnt pull away im not letting that bastard escape he said slowly and clearly murdering fig is only the tip of what he does like the mast of a sunken wreck above the water therell be a back way out orme added likely moren one it was on the edge of monks tongue to snap that he knew that but he bit it back orme deserved to catch phillips as much as monk did maybe more he had worked with durban on the original case the only difference was that durban s death was nothing to do with him and it was all to do with monk they continued along the alley away from the dock moving more swiftly now there were doorways on either side and sometimes passages no more than a yard wide mostly dead ends perhaps ten or twelve feet along hell keep going a bit orme said grimly instinct although hes a fly sod an all hell have friends here monk agreed and enemies orme said wryly hes a nasty piece o work hed shop anyone for sixpence so he wont expect any favors try that one he pointed to the left a twisted passageway leading back towards the open dock as he spoke he increased his pace like a dog scenting the prey anew monk did not argue but kept up just behind him there was no room for them to move abreast somewhere to the left a man cursed and a woman shouted abuse at him a dog started to bark and ahead of them there were footsteps orme began to run monk on his heels there was a low arch to the right and something moved across it there was a scatter of stones orme stopped so abruptly monk collided with him and bumped into the wall which was seeping wet from a loose drain in the shadows above orme started forward again very carefully now it was always they who had to be on guard phillips could wait behind any wall any arch or doorway knife in hand he could and would disembowel a man who was a threat to him a policeman could kill a man only to save his own life or that of someone else in mortal danger and he would still have to prove he had had no other course phillips could be getting away in either direction along the docks up the ropes into one of the ships or down the steps to a lighter and back across the river they could not stand there hiding forever together monk said harshly he cant get both of us now orme obeyed they charged the opening and burst out into the sudden sunlight phillips was nowhere monk felt a wave of such bitter defeat pass over him that he struggled for breath conscious of a physical pain in the pit of his stomach there was a score of places for phillips to disappear it had been stupid to take anything for granted until they actually had him in a cell with the door closed and the bolt shot home he had grasped at victory too soon the arrogance of it was like bile in his mouth now he wanted to lash out at somebody and there was no one to blame but himself he knew he should be stronger than this more in control a good leader should be able to swallow his own misery and think of the next step to take hide the disappointment or the rage smother the personal pain durban would have monk needed to measure up to that more than ever now that he had lost phillips go north he told orme ill go south wheres coulter he looked for the man they had left on the quayside he swiveled as he spoke searching for a familiar figure among the dockworkers he saw the dark uniform at the same moment orme did and coulter started waving his arms in the air they both ran forward swerving to avoid a horse and wagon and a lumper with a heavy load on his shoulders down the steps coulter shouted gesticulating at the water beyond the ship got a lighterman at knifepoint hurry wheres our boat monk shouted back jumping over a loose keg and landing hard on the uneven stones where are they went after him coulter answered turning instinctively to orme usually he was careful to be correct but in the heat of the chase old habits of loyalty came back monk was still too new theyll be closing on him lighters are slow but ive got a ferry waiting down there hurry up sir he led the way back to the steps and started down them without turning to see if monk and orme were following monk went after him he must praise coulter and not spoil it with criticism of his lapse in etiquette he went down the slimecoated steps as fast as he could and clambered into the ferry crushing his disappointment that the oarsmen in the boat would be the ones who made the arrest and saw the fury in phillipss face he would only get there in time to congratulate them but this was a team he told himself as orme landed behind him shouting at the ferryman to pull out monk was in charge but that was all he did not have to be the one who made the arrest faced phillips and saw the fury in his face as long as it was done that was all that mattered it was nothing like his days as a private agent relying on no one taking both the credit and the risks he didnt cooperatethat was what runcorn his old superior in the metropolitan force had said of him no idea how to help others or to rely on their help when he needed it selfish they were slicing through the water now the ferryman was skilled he did not look very stronghe was wiry rather than powerfulbut he steered a course that cut yards off their distance monk admired his skill there coulter pointed at a lighter ahead which was slowing a little to make way for a string of barges going downriver there was a figure crouching low to the deck it could be phillips it was impossible to tell at this distance cooperation that was why in the end runcorn had been promoted rather than monk runcorn knew how to keep silent about his own opinions even when he was right he knew how to please the men with power monk despised that and had said so but runcorn had been right monk was not easy to work with he had not allowed himself to be the barges had passed and the lighter was picking up speed again but they were far closer to it now he could see phillips clearly this time they were in the open river and he could not hide the space between them was narrowing fifty feet forty feet thirty feet suddenly phillips was on his feet his left arm clasped around the lighterman his right hand with a long knife in it across the lightermans throat he was smiling there were only twenty feet between them now and the lighter was losing speed rapidly as both men stood frozen more barges were heading for them already altering course to avoid ramming them with pounding rage monk realized what phillips was going to do and there was no way to prevent it he felt completely helpless cold inside ten feet now and still closing the barges were bearing down on them phillips whipped the knife from the mans throat and drove it hard into the side of his belly blood gushed out and the lighterman collapsed just as coulter leapt at him phillips scrambled beyond his reach hesitated a moment then leapt for the lead barge he fell short and landed in the water throwing up a huge splash but after the first shock he struggled to the surface mouth open as he gulped frantically at the air arms and legs thrashing coulter did what any decent man would he swore a string of curses at phillips and bent to help the wounded lighterman gathering as much cloth as he could into his fist and holding it on the wound while ormewho had followed coultertook off his jacket then his shirt folded the shirt into a pad and held it stopping the blood as much as possible the bargees had pulled phillips out of the water already opening the distance between them and the drifting lighter with the ferry alongside it whether they meant to or not their weight and speed meant that they could not stop easily phillips would be around the curve of the river beyond the isle of dogs in fifteen or twenty minutes monk looked at the lighterman his face was ashen but if he reached medical help he might still be saved that was what phillips was counting on he had never intended to kill him the ferryman was stunned not knowing what to do take him to the nearest doctor monk ordered you get rowing as fast as you can coulter look after him orme put your jacket on and come with me yes sir orme snatched up his jacket and stood ready the ferryman took up the oars orme and coulter very gently and awkwardly picked up the injured man and laid him in the bottom of the ferry coulter holding the pad over his wound all the time monk went to the fallen oar of the low flatbottomed lighter and gripped it with both hands balancing his weight the moment orme was on board monk began to pull away it came to him more naturally than he had expected he knew from flashes of memory and things he had been told that he had grown up in northumberland around boats mostly fishing and in bad weather lifeboats the way of the sea was ingrained in his experience some inner sense of discipline one can rebel against man and laws but only a fool rebels against the sea and he does it only once well not catch up with him orme said desperately id tie the noose around his neck with my own hands and pull the trapdoor monk did not answer he was getting the weight and movement of the long oar right and learning how to turn it to gain the greatest purchase against the water at last they were going with the tide now but then so were the barges fifty yards ahead of them at least there was nothing orme could do to help it was a oneman job he sat a little way over to the other side to balance monks weight staring ahead his uniform jacket fastened to hide as much as possible the fact that he now had no shirt certainly he would never wear that one again theyre longer than we are monk said with determined optimism they cant weave through the anchored shipping but we can theyll have to go around if we go in between those ships well lose sight of them orme warned grimly god knows where he could get to if we dont well lose them anyway monk replied theyre fifty yards ahead now and gaining he threw his weight onto the oar and pulled it the wrong way he knew the moment he felt the resistance that he had made a mistake it took him more than a minute to get into the rhythm again orme deliberately looked the other way as if he had not noticed the barges swung wide around an east indiaman anchored ahead of them stevedores working on deck with chests of spices silks and probably tea monk took the chance veering to the port to pass between the east indiaman and a spanish schooner offloading pottery and oranges he concentrated on the regularity of his strokes and keeping his balance exactly right and trying not to think that the barges were going over to the far shore now that they were out of sight if they did he might lose them but if he did not take the chance to catch up he certainly would he passed as close as he dared to the east indiaman almost under the shadow of her hull he could hear the water slapping against her and the faint hum and rattle of the wind in the shrouds the moment he was back in the sun again he looked to starboard the line of barges was nearer no more than forty yards ahead he controlled himself with an effort orme was straining forward also hands clenched shoulders tight his lips were moving as he counted the barges just to make certain they had not cast one adrift when they were out of sight the gap was still closing they could not see phillips and monk searched back and forth along the line of canvas coverings he could be behind a bale or keg under the canvas or even have taken a bargees coat and cap and at this distance look like one of them it meant nothing still he wanted to see him and be certain that phillips was there he would have to go on to the barges alone one of them had to stay with the lighter or they would have no way to take phillips back it was a long time since he had fought alone against a man with a knife in fact he was not sure if he ever had he remembered nothing from the years since the accident would he find some instinct to fall back on ten yards now he must get ready to jump they were passing into the lee of a clipper the masts seemed to scrape the sky barely moving since the hull was too large and heavy to roll in the short choppy water the lighter skimmed the surface easily then bucked the moment it hit the tide again but now they were closing on the last barge very quickly four yards three twomonk leapt orme swung over and took the oar monk landed on the barge swayed for a moment then regained his balance the bargee took no notice it was all a drama playing out in front of him in which he had no part since monk was on the last barge if phillips had moved at all it had to have been forward monk started towards the front he stood warily on top of the canvas moving from one shapeless mound to the next altering his weight all the time arms wide footing precarious his eyes moved from one side to the other expecting surprise he was almost at the prow ready to jump to the next barge when he saw a flicker of movement then phillips was on him knife arcing high and wide monk kicked forward low and moving sideways almost overbalancing then righting himself at the last instant phillips missed his mark expecting to strike flesh and meet resistance but not meeting it he teetered on one foot whirled his arms wildly for an instant and fell forward onto his knees ignoring the pain of monks boot on his flesh he lashed out again immediately catching the very front of monks shin and ripping his trousers drawing blood monk was startled the pain was searing he had expected phillips to be more taken aback longer in recovering a mistake he would not make again he had no weapon but the pistol in his belt he drew it now not to shoot but to bludgeon then he changed his mind and kicked again hard and high aiming more carefully this time he caught phillips on the side of the head sending him sprawling but phillips had seen it coming and moved back and the impact was not so great now monk had to go forward over the lumpy canvas and he had no idea what was underneath it the barges were all hit by the wake of a coal barge sails set passing upriver they bucked and slewed throwing the men off balance again monk suffered most because he was standing he should have seen that coming phillips younger and more agile had monk swayed staggered and fell almost on top of phillips who twisted and squirmed away from him he landed hard feeling the kegs under the canvas bruise him and the next moment phillips was on top of him arms and legs like steel monk was pinned he was alone orme might even be able to see what was happening but he could not help and the bargees were going to take no part for a moment phillipss face was so close monk could smell his skin his hair the exhale of his breath his eyes were glittering and he smiled as he brought the knife up in his hand monk headbutted him as hard as he could it hurtbone against bonebut it was phillips who yelled and his grip went suddenly slack monk threw him off and slid away crablike then spun around instantly the pistol in his hand but he was too late to shoot blood smeared over his face and running from his mouth phillips had risen to a crouch and turned away as if he knew monk would not shoot him in the back he launched himself from the barge and landed spreadeagle on the canvas of the one ahead without a moments thought monk followed phillips staggered to his feet and started along the central ridge of the canvas monk went straight after him this time finding the balance more difficult whatever was under the tarpaulin rolled beneath his feet and pitched him forward harder and faster than he intended phillips reached the prow and jumped again again monk went after him this time it was tight canvaslashed bales underfoot which were easier to balance on he jumped from one to the other catching up tripping phillips who went down hard monk struck him in the chest crushing the air out of his lungs and hearing the long grating rasp as he tried to fill them again then he felt pain in his forearm and saw blood but it was only a slice too shallow to cripple he hit phillips again in the chest and the knife fell from phillipss hand monk heard it slide down the canvas and clatter on the decking the blood was making his hand slippery now phillips was squirming like an eel strong and hard elbows and knees all powerful bone and angles and monk could not hold on suddenly phillips was free staggering towards the front ready to leap to the next barge there was a lighter about to cross ahead of them just one his intention was clear he would jump to it and there would be no boat in which monk could follow him monk clambered up and reached the prow just as phillips jumped and fell short he went into the water and along the lighters side in the white wash of the bow monk hesitated he could let him drown easily he needed to be only a moment late and it would be beyond anyones skill to fish him out injured as he was he would drown in minutes it would be an end better than he deserved but monk wanted him alive so he could be tried and hanged durban would be proved right and all the boys phillips had used and tortured would have a proper answer monk leaned forward with both arms over the side and caught phillips by the shoulders felt his hands lock onto his arms and used all the strength he possessed to haul him out he was wet heavy and almost a dead weight his lungs were already filling with water and he made no resistance monk took out the handcuffs and locked them on before he balanced to roll phillips over and pump his chest to get the water out breathe he said between his teeth breathe you swine phillips coughed vomited up river water and drew in his breath well done mr monk sir orme said from the lighter coming alongside mr durband have been happy to see that monk felt the warmth spread through him like fire and music and peace after desperate exertion it needed tidying up he said modestly thank you for your assistance mr orme monk arrived home at paradise place in rotherhithe before six a time that was relatively early for him he had walked rapidly up the street from where the ferry had landed at princes stairs and walked all the way up to church street then the dogleg into paradise place all the way he was refusing to think that hester might not yet be home and he would have to wait to tell her that they had phillips at last and yet idiotically he could not get the fear of it out of his mind the police surgeon had stitched up the gashes phillips had made in his arm and leg but he was bruised filthy and covered with blood he had also bought an excellent bottle of brandy for his men and shared it with them it had been for all the station so no one was the worse for wear but he knew the flavor of it hung around him however he did not even think of such a thing as he skipped a step ran the last few dozen yards up the short length of paradise place and unlocked his own front door hester he called even before he closed it behind him hester only now did he fully face the possibility that she was not yet home i got him the words fell on silence then there was a clatter at the top of the stairs and she came running down feet flying her hair was half undone thick and fair and unruly as always she hugged him with all her strength which was considerable in spite of her slender frame and lack of fashionable curves he picked her up and swung her around kissing her with all the joy and victory he felt and the sudden upsurge of belief in everything good most of all his elation was due to the possibility that she was right to have had faith in him not just in his skill but in his honor that core of him that was good and could treasure and hold on to love and phillipss capture at last meant that durban was right to have trusted him too which he realized now had also mattered two on an evening nearly two weeks after the capture of jericho phillips sir oliver rathbone arguably the best attorney in london returned a little early from his offices at the inns of court to his elegant and extremely comfortable home it was the middle of august and the air was hot and still it was much pleasanter in his own sitting room with the french windows open onto the lawn and the perfume of the second flush of roses rather than the odor of the streets the sweat and dung of horses the dust and the noise like monk rathbone was in his late forties but very different in appearance he was slender fairhaired with the air of confidence of one who has long proved his worth margaret greeted him with the same pleasure she always had since their marriage not so long ago she came down the stairs with a swirl of pale green and white muslin looking impossibly cool in the heat she kissed him gently smiling perhaps still a trifle selfconsciously he found a pleasure in it that he thought might be tactless to show they talked of many things over dinner a new art exhibition that was proving more controversial than expected the queens absence from the london season due to the recent death of prince albert and quite how much difference that was going to make in the future and of course the wretchedly miserable matter of the civil war in america the conversation was sufficiently interesting to occupy his mind and yet also supremely comfortable he could not remember ever having been happier and when he retired to read a few necessary papers in his study he found himself smiling for no other reason than his inner peace dusk was already gathering and the air was mercifully cooler when the butler knocked on the door and told him that his fatherinlaw had called and wished to see him naturally rathbone accepted immediately although somewhat surprised that arthur ballinger would specifically ask to see him rather than including his daughter as well when ballinger came in hard on the servants heels rathbone saw at once that the matter was professional rather than personal ballinger was an attorney of high standing and very considerable repute from time to time they had had dealings but so far no clients in common rathbones practice being almost entirely in major cases of criminal law ballinger closed the study door behind him to ensure their privacy then walked over to the chair opposite rathbone barely acknowledging the greeting he sat down he was a large rather heavy man with thick brown hair that had only touches of gray his features were powerful margaret had gained all the delicacy of her face and bearing from her mother i am in a difficult position oliver he began without preamble a longstanding client has asked a favor of me that i am loath to grant and yet i feel i cannot refuse him it is a business that frankly i would prefer to have nothing to do with but i can see no honorable way of escape he gave a slight shrug with one shoulder only and i suppose to be honest no legal way either one cannot pick and choose in which matters you will act for people and in which you will not that would make a mockery of the entire concept of justice which must be for all or it is for no one rathbone was startled by such a speech it suggested a lack of confidence quite uncharacteristic of ballinger something had clearly disturbed him can i be of help without breaking your clients privilege of discretion he asked hopefully it would please him to assist margarets father in a matter that was important to him it would make margaret herself happy and it would draw him closer into the family which was not a situation he found naturally easy he had a deep instinct for privacy apart from an intense friendship with his own father he had found few ties in his adult years in some ways william monk of all people was the truest friend he had that excluded hester of course but his feeling for her had been different stronger more intimate and in ways more painful he was not ready to examine it any more closely ballinger relaxed a fraction more at least outwardly although he still concealed his hands in his lap as if they might have given him away it would break no confidences at all he said quickly i am seeking your professional skills to represent a case i fear you will find repellent and have very little chance of winning however you will of course be properly paid for your time and your skill which i regard as unique he was wise enough not to overpraise rathbone was confused his profession was to represent clients in court very occasionally he prosecuted for the crown but not as a habit why was ballinger nervous about this as undoubtedly he was why come to rathbone at home and not in his office as would be far more usual what was so different about this case he had defended people accused of murder arson blackmail theft almost every crime one could think of even rape what is your client accused of he asked could it be something as contentious as treason against whom the queen ballinger gave a slight shrug murder but he is an unpopular man unsympathetic to a jury he will not appear well he hastened to explain he must have seen the doubt in rathbones face he leaned forward a little but that is not the problem oliver i know you have represented all manner of people on charges that have had no public sympathy at all although i deplore everything about this particular case it is the issue of justice that is paramount in my clients mind rathbone found a wry irony in the remark few accused men phrased their attempts to be defended successfully in such general and rather pompous terms ballingers eyes flickered and something altered in the set of his features i have not explained myself fully he went on my client wishes to pay your fees to defend another person entirely he has no relationship to the man accused and no personal stake in the outcome only the matter of justice impartial clear of all gain or loss to himself he fears that this man will appear so vile to average jurors that without the best defense in the country he will be found guilty and hanged on emotion not on the facts very altruistic rathbone remarked although there was a sudden lift of excitement inside him as if he had glimpsed something beautiful a battle with all the passion and commitment he could give it but it was only a glimpse a flash of light gone before he was sure he had seen it at all who is he he asked ballinger smiled a small bleak movement of the mouth that i cannot disclose he wishes to remain anonymous he has not told me his reasons but i have to respect his wish from his expression and the peculiar hunched angle of his shoulders it was clear that this was the moment of decision the trial in which he was afraid he might fail rathbone was taken aback why would a man in so noble an endeavor wish to remain anonymous even from his attorney from the public was easy enough to understand they might well assume that he had some sympathy for the accused and it would be only too clear to see why he would avoid that if i am bound to secrecy i shall observe it rathbone said gently surely you told him that of course i did ballinger said quickly however he is adamant i cannot move him on the subject as far as you are concerned i shall represent the accused man to you and act on his behalf all you need to know is that you will be paid in full by a man of the utmost honor and probity and that the money is earned by his own skills which are in every way above suspicion i will swear to that he sat motionless staring earnestly at rathbone in a man of less composure it might even have been thought imploringly rathbone felt uncomfortable that his own fatherinlaw should have to plead for the professional assistance he had always been willing to give even to strangers and men he profoundly disliked because it was his calling he was an advocate his job was to speak on behalf of those who were not equipped to speak for themselves and who would suffer injustice if there were no one to take their part the system of the law was adversarial the sides must be equal in skill and in dedication otherwise the whole issue was a farce of course i will act for your client he said earnestly give me the necessary papers and a retaining fee and then all we say will be privileged ballinger relaxed fully at last your word is good enough oliver i shall have all that you need sent to your office in the morning i am extremely grateful i wish i could tell margaret what an excellent man you are but no doubt she is already perfectly aware i am delighted now that she had enough sense not to allow her mother earlier to push her into a marriage of convenience although i admit i was exasperated at the time he smiled ruefully if you are going to have a strongminded woman in the house it is better to have two preferably of opposing views then you can back one or the other and achieve the goal you wish he sighed and there was a momentary sadness in his face in spite of the relief i cannot say how much i appreciate you oliver rathbone did not know how to answer he was even a trifle embarrassed by ballingers regard he directed the conversation towards the practical who am i to defend you said the charge was murder yes yes regrettably so who is he and who was the victim he knew better than to warn ballinger not to tell him of any confession which would jeopardize his standing as an officer of the court jericho phillips ballinger replied almost casually rathbone suddenly became aware that ballinger was watching him intently but beneath his lashes as if he could conceal the fact the man charged with killing the boy found down the river at greenwich he asked he had read a little about it and already he was unaccountably chilled thats right ballinger replied he denies it says the boy ran away and he has no idea who killed him then why is he charged they must have some evidence river police isnt it monk is not a fool of course not ballinger said smoothly i know he is a friend of yours or at least he has been in the past but even good men can make mistakes especially when they are new to a job and a little too eager to succeed rathbone felt more stung on monks behalf than he would have expected to i havent seen him lately i have been busy and i imagine so has he but i still regard him as a friend regret and contrition filled ballingers face i apologize i did not mean to imply otherwise i hope i have not placed you in a position where you will have to question the judgment of a man you like and respect liking monk has nothing to do with defending someone he has arrested rathbone said hotly realizing exactly how much it could if he allowed it to do you imagine that my acquaintance with the police the prosecution or the judge for that matter will have any effect on my conduct of a case any case no my dear chap of course i dont ballinger said with profound feeling that is exactly why my client chose you and why i fully concurred with his judgment jericho phillips will receive the fairest trial possible if you speak for him and even if he is found guilty and hanged we will all be easy at heart that justice has been done we will never need to waken in the night with doubt or guilt that perhaps we hanged him because his style of life his occupation or his personal repulsiveness moved us more than honest judgment if we are fair to the likes of him then we are fair to all he rose to his feet and offered his hand thank you oliver margaret is justly proud of you i see her happiness in her face and know that it will always be so rathbone had no choice but to take ballingers hand and clasp it still with a faint trace of selfconsciousness because he was not accustomed to such frankness in matters of emotion but after ballinger had gone he was also pleased this would be a supreme challenge and he would not like losing but it was an honorable thing ballinger had asked him to doobliquely dangerously honorable and it would be intensely precious to have margaret truly proud of him it was several more days before rathbone actually went to newgate prison to meet with jericho phillips by this time he had a much greater knowledge of both the specific crime he was charged with andfar more worrying to himphillipss general pattern of life even so he was still unprepared for the acute distaste he felt when they met it was in a small stone room with no furniture other than a table and two chairs the single window was high in the wall and let in daylight but there was nothing to see beyond it but the sky the motionless air inside smelled stale as if it held a centurys sweat of fear that all the carbolic in the world could not wash away phillips himself was little above average height but the leanness of his body and the angular way he stood made him look taller he possessed no grace at all and yet there was a suggestion of power in him in even the simple act of rising to his feet as rathbone came in and the guard closed the door behind him mornin sir oliver phillips said civilly his voice was rasping as if his throat were sore he made no move to offer his hand for which rathbone was grateful good morning mr phillips he replied please sit down our time is limited so let us use it to the full he was slightly uncomfortable already he felt an unease almost like a brush of physical fear and yet phillips was no threat to him at all as far as he knew to phillips he was the one man on his side phillips obeyed moving stiffly it was the only thing that betrayed his fear his hands were perfectly still and he did not stammer or shake yes sir he said obediently rathbone looked at him phillips had sharp features and the pallid skin of one who lives largely away from the sunlight but there was nothing soft in him from his spiky hair to his glittering eyes his strong hands and his narrow bony shoulders he had the physical build of povertythin chest slightly crooked legsand yet he had learned not to show the usual limp of deformity your attorney informs me that you wish to plead not guilty rathbone began the evidence against you is good but not conclusive our greatest difficulty will be your reputation jurors will weigh the facts but they will also be moved by emotion whether they are aware of it or not he watched phillipss face to judge whether he understood he saw the instant flash of intelligence and something that could almost have been mistaken for humor were the situation not so desperate course they will phillips agreed with the faintest smile feelings where we get em cause yer see mr durban werent anything like the good man they think e were e ated me for a long time an e made it is lifes work ter see me ang whether i done anything for it or not an mr monk took over from im just like e stepped into a dead mans shoes an is coat and trousers as well careless they were both of em an from wot mr ballinger says yer clever enough an straight enough ter show it if its true whether they were yer friends or not rathbone became uncomfortably aware that just as he was studying phillips so phillips in turn was studying him equally as closely and probably with just as acute a judgment he did everything he could to keep all expression from his face i see i shall look at the evidence in that light not only for its validity but as to how it was obtained if there were errors it may work to our advantage phillips shivered involuntarily struggled to conceal it and failed the room was chilly because the damp never seemed to entirely leave it in spite of the august heat outside are you cold mr phillips rathbone forced himself to remember that this man was his client and innocent of the crime he was charged with until such time as he was proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt something flared in phillipss eyes memory fear no he lied then he changed his mind its just this room his voice changed and became hoarser its wet in my cell i can hear dripping his body went rigid i hate dripping and yet the man chose to live on the river he must never be away from the slap of the waves and the shifting of the tide it was only in here where the walls sweated and dripped that he could not control his hatred of it rathbone found himself looking at phillips with a new interest something almost like respect was it possible that he deliberately forced himself to face his phobia live with it test himself against it every day that would be a strength few men possessed and a discipline most would very definitely avoid perhaps he had assumed a great deal about jericho phillips that he should not have i will look into your accommodation closely he promised now let us put our attention to what we have so far two weeks later when the morning of the trial came rathbone was as ready as it was possible to be the excitement of the eve of battle fluttered inside him tightening his muscles making his stomach knot burning within him like a fire he was afraid of failure full of doubts as to whether the wild plan he had in mind could workand even in darker moments whether it ought to and yet the hunger to try was compulsive consuming it would be a landmark in history if he succeeded in gaining an acquittal for a man like phillips because the procedure was flawed wellmotivated but essentially dishonest drawn by emotion not fact that path no matter how understandable in the individual instance would in the end only lead to injustice and therefore sooner or later to the hanging of an innocent man which was the ultimate failure of the law he looked at himself in the mirror and saw his reflection with its long nose sensitive mouth and as always humor in the dark eyes he stepped back and adjusted his wig and gown until they were perfect there were approximately fifteen minutes to go he still wished that he knew who was paying his very considerable fee but ballinger had steadily refused to tell him it was quite true that rathbone did not need to know ballingers assurance that the man was reputable and that the money was obtained honestly was sufficient to put all suspicion to rest it was curiosity that drove rathbone and possibly a desire to know if there were facts to do with someone elses guilt that were being held from him it was that second possibility that above all compelled him to give phillips the finest defense he could there was a discreet knock on the door it was the usher to tell him that it was time the trial began with all the ceremony the old bailey commanded lord justice sullivan was presiding a man in his late fifties with a handsome nose and very slightly receding chin his shock of dark hair was hidden beneath his heavy fullbottomed wig but his bristling brows accentuated the somewhat tense expression of his face he conducted the opening procedures with dispatch a jury was sworn the charges were read and richard tremayne qc began the case for her majesty against jericho phillips tremayne was a little older than rathbone a man with a curious face full of humor and imagination he would have appeared much more at home in a poets loosesleeved shirt and extravagant cravat rathbone in fact had seen him wear exactly that one evening at a party in his large house whose lawn backed on to the thames they had been playing croquet and losing an inordinate number of balls the late sun was setting falling in reds and peaches on the water bees were buzzing lazily in the lilies and nobody knew or cared who won and yet despite this lack of competition rathbone knew that tremayne both loved and understood the law rathbone was not sure at all whether he was a fortunate choice or an unfortunate one as his opponent the first witness he called was walters of the thames river police a solid man with a mild manner and buttons that had such a high polish they shone in the light he climbed the steep curving steps to the witness box and was sworn in in the dock higher up opposite the judges bench and sideways to the jury jericho phillips sat between two blankfaced guards he looked very sober almost as if he might be frightened was that to impress the jury or did he really believe rathbone would fail rathbone hoped it was the latter because then phillips would maintain his appearance without the chance of it slipping and betraying him rathbone listened to see what the river policeman would say it would be foolish for him to question any of the facts that was not the tactic he proposed to use now all he needed to do was take note tremayne was intelligent charming born to privilege and perhaps a little lazy he was due for an unpleasant surprise the message came to us at the wapping station walters was saying lightermend found a body an they reckoned as we should go and look at it is that usual mr walters tremayne asked i presume there are tragically many bodies found in the river yes sir there are but this one werent an accident poor beggard ad is throat cut from ear to ear walters replied grimly he did not look up at phillips but it was obvious from the rigidity of his shoulders and the way he stared fixedly at tremayne that he had been told not to tremayne was very careful could that have happened accidentally he asked walterss impatience sounded in his voice ardly sir apart from is throat cut an e were only a boy there were burn marks on is arms like from cigars they called us because they thought ed been murdered how do you know that mr walters rathbone smiled to himself tremayne was nervous even though he believed his case to be unassailable or he would not be so pedantic he was expecting rathbone to attack at every opportunity it would be pointless to object to this as hearsay it would make rathbone look desperate because the answer was obvious lord justice sullivans lips curved in a very slight smile also it seemed he read both of them and understood for the first time since they began there was a flash of interest in his eyes he sensed a duel of equals not the execution he had expected i know it cause they said so when they asked us to come walters replied stolidly thank you who is the us you refer to i mean who from the river police did go mr durban an me sir mr durban being your commanding officer the head of the river police at wapping yes sir rathbone considered asking why durban was not testifying although of course he knew but most of the jury would not lord justice sullivan beat him to it he leaned forward his expression mild and curious mr tremayne are we to hear from this commander durban no my lord tremayne said grimly i regret to say that mr durban died at the very end of last year giving his life to save others that is the reason we have called mr walters i see please proceed sullivan directed thank you my lord mr walters will you please tell the court where you went in answer to the summons and what you found there yes sir walters squared his shoulders we went down the limehouse reach about level with cuckolds point an there was a lighterman a ferryman and a couple o barges all anchored an waiting one o the bargesd caught up the body of a boy maybe twelve or thirteen years old the lightermand seen it and raised the cry o course you cant stop a barge still less a string of em all of a sudden like so theyd gone a good undred yards or so before they threw out an anchor an got to look at what they ad his voice sank even lower and he was unable to keep the emotion out of it poor kid was in an ell of a mess throat cut right across from one ear to the other an been dragged an bashed around so it were a wonder is ead adnt come off altogether e were caught in some ropes otherwise of course hed ave gone out with the tide an wed never ave found him before the sea an the fish ad im down to bone on his high seat sullivan winced and closed his eyes rathbone wondered if any of the jurors had seen that small gesture of revulsion or noticed that sullivan was more than usually pale yes i see tremayne gave the tragedy of it full importance by waiting to make sure the court had time to dwell on it also what did you do as a result of this discovery we asked em to tell us exactly what appened where they were when they reckoned the barged run onto the body ow far theyd dragged it without realizing sullivan frowned looking sharply at tremayne tremayne saw it mr walters if they did not know the body was there how could they have estimated how far they had dragged it rathbone hid a smile not because he was unamused by the irony of the arguments and tremaynes exactness but because if he were seen to display any lack of horror or pity now it would work against him later because o the last time someone would ave ad to ave seen it if it were there sir walters said grimly if someone passed astern o you theyd ave seen tremayne nodded precisely so and how far had that been around horseferry stairs passed a ferry going in pretty close must ave run afoul o the poor little begger some time after that did you know who he was this dead child walters winced his face suddenly transformed by anger and pity no sir not then theres thousands o children on the river one way or the other did you work on the case after that mr walters no sir it was mostly mr durban hisself and mr orme thank you please remain there in case my learned friend sir oliver wishes to ask you anything tremayne walked back across the open space of the floor and gestured an invitation to rathbone rathbone rose to his feet thanked him and walked calmly into the center of the court then he looked up at the witness stand to where walters was waiting his face heavy and apprehensive good morning mr walters he began i shall not detain you long may i compliment you on the marvelous work the river police do for us i believe that in the nearly three quarters of a century that you have existed you have reduced crime on the river by a staggering amount in fact you solve more than ninety percent of the crimes you address do you not walters straightened himself yes sir thank you sir you are rightly proud it is a great service to her majesty and to the people of london am i correct in thinking that the murder of this boy stirred a deep anger in you yes sir you are ed not only been murdered from the burns on is arms and body ed been tortured as well walterss face was ashen his voice hoarse as though his throat were dry it is very terrible rathbone agreed this was proceeding exactly as he had intended walters was a deeply sympathetic witness was mr durban similarly affected he went on or perhaps i should more correctly ask you what was mr durbans manner his reaction when he saw the boys corpse with his throat slashed open so his head hung half off and the marks of deliberate torture on his flesh walters winced at the brutal words he closed his eyes as if taking himself back to that fearful scene e wept sir he said quietly e swore that ed find oo done it an see im ang till is own ead were near off is body too ed never ever do that to another child i imagine we can all understand how he felt rathbone spoke quietly yet his voice had a timbre that carried to every seat in the silent court he knew lord justice sullivan was staring at him as if he had taken leave of his senses he was probably wondering whether to remind rathbone which side he was on and commander durban pursued it himself he continued with the assistance of mr orme you said mr orme i believe was his immediate righthand man yes sir hes still second in command sir walters agreed just so these events you describe happened some year and a half ago and we are only just come to trial did mr durban abandon the case walterss face flushed with indignation no sir mr durban worked on it day and night until e ad to give over to other things an then e followed it on is own time e never ever gave up on it rathbone lowered his voice while making sure that every word still carried to the jury and to the benches where the public sat awed and silent are you saying that he felt so passionately that he devoted his offduty time to it until the tragedy of his own early death cut short his dedication to finding the person who had tortured and then killed this boy yes sir i am an then when e found the notes mr durban left mr monk took up after im walters said defiantly thank you rathbone held up his hand to stop any more revelations we will get to mr monk in due time he can testify himself should that prove necessary you have made it all very clear mr walters that is all i have to ask you tremayne shook his head his face a little tight concealing a certain unease the judge thanked walters and excused him tremayne called his next witness the police surgeon who had examined the body of the boy he was a thin tired man with receding sandy hair and a surprisingly good voice in spite of having to stop and sneeze then blow his nose from time to time he was obviously practiced at such court appearances he had every answer on the tip of his tongue and told them of the state of the boys body briefly and precisely tremayne did not need to prompt him in anything he used no scientific language to describe the wasted flesh which was underdeveloped barely beginning to show signs of puberty he spoke simply of the flesh scarring that could have been made only by something like the lit end of a cigar finally he told them that the throat was cut so violently that the wound reached to the spine so the whole head was only just attached in such unaffected words the description seemed immeasurably more appalling there was no passion or disgust in his language it was all in his eyes and in the rigid angles of his body as he gripped the rail of the witness stand rathbone found it hard to speak to him legal tactics melted away he was facetoface with the reality of the crime as if the surgeon had brought the smell of the mortuary with him the blood and carbolic and running water but nothing washed away the memory rathbone stood in the middle of the floor with every eye in the room on him and wondered suddenly if he really knew what he was doing there was nothing this man could add that would help him yet to fail to ask him at least one question would make that obvious he must never let tremayne see any weakness tremayne might look like a dandy a poet and dreamer caught by chance in the wrong place but it was an illusion his mind was keen as a razor and he would scent weakness as a shark scents blood in the water you were obviously very moved by this particular case sir rathbone said with great gravity perhaps it was one of the most distressing you had seen it was the surgeon agreed did mr durban seem to you similarly distressed by it yes sir any civilized man would be the surgeon looked at him with distaste as if rathbone himself were devoid of decency mr monk after him was equally upset if you were going to ask he added it had occurred to me rathbone acknowledged as youve implied it is an appalling piece of savagery and against a child who had obviously suffered already thank you he turned away is that all you have to ask me the surgeon called after him his voice harder challenging yes thank you rathbone replied with a slight smile unless my learned friend has anything further you are free to leave tremayne next called orme he was a solemn figure not overtly nervous he held his hands at his sides not gripping the rail except when he went up the steps then he stood square in the box and faced tremayne with as little expression on his face as he could manage rathbone knew he would be a difficult man to break and if he did so and the jury saw it they would not forgive him he glanced at them now for the first time immediately he wished he had kept his resolve not to they were mostly middleaged men old enough to have sons the victims age they sat stiffly in their sober best suits whitefaced and unhappy society had entrusted them not only with weighing the facts but also with seeing the horror and dealing with it on behalf of everyone if they sensed that they were being manipulated they would not pardon the man who did it mr orme tremayne began his questions which were likely to go on until the adjournment for lunch and long into the afternoon perhaps until evening you worked with mr durban during the rest of his life from the time the boys body was pulled out of the river until mr durbans own death at the end of last year yes sir i did we have already heard that mr durban took a special interest in this case as far as you know from your own direct observation will you describe what was done to solve it either by him of which you have the evidence or by yourself yes sir orme stood stiffly it was plain from the beginning that the boy was murdered and that hed been pretty badly used before that he said distinctly his voice carrying throughout the room no one moved or whispered in the jury box or the gallery we ad to find out who he was and where he came from there was nothing on the body thatd give is name but the way ed been treated it seemed likely ed fallen into the ands of one o them who sells children for the use of brothels an pornographers and the like he said the words with withering disgust you could tell that from a body tremayne said affecting some surprise all this was exactly what rathbone had expected and what he would have done had their roles been reverseddraw it all out in the fashion of a story and with detail the jury would never forget the poor devils would probably have nightmares for years to come they would waken in a sweat with the sound of running water in their ears yes sir pretty likely orme replied lots of boys an girls too is alf starved youre poor youve got no choice but the burns are different is it not possible that a poor man violent perhaps drunken in his despair might hurt even his own children tremayne pressed yes sir orme conceded course it is but poor men dont ave cigars to do it with it isnt a bad temper that makes you light a cigar smoke it till its hot then hold the end of it against a childs body till it burns through the skin into the flesh and then makes scabs that bleed several people in the gallery cried out stifling the sound instantly and one of the jurors looked as if he might be sick his face was sweaty and had a faintly greenish hue the man next to him grasped his arm to steady him tremayne waited a moment before going on rathbone understood he would have done the same did that prompt any particular course of action from you tremayne asked retaining his composure as if with difficulty yes sir orme answered we visited the places we knew of where people kept boys o that age to use wed looked at them pretty hard sir e wasnt a chimney sweeps boy nor a laborer of any kind easy enough to see by is ands no dirt from chimneys no calluses from oakum picking or any other sort of thing like that but if youll pardon me sir in public like there were other parts of his body thatd been ard used his face was red his voice cracking with emotion the surgeon didnt testify to that tremayne pointed out reluctantly his body was oddly stiff as he stood his usual grace lost we didnt ask im sir it isnt medical its common sense orme told him i see did that cause you to look anywhere in particular we tried lots o places up and down the river its our job to know where they are and did you find out where he came from no sir not for sure only sure will do here mr orme i know that ormes temper was suddenly close to the surface the emotion too raw to govern we know that jericho phillips kept a lot o boys especially young ones small as five or six years old took them in from wherever e found them and gave them a bed and food lot of them lived on a boat but wed never find anything there he had lookouts and they always knew who we were rathbone considered objecting that orme was stating an opinion rather than presenting evidence but it was hardly worth making a fuss over he decided against it so you never saw anything amiss on his boat tremayne concluded no sir then why did you raise his name at all tremayne asked gently as if he were puzzled what was it that drew him to your attention other than a growing desperation to find at least a name for this dead boy orme let out his breath in a sigh an informant came to us and said that jericho phillips was keeping a kind o cross between a brothel and a peep show on his boat he ad young boys there and forced them to perform certain acts he stopped obviously embarrassed his eyes flickered to the public gallery aware that there must be women there then he looked away again angry with himself for his weakness tremayne did not help him it was clear from the expression on his face the slight downturn of his mouth that he found the subject repellent and touched on it only because he owed it to the dead and to the truth unnatural acts with children orme said miserably boys e used cameras to make pictures so e could sell them to people get more money than just from those who watched his face was hot the color reaching all the way up to his hair tremayne was exquisitely careful that is what this man told you mr orme yes sir i see tremayne shifted his balance a little and did you request that he take you so you might ascertain for yourself if this were true after all he could have invented the entire story couldnt he yes sir e could but e refused to take us or to testify e said he was being blackmailed because ed looked at the pictures it was my opinion that ed probably bought some as well e was scared stiff this time rathbone did rise to his feet and object the witness may be of that opinion my lord but that is not evidence tremayne inclined his head in acknowledgment smiling a little then turned again to orme did he say so mr orme no sir he wouldnt even give us is name tremayne shrugged in a very slight elegant gesture of confusion was there any purpose in his coming forward at all if he was prepared to say so little and not to swear to any of it no sir not really orme admitted maybe it just helped us narrow the search so to speak mr durban was rather good at drawing he made a sketch of the dead boys face and then a picture of how he might ave looked standing up and dressed we took it around for a couple of weeks or so to see if anyone could give im a name or say anything about im and could they yes sir they said e used to be a mudlark a young lad came and told us they picked coal up off the tideline o the river when they were six or seven years old he just knew him as fig but he was certain it was im because of the funny way his hair grew at the front never knew his ole name or where he come from maybe he was a foundling and nobody knew much more he disappeared a few years ago but this mudlark wouldnt say exactly where or when couldnt remember and it wasnt any use pushing im we went and found a few more lads and they confirmed what e said they all knew im as fig tremayne turned towards rathbone but there was no point contesting the identification whether it was the same boy or not was immaterial to the charge he was somebodys child tremayne led orme in some detail through the process of the various other people who had confirmed that they knew the boy one had added that his whole name was walter figgis others through a laborious process that rathbone allowed tremayne to abbreviate confirmed that there were boats on the river that gave shelter to children on some of them the boys were appallingly misused but of course there was no proof tremayne wisely barely touched on that the generality was enough to shake the jury and the audience in court to a revulsion so deep that many of them were physically trembling some looked nauseated to the point that rathbone was afraid they might not be able to control themselves rathbone himself was aware of a depth of distress he had seldom felt before only perhaps in cases of the most depraved rape and torture he looked up at phillips and saw nothing in him at all resembling human pity or shame a wave of fury almost drowned him the sweat broke out on his body and the wig on his head was like a helmet the black silk gown suffocated him as he held his arms to his sides he was imprisoned in it then he was afraid was phillips beyond human emotions unreachable and rathbone had promised to use all his skills to set him free again to go back to the river he had no escape from doing it it was his covenantal duty which he had already accepted and he had given his word not only to the court but also to arthur ballinger and thus obliquely to margaret to refuse now would suggest to the jury that he knew something that condemned the accused beyond doubt he was trapped by the law that he wanted above all to serve he had the ugly sense that phillips knew that just as well as he did himself indeed that was why he showed no fear they adjourned for lunch before tremayne was finished orme was one of his major witnesses and he intended to gain every word of damnation from him that he could they resumed after the shortest adjournment possible and began the afternoon with tremayne asking orme about durban s death mr durban died last december is that correct mr orme tremayne asked his manner suitably grave yes sir and mr monk succeeded him as commander of the river police at the main station which is in wapping yes sir lord justice sullivan was beginning to look a trifle impatient his frown deepened is there some point to this mr tremayne the succession of events seem to be plain enough mr durban did all he could to solve the case for the police and did not succeed so he continued on his own time unfortunately he died and mr monk took over his position and presumably his papers including notes on unsolved cases is there more to it than that tremayne was slightly taken aback no my lord i believe there is nothing to contest then i daresay the jury will follow it simply enough proceed there was an edge to sullivans voice and his hands on the great bench in front of him were clenched he was not enjoying this case perhaps to him it was simply a tragedy of the darkest and most squalid sort certainly there were no fine points of law and none of the intellectual rigor rathbone knew he liked he wondered quickly whether tre mayne knew him socially they lived not far from each other to the south of the river were they friends enemies or possibly not even acquaintances rathbone knew tremayne and liked him sullivan he had never met outside the courtroom tremayne turned back to orme in the witness box mr orme was the case officially reopened new evidence perhaps no sir mr monk was just looking through the papers to see if there was anything rathbone rose to his feet yes yes yes sullivan said quickly mr orme please restrict yourself to what you know what you saw and what you did orme flushed yes my lord he looked at tremayne with reproach mr monk told me ed found papers about a case wed never closed and e showed me mr durbans notes on the figgis case he said it would be a good thing if we could close it now i agreed with him it always bothered me that we adnt finished it will you please tell the court what you yourself did then since you worked on it with mr durban presumably mr monk was keen to avail himself of your knowledge yes sir very keen tremayne then took orme through the trail of evidence he asked about the lightermen bargees lumpers stevedores ferrymen chandlers landlords pawnbrokers tobacconists and quayside news vendors he and monk had spoken to in the endless pursuit of the connection between the boy fig and the boat in which jericho phillips plied his trade they were always looking for someone who could and would swear to the use of phillipss boat and the fact that fig was there against his will it was all circumstantial little threads secondand thirdhand links rathbone looked at the jury and saw the confusion in their faces and eventually the boredom they could not follow it the disgust was there the anger and the helplessness but the certainty of legal proof still eluded them they were lost in complexity and because they were still sickeningly aware of the crime they were frustrated and becoming angry the day closed with a feeling of hatred in the room and the police crowded closely around phillips as he was taken down the stairs to the prison below the court the mood was ugly with the weight of old unresolved pain rathbone began crossexamining orme the next morning he knew exactly what he needed to draw from him but he was also aware that he must be extremely careful not to antagonize the jury whose sympathies were entirely with the victim and with the police who had tried so very hard to bring him some kind of justice he stood in the middle of the courtroom floor in the open space between the gallery and the witness stand deliberately at ease as if he were a trifle in awe of the occasion identifying with orme not with the machinery of the law i imagine you deal with many harrowing tragedies mr orme he said quietly he wanted to force the jury to strain to hear him to make their attention total the emotion must be grave subdued even private with each man as though he were alone with the horror and the burden of it then they would understand durban and why monk in his turn had taken the same path he had not expected to dislike doing this so much facing the real man was very different from the intellectual theories of justice no matter how passionately felt but there was no way to turn back now without betrayal when he had to question hester it would be worse yes sir orme agreed rathbone nodded but it has not blunted your sensibilities or made you any less dedicated to finding justice for the victims of unspeakable torture and death no sir ormes face was pale his hands hidden by his sides but his shoulders were high and tight did mr durban feel as deeply yes sir this case was was one of the worst if youd seen that boys body sir wasted and burned like it was then is throat cut near through and dumped in the river as if he were an animal youd have felt the same i imagine i would rathbone said quietly his head bent a trifle as if he were in the presence of the dead now lord justice sullivan leaned forward his face pinched his mouth drawn tight is there some purpose to this sir oliver i trust it has not slipped your mind which party you represent in this case there was a note of warning in his voice and his eyes were suddenly flat and hard no my lord rathbone said respectfully i wish to find the truth it is far too grave and too terrible a matter to settle for anything less in the interests of humanity sullivan grunted and for a moment rathbone was afraid he had taken his play too far he glanced sideways at the jury and knew he was right relief washed over him with physical warmth then he remembered phillips shivering in newgate and his horror of dripping water and his satisfaction vanished he turned again to orme you and mr durban worked all your duty hours and many beyond yes sir orme knew not to answer more than he was asked was this same passionate dedication also true of mr monk he had to ask it was the plan yes sir there was no hesitation in orme if anything he was more positive i see it is not surprising and much to be respected tremayne was fidgeting in his seat growing restive at what seemed to be a purposeless reaffirmation of what he himself had just established he suspected rathbone of something but he could not deduce what and it troubled him the jury was merely puzzled rathbone knew he must make his point now one by one he touched on the evidence that first durban and then monk had pursued asking orme for the facts that specifically connected the abuse of the boys to phillipss boat never once did he suggest that it had not happened only that the horror of the facts had obscured the lack of defining links to phillips the boat existed boys from the age of five or six up to about thirteen unquestionably lived on it there were floating brothels for the use of men with any kind of taste in sexual pleasures either to participate or merely to watch there were pornographic photographs for sale in the dark alleys and byways of the river what unquestionable proof had durban monk or orme himself found that the boys so abused were the ones to whom phillips gave a home there was none the horror of the cruelty the greed and the obscenity of it had moved all three men so deeply that they had been too desperate to stop it and punish the perpetrators of it than to make certain of their facts it was only too easy to understand any decent man might fall into the same error but surely any decent man would also be appalled at the idea of convicting the wrong person of such a heinous crime deserving of the gallows the court adjourned for lunch with quite suddenly a complete and awful confusion a knowledge that all the certainties had been swept away only the horror remained and a sense of helplessness rathbone had accomplished exactly what he had intended it was brilliant even the subtle and clever tremayne had not seen the trap before he was in it he had left palefaced angry with himself hester was waiting to testify to her part in the investigation when tremayne came to her during the lunch adjournment she was sitting in one of the public houses that provided food but she was too tense to do more than take an occasional bite of her sandwich and then found it difficult to swallow he sat down opposite her his face grim his manner apologetic he too declined to eat more than a sandwich and drink a glass of white wine im sorry mrs monk he said immediately once they were alone he spoke quickly so as not to be overheard by others passing close to them it has not gone as well as i had hoped in fact rather as i had taken for granted it is proving harder to make the connections between phillips and the victims of his depravity than i had expected he must have seen the surprise on her face sir oliver is one of the most brilliant attorneys in england far too clever to attack us openly he said i knew there was something wrong when he played up the horror of the crime it should have warned me of what he was doing she felt a chill of dismay what is he doing tremayne blushed and the last shred of irony vanished from his face replaced by gentleness did you not know he was defending this case mrs monk no then instantly she saw the understanding in his face and wished she had not admitted it he must have known or have sensed something of her friendship with rathbone and had seen her sense of betrayal im sorry he said quietly how clumsy of me he is suggesting that the police were moved as much by pity and outrage as by logic they proved the crime was committed but forgot the finer elements of connecting it unarguably with jericho phillips he took a sip of his wine his eyes not leaving hers he has made it obvious that so far we have provided no motive for him to have tortured and murdered one of his own boysassuming we can ever prove figgis was one of his and he is quite right that we have not so far done that beyond a reasonable doubt who could doubt it she said hotly it all fits together and makes the most excellent sense in fact it is the only answer that makes sense at all on balance of probability it does he agreed he leaned across the table a little the law requires that it be beyond all reasonable doubt if we are to hang a man for it you know that mrs monk you are not a novice at the law now she was shivering in spite of the heat inside the stuffy room with its gleaming tankards on the bar its sawdust floor muffling footsteps and the smells of ale food and too many people crushed together you dont mean hes going to get away with it she asked huskily it was a possibility she had not even considered phillips was guilty he was brutal sadistic and profoundly corrupt he had abused numberless children and murdered at least one he had nearly murdered a lighterman simply to divert the river police so he could escape monk and orme had seen him do it no of course not tremayne assured her but i will have to describe some very violent and offensive scenes and ask you to relive on the witness stand things that i am sure you would rather forget i apologize for it because i had hoped to spare you for heavens sake mr tremayne she said sharply i dont care in the slightest what you question me about or whom if it is unpleasant or discomfiting what on earth does that matter we are talking about the misery and death of children what kind of person is concerned about such trivialities as comfort at such a cost some people will allow others to pay almost anything in order to avoid embarrassment to themselves mrs monk he replied she did not consider that worthy of an answer she took the stand climbing up the steep curving steps carefully so as not to trip over her skirt she faced the court seeing tremayne below her in the open space reserved for the lawyers lord justice sullivan sat in his high magnificently carved seat to the right the twelve somber jurymen were opposite in their double row under the windows the public gallery was behind the lawyers tables she was not afraid to look ahead to where jericho phillips sat in the dock above the whole proceedings his face was jagged the highboned nose sharp cheekbones crooked eyebrows and hair that even water would not make lie straight she recognized no emotion whatever in his face perhaps it was in locked hands or a shivering body behind the high ledge out of sight she did not look to where rathbone sat quietly waiting his turn nor did she try to see if margaret was in the public gallery behind him just at the moment she did not wish to know tremayne began his voice sounded confident but she had come to know him well enough over the last few weeks to notice the slightly awkward way he stood and that his hands were restless he was not as sure of himself as he had been before the trial began mrs monk is it correct that you have created and now run a clinic situated in the portpool lane for the treatment at no charge of street women who are ill or injured and unable to obtain help any other way yes it is are you financially rewarded for this no the answer sounded very bare she wanted to add something but could not find the words she was saved from the attempt by rathbone rising to his feet if it may please the court my lord the defense will stipulate to the fact that mrs monk was an outstanding nurse under miss florence nightingale during the crimean war and that on her return to this country she worked in hospitals courageously and tirelessly endeavoring to bring about some very necessary reforms there was a murmur of admiration from the gallery she then turned her attention to the plight of street women rathbone continued reduced to prostitution by abandonment or whatever other crime she created at her own expense a clinic where they could come for treatment of injury or disease it is now a recognized establishment drawing voluntary help from society in general indeed my own wife gives much of her time in its cause both to raise charitable contributions and to work there at cooking cleaning and tending the sick i can think of no finer work a woman may perform several of the jurors gasped and their faces brightened into uncertain smiles even sullivan was moved to an expression of admiration only tremayne looked nervous do you have anything to add mr tremayne sullivan asked tremayne was off balance no my lord thank you a little more tightlipped he looked up at hester and resumed his questioning in the nature of this work mrs monk have you had occasion to learn a great deal more than most of us could know about the business of those who sell their bodies for the sexual indulgence of others yes one cannot help learning i imagine so in order to avail himself of such knowledge did mr monk ask for your assistance in discovering more about how walter figgis might have lived been abused and then killed yes it was far easier for me to gain the trust of those who deal in such things i knew people who could help me and take me to speak to others who might never speak to the police precisely would you please tell the court step by step what you found out with reference to walter figgis tremayne directed i regret the necessity of such distasteful material but i require you to be specific otherwise the jury cannot decide fairly what is true and what we have suggested but failed to prove do you understand yes of course i do then gently and very clearly he led her through all the long questioning collecting deducing then more questioning until they had gathered the evidence creating a portion of figs life his disappearance from the riverbank to phillipss floating brothel his years there and finally his death every piece of information was gained from someone she could name although she chose to give only the nicknames by which they were known on the street and rathbone did not object if fig was working as the evidence says tremayne continued why on earth would phillips or any other brothel keeper wish to harm his property at all let alone murder it what use is fig to him dead hester knew her face showed her revulsion but she could not control it men whose taste is in children have no interest in the same person once they begin to show the signs of coming manhood it has nothing to do with any kind of affection they are used to relieve a need as a public lavatory is used there was a ripple of disgust around the room as if someone had opened a door into a cesspit and the smell had drifted in tremaynes own wry sensitive face reflected it most of all are you suggesting that such men murder all children as they begin to show signs of growing up he asked no she replied as steadily as she could reliving her fury and pity in careful words was making her feel a little queasy it seemed offensively clinical although the faces of the jury reflected it as anything but she drew in her breath no i have been informed that usually they are sold to any merchant captain willing to buy them and they serve as cabin boys or whatever is needed she permitted her expression to convey the darker meaning of the phrase they leave port on the next ship out and are maybe years gone in fact they may never come back i see tremayne looked pale himself perhaps he had sons then why would this not happen to fig it might have been intended to she answered for the first time moving her glance from tremayne and looking at rathbone she saw misery and revulsion in his face and wondered what could possibly have happened that had compelled him to defend jericho phillips surely he could not ever have done it willingly he was a civilized man offended by vulgarity an honorable man she had once thought him too fastidious in his passions for him to love her with the totality that she needed mrs monk tremayne prompted her he might have rebelled she completed her thought if he caused trouble he would be less easy to sell he might have been a leader of the younger boys and been murdered as an example of discipline no quicker way to suppress a rebellion in the ranks than to execute the leader she sounded cynical even to her own ears did the crowd the jury rathbone himself realize that she spoke so to hide a pain of understanding that was unbearable was rathbone being pressured by someone into doing this was it possible that he had not realized how repulsive the reality was did he even think how the money was earned that he took in payment if he had how could he accept it thank you mrs monk tremayne said softly his face bleak and lips tight as if the grief of it were clenched inside him you have shown us a very terrible picture but one that is tragically believable may i commend you for your courage and pity in the work you do there was a murmur of approval two of the jurors nodded and one blew his nose fiercely the court is obliged to you madam lord justice sullivan said quietly his face was a mask of disgust and there was high color in his cheeks as if the blood burned beneath his skin you are excused for today no doubt tomorrow sir oliver rathbone will wish to question you he glanced at rathbone may it please the court my lord rathbone affirmed the court was duly adjourned and hester climbed down from the witness stand grasping the railing she felt drained even a little dizzy one of the ushers offered her his arm but she declined it thanking him she was in the hall outside the courtroom when she saw rathbone coming towards her she had deliberately chosen that way of leaving in hope of meeting him she wished to ask him facetoface what had made him take such a case if he were in some kind of trouble why had he not asked monk for help it could hardly be financial destitution could hardly be worse than descending to this she moved to the center of the hall so he could not avoid encountering her he saw her and faltered in his step but he did not stop she did waiting for him to reach her his eyes on hers he moved steadily forward he was only a few yards from her and she was about to speak when another man older came out of one of the side rooms his face was familiar but she could not immediately place him oliver he called rathbone turned his relief at escape momentarily undisguised arthur good to see you how are you of course arthur ballinger margarets father there was nothing hester could do now the conversation she wished for could only be held in absolute private even from margaret in fact perhaps most of all from margaret she did not wish her to ever know how close hester and rathbone had once been what she might guess was one thing knowledge was another she lifted her chin a little higher and kept walking three rathbones crossexamination of hester began as soon as court resumed the next morning she took her place again in the witness stand she was wearing a plain bluegray dress not unlike the sort of uniform a nurse would wear but more flatteringly cut and she knew it made the most of her fair coloring and steady wide gray eyes she wanted to appear both competent and feminine and of course respectable tremayne had mentioned this to her quite unnecessarily she understood what a jury wanted and what kind of person they would believe during monks many cases there had been times when she had testified or seen others do so and watched the faces of the jurors may i add my admiration to that of the court mrs monk rathbone began it is a brave and charitable work that you do thank you she did not trust him even though she knew he did admire her intensely even with a degree of envy for her passion too often thought had robbed him of action she simply cared enough to take the risk anyway now he stood elegantly in the middle of the floor and complimented her how much of your time do you put to your work in portpool lane mrs monk he went on tremayne moved in his seat uneasily hester knew it was because he was waiting for rathbone to attack and he did not know from which direction it would come it varies hester replied meeting rathbones eyes at times of crisis we work all the time taking turns to sleep at other times when there is relatively little to do i may not go in every day perhaps only two or three times a week a crisis rathbone turned the word over as if tasting it what would constitute a crisis mrs monk the question sounded innocent and yet hester sensed a trap in it if not now then later after he had led her carefully with other questions the ease with which he asked it was like a warning why was he defending jericho phillips what had happened to him while she had not been paying attention he was waiting for her answer it felt as if everyone in the court was looking at her waiting with him several people seriously injured at once perhaps in a fight she answered levelly or worse than that in the winter seven or eight people with pneumonia or bronchitis or perhaps consumption and then a bad wound or gangrene on top of it he looked impressed and how do you cope with all of that tremayne stared forward as if he would object but no one was listening or watching him we dont always succeed hester replied but we help most of the time it isnt nearly as bad as that dont you get the same people in again and again rathbone asked yes of course any doctor does she smiled very slightly what has that to do with it you try to help whom you can one person one day at a time or day and night and day he amended if necessary she was anxious now as well he was making a heroine out of her as if he had temporarily forgotten that she was there to give the evidence that would damn jericho phillips you have a marvelous dedication to the poor and the wretched mrs monk rathbone said it with respect even admiration but she was waiting for the question beyond the one that hid an attack thank you i dont think of it that way but simply as an attempt to do what you can she answered you say that quite casually mrs monk rathbone moved back and then turned and walked the other way the gesture had a grace that drew the eyes he looked up at her again but surely you are speaking of a passion a selfsacrifice that is far beyond that which most people experience i dont see it as such she answered not merely in modesty but because it was true she loved her work she would be hypocritical were she to allow it to be painted as a nobility at cost to herself rathbone smiled i expected that you would say that mrs monk there are some women like your mentor miss nightingale whose life is to give their time and emotion to bettering the lot of others there was a murmur of approval around the room tremayne rose to his feet his expression confused and unhappy something was happening that he did not understand but he knew it was dangerous my lord i am aware that sir oliver is long and well acquainted with mrs monk and that lady rathbone also gives her time freely to the portpool lane clinic admirable as this is there is no question in sir olivers observations and they seem irrelevant to the case against jericho phillips sullivan raised his eyebrows sir oliver in the unlikelihood that mrs monk is unaware of your regard for her would it not be better to make such remarks privately rathbone colored perhaps at the implication but he was not disconcerted with his tactic the relevance will become clear my lord he replied with an edge to his voice if you will permit me but without waiting he turned again to hester reluctantly tremayne resumed his seat were you acquainted with the late commander durban mrs monk rathbone asked mildly he knew the circumstances of the louvain case he had played a major part in it of course he already knew that she did not know durban except through monk no she answered uncertain why he had asked he was not challenging her evidence which was what she had expected and prepared for only by repute from whom he asked to begin with my husband later i also heard mr orme speak very highly of him what opinion did you form of his character she could not understand why he asked her answer was bound to be against every point he must establish to raise any doubt as to phillipss guilt surely it was inconceivable that he would deliberately sabotage his own case it was contrary to everything she had ever known of him that he would take a case any case whatever in order to deliberately lose it mrs monk he prompted that he was a man of passion humor and great integrity she answered he was a good policeman and an exceptional leader of men he was honorable and brave and in the end he gave his life to save others rathbone smiled very slightly as if that were the answer he had not only foreseen but also wanted i will not ask you the circumstances i know what they are i also was there at the time and it was exactly as you say but it was a matter that for the public good must be kept discreet he moved a step or two as if to mark the change of subject there is no purpose in my asking if you are devoted to your husband how else would you answer but in the affirmative but i will ask you to describe your circumstances at the time mr monk first met mr durban for example were you well off how was your husband employed had he good opportunities for advancement lord justice sullivan moved uncomfortably on his high seat and looked at rathbone with a flicker of anxiety then away from him and beyond to somewhere in the body of the court as if to gauge how the public mood interpreted this extraordinary direction of events tremayne half rose to his feet then sank back again by not allowing hester to answer he would be implying that she or monk had something to hide or to be ashamed of the jury might imagine all kinds of things all of them discreditable my husband was a private agent of inquiry hester replied our circumstances were uncertain from week to week occasionally clients did not pay and some cases were incapable of solution that cannot have been easy for you rathbone sympathized and obviously no advancement was possible as the court is aware mr monk succeeded mr durban as commander of the wapping station of the river police which is a fine job with good remuneration high status and opportunity for advancement to even higher rank eventually even commissioner of police would not be impossible for an able and ambitious man how did it come about that mr monk took this position and not one of the men already employed there mr orme for example mr durban recommended him hester replied now with some idea where rathbone might be leading but even if she were correct and saw every step ahead before she reached it she could see no way of escape her hands felt clammy on the railing and yet she was cold inside the air was stale in the crowded room you must be very grateful for such a remarkable and unforeseen improvement in your circumstances rathbone went on your husband is now a commander in the river police and you have financial security and social respect and apart from yourself you must be very pleased for your husband also is he happy in the river police she could not possibly say other than that he was even if in fact he hated it fortunately she did not have to lie as rathbone knew yes he is they are a fine body of men with a high reputation for both skill and honor and he is proud to be among them let us not be overmodest mrs monk to lead them rathbone corrected her are you not proud of him also it is a great achievement yes of course i am proud of him again she could give no other answer he did not belabor the point he had made it sufficiently for the jury both she and monk owed durban a great deal personally and professionally rathbone had placed her in a position where she had to say so or appear utterly graceless now anything in which she supported durban would appear as gratitude and be suspected as founded in emotion rather than fact how well he knew her he had forgotten nothing of her from the days when they had been much closer when he had been in love with her not with margaret she felt very alone in the stand with everyone in the court staring at her and with rathbones knowledge of her so delicate and intimate she was horribly vulnerable mrs monk rathbone resumed you played a large part in helping identify this tragic boy through your knowledge of the abuse of women and children in the trade of sexual relations he said it with distaste reflecting what all the people in the galleryand more particularly in the jury boxmust feel it was you who learned that he was once a mudlark he turned slightly in a peculiarly graceful gesture in case there is anyone in the jury who does not understand the term would you be good enough to explain it to us she had no choice but to do as he asked he was guiding her as a skilled rider does a horse and she felt equally controlled to rebel in the public gaze of the court would make her appear ridiculous how well he knew her a mudlark is a person who spends their time on the banks of the river between low and high tide lines she said obediently they salvage anything that may be of value and then sell it most of them are children but not all the things they find are largely brass screws and fittings pieces of china lumps of coal that sort of thing he looked interested as if he were not already familiar with every detail of the facts how do you come to know this it does not seem to lie within the area of your usual assistance who did you ask for the information that led to your discovering that the boy fig had once been a mudlark in a case a short while ago a young mudlark was injured i looked after him for a couple of weeks she wondered why he was asking about scuff did he mean to challenge the identification of the body really how old was he what was his name he inquired why was he asking he knew scuff he had been in the sewers with them as desperate to ensure scuffs safety as any of them he is known as scuff and he thinks he is about eleven she replied her voice catching with emotion in spite of her efforts to remain detached rathbone raised his eyebrows he thinks yes he doesnt know did he identify fig so it was the identification no he introduced me to older boys and vouched for me so they would tell me the truth this boy scuff trusts you i hope so you took him into your home when he was injured and cared for him nursed him back to health yes and an affection grew between you yes do you have children of your own mrs monk she felt as if he had slapped her without warning it was not that she had desperately wanted children she was happy with monk and her work it was the implication that somehow she was lacking which hurt that she had taken scuff in not because she liked him but to fill an emptiness in herself by a sort of oblique reference backward it made it seem as if all she had done in the clinic and even in the crimea had been to compensate for her own lack of family of purpose in the more usual sense it was not true she had a husband she loved far more than most women did theirs she was married of choice not convenience or ambition or need she had work to do that stretched her intellect and used her imagination and courage most women got up in the morning to the same endless domestic round filling their days with words rather than actions or accomplishing small tasks that had to be begun again in exactly the same fashion the next day and the day after hester had only once in her life been bored and that was for the brief time spent in the social round before going to the crimea but if she said any of that she would sound as if she were defensive he had attacked her so delicately so obliquely that people would think she was protesting too much she would immediately make him seem right they were all waiting now for her to reply she could see the beginning of pity in their faces even tremayne looked uncomfortable no i dont have children she answered the question it was on the tip of her tongue to point out that neither did he but that would be unbecoming again an attack in order to defend before there was justification for it may i say that it is a very noble thing you are doing giving of your time and means to fight for those children of others who suffer from the abuse and neglect of the very people who should be caring for them he spoke sincerely and yet after what he had said before it still managed to sound like pity he moved his hand in the air as if to dismiss the subject so you sought the help of other mudlarks to identify the body of this poor boy who was found near horseferry stairs and because of your rescue of scuff they were willing to help you in a manner that they would not help the police is that accurate they helped she replied i did not attribute motive to them it sounded sharp as if she were defending herself it took all the selfcontrol she could muster to keep her voice from shaking and her expression mild but if i had i would think it to protect themselves and perhaps act in some fairness to the boy who had been one of them rathbone smiled you think well of them mrs monk your trust and affection do you credit i am sure every woman in this court would like to think she might do the same in one sentence he had turned it into an issue of being feminine something charitable but unrealistic how clever of him and how very unfair he knew she was the least sentimental of people she must attack him back or be mowed under i am an army nurse sir oliver as you mentioned earlier her voice shook in spite of all her efforts and the tone was sharper than she meant it to be wounds are real they do not stop bleeding because of wellmeaning idealism or kind judgments of affection gangrene typhoid and starvation do not respond to woollyminded good wishes i have quite often failed especially in reforms i would like to have brought in but because i spoke too bluntly not because i was sentimental i thought you knew that of me but perhaps it was you who were too kind in your judgments and saw what you wished to see what you thought womanly and becoming and easy to deal with a flare of surprise lit in his eyes and of admiration this time it was honest not assumed for the jury i stand corrected mrs monk he apologized of course you are right you never lacked courage only tact you saw what needed to be done but did not have the knowledge of human nature to persuade people to do it you did not foresee the arrogance the shortsightedness or the selfishness of those with interests vested in things remaining as they are you are idealistic you see what could be and strive to bring it about you fight with passion courage and honor for the oppressed the sick the forgotten of the world you are disobedient to the law when it is unjust and loyal at any cost to what is right is that a fairer assessment of your character it was fair even generous it was also damning of her as an impartial witness the court might both like and admire her but it would always judge whatever she said against the force of her beliefs and emotion would win she had turned rathbones argument around but he had still beaten her he went on to take apart all the evidence she had gathered through the witnesses learned of in her dealings with portpool lane for every one of them he could show that they had benefited from her care he worded it so it seemed that their indebtedness would cause them to say whatever she wished them to not in deliberate deceit but in the desire to please a woman whose help they depended upon in spite of the praise he had given her she still appeared worthy but driven more by feelings than by reason passionately tireless for justice towards those she saw as needy and furious for vengeance against those who preyed upon them she was feminine he had harped on about her womanliness she was vulnerable he had subtly reminded them that she was childless and she had poor judgment he gave no example of that but by then he was believed without it she stood helpless on the stand surrounded by strangers who saw her through rathbones words and she wondered if he actually saw her that way was this his true opinion and all the past courtesy was only good manners towards a woman with whom he had once been in love but had now grown beyond his arrogance infuriated her then she was touched by the first cold splash of fear that he could be right perhaps she was led by emotion rather than a fair and equal rationality perhaps monk was led by his sense of debt to durban as rathbone implied and she simply went along with it in blind loyalty rathbone sat down knowing he had succeeded superbly she looked at his face and had no idea what he felt or if he felt anything at all perhaps his intellect would always dominate his heart that was why she had not accepted his offer of marriage turning it aside gently as if it had not really been made in order not to hurt him poor margaret tremayne stood up and attempted to redress the balance but it was impossible and he realized it quickly enough to do little damage before he sat down again hester remained in the courtroom afterwards as rathbone called other witnesses who cast doubt on durban s honesty it was done so subtly that at first she did not realize the impact of it a revenue man testified as to durban s zeal in pursuing phillips oh yes sir he said nodding his head vigorously e was very keen like a terrier with a rat e were wouldnt let go fer love ner money wouldnt let go rathbone repeated for the sake of the jury mr simmons would you describe exactly the kind of thing you are referring to the gentlemen may have had little to do with police procedure and be unfamiliar with what is usual and what is not i assume you are speaking of behavior that was out of the ordinary simmons nodded again yes sir i see what yer mean folks might think as all policemen are like that an they int e were very different mr durban were ed ask one question and if yer didnt give im the answer e wanted ed go round it a different way an then another again ive seen some o them bull terriers what didnt ave a grip like e ad if id been less than onest id ave told im what e wanted just to get im off me back indeed did he tell you why he was so determined to find out who killed the boy fig mr simmons rathbone was very careful not to lead the witness not to ask him for assumptions or evidence that was hearsay tremayne was unhappy with it but there were no grounds for him to object hester could see it as clearly as watching a game of chess every move was plain obvious the moment after it had been made and yet impossible to forestall no sir e dint simmons answered couldnt say whether e ated phillips cause e killed the boy or cared about the boy cause it was phillips oo killed im rathbone responded quickly before tremayne could object or sullivan sustain him you mean his behavior gave you reason to think there was a personal dislike above the matter of the crime what behavior was that mr simmons tremayne half rose then changed his mind and sank back again sullivan looked at him inquiringly a sharp interest in his face as if he were watching a personal battle beneath the professional one and it interested him intensely almost excited him was this why he loved the law for the combat simmons was struggling with his answer his face furrowed it were personal he said at length i cant really say ow i know look on is face way e spoke about im language e used ed sometimes let go of other things but never phillips e were real torn up with the way the boy ad been used but e were still glad to ave a reason ter go after phillips there was an almost indiscernible ripple of appreciation around the room lord justice sullivan leaned sideways a little to face the witness his face earnest one hand clenched on the beautiful polished surface in front of him mr simmons you may not state that the accused is guilty of having murdered the boy unless you know of your own observation that he did so is that the case did you see him kill walter figgis simmons looked startled he blinked then he went white as the full import of what he had been asked dawned on him no me lud i didnt see it i werent there if i ad been idve said so at the time an mr durban wouldntve needed to ride me like e did i dont know for meself oo killed the poor little devil nor any o them other kids up and down the river what go missing and get beaten or whatever else appens to em rathbone raised his eyebrows are you saying that mr durban appeared to you to be more interested in this lost child than in any other mr simmons damn right e did simmons agreed like a dog with a bone e were couldnt ardly think o nothing else surely he was equally concerned with the theft fraud smuggling and other crimes that happen on the water and dockside rathbone said innocently not that i saw no sir simmons replied always on about phillips and that boy ated him he did wanted to see im anged e said so he glanced up at sullivan and then away again that i eard with me own ears rathbone thanked him and invited tremayne to take his turn hester could think of a dozen things to ask in rebuttal she stared at tremayne as if by force of will she could prompt him into doing so she watched him rise a little of his usual grace lost to tension what had seemed a certainty was slipping out of his hands he looked pale mr simmons he began very politely you say that mr durban gave you no reason for his eagerness to catch whoever abused tortured and then murdered this boy and as you yourself suggest perhaps many others like him simmons shifted his weight uncomfortably no sir e didnt and you found it hard to understand that he should consider the lives of children much more important than the evasion of customs duty on a cask of brandy for example simmons started to speak then changed his mind do you have children mr simmons tremayne inquired gently as one might of a new acquaintance hester held her breath did he did it matter what was tremayne going to make of it at least some of the jurors would have children if not all of them her nails dug into the palms of her hands she found that she was holding her breath no sir simmons answered tremayne smiled very slightly neither does sir oliver perhaps that might explain a great deal it is not everyone who has mrs monks compassion for the injured and the dead who do not belong to their own family or even their own social class there was a distinct rustle in the gallery now the people on either side of hester quite blatantly turned to look at her one even smiled and nodded simmons blushed furiously tremayne wisely hid his victory he inclined his head towards the judge as if to thank him and then returned to his seat rathbone sounded a little less certain as he called his next witness a dockmaster named trenton from the pool of london he testified to durban s friendship over several years with the mudlarks beggars and petty thieves who spent most of their lives at the rivers edge this time rathbone was more careful to allow his witness to express his own opinions tremayne had scored an emotional victory but he was going to find it a great deal more difficult to score another spent time with them trenton said with a slight shrug he was a small squarely built man with a heavy nose and mild manner but under the respect for authority there was considerable strength and more than fifty years of everhardening opinion talked to em gave em advice sometimes even shared is food or gave em the odd sixpence or the like was he looking for information rathbone asked if e was e was a fool trenton answered you get a reputation for being a soft touch like that an youll ave a line o folks from tower bridge to the isle o dogs all ready to tell you anything you want to ear for a penny or two i see then what could he have been doing do you know trenton was well prepared tremayne leaned forward ready to object to speculation but he did not have the opportunity dont know what e was doing he said pushing his lower lip out in an expression of puzzlement never seen another river police nor land neither who spent time with beggars and drifters like e did not with boys like they dont know much an wont tell you anything that matters even if they do how do you know that mr trenton i run a dock sir oliver i ave to know what people are doing on my patch specially if theres a chance its something as they shouldnt i kept an eye on im over the years there arent that many bent river police but its not impossible not that im saying e was mind you he added hastily but i watched thought at first e might be a kidsman a kidsman rathbone inquired although of course he knew the word he asked for the benefit of the jury trenton understood a man who gets kids to do is stealing for im he replied simply mostly its silk handkerchiefs bits o money things like that a good leather purse maybe but e werent of course he shrugged again just river police with more interest in kids than anyone else i see did he ask you about jericho phillips trenton rolled his eyes over and over till i was sick of telling im that as far as i know es just a petty thief a chancer maybe does a bit of smuggling although weve never caught im at it peraps a bit of informing but thats all did mr durban accept that answer trenton s face darkened no e didnt obsession e ad and got worse towards the time e died which was a shame he added quickly thank you rathbone released him tremayne looked indecisive from the moment he stood up his face and his voice reflected exactly the fears that were beginning to touch hester could they have been mistaken about durban had he been a man who committed one marvelous act of nobility in an effort to redeem a life otherwise deeply flawed had they come in at the end and thought all the rest was the same when in fact it was not at all tremayne was floundering and he was acutely aware of it it had been a decade since he had last been so subtly set off balance there was nothing in trenton s evidence to contest nothing he could grasp firmly enough to turn or twist to any other meaning hester wondered if he was beginning to have doubts as well did he wonder if monk had been naive driven by loyalty to a man he had known only a short time a matter of weeks and whose real character he had only guessed at for the first time hester actually entertained the thought for an instant that rathbone could be right yes phillips was an evil man one who preyed on the weaknesses and appetites of others but he might not be guilty of torture or murder as durban had believed or as monk had accepted from him she pushed the thought away refusing to entertain it it was ugly and it was disloyal rathbone resumed the presentation of the defense he called a lighterman who had known durban well and admired him he asked questions gently drawing out pieces of information as if he were aware that the process would sooner or later become painful he was right at the start it was easy merely a pattern of dates and questions asked and answered durban had asked the lighterman about comings and goings on the water mostly of jericho phillips and his boat occasionally of other men who patronized whatever its facilities were they professed that it offered ale and entertainment a simple matter of an evening on the river with refreshment and a little music performed to the taste of whatever audience presented itself lord justice sullivan leaned forward listening intently his face grave did the lighterman hurst know for certain what that entertainment was rathbone continued no he had no personal knowledge at all durban had asked him that many times the answer was always the same he did not know or wish to as far as he was aware the boys could have been there to serve ale wait on tables clear up anything at all it seemed very routine even tedious until hester saw something alter in rathbones stance and a new suppressed energy enter him was durban s interest in phillips consistent from the time it began hurst looked puzzled as if he remembered something odd no it wasnt for several months durban had shown no interest at all as if he had forgotten about him then equally without explanation his interest had resumed again even more fiercely than before his pursuit had become almost savage exceeding his duty he had been seen on the river in all weather even in the small hours of the night when all sane men were in their beds could hurst explain any of this in fact had durban offered any reason for his extraordinary obsession and the erratic manner of his occupation with it no hurst was disillusioned he had no idea tremayne must have known that in questioning him further he would gain nothing and might even lose he declined to end the day rathbone added another member of the river police who had been serving at the wapping station during durban s latter years the man made it quite apparent that he was there against his will his loyalty was to the police in general and to his immediate colleagues in particular he was openly hostile to rathbone and to anyone else who questioned durban s integrity and by implication that of all the police however he was obliged to admit that he knew beyond any doubt at all that towards the end of his life durban had spent the little spare time he had and much of his own money in his endless fruitless pursuit of jericho phillips in spite of his careful wording or perhaps because of it it made durban sound obsessed to the point of madness suddenly phillips as unpleasant as he was appeared to be the victim hester saw several confused faces in the gallery around her even glances towards the figure of phillips as he was escorted from the dock back down to the cells for the night now they were curious and not as certain of his guilt as they had been even a few hours ago she left the courtroom feeling betrayed she moved through the open doors into the hallway beyond not literally buffeted by the crowd but it seemed as if they pressed in on her from all sides they were puffed up with their own convictions there to see and hear unaffected by what anyone believed she cared passionately she cared whether durban was the hero monk believed him to be both because he was one of the few men monk admired and also because monk himself had founded his career in the thames police on finishing his predecessors last case it was his gift of gratitude to a man he could thank in no other way she could see now that they had both allowed it to become too important all the rage they felt towards everyone who had beaten neglected or abused a child had centered on phillips perhaps that was unfair and it was that thought reflected in other peoples eyes that humiliated and confused her now she came facetoface with margaret rathbone on the steps as she was leaving she had turned for an instant uncertainly and margaret was only a couple of paces behind her margaret stopped but she did not lower her eyes there was an embarrassed silence hester had always been the leader she was the one with the medical experience the knowledge she had been to the crimea margaret had never been out of england except for family holidays to france carefully chaperoned hester had watched margaret fall in love with rathbone and try so hard to win him they had said little neither was someone who discussed their deepest fears or dreams but there had been a wealth of silent understanding between them they had nursed the sick and dying together and faced the truth of violence and crime now for the first time they were on different sides and there was nothing to say that would not make it worse rathbone had attacked hester on the stand personally and stripped the covering decencies from her beliefs by revealing those she had trusted above all he had exposed monk to disillusion and to the appearance of having let down his colleagues who had followed him into the battle margarets loyalty was committed to rathbone she had no room to ask anything or to yield in her position the lines were set margaret hesitated as if she would smile say something offer commiseration then she knew that everything could be misunderstood and she changed her mind hester made it easier for her by turning away again and continuing down the steps margaret would catch a cab hester took the public bus to the ferry across the river then walked up to paradise place and let herself in through the front door the house was warm in the summer sun and quiet they were close to southwark park and the distant sound of laughter carried through the trees she spent a wretched evening alone there had been a bad incident on the river on limehouse reach and by the time monk came home he was too tired to talk about anything she did not have the opportunity to discuss the days events with him rathbone also had an acutely uncomfortable evening in spite of margarets unconditional praise of his skill and surprisingly of his morality of course it disturbs you she said to him gently after dinner they were sitting opposite each other with the french windows open again onto the quiet garden with its birdsong and the slight rustling of leaves in the late sunset wind no one likes to show up the weakness of their friends especially in public she continued but it was not your choice that they go after jericho phillips it would be totally wrong for you to refuse to defend him or anyone else on the grounds that you have friends in the prosecution if it were right then anyone could refuse to defend any case they might lose or that might challenge their opinions or even their social standing no man of honor does only what is comfortable to him her eyes were bright and there was warm color in her skin it gave rathbone pleasure that she admired him so genuinely but it was the guilty pleasure of stolen fruit or at least of that obtained dishonestly he struggled for words to explain it to her but it was too complicated to frame and he knew from her smile that she was not really listening he ended up saying nothing and was ashamed of himself rathbone began the next days proceedings with what he intended to be his coup de grâce he had no choice now but to go ahead with it it was inconceivable that he would do less than his best because even in the defense of a man like jericho phillips that would be to betray every principle that he believed in above the political battles the good or bad governments the judiciary at its most brilliant corrupt or incompetent the impartiality of the lawand its power to deal with all people without fear or favorwas the bedrock upon which every civilized nation depended when lawyers made judgments the jury of the common man was betrayed and in the end would become extinct the law itself would pass from the people to the few who held power there would no longer be a check on their prejudices or in time on their ability to remain above the tides of corruption bribery the threat of loss or the hope of gain he now found himself in a position in which he must call william monk to the stand and force him to testify against the man to whom he owed the best opportunity of his life they faced each other in a silent court this might well prove to be the last day of a trial that had begun as a mere formality but was now a very real battle in which it was even possible that jericho phillipss fight for his life could end in victory people in the gallery were straining to look at him he had assumed a sudden public stature that was both frightening and fascinating monk had already been identified both the jury and the spectators had heard of him from earlier witnesses now they stared in sharp interest as the questions began i did not call you earlier commander monk rathbone began because you are familiar with only part of this case and mr orme was involved from the beginning when mr durban was first called to the discovery of the boys body he walked elegantly across the open space as if he were very much at ease only someone who knew him as well as monk did would see that his shoulders were stiff and he did not carry his hands quite naturally however he continued turning to face the witness stand certain facts have come to our attention that suggest unusual elements with which you could help us he waited for dramatic effect not because there was any question in his words tremayne shifted in his seat as though he could not find a comfortable position this case had been dropped mr monk rathbones voice was suddenly challenging why did you choose to reopen it monk had expected exactly this question because i came across a record of it in mr durbans papers and the fact that it was still unsolved bothered me he replied rathbones eyebrows rose indeed then i assume you pursued all of mr durbans other unsolved cases with equal zeal i would like to solve them all monk replied there were not many a few minor thefts one to do with the smuggling of half a dozen kegs of brandy the fencing of stolen china and ornaments a couple of incidents of public drunkenness that ended in fights a few broken windows the murder of children comes before all those he too paused for effect and smiled very slightly ill attend to the rest if i have time rathbones face changed slightly acknowledging that he had an adversary not to be trifled with of course that takes priority he agreed changing his angle of attack with barely a trace of awkwardness it seems from what we have heard that it comes before a great many things in your estimation you appear to have read mr durbans notes with great attention why is that monk had not foreseen the question phrased quite that way i have held mr durbans position since shortly after his death i thought i had a great deal to learn from his experience and what he had written about how modest of you rathbone observed so you admired mr durban a great deal there was only one possible answer i did why rathbone asked innocently monk had opened the way to such a question now he had to answer it he had no time to concoct a reply that was careful or measured to safeguard the case because he held command without abuse of his authority he said his men both liked and respected him for the short time that i knew him before he gave his life in the call of duty i found him to have humor kindness and integrity he nearly said something about hating injustice and stopped himself just in time a fine eulogy for a man who is not here to speak for himself rathbone said he certainly has a loyal friend in you mr monk you say that as if loyalty to a friend were an offense monk retaliated just a shade too quickly betraying his anger rathbone stopped turned slowly towards monk up in the witness stand and smiled it is mr monk when it places itself before loyalty to truth and to the law it is an understandable quality perhaps even likableexcept of course to the man who is accused of a hideous crime so that one friend may pay a debt to another there was a rustle of sharpened interest around the room one or two of the jurors looked anxious lord justice sullivans face was carefully expressionless tremayne rose to his feet but with anger rather than confidence profound as sir olivers philosophy may be my lord it does not appear to contain a question you are quite correct sullivan agreed but with reluctance such observations more properly belong in your club sir oliver you called mr monk to the stand therefore i assume you have something to ask him please proceed with it my lord rathbone said masking only the slightest irritation he looked back up at monk what was your own occupation when you first met mr durban i was a private agent of inquiry monk answered he could guess where rathbone was leading but he could not avoid going with him did that fit you for taking over mr durbans position as commander of the river police at wapping i dont think so but i had been in the metropolitan police before that surely rathbone was not going to bring up his loss of memory he was seized with a sudden cold uncertainty that he might but that was not where rathbone struck why did you leave the metropolitan police he asked sullivan was impassive but as if he were containing his emotion with difficulty his color was high his fist tightly closed on the bench sir oliver are you questioning mr monks professional ability his reputation or his honesty he asked none of those my lord irritation marked rathbones face now his hands were closed tight and hard i believe mr durban had leadership skills that mr monk intensely admired because he had failed to exhibit them himself in the past mr durban in choosing him as his successor gave him the opportunity to try a second time which is a chance few men receive mr durban also expressed a confidence in him that he did not have in himself i will show that mr monks sense of debt to durban drove him to exceed his authority and his usual judgment in pursuit of jericho phillips and that he did so to pay what he perceived as a debt he also desired profoundly to earn the respect of his men by vindicating durban s original pursuit of the murderer tremayne shot to his feet his face filled with consternation forgetting even to address the judge that is a very large and rather rash assumption sir oliver rathbone turned to sullivan with an air of innocence my client is accused of a very terrible crime my lord if he is found guilty he will be hanged no lengths within the law are too great to make certain that justice is done and that we do not also allow our emotions our pity or our revulsion to dictate our thoughts and overwhelm our reason we too wish to see someone pay but it must be the right someone of course it must sullivan said forcefully proceed sir oliver but get to the point rathbone bowed very slightly thank you my lord mr monk did you follow durban s notes to retrace his original detection or did you accept his observations and deductions as sufficient i followed them again and questioned the same people again as far as i could monk answered with a tone suggesting that the answer was obvious but in each case you already knew what evidence you were looking for rathbone pointed out for example mr durban began with an unidentified corpse and had to do whatever he could to learn who the boy was you began knowing that mr durban believed it to be walter figgis you had only to prove that he was right those are not the same courses of action at all several jurors fidgeted unhappily they could see the plain difference are you sure you were not merely confirming what you already wished to believe rathbone hammered the point home yes i am sure monk said decisively rathbone smiled his head high the light gleaming on his fair hair how do you identify the body of a boy who has been in the water for some days mr monk he challenged surely it is severely changed the flesh he did not continue the mood of the court altered the reality of death had entered again and the battle of words seemed faintly irrelevant of course it is changed monk said softly what had once been a bruised burned and underfed boy but very much alive had become so much cold meat like something the butcher discarded but that is what we had to work with it still mattered that we learn who he was he leaned forward a little over the railings of the stand he still had hair and height shape of face possibly some clothes left and quite a bit of skin enough to guess his coloring and of course his teeth peoples teeth are different there were gasps of breath drawn in sharply more than one woman stifled a sob monk did not hesitate to be graphic in this case durban had written down that the boy had the marks of burns old and new on the inside of his arms and thighs the full obscenity of it should be known no one burns themselves in those places by accident rathbones face was pale his body awkward where he stood that is vile mr monk he said softly but it is not proof of identity it is a beginning monk contradicted him an undernourished child who has been tortured and has begun to change from a boy into a man and no one has complained of his disappearance that narrows down the places to look very much indeed thank god durban made several drawings of what the boy probably looked like he was good at it he showed them up and down the riverbank particularly to people who might have seen a beggar a petty thief or a mudlark he assumed he was one of such a group i dont know but it was the obvious place to begin and as it turned out the right place ah yes rathbone nodded somebody recognized one of these drawings that durban did from what was left of the boy you mentioned hair skin coloring to some extent shape of skull and so on correct me if i am mistaken mr monk but could not such bare characteristics produce at least a thousand different sets of features monk kept his temper knowing that rathbone was trying to bait him of course but desperate as the state of many children is there are not a thousand boys of that age missing at one time along the bank of the river and unreported so you fitted this tragic corpse to the face of one boy that a mudlark said was missing and you identified the body as that of walter figgis rathbones eyes were wide a very slight smile on his lips monk swallowed his sarcasm he knew he was playing to an audience who was watching the shadows on his face hearing the slightest inflection of his voice no sir oliver commander durban thought it very likely that the corpse was that of figgis when we found obscene photographs of figgis taken when he was alive they were identified by those who knew him and commander durban then matched them to the corpse he had unusual ears and one of them had not been destroyed by the water and the creatures in it who feed on the dead rathbone was forced to accept it tremayne smiled his body relaxing a little in relief sullivan sat forward a little at his high bench turning first to rathbone then to tremayne then back again rathbone moved on did you see theseobscenephoto graphs yes they were in durban s papers monk could not prevent the violence of his disgust from showing he tried to he knew he should keep control this was evidence only facts should matter but still his body was shaking and he felt sweat break out on his skin the faces were perfectly clear even three of the burns we found two of them on the same places and the third rathbone asked very gently that part of him had been eaten away monks voice trembled thick with the horror and misery of durban s words on the page in jagged writing creating a picture of disintegration and loss the vision of tragedy of bestiality that you call up is almost beyond bearing rathbone acknowledged i do not wonder that you find it hard to speak of or that mr durban put in endless hours of his own time and indeed also his own money to bring to justice whoever did this would it be true to say that you felt just as deeply as he did he shrugged very slightly or perhaps you did not there was only one answer possible rathbone had chosen his words with an artists precision every eye in the court was on monk of course i felt as deeply he said commander durban had given his life to save others rathbone went on with some reverence and he had recommended you to take over his position that is perhaps the highest mark of trust one man can offer another would it be true to say that you owe him a debt of both honor and gratitude again there was only one possible reply yes i do there was a sigh and a rustle of agreement around the room and you will do everything you can to honor it and bring pride to the men of the river police who are now in your command and earn their loyalty as durban did rathbone asked although it was barely a question the answer spoke for itself of course especially completing this task of durban s in the way he would have wished perhaps you would even give him the credit for its solution yes monk said without hesitation rathbone was satisfied he thanked monk and returned to his seat with a gesture of invitation to tremayne tremayne hesitated only too clearly seeking any way to regain the balance then he declined perhaps he thought that anything monk might add would only raise the emotion still higher which would make it even worse monk was excused in the early afternoon tremayne gave the prosecutions summary his movements were graceful his voice smooth and confident but monk knew it was a superb piece of acting the man should have been on the stage he even had the striking looks for it but he was laboring against the tide and he had to know it he mentioned durban s original deductions only in passing concentrating on monks taking up of the trail again he avoided the horror of it whenever he could telling instead the detail of monks piecing together the proof of figs identity and the links that connected him to jericho phillips and the trade in exploitation and pornography he could not mention the photographs because they had not been produced only referred to by monk as evidence they did not exist as rathbone would have instantly pointed out he also spoke of hesters part in connecting phillips to the trade that satisfies the sexual appetites of those with money to pay for whatever they wanted using the poor willing or unwilling who had no other way to survive when he finally sat down the jury was wrung with emotions of anger and pity and would clearly have been willing themselves to tie a noose around phillipss neck rathbone stood up he looked very somber as if he too were shaken by what he had heard what happened to this boy is appalling he began there was absolute silence in the room and he had no need to raise his voice it should shock all of us and i believe it has he stood very still awed by the horror of it the fact that he was a child of poverty and ignorance is completely irrelevant the fact that he may have made his living at first by begging or stealing then was very probably forced into acts of the utmost degradation by men in the grip of deviant appetites is also irrelevant every human being deserves justice at the very least if possible they deserve mercy and honor as well there was a low rumble of assent the jurors faces were filled with emotion they sat huddled forward bodies tight and uncomfortable on the bench sullivan seemed frozen his cheeks dark with color what we have heard is sufficient to stir the passions the rage the pity of every decent person man or woman rathbone continued what would you think of a woman like hester monk who spends her time and her means laboring to help the sick the destitute the forgotten and the outcast of our society if she had no pity for this misused child if she does not fight for him then who will if she is not moved to fury and to weeping on his behalf what manner of woman is she i am bold enough to say that she would not be a woman that i wish to know there were strong murmurs of agreement rathbone was speaking to them intimately now not a soul moved or made the slightest rustle and commander durban who saw the boys dead body pulled from where it was tangled in the ropes of the lighter mangled and unrecognizable who saw the marks of torture on the dead flesh he gestured delicately with his hands what sort of a guardian of our law would he be had he not sworn to spend his professional life seeking the creature who brought this about in his case he spent his personal time as well and his own money to seek justice and it seems to me to put an end to such things happening to other boys as well do we want policemen who are not moved by such horror up in the dock for the first time jericho phillips stirred anxiously his eyes flickered with panic and his body was hunched forward as far as his manacles would allow and mr monk is a worthy successor to durban rathbone continued he has the same passion the same dedication the driving will that compels him to spend night and day searching for clues answers proof anywhere he can he will not rest indeed he cannot rest until he has captured the man responsible and taken him to the very foot of the gallows several jurors were nodding now lord justice sullivan looked concerned on the brink of going so far as to interrupt him could rathbone conceivably have forgotten which side he was on let us consider these excellent people one by one rathbone said reasonably and mr orme as well of course we too i believe wish that justice may be served completely and irrevocably that was almost a question although he smiled very slightly our position is different from theirs in that they provide evidence to be considered while we reach a conclusion that is irrevocable if we find that jericho phillips is guilty within three weeks he will be hanged and cannot ever be brought back to this world if on the other hand we find that he is not guilty then he cannot be tried for this crime again gentlemen our decision allows no room for passion no matter how understandable how human how worthy of the noblest pity for the victims of poverty disease or inequality we have not the luxury that others will have after us to alter our mistakes or correct our misjudgments we have in this room only that final judgment at the bar of god before whom we will all stand in eternity we must be right he held up his hand in a closed fist not of any kind of threat but of an unbreakable grasp we are not partisan he looked at them one after another and then quailed a little we must not be to allow emotion of liking or disliking of horror or pity or selfindulgence of fear or favor for anyonehe sliced the airor any other human tenderness to sway our decision is to deny justice and never believe that the drama here is our purposeit is not our purpose is the measured and equal justice for all people alive or dead good or evil strong or weak he hesitated beautiful or hideous the question is not whether commander durban was a good man even a noble one it is whether he was right in his collection of and deduction from evidence regarding the murder of walter figgis did he allow his human passions to direct his course his dream of justice to hasten his judgments his revulsion at the crime to make him too quick to grasp at the solution you need to weigh in your minds why it was that he stopped his pursuit of phillips and then started it again his notes do not say why do they not you need to ask that and not flinch from the answer he turned paced back and then faced the jury again he chose william monk to succeed him why he is a good detective no one knows that better than i but did durban who knew him only a few months choose him because he saw in monk a man of profound convictions like his own of pity for the weak rage against the abusive and an unstoppable dedication a man who would seek to close his own unfinished cases out of honor and to pay a personal debt the jurors eyes were fixed unwaveringly on rathbone he knew it you must judge the power and the compulsion that drove monk to follow precisely the course that durban had taken he told them you have listened to mrs monk and must have formed some opinion of her courage and her passion this is a woman in the same mold as florence nightingale a woman who has walked the fields of battle among the dead and the dying and has not fainted or wept or turned away but has steeled her courage and made her decisions with knife and needle bandages and water she has saved lives what would she not do to bring to justice the man who abused and murdered childrenincluding a boy so like the very mudlark she has all but adopted as her own he lowered his voice are you prepared to hang jericho phillips in the certainty beyond any reasonable doubt that those passionate justifiably enraged people have made no error in their detached and analytical reasoning and have found the right man among all the teeming many who make their livings on this busiest river in the world he stood motionless in the center of the floor if you are not certain then for all our sakes you must find him not guilty above all for the sake of the law which must protect the weakest the poorest and the least loved of all of us as much as it protects the strong the beautiful and the good if you do not then it becomes no protection at all simply the instrument of our power and our prejudice gentlemen i leave the judgment to rest not with your pity or your outrage but with your honor to the sacred principle of justice by which one day we will all be judged he sat down in total silence not another person moved even to rustle in their seats after a moment in a hushed voice lord justice sullivan invited the jury to retire to consider its verdict they came back within the hour looking at no one they were unhappy but they were resolute sullivan asked their foreman to speak for them not guilty he said in a low clear voice four sitting in the courtroom monk was stunned beside him hester was rigid he could feel it as if he were touching her although actually there were several inches between them then he heard her move and knew she had turned to look at him what could he say to her he had been so certain of the verdict that he had not even suggested that the prosecution charge phillips with the attempted murder of the ferryman now as if he had dissolved into the air phillips had escaped they walked out of the courtroom and through the crowds in silence then instead of looking for a bus as if by unspoken agreement they went along ludgate hill and left down to blackfriars bridge the river was bright in the low lateafternoon sun pleasure boats had bright flags up and streamers rippling in the wind the sound of a barrel organ drifted from the bank somewhere just out of sight they were less than a mile upstream from the southwark bridge they walked over slowly watching the bright wake of boats below them and caught a bus on the farther bank they sat still without speaking until they alighted a quarter of a mile from paradise place and walked uphill a longer way around than they needed for the pleasure of the air the park was quiet a faint breeze moving the leaves like someone breathing softly in their sleep half a dozen times monk had wanted to speak but each time the words he had been going to say seemed clumsy like an attempt at selfjustification what did she think of him rathbone had called him as a witness he must have counted on monk saying and doing exactly what he had did he know i was going to do that he said at last as they passed under one of the towering trees the shade deep beneath the boughs am i so predictable or did he manipulate me into it she thought before she answered both i think she said finally thats his skill to ask the question in such a way that you can really give only one answer he painted a picture of durban as overemotional and then asked if you cared just as much you could hardly say that you didnt she was frowning i understand the principle that the law must be based on evidence not love or hate thats hard but its true you cant condemn him because you dont like him but i dont understand why he chose this case to demonstrate it i could have sworn that he would find phillips as repulsive as the rest of us do it seems she searched for the right word perverse it solidified monks thoughts yes it does and that is not the man he used to be is it they crossed the road and walked side by side up towards paradise place no she said at last as they reached their own door and he took out the key to let them in it smelled closed up in the warmth of the day but the faint aroma of lavender and beeswax was pleasing as was the cleanness of freshly laundered linen hanging on the airing rail in the kitchen there was a maid who came twice a week for the heavy work and she had obviously been there today do you think hes changed as much as it seems hester stopped and turned to face him he did not know how to answer he realized only now how much he had liked rathbone in spite of the difference between them if rathbone no longer held the beliefs he used to then monk had also lost something i dont know he said honestly she nodded lips closed tightly eyes suddenly sad she walked through to the kitchen and he followed sitting on one of the hardbacked chairs as she picked up the kettle and filled it before setting it on the stove he knew the change in rathbone would hurt her also even more than it would him people did change when they married sometimes only a little but it could be a great deal he was different since marrying hester although he believed that was entirely for the good he did not like to admit it but looking back he had formerly been harder to please quicker to lose his temper and to see the ugly or the weak in anyone happiness had made him kinder that was something to be grateful for though not proud of he should have managed it anyway pride might have been justified if he had been gentler without his own inner peace or safety from the wounds of loneliness if this change in rathbone were to do with margaret then it would be an even deeper loss to hester because margaret had been her friend also they had worked hard together shared pain and fear and more than a little of each others dreams he watched hester now as she worked quietly at preparing supper it was simple but then in the warmth of summer cold food was not only easier it was pleasanter it was supremely comfortable looking at her as she turned from one bench to another finding what she wanted chopping slicing carrying her hands were slender and quick and she moved with grace some men might not have thought her beautiful in fact he had not himself when they first knew each other she was too thin far richer curves were fashionable and a face with less passion or strength and with more demureness and an inclination to obedience but he knew her in all her moods and the play of laughter and sorrow in her features the flare of anger or the quick pain of contrition and the stab of pity were all familiar to him he knew how powerfully they worked in her now the shallower emotions of bland pretty women seemed empty leaving him starving for reality what did margaret rathbone offer compared with hester what did she want that had made rathbone defend jericho phillips so brilliantly and monk would be dishonest were he to say that it was less than brilliant rathbone had turned an untenable situation into one of dignity even some kind of honor at least on the surface but what about afterwards what was underneath the momentary victory in the courtroom the amazement of the crowd the admiration for his skills what about the question why who had paid him to do this if it were a favor then to whom who could ask something or offer something that could be wanted by a man such as rathbone used to be in the past hester monk and he had fought great battles that had taxed every ounce of their courage imagination and intelligence because they believed in the causes if rathbone were honest what did he believe of this phillips was an evil man even rathbone had not said that he was innocent only that they had failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt the defense was based on a legality not a weighing of the facts and certainly not a moral judgment if rathbone really loved the law above all else then monk had misjudged him the entire time they had known each other and that was not only an ugly thought but a sad one surely rathbones motivation had to be something better than money monk refused to believe it was as simple and as grubby as that the food was ready and they sat down to eat it in silence it was not uncompanionable they were each lost in their own thoughts but they concerned the same subject he looked at her eyes momentarily and knew that as she knew it of him neither of them was ready yet to find the words they had not obtained justice no matter what rathbone had claimed the use of the law had enabled a deeply guilty man to go free and to repeat his offenses as often as he chose the message to the people was that skill wins not honor and monk himself was as much to blame as rathbone for that if he had done his job more completely if he had been as clever as rathbone then phillips would be on his way to the gallows in taking it for granted that because he was right he had some kind of invulnerability against defeat he had been careless and he had let down orme who had worked so hard and who had trusted him and he had let down durban as well this was to have been an act of gratitude the one thing he could give him even beyond the graveto do his job honorably and by bringing phillips to face trial and then be acquitted he had freed him from ever being charged with that crime again which was worse than not having caught him all the river police were betrayed in that the confidence the inner peace that he had won so hard and treasured so dearly was slipping out of his grasp like water through his fingers one day it was there and then he looked and it was draining away while he was helpless to stop it it was the cold truth he was not the man he had begun to hope and believe he was he had failed jericho phillips was guilty at the very least of child abuse and pornography andmonk had no doubtalso of murder it was monks carelessness his incompetence to make sure of every single detail to check and check again to prove everything that had allowed rathbone to paint him as driven more by emotion than reason so phillips slipped through the blurring of doubts and escaped he looked up at hester i cant leave it like this he said aloud i cant for myself i cant for the river police she put her spoon down and looked at him steadily almost unblinking what can you do you cant try him again he drew his breath in sharply to respond then saw the honesty and gentleness in her eyes i know that and we were so certain of convicting him for figgiss murder we didnt even charge him with assaulting the ferryman if we try that now itll look as if were only doing it because we failed hell say he slipped it was an accident he was fighting for his life itll make us look even more incompetent she bit her lip then this time we need to know what it is we are trying to doexactly seeing the truth is not enoughis it that was a challenge an invitation to face something far beyond the bitterness of the day how practical she was but then to nurse she had to be the treatment of the illnesses of the body was above all practical there was no time no room for mistakes or excuses it demanded a very immediate kind of courage a faith in the value of trying no matter what the result fail this time you must still give everything you have next time and the time after and after that she had stopped eating her plum pie waiting for an answer if i learn enough about him i shall prove him guilty of something he replied even if it doesnt hang him a good stretch in the coldbath fields would save a score of boys from abuse maybe a hundred by the time he gets out a lot of things could be different maybe he would even die in there people do she smiled then well start again from the beginning she ate her last mouthful and rose to her feet but a cup of tea first if were going to sit up all night well need it he felt a sudden wave of gratitude choke him too much to answer her he bent and concentrated on finishing his own pie afterwards he fetched durban s notes again and side by side they spread them all over the table the seats and the floor of the parlor and read every one of them again for the first time monk realized just how patchy they were some were full of description seemingly no detail omitted others were so brief as to be little more than words jotted down as reminders of whole trains of thought never completed in some the writing was done in such haste that it was barely legible and from the jagged forms of the letters and the heaviness of the strokes it had been in the heat of great emotion do you know what this means hester asked him holding up a torn piece of paper with the words was it money what else written across it with a different pen i dont know he admitted he had found other notes scribbled sentences unanswered questions that he had assumed referred to phillips but perhaps did not he had reread the notes on all other cases at the time both of durban s and those kept in the station by anyone else he had checked all the prosecutions recorded in the station archives too hester was still watching him he thought he knew what she was going to say if not with this piece of paper then with the next or the one after it could be something to do with his own life he said to her at last personal i hadnt realized how little i really know about him he remembered back to those few hectic days together searching for the crew of the maude idris believing they were ashore somewhere in the teeming docks and knowing they were infected and dying he and durban had worked until they were so exhausted they slept where they collapsed they woke again after an hour or two and staggered on he had never had a more desperate or terrible case and yet there had been a feeling of companionship whose memory still made him smile durban had liked him and he did not know anyone else who had done so with instant and unquestioning honesty if he had had any other friend like that it had been in that huge part of the past he could no longer remember he had sudden moments of light on the shadow so brief as to give him only an image never a story judging from what he had heard and deduced of who he was the intelligence and the ruthlessness the relentless energy that drove him even durban would not have liked him then certainly runcorn had not and neither hester nor oliver rathbone had known him hester might have tamed him but without that searing vulnerability of his confusion and the fear of his own guilt in joscelyn grays death why would she have bothered he had little humanity to offer until he was forced to look within himself and examine the worst he was glad durban had known only the man he had become and not the original what lay in the spaces around his mental construction of durban that monk did not know was the compulsion to catch jericho phillips going to force him to intrude into the areas of durban s life that durban had chosen to keep private perhaps because there was pain there failure old wounds he needed to forget i can remember his voice he said aloud meeting her steady eyes his face the way he walked what made him laugh what he liked to eat he loved to see dawn on the river and watch the early ferries start out across the water he used to walk alone and watch the play of light and shadow the mist evaporating like silk gauze he liked to see the forest of spars when we had a lot of tall ships in the pool he liked the sound and smells of the wharves especially when the spice ships were unloading he liked to listen to the cry of gulls and men talking all the different foreign languages as if the whole earth with its wealth and variety had come here to london he never said so but i think he was proud to be a londoner he stopped his emotion too strong for the moment then he drew in a deep breath i didnt want to talk about my past and i didnt care about his for any of us its who you are today that matters hester smiled looked away then back again at him durban was a real person william she said gently good and bad wise and stupid picking out bits to like isnt really liking at all it isnt friendship its comfort for you youre better than that whether he was or not are your dreams or durban s memory worth more than the lives of other boys like fig she bit her lip or scuff he winced he had been lulled into forgetting how honest she could be even if her words were harsh i know its intrusive to examine the whole man she said even indecent when hes dead and cannot defend himself or explain or even repent but the alternative is to let it go and isnt that worse it was a bitter choice but if durban had been careless or even dishonest that had to be faced yes he conceded pass me the papers well sort them into those we understand those we dont and those i expect we never will ill get that bastard phillips however long or hard the trail i made the mistake and ill undo it we did she corrected him her face pinched a little i let oliver paint me as an overemotional woman whose childlessness led her to hysterical and illthoughtout judgments he saw the pain in her face the selfmockery and for that he would not forgive rathbone until he had paid the last ounce and maybe not even then that was something else she had lost the real and precious friendship with rathbone like monk she had no close loving family left she had lost a brother in the crimea her father to suicide and her mother to a broken heart her one surviving brother was a stiff and distant man not really a friend one day when he had time monk must go and visit the sister he barely remembered he did not think they had been close even when his memory had been whole and that was probably his fault he put the papers down and leaned over touching hester gently then drawing her closer to him and kissing her then closer again theres tomorrow he whispered let it befor now monk rose early and went to buy the newspapers he considered not taking them home so hester would not see how bad they were and then discarded the idea she did not need his protection and probably would not wish for it it would not mean tenderness to her as much as exclusion and after both the honesty and the passion of the previous night she deserved better from him he thought with a smile that perhaps he was beginning to understand women or at least one woman there was nothing else to smile at when he sat at the breakfast table opposite her each with their newspapers propped open in front of them the full ugliness of the situation was extremely clear durban was drawn as incompetent a man whose death saved him from the indignity of having been removed from office for at best a personal vengeance against a particularly grubby criminal on the river at worst a seriously questionable professional ethic monk himself was painted as little better an amateur drafted in over the heads of more experienced men he was out of his depth and beyond his skill he had been trying too hard to pay a debt that he imagined he owed a friend but whom in truth he barely knew hester came off more lightly at first glance she was portrayed as overemotional driven by loyalty to her husband and a foolish attachment to a class of child her thwarted maternal instincts had fastened on and caused her to reach out and cherish quite inappropriately but from a woman denied her natural role in society by a misguided devotion to charitable causes and a certain belligerence that made her unattractive to decent men of her own station what else could one expect it should be a lesson to all young ladies of good breeding to remain in the paths that nature and society had set for them only then might they expect fulfillment in life it was immeasurably condescending when hester read it she used some language about the writer and his antecedents that she had learned in her army days after several minutes she looked nervously at monk and apologized concerned in case she had shocked him he grinned at her possibly a little bleakly because the remarks about her had stung him perhaps even more than they had hurt her youll have to tell me what that means he responded i think i may have use for some of those expressions myself she colored deeply and looked away but the tension eased out of her body and her hands unknotted in her lap the worst thing in the papers actually was a single line suggesting almost as an afterthought that possibly the river police had outlived their usefulness perhaps the time had come for them to relinquish any separate identity and simply come under the command of whatever local force was nearest they had so badly mishandled the case that jericho phillips were he guilty had escaped the noose forever at least for the murder of walter figgis he was now free to continue his trade unmolested it made a mockery of the law and that could not be permitted no matter which wellintentioned but incompetent officer had to be dismissed a hot tight resolution settled in hester to prove them wrong but immeasurably more important than that was to prove monk right but she was realistic enough to know that that was not necessarily possible she had no doubt at all that phillips was capable of murder or even that he had committed it if not of fig then of others but the truth was that in their outrage and their certainty they had been careless and they had forgotten the precision of the law when used by someone like oliver rathbone and that was another different kind of pain it was less urgent a wide blind ache that intruded into all sorts of other areas of life darkening and hurting the only way to begin again was with her own investigation which meant at the clinic and of course that also meant seeing margaret hester had liked margaret from the first time they had met when margaret had been shy and wounded from the repeated humiliation of her mother constantly trying to marry her off to someone suitableaccording to her own assessment not margarets of course to margarets mortification when they had encountered rathbone at some ball or other mrs ballinger had praised margarets virtue to him in front of margaret herself with the alltooobvious intent of engaging rathbones matrimonial interest hester understood with sharp compassion she would never forget her own familys similar attempts on her behalf it had made her feel like jetsam to be cast overboard at the first opportunity her acute understanding of margarets situation had forged a bond between them margaret had found purpose and freedom working in the clinic and even a sense of her own worth which no one else had given her or could now take away then rathbone had realized that he really did love her kindness had nothing to do with it he was not rescuing her at all it was his privilege to earn her love in return now with the acquittal of jericho phillips hesters closeness with the rathbones was gone too tarnished and made uncomfortable the long bus ride came to an end and hester walked the short distance along portpool lane under the huge shadow of the brewery she went through the door of the rambling tenement houses that were now connected inside to form one large clinic where the sick and injured would be treated lodged and nursed if necessary they were even operated on there if emergency required it and the procedure was comparatively slight such as the amputation of a finger or toe the setting of bones or the stitching of knife wounds once or twice there had been the removal of bullets and once the amputation of a gangrenous foot the extraction of splinters of various kinds the repair of dislocations the occasional difficult birth and the nursing of bronchitis fever pneumonia and consumption were usual in their daily work more than one woman had died of a bungled abortion beyond repair even after their most exhaustive and desperate efforts to save her there was too much shared triumph and loss to let go of friendship easily but as hester went in through the front door and bessie greeted her she felt none of her usual anticipation of warmth she responded and then asked bessie about the previous two days happenings when she had been occupied in court and could not be there of course bessie knew why she had been absent as they all did and telling them the outcome was not something she was looking forward to like drinking castor oil it was better done swiftly we lost she said before bessie could ask phillips got away with it bessie was a large woman who wore her hair screwed back fiercely and gripped by pins so tightly hester had wondered how she could bear it bessie looked even angrier than usual but her eyes were oddly gentle i know that she said tartly that lawyer twisted everything to make it look like yer fault i eard already that was a complication hester had not even thought of divided loyalties in the clinic more bitter medicine to take her chest hurt with the tightness of her breath that was sir olivers job bessie we should have got our evidence tight enough so that he couldnt we werent sufficiently careful yer just gonna let it go then bessie challenged her disbelief pity and hurt crowding her face all at once hester swallowed no im going to go back to the beginning and start again bessie flashed a brilliant smile then it disappeared so rapidly it could have been an illusion good then yerll be needin me an the rest of us ter keep comin ere yes please i would appreciate that very much bessie grunted lady rathbone is in the kitchen givin orders i spect she added an squeakys in the office countin money she was watching hester carefully judging her reaction thank you hester replied with a face as devoid of expression as she could manage and went to get the encounter done with as soon as possible besides she needed to speak to squeaky robinson privately and at some length she swallowed hard and walked along the uneven passage with its twists and its steps up and down until she reached the kitchen it was a large room originally intended to serve a family and it had been added to when the two houses had been turned into one she smiled with bitter humor when she remembered how rathbone had exercised legal skill and some considerable guile in maneuvering squeaky into yielding his ownership of the brothels and then taking on the bookkeeping of his own premises as a shelter for the very people he had once owned rathbone had left squeaky no acceptable choice it had been wildly daring and from rathbones point of view totally against the spirit of the establishment he had spent his adult life serving it had also brought him acute moral and emotional pleasure but then hester had also allowed squeaky little choice in his decision or as little as she could manage now she was at the kitchen door her quick light step on the wooden boards had alerted margaret to her coming margaret turned with a vegetable knife in her hand at home she had servants for everything here she could put her hand to any task that required attention there was no one else in the room hester was not sure if it would have been easier or harder had there been good morning margaret said quietly she stood motionless her shoulders square chin a little high eyes direct in that one look hester knew that she was not going to apologize or offer even the suggestion however tacit that the verdict of the trial had been unjust she was prepared to defend rathbone to the hilt had she any idea why he had chosen to champion jericho phillips from the angle of her head the unwavering stare and the slight rigidity of her smile hester guessed that she did not good morning she replied politely how are our stores do we need flour or oatmeal not for three or four days margaret said if the woman with the knife wound in her arm goes home tomorrow we might last longer unless of course we get anyone else in bessie brought some ham bones this morning and claudine brought a string of onions and the bones from a saddle of mutton we are doing well i think we should use what money we have for lye carbolic vinegar and a few more bandages but see what you think yourself there was no need for hester to check that would have made the most delicate of implications that she did not believe margaret capable before the phillips affair neither of them would have thought such conspicuous courtesy necessary they discussed the medical supplies simple as they were alcohol for cleaning wounds and instruments cotton pads thread bandages salve laudanum quinine for fevers fortified wines to strengthen and warm the cautious politeness was in the air like a bereavement hester was relieved to escape to the room where squeaky robinson the shorttempered muchaggrieved exbrothelkeeper was doing the accounts and guarding every farthing from frivolous and unnecessary expenditure one would have thought he had labored for it personally rather than received it through margaret from the charitable of the city he looked up from his table as she closed the door behind her his sharp slightly lopsided face under its long motheatenlooking hair was full of sympathy made a mess of it he observed without specifying whom he meant pity that bastard shouldve ad is neck stretched an no mistake the fact we got a lot o money int much comfort is it not today anyow mebbe termorrer itll feel good yer can ave five pounds ter get more sheets if yer like that was an extraordinarily generous offer from a man who begrudged a penny and regarded sheets for street women as being about as necessary as pearl necklaces in the farmyard it was his oblique way of trying to comfort her she smiled at him and he looked away embarrassed he was slightly ashamed of himself for being generous he was letting his standards slip she sat down in the chair opposite him i shall do that then we can launder them more often and keep infection down thatll cost more soap and more water he protested horrified at the extravagance he had apparently let himself in for an more time to dry em and fewer people infected so theyll leave quicker she elaborated but what i really want is your help thats why i came he looked at her carefully you seen mrs lady rathbone his face was carefully expressionless yes i have and dealt with the kitchen accounts she replied wondering how much all of them knew about the trial and the verdict it seemed to be quite a lot wot can i do the swine is free he said the words with a sudden savagery and she realized with new pain how much she and monk had let them all down they had used every avenue they knew and given hester the information and she had failed to get phillips hanged im sorry she said quietly we were so sure he was guilty we werent careful enough squeaky shrugged he had no compunction about hitting a man when he was down indeed it was the safest time to do it but he could not hit hester she was different he did not want to think how fond he was of her it was a decidedly serious weakness oodve thought sir rathboned ave done that he demanded we could see if we got enough money to ave someone stick a shiv in is gizzard itd cost mind get bedsheets for alf the ores in england oliver she was horrified he rolled his eyes gawd woman i mean jericho phillips wouldnt cost nothin ter do sir rathbone except yerd ave every cop in london after yer so i spose yerd dance on a rope in the end an thats kind o costly but phillipsd be another thing like as not ed get yer first right nasty piece o work e is i know that squeaky id rather get him legitimately yer tried that he pointed out he pushed a pile of papers across the desk further out of his way dont want ter rub it in like but yer didnt exactly get im justice did yer es better off now than if yer adnt bothered free e is the piece o turd now even if yer could prove it an e confessed yer cant touch the sod i know but mebbe wot you int thought of miss ester he said very seriously is that e knows yer after im an e knows oo can tell yer wot an theyre gonna ave ter tread very careful from now on es a nasty piece o work is jericho phillips e int gonna forgive them wot spoke out o turn she shivered chilled in the pit of her stomach perhaps that was the most serious failure of all the danger to others lives now shadowed with fear of phillipss revenge when they had been promised safety she did not want to meet his eyes but it was cowardly to look down yes i know that too it is going to be even harder to do it again int no point in doin it again miss ester he pointed out we cant ang the bastard anymore we know e should be ung drawn and quartered an is guts fed ter the birds but the law says es as innocent as them kids wot e sells thanks ter sir bloody rathbone now none o them wot spoke agin im int safe poor sods i know squeaky she agreed and i know we let them down not you mr monk and i we took too much for granted we let our anger and pity guide us instead of our brains but phillips still needs dealing with and we owe it to everybody to do it well have to put him away for something else thats all squeaky shut his eyes and sighed in exasperation but for all the alarm there was a very faint smile on his face as well yer dont learn do yer gawd in eaven wot der yer want now she took it as if it were agreement or at least acquiescence she leaned forward on the table he is only acquitted of murdering fig specifically he can still be charged with anything else not anged he said grimly an e needs angin twenty years in coldbath fields would do for a start she countered wouldnt it it would be a much longer slower death than on the end of a rope he gave it several moments thought i grant yer that he said finally but i like certain the rope is certain once its done its done ferever we dont have that choice anymore she said glumly he looked at her blinking yer wonderin oo paid im or dyer know he asked she was startled paid sir rathbone he replied e dint do it fer nothin wot did e do it fer anyway does she know he jerked his hand in the general direction of the kitchen ive no idea hester replied but her mind was busy with the question of who had paid rathbone and why he had accepted the money she had never considered the possibility of his owing favors before not of the sort for which such a payment could be asked how did one incur such a debt for what and who would want such payment surely anyone rathbone would consider a friend would want phillips convicted as much as monk did squeaky screwed up his face as if he had bitten into a lemon if yer believe e done it fer free there int much ope for yer he said with disgust phillipss got friends in some very igh places never reckoned rathbone was one of em still dont but some of em ave a lot o power one way an another he curled his lip never know where their fingers stretch ter lot o money in dirty pictures the dirtier the more money got em o little boys an yer can ask yer own price first for the pictures then fer yer silence like he tapped the side of his nose and looked at her sourly out of one eye she started to say that rathbone would not have yielded to pressure of any sort then changed her mind and bit the words off who knew what one would do for a friend in deep enough trouble someone had paid rathbone and he had chosen not to ask why squeaky pursed his lips into an expression of loathing lookin at the kind o pictures phillips sells people can affect yer mind he said watching her closely to make sure she understood even people who you wouldnt think take em out o them smart trousers an fancy shirts an they think no different from yer beggar or yer thief when it comes ter queer tastes exceptin some folk ave got more ter lose than others so it leaves em open ter a little pressure now an then she stared at him are you saying jericho phillips has friends in places high enough to help him before the law squeaky he rolled his eyes as if her naiveté had injured some secret part of him course i am yer dont think es been safe all these years cause nobody knows what es doin do yer because of a taste for obscene photographs she went on disbelief thick in her voice i know many men keep mistresses or conduct affairs haphazardly and in some unlikely places but photographs what pleasure can there be in seeing them that is so powerful that you would compromise your honor reputation everything to deal with a man like phillips he shrugged his bony shoulders don ask me ter explain uman nature miss i int responsible fer it but theres some things you can make children do that no adultd do without lookin at yer like yerd crawled up out o the garbage it int about love or even decent appetite its about makin other people do wot you want em to an tastin the power over an over like yer cant get enough of it sometimes its about the thrill o doin something thatd ruin yer if yer was caught an the danger of it makes yer kind o drunk an neither of them int always no respecters o persons if you get my meanin some people need ter be colder an ungrier ter think on wot matters she said nothing goin with ores is one thing he continued lets face it it int all that serious as society looks at it most married ladies turn the other way an gets on wi their own lives keep the bedroom door locked likely cause they dont want ter wake up wi no nasty disease but dont make no scandal about it pictures o little girls is indecent an it makes a rightthinkin person disgusted he shook his head but little boys is summink else altogether it int only indecent its illegal an thats entirely another thing if nobody knows about it most int goin ter go lookin we all know that things go on wed sooner not think about an most folk mind their own affairs but if yer forced ter know then yer forced ter do summink friend or no friend yer out o yer clubs and yer job an society wont never ave yer back so yer pays igh wide and andsome ter keep it good an quiet see yes i do see hester said a trifle shakily a whole new world of misery had yawned open in front of her not that she had been unaware of homosexuality she had been an army nurse but the use of children to exert a power no adult relationship would tolerate even one purchased with money or to gratify a hunger for the thrills of danger was a new thought and extremely ugly the idea of children kept and hired out for such a purpose was sickening i need to destroy mr phillips squeaky she said very softly i dont think i can do it without your help we have to find out who else we can ask to assist us i imagine mr sutton will be one and possibly scuff who else can you think of a succession of emotions crossed squeakys face first incredulity then horror and an intense desire to escape lastly a kind of amazement at flattery and the beginning of a daring impulse she waited him out he cleared his throat giving himself time well he coughed slightly theres a couple i know of i spose but they int very he fished for the right word and failed to find it nice he finished lamely good she did not hesitate nice people arent going to be any help at all nice people dont even believe in creatures like jericho phillips let alone have the slightest idea how to catch them he probably eats nice people for breakfast skewered on a fork he smiled mirthlessly but not without a certain surprised satisfaction there was a knock on the door and without waiting for an answer claudine burroughs came in with a tray of tea she set it down on the tabletop a fraction closer to hester than to squeaky the pot was steaming gently the fragrance of it inviting claudine was a tall woman roughly the same height as squeaky so he always stood a trifle more stiffly when beside her to add the extra halfinch she was narrowshouldered and broadhipped handsome enough in her youth but years of loneliness in an unsatisfying marriage had drawn many of the lines downward in her face only since coming to portpool lane searching for some charitable work to do had she found a genuine and vital purpose thank you hester said with the sudden realization of how welcome the tea was she wondered if claudine had any idea of yesterdays desperate disappointment or if she was simply aware that hester was tired even at this hour of the morning she was weary inside confused and beaten which was an even deeper thing claudine was still standing motionlessly waiting for something squeaky moved in his chair impatiently implying that claudine had interrupted hester turned to look at her and realized that she was uncomfortably aware of his annoyance perhaps she did know about yesterdays conclusion id like to help claudine said awkwardly her face pink her eyes unable to look at them and yet she would not leave she waited there in acute embarrassment determined to be part of whatever they were doing to give her own contribution regardless of the cost yer cant squeaky said flatly yere a lady yere not part o the folks wot we need ter be talking ter very kind o yer but yer wouldnt be no use thank yer fer the tea he probably meant it kindly but to drop from being part of the plan to fetching the tea was like a slap across her face claudine stood her ground but she struggled for words her face was so pink hester felt as if her cheeks must be burning we havent any plans yet hester said quickly we dont even know where to start we need to go over everything again but with more care and part of the trouble is that the people who testified before are now going to be very afraid phillips isnt in prison any longer and hell be dangerous then we will have to be very careful too claudine replied staring at hester and ignoring squeaky we will have to question them so they do not realize the importance of what they are saying until they have said it and cannot retreat the man phillips is very terrible and he must be put away at last she looked at squeaky i am glad you are going to help i respect you for it mr robinson she turned abruptly and walked to the door then she looked back at hester doubt in her eyes i shall be available to do anything i can to help please do not forget that before either of them could reply she went out shutting the latch firmly behind her yer int goin ter use er squeaky protested leaning forward across the desk his eyes wide what can she do she couldnt find er way from one end o the street ter the other an she int got no right ter respect me i didnt tell er i was goin ter do anything at all with wot e he stopped suddenly uncomfortable are you saying you wont do anything squeaky hester asked with a very faint smile well well i int exactly no i int all the same all the same she led you into saying it and then cut off your retreat she explained for him yeah he was aggrieved then he gave a slow smile wily and halfamused perhaps even appreciative she did dint she he sniffed but i still say she wouldnt be safe in the street she doesnt want to be safe hester lost all trace of the smile she wants to help to belong and you cant belong if you dont take the rough with the smooth she knows that squeaky we arent going to shut her out he shook his head yer int got no idea he said sadly that rathbones got yer ter rights all eart an no brains you are gawd elp us ow the ell am i goin ter look after you an er bothdaft old thing she is an all hester considered telling him very thoroughly to speak with more respect and decided against it this was almost a form of affection and that was beyond price she poured the tea carefully his first it will be hard she agreed but youll manage it now let us get started the choice of whom to see first was not difficult nor was it hard to find him and know what to say hester was happy to do it alone squeaky would be more usefully employed in seeking out his dubious friends sutton was a rat catcher by trade and proud of being called upon for his services by some of the best households in london he numbered duchesses among his clients he was also not too proud to attend to the needs of more humble establishments and had rid the portpool lane clinic of rats at one of the most desperate times in hesters life they had been friends in terrible adversity and indeed sutton and his terrier snoot had almost perished in the sewers with monk only a matter of months ago hester always dressed very plainly to go to the clinic so she did not have any difficulty passing almost unnoticed along the narrow streets to suttons house where she learned from his housekeeper the address where he had gone for the days business she found him at his frequent lunchtime haunt a public house by the name of the grinning rat it was much like any other except for the sign that creaked slightly in the wind as it swung outside the rat in the picture had a look of devilish glee on its painted face it was dressed in green and it stood upright on its hind legs smiling with all its teeth bared hester could not help smiling back before she went inside trying to look as if she belonged there she was immediately enveloped in sound men were laughing and chattering there was a clink of glass and pewter and the scuffle of feet on the sawdustcovered floor and somewhere in the cellars barrels being rolled a dog barked excitedly there was no point in asking for sutton she must simply look it took her several minutes to push her way through unyielding bodies of men intent on slaking thirst and enjoying the latest piece of news she forced her way between two very corpulent bakers flour still on their sleeves and aprons and nearly fell into the lap of a neat slender man sitting by himself eating a cheese and pickle sandwich there was a tankard of cider in front of him and a small brownandwhite dog at his feet mr sutton she said breathlessly straightening herself and attempting to look respectable her hair had fallen out of its pins as it frequently did and she had simply poked it behind her ears im very relieved to have found you he stood up politely partly because there was no second chair for her to be seated she could see immediately from his expression that he knew phillips had been acquitted it made it easier that she did not have to tell him but she would have preferred that the news not be so very widespread perhaps everyone in london knew by now can i get something fer yer miss hester he said dubiously no thank you i have already eaten she answered it was not strictly true but she knew he had no time to waste in the middle of his working day she had enough favors to ask without using them up unnecessarily now he remained standing sandwich in his hand snoot stared at it hopefully but was ignored please continue hester invited him i would be most uncomfortable if i spoiled your lunch all the same i need to ask your help please he nodded grimly as if a foreseen disaster were about to break over him and continued standing youre goin to go after that slimy bastard phillips again arent you it was a conclusion not a question dont miss hester he pleaded anxiously hes a bad one an hes got friends all over the place people yer or me wouldnt even think of knowing the likes of im wait ell make a mistake one day an somebodyll have im e was born for the gallows that one i dont mind if they hang him or simply lock him up in the cold bath fields and throw away the key she replied what i care about is that they do it soon in fact very soon before he has the chance to kill any more children or anyone else for that matter he looked at her carefully for several moments before speaking she began to feel uncomfortable his eyes were blue and very clear as if nothing whatever could impede his vision it gave her a peculiarly vulnerable feeling she had to force herself not to try to explain to him even further you want ter go over all the evidence again he asked slowly his expression tense and troubled youre sure o that she felt a chill even in this hot close room what was he trying to warn her from can you think of a better way she countered we made a mistake several in fact but they were errors in connecting people not in the basic fact that jericho phillips is a child pornographer and murderer you made a mistake in ow long is arm is sutton corrected her biting into the sandwich at last youll ave to be a lot more careful to catch a canny sod like im an ell be watching for you this time his eyes creased in concern she felt a shiver of fear you think hell come after me wouldnt that just prove were right wouldnt he be safer to let us wear ourselves out and prove nothing safer yes sutton agreed but he might get annoyed and come after you anyway if you get close enough to im to scare off some of is custom and that int all theres the other thing to think about an i cant protect you from that cause no one can what thing she asked immediately she trusted sutton he had proved both his friendship and his courage if he feared something then it was dangerous the way i heard it it wasnt just you and mr monk who proved a bit sloppy he said reluctantly it was mr durban as well you trusted in what ed done so you didnt take care to prove everything so not even a clever beggar like mr rathbone could undo it but what about mr durban eh whyd he slip up because she had been about to say that he could not have realized how clever rathbone would be but that wouldnt do he should have been prepared for anyone he was emotional about it too she said instead sutton shook his head that int good enough miss hester an you know that he stopped an started all over the place way i heard it you sure you want to know why his voice was gentle what do you know about him for sure she did not answer there was no point in being defensive and saying that she knew he was good she did not know it she believed it and she did that only because monk did sutton sighed sure you want to this time he was not arguing just waiting to allow her space to retreat if she needed to but there was no point monk would go ahead regardless of whether she went with him or not he could not leave it alone now something of his belief in himself in his value as a friend depended upon durban being essentially the man he supposed him to be and if he were to be disillusioned he would need hesters strength all the more standing apart would leave him bitterly alone better to know she replied sutton sighed and finished the last of his sandwich still standing then drained his glass then wed better go he said with resignation cmon snoot what about your rats she asked theres rats an rats he replied enigmatically ill take you to see nellie what she dont know int worth the bother just follow me and keep your ears open an your mouth shut it int nice places were goin by rights id rather not even take you but i know youll insist and i avent got time for an argument i int goin to win she smiled bleakly and followed after him along the narrow street the dog between them she did not ask what nellies occupation might be and he did not offer any further information they took a bus eastwards into limehouse after walking with him another further half mile on foot through tangled lanes and cobbles with awkward roofs almost meeting above them she had lost her sense of direction entirely she could not even smell the incoming tide of the river above the other odors of dense swarming city life the drains the stale smoke the horse manure the sickly sweetness of a nearby brewery they found nellie in a dim back room behind a public house she was a small tidy woman dressed in black that had long ago faded to a variety of grays she wore a widows lace cap on hair that sat in absurd littlegirl ringlets down the sides of her creased face her eyes were small narrow against the light andwhen hester met them almost accidentallyas sharp as gimlets she could probably see a pin on the floor at twenty paces sutton did not introduce them he merely told nellie that hester was all right that she knew when to speak and when not to nellie grunted thats as may be she said curtly what dyer want the last was addressed to sutton hester was already dismissed like to know a bit more about some o the river police sutton replied wot for nellie regarded him suspiciously they int never gonna cross your path for a friend of mine sutton said if your friend is in trouble better ter deal wi the reglar cops she told him unequivocally river police is right bastards not many of em an not much way round em straight he raised his eyebrows mostly she conceded monk used ter be reglar plice so i eard mean bastard an clever ang on ter a case like a bleedin bulldog she glanced at snoot sitting at suttons feet bulldog she repeated but straight sutter insisted yeah leave im alone best e never eard of yer orme straight as a stair rod she replied with a sniff durban dont matter es dead blew isself up on a ship but was he straight she tilted her head to one side and twisted her mouth until it looked like she had tasted a bad egg if yer after jericho phillips again yere a fool e ad summink on durban same as durban ad on im dunno wot it were an reckon im best ter keep it that way although i like ter know things never say when it might come in useful but someone ad the bite on durban dunno if it were phillips isself or just that e knew about it but i do know that mr durban werent nothin like wot is precious river police thought e were got secrets that one an i never found out wot they were so it int no use askin me mr sutton no matter wot yer thinks i owe yer sutton had to be content with that at least from her even when they were outside again he said nothing to hester except to ask her if she wished to continue certainly she replied although the misery was knotting up inside her the word of one woman who might be a fence of stolen goods a brothel keeper or worse should not tarnish the reputation of a good man it was not nellies word that disturbed her it was her own fear as to why durban had pursued phillips so relentlessly then suddenly stopped then why had he taken it up again when nothing they knew of had changed rathbone with his skill had revealed weaknesses in her reasoning questions and doubts that she needed to have answered she was ashamed of it but that did not still the voices in her mind and she was afraid for monk because she knew how much of the peace within him that he had finally gained had come because a man like durban honest wise and possessed of his own inner strength had bequeathed him the task he himself could no longer perform durban had trusted monk to lead his men and leading men was something monk had never done successfully he was brave intelligent imaginative sometimes ruthless but never before likable he had never before inspired loyalty or the ultimate trust of others over the years since the accident flashes of memory had lit up individual scenes for him and deduction had filled in many of the surrounding blanks the picture that emerged was of a man he did not always like it was too vividly easy to see why others had not he had tried hard to change durban was the one man who had seen the best in him and placed his trust in it now that oliver rathbone had suddenly become a stranger a man they no longer understood durban was even more a key to trust hester was afraid of what monk was going to learn about him and how deeply it would hurt therefore she needed to be the first to know so she could protect himor if that were not possible at least walk beside him through whatever lay ahead she followed sutton along the dark alley towards the next person he would question on her behalf five monk left home and walked down towards the ferry landing he was also weighed down with anxiety and even more with guilt the view across the river was bright and busy heavily laden barges passed in both directions dark against the sun on the water all he could think of was that phillips was free not only from prison and execution but from ever being charged again with the murder of fig no matter what proof monk might find now it could not be used against him how could failure be more complete he crossed rotherhithe street and went down the narrow alley to princes stairs the smells of salt and mud were heavy in the air it was not yet nine in the morning but at this time of the year the sun had been up for hours and it was already hot there was barely any wind to lift the heaviness and he could hear the shouts of lightermen and stevedores from two hundred yards away it was high tide the water was slack and oilylooking there was not enough current to move the ships at anchor and the tangles of masts and rigging were motionless against the sky he had had the chance to kill phillips and it was his own arrogance that had made him so certain he had already won that he had let it go in order to vindicate durban and how badly he had wanted to be the one to do this so that all his men would know and respect him for it they would see that he had paid his debt to durban and earned some kind of right to take his place instead of merely being given it except of course that he had not instead he had guaranteed that phillips was free from paying the price not just now but forever free to go back to his boat with its children who would be more than ever imprisoned in their wretched lives a ferry bumped against the steps and the ferryman called up breaking monks train of thought monk brought himself to attention and went down he did not need to give directions he made this journey every day and most of the men knew him a nod good morning was all he needed to give probably half the river knew the result of the trial they might pity him for it but they would despise him too phillips had made a fool of him or rathbone had or more honestly he had made a fool of himself if he had been lucky he would have gotten away with it but it would not have altered the fact that he had taken too much on trust allowed his emotions to cloud his intellect and as a result made careless mistakes there was nothing for him to say to the ferryman there was not really anything to say to anyone until he could rescue at least something from the ashes he paid his fare got out at the other side at wapping new stairs and climbed up the short way to the top there was a boy standing waiting he was thin and wiry his face keen he had a cap jammed on his head hiding most of his hair his shirt was ragged and missing several buttons and his trouser legs were uneven which complemented his boots one brown and one black he appeared to be about ten or eleven he was the mudlark scuff one of the boys who salvaged small items of value from the river to sell he had helped monk before and chose to continue to help him with his knowledge of the dockside and its ways sorry sight you are he said to monk disparagingly got a face like a burst boot spose you got a right made a pigs ear of it an all the boy fell into step behind him as monk turned to walk along the dockside towards the police station the boy sniffed but yer gonna do summink int yer there was a note of anxiety in his voice that was close to real fear monk stopped the ferryman was not worth the effort of pretense but scuff deserved both honesty and the courage not to disappoint him he looked at the boy and saw the vulnerability bright in his eyes yes of course im going to do something he said firmly i just need to think very hard before i do it so that i get it rightthis time scuff shook his head drawing his breath in through his teeth but some of the fear in him eased yer gotta be careful mr monk yer may ave been the cats whiskers wi villains on shore but yer int much use wi river folk though come ter think on it that lawyers sharp all right pretty as new paint e is all striped trousers and shiny shoes for a moment his face was full of sympathy for all that es bent as a dogs ind leg he kept pace with monk across the stones hes not bent monk corrected him its his job to get people off a charge if he can its my fault that i made it possible for him scuff was skeptical someone twistin is arm ter do it then possibly it might just be that he felt that the principle of the law required that even the worst of us deserve a fair hearing scuff pulled his face into an expression of deep disgust the worst of us deserves ter dance on the end of a rope an if yer dont know that then yer int fit ter be out o the ouse by yerself it doesnt make any difference scuff monk told him miserably phillips is free and its up to me to clear up the mess and nail him for something else ill elp yer scuff said immediately yer need me id like your help but i dont need it monk said as gently as he could i have no very clear idea yet where to begin except by going over what i already know and seeing where the holes are then pursuing it until i can at least nail him on pornography or extortion its dangerous and i dont want to risk you getting hurt scuff thought about it for a moment or two he was trying to keep up with monk but his legs were not long enough and every third or fourth stride he had to put in an extra little skip i int afraid he said at length leastways not enough ter stop me monk halted and scuff halted half a step later i dont doubt your courage monk said clearly meeting scuffs eyes in fact if you had a trifle less you might be safer yer want me ter be scaredycat scuff asked incredulously monk made a quick decision if it will keep you out of the hands of men like phillips yes i do scuff stood still on the spot the stubbornness in his face slowly revealing the hurt yer think i int no use dont yer he asked sniffing very slightly monk was furious with himself for having put them both into such a position now he was caught between denying the fact that he cared about the boy which would be a wounding lie whose damage he might never undo or admitting that his decision was based on emotion rather than reason or the alternative perhaps crueler still was to suggest that he really did think scuff was no use that one he could not even consider he started to walk again i think youre a lot of use he said quietly falling back a bit to keep step with the boy rather than letting him skip to keep up for knowledge and brains not for fighting and this could become very unpleasant if i have to get out very quickly i dont want to have to stop to make sure you are all right have you ever heard the expression hostage to fortune no i int scuff said dubiously but there was a spark of hope in his eyes it means caring enough about something that you cant afford to lose it so people can make you do what they want monk explained because you think its worth a lot or its bad that it should be destroyed he added in case scuff should be embarrassed scuff turned the idea over in his mind examining it oh he said at last so you wouldnt want phillips ter drown me take a frinstance or cut me throat like so you might leave im alone but if it dont bother yer yerd tell im ter get on with it an yerd nab im something like that monk agreed thinking that he had made his point rather well i see scuff nodded very slightly well if we get someone as is daft enough ter get caught well ave ter make sure its someone we dont care about not too much i spose mrs monk is one o them ostages int she yerd let pretty well the devil isself go ter save er wouldnt yer there was no way out of the conclusion yes he admitted thats why shes staying away from phillips and the bad places on the river im going there andbefore you argue anymoreyou arent yer can mebbe tell er wot ter do cause shes a woman scuff observed stopping and standing very stiffly feet slightly apart i int he took a deep breath an you int me pa but ill look after yer anyway where are yer gonna start i knowwi fishin figs body out o the river we better get on wi it don just stand there like yer growin out o the ground and without waiting for a reply he started to walk nonchalantly towards the edge of the embankment and the nearest steps where they might catch a ferry he did not look back over his shoulder to see if monk was following him monk was irritated at being outmaneuvered and yet underneath the surface aware that scuff was also trying to stay with him without sacrificing his own dignity he wanted desperately to belong and he thought his only way was to be of use what was the risk really compared with those he ran every day living on the river edge cadging his food and shelter by picking up bits of coal or dropped brass screws from the mud when the tide went down he caught up with scuff all right he said mock grudgingly you might help me find the lighterman youre right thats where i was going to start course scuff said casually as if he did not really care but he shrugged his shoulders and then walked a little taller avoiding monks eyes he did not wish to be read at this particular moment he was too vulnerable we can get a ferry down a bit he added find the lightermen avin a cup o tea like as not at this hour monk was uncertain whether to thank him he decided against it it might sound a little patronizing hope so he said instead i could do with one too scuff grimaced monk knew he had great hopes of being given one himself if he were lucky possibly even a sandwich it was unlikely that he had eaten today they took the ferry downstream as suggested and asked specifically after the lighterman they wanted it took them more than an hour to find him because he was already at work first loading and then getting his lighter out into the traffic they made some of their inquiries of a group of men standing around a brazier with boiling water and monk purchased a mug of tea and a thick slice of bread he offered the same to scuff who thought about it as long as he dared then said with practiced indifference that he didnt mind if he did all the while he watched monk out of the corner of his eye to make sure he did not miss his chance monk affected not to notice i already told yer the lighterman said wearily yer let the bastard orff there int no more i can say they were sitting on the canvas bales as the flatbottomed craft made its slow heavy way downstream towards greenwich i know what you said monk assured him and all the evidence bears it out but we didnt ask you what mr durban said or if he asked you anything that you didnt mention before the lighterman screwed up his face in thought moving his eyes as if looking at the hard glittering reflections off the water e were upset he replied slowly all bent over isself like someoned it im in the belly tell yer the truth i liked im better fer it so did monk but it was not the answer he needed he had already asked orme these questions but orme was so defensive of durban that his answers were no longer useful they had become simply a repetition that durban had done the right thing monk was hoping the lighterman would remember some other information that durban had let slip some word or even omission that might lead in a new direction he was fumbling and he knew it the lightermans face showed his disappointment he had expected more and he had not received it he had endangered himself to testify and monk had let him down are you afraid of phillips monk asked suddenly the lighterman was caught off guard no he said indignantly why should i be i never said he done nothin int got no cause ter come after me and if he had cause would he monk asked trying to keep all expression out of his voice the lighterman stared at him wots the matter with yer yer simple or summink ed bloody carve out me guts an ang em on execution dock ter dry in the wind monk continued to look skeptical scuff looked from monk to the lighterman and back again waiting his eyes wide an yer wont catch im fer it neither the lighterman added not that you bleedin lot could catch a cold soppin wet in winter mr durban knew wot e were about reckon if ed a lived ed a swung the bastard by is neck all right monk felt the words land like a blow the harder because it was the one case durban had not solved and he did not want to admit it but there was a thread in what the lighterman had said that was worth following so he was still working on it he asked the lighterman looked at him witheringly course e were i reckon ed never ave given up he squinted a little in the hard light and leaned very slightly on his long oar to steer a few degrees to port what is there to follow monk found the words hard to say placing himself so vulnerably as if he were asking a bargee how to do his own job the lighterman shrugged ow the ell do i know e said summink about money an making them fat bastards pay for their pleasures twice over but i dunno wot e meant extortion monk replied yeah well you int gonna get any o them exactly ter complain now are yer the lighterman sneered monk kept his voice level and his face as expressionless as he could unlikely he agreed at least not to me the lighterman turned slowly from his position holding the oar he was a lean angular man but the movement was unconsciously graceful for a moment surprise caught him off guard yer not so daft are yer gawd elp yer if e catches yer is all i can say monk could wrest no more out of him and twenty minutes later he and scuff were back on the dockside yer gonna set is customers agin im scuff said in awe ow yer gonna do that he looked worried im not sure what im going to do monk answered starting to walk along the dockside they were on the north bank back near the wapping police station for now ill settle for learning a great deal more about him if yer can prove for sure that e killed fig will they ang im scuff asked hopefully no monk kept his pace even though he was not yet certain where he was going he did not want scuff to realize that although he was beginning to appreciate that scuff was a far sharper judge of character than he had previously given him credit for it was disconcerting to be read so well by an elevenyearold no he said again hes been found not guilty we cant try him again no matter what we find in fact even if he confessed thered still be nothing we could do scuff was silent he turned towards monk looking him up and down his lips tight monk was unpleasantly aware that scuff was being tactful he was touched by it and at the same time he was hurt scuff was sorry for him because he had made a mistake he did not know how to mend this was a far cry from the brilliant angry man he had been in the main metropolitan police onshore where criminals and slipshod police alike were frightened of him so we gotta get im for summink else then scuff deduced wot like thievin forgin e dont do that far as i know sellin stuff wot was nicked e dont do that neither an e dont smuggle nothin so e dont pay the revenue men beind is back like he screwed up his face in an unspoken question i dont know monk said frankly thats what i need to find out he does lots of things maybe fig isnt the only boy hes killed but i need something i can prove scuff grunted in sympathy and walked beside monk trying very hard to keep in step with him monk wondered whether to shorten his stride he decided not to he did not want scuff to know that he had noticed the police surgeon was busy and shorttempered he met them in one of the stonefloored and utilitarian outer rooms of the mortuary he had just finished an autopsy and his rolledup sleeves were still splashed with blood made a mess of it didnt you he said bitterly it was an accusation not a question he glanced at scuff once then disregarded him if you expect me to rescue you or excuse you for that matter then youre wasting your time scuff let out a wail of fury and stifled it immediately terrified monk would make him go away and then he would be no use at all he stood shifting his weight from one foot to the other in his odd boots and glaring at the surgeon monk controlled his own temper with difficulty only because his need to find some new charge against phillips was greater than his impulse for selfdefense you deal with most of the bodies taken out of this stretch of the river he replied his voice tight figgis cant have been the only boy of that age and general type id like to hear about the others you wouldnt the surgeon contradicted him especially not in front of this one he indicated scuff briefly wont give you anything useful anyway if we couldve tied any of them to jericho phillips dont you think we would have his dark face was creased with an inner pain that perhaps he did not realize showed so clearly monks anger vanished suddenly they had everything that mattered in common the retort that apparently the surgeon had been no cleverer than anyone else died on his tongue i want to get him for anything i can he said quietly loitering with intent or being a public nuisance if it would put him away long enough to start on the rest i want to see him hang for what he does to these boys the surgeon replied his voice shook very slightly so do i but ill settle for what i can get monk replied the surgeon looked up at him his eyes hard then very slowly the disgust seeped out of him and he relaxed scuff stopped fidgeting ive had a few boys i think were his the surgeon said and if i could have proved it i would have one he acknowledged police asked him and he came in here brassfaced as the lord mayor and said he knew the boy said hed taken him in but hed run away he knew i couldnt prove anything different id have happily dissected him alive and he knew it he enjoyed looking at me and seeing me know that i couldnt he winced but id have taken you apart when that verdict came in you so bloody nearly had him ive no right i didnt get him myself how sure are you that hes done it before monk asked i mean sure not just instinct absolutely but i cant prove a damn thing if you can get him ill be in your debt for life and ill pay it i dont care whether hes on the end of a rope or knifed to death by one of his rivals just take him off our river for a moment it was a plea the urgency in him undisguised then he hid it again rolling up his sleeves even higher and turning away all i can tell you is that hes fond of torturing them with burning cigars but you probably know that and when he finishes them its with a knife his body was rigid and he kept his back to them now get out of here and do something bloody useful he stalked away leaving them alone in the damp room with its smells of carbolic and death outside monk breathed in the air deeply scuff said nothing looking away from him perhaps he was frightened at last not just aware of dangers that he must live with every day but of something so large and so dark it stripped away all bravado and pretense his fear was out of his control and he did not want monk to see it they walked side by side near the edge of the water both lost in their own thoughts on the reality of death and its pedestrian physical immediacy they were barely aware of the slap of the tide on the wall of the steps and the shouts of the lightermen and stevedores a hundred yards away unloading a schooner from the indies this is worse than i thought monk said after a while he stopped walking and looked out over the water he must be careful how he phrased it or scuff would know he was being protected and would resent it i dont like to involve you because its dangerous he went on but i dont think orme and i can do it without your help there are boys who will trust you who wont even speak to us unless youre there to persuade them scuffs narrow shoulders were tight as if he were waiting to be struck it was his only outward sign of fear now he stopped hands in his pockets and turned slowly to face monk his eyes were dark hollow and embarrassed by what he saw as his own weakness yeah he wanted desperately to meet expectations i think well need you all the time to help with the questioning until we get him monk said casually starting to walk again it would be a sacrifice i know but wed find you a proper place to sleep where you could shut the door and be alone and thered be food of course scuff was too startled to move he stood rooted to the spot food he repeated monk stopped and turned back well i cant come looking for you every day i havent time suddenly scuff understood joy filled his face then very quickly he sobered up to a proper dignity i reckon i could he said generously just until yer get im like thank you monk replied almost certain that hester would see the necessity of keeping scuff safe as long as jericho phillips was free however long that might be well come on then the first boy we need to find is the one who identified fig from durban s drawings he might know something else if we ask him the right questions yeah scuff said as if he thoroughly agreed e might an all however it took them the rest of the day to find the boy and he was clearly very unhappy about speaking with monk about anything they stood where the narrow entrance of an alley opened into the shadwell dock the tide was ebbing and slapping over the stairs a few yards away leaving the higher steps slimy as it retreated there was a large ship in the new basin behind them its spars and yards black against the fading sky i dunno nothin more the boy said urgently i told yer oo e were same like i told mr durban i dunno oo done im an i cant elp yer e wont leave yer alone til yer tell im scuff gestured towards monk so yer might as well get on wif it it dont do ter be seen talkin ter the cops if yer can elp it he gave a philosophical shrug its a bit late for me but you could save yerself the boy gave him a filthy look scuff was impervious wot else did mr durban ask yer he looked at monk then back at the boy yer dont want im as an enemy believe me if yer like ell pretend e never eard of yer the boy knew when to give up e were askin fer a woman called mary webster walker webber summink like that he said like a dog wif a bone e were where was she ad i seen er ad anybody said anything even er name i told im id never eard of er but e wouldnt leave it i told im id ask me sister just ter shut im up like e said as ed be back this mary whatever were bout is age e said but e dint know much more about er n that scuff looked across at monk there was a pleasure boat passing down the river hurdygurdy music playing the sound drifted on the air loud and then soft loud and then soft as the wind carried it so did you ask your sister monk said curious to know what durban was looking for there had been no mention of a middleaged woman before not the first time the boy answered sucking in his breath but mr durban come back an e wouldnt let it go i seen pit bull terriers as couldnt ang on to a thing and worry it like e did so i told im ter ask biddie isself an told im where ter find er where can we find biddie the boy rolled his eyes but he told him monk had no desire to take scuff with him to a brothel but the alternative was to leave him alone he could have told him to go to paradise place but it would be bitterly unfair to oblige him to explain to hester that he had come to stay and anyway she might not even be there if they had had some crisis at portpool lane there was nothing to do but allow him to come it was completely dark even on this clear summer night by the time they found biddie she had apparently been plying her trade earlier in the evening but was now cheerfully available to take a glass of ale and merely talk for a couple of shillings she was a plain girl but buxomly built and relatively clean in a blue dress disturbingly low cut which did not bother scuff as much as monk thought it should have yeah mary webber biddie said nodding keeping both hands around her glass as if she feared having it taken from her lookin fer er summink fierce e were i kep tellin im i dint know no mary webber which i dint i never eard of er she managed to look aggrieved even while wiping the foam off her upper lip e got a temper on im that one right paddy e were in clocked mr opkins summink awful it im on the side o the ead an near sent im inter the middle o next week an es a nasty sod too but e never eard o mary webber no moren i ad monk felt an acute sense of dismay it sounded nothing like the man he had known what did he look like he asked perhaps this was a case of mistaken identity biddie had a good eye for faces perhaps it was part of her trade it might be the way to remember certain people it would be advisable to avoid bout your eight bit less but more solid nicelookin specially fer a cop nice eyes dark they were grayish air wi sort o little waves in it walked easy but a bit like mebbe ed once been a sailor that was durban monk swallowed did he say why he wanted to find mary webber a couple wove their way past them talking loudly and bumping into people no an i dint ask biddie said vehemently i eard e went ter old jetsam the pawnbroker an gave im an ell of a time duffed im up summink rotten still got the scars e as not that e were ever much ter look at but is own ma wouldnt take ter im now she finished her ale with relish wouldnt mind if yer got me another she remarked monk dispatched scuff with the empty glass and threepence he took a breath there was no escaping now whatever the truth was do you mean that durban beat the pawnbroker she must be lying why would he believe her rather than everything he knew of durban and yet he could not leave it alone in his own past people had been frightened of him was he violent too it was so easy who told you that he asked i saw im she said simply told yer orrible e looked but how do you know it was durban who struck him or that it was deliberate perhaps jetsam hit him first she gave him a look of incredulity ol jetsam get on wi yer jetsams as big a coward as ever were born e wouldnt go ittin a cop even if e were soused as an erring lie is way out of a paper bag cheat is own mother out o sixpence but e wouldnt never it nobody faceterface monks stomach clenched and he felt a coldness through him why would durban hit him probably lost is temper cause jetsam lied ter im she answered reasonably if jetsam is that kind of a liar how do you know it wasnt some customer he cheated who hit him scuff came back with the ale and gave it to biddie and the change to monk who thanked him look biddie said patiently yer been fair ter me i int gonna lie to yer the local cop on the beat ad ter pull em apart an e were gonna charge durban cause ol jetsam got moren the worst of it e were near avin is ead stove in i reckon durban d ave been charged if e adnt bin a cop isself an put the twist on that shouldnt make any difference monk said then immediately knew it was a mistake he saw the contempt in her eyes he knew what she was going to say before she started and yet the words still hurt like a fresh cut she rolled her eyes yeah well the cop wot caught im were just the local constable and durban were a commander in the river police yer cant be daft enough not ter work that out fer yerself constable might a grumbled but e dint do nothing nor jetsam neither if any of us ad known oo mary webber were wed a told im monk did not pursue it any further it was too late today to see if he could substantiate any of it he walked in silence with scuff to the nearest steps where there was a light and he could hire a ferry to take them back across the river to rotherhithe it was slack tide now and the long stretch of mud and stones gleamed in the yellow glare from the lamps in its own way it was both sinister and beautiful the slick surface of the river barely moved even the ships at anchor lay still their spars lumpy with furled sails the blur of smoke hung above some stillburning factory chimney where industry never slept did he believe biddie who was mary webber nothing he had learned about durban had made any mention of a woman why such passion who was she that durban would so lose control of himself and of all the beliefs he had so clearly lived by that he would attack a man to beat information out of him and perhaps even worse he had apparently then coerced a junior officer into ignoring his duty and overlooking the whole episode monk could not imagine durban doing either of these things but then how much had he really known him he had liked him they had shared food warmth and exhaustion of body and mind in the relentless search to find men who could unknowingly destroy half the world they had found them he still relived the horror of it in dreams but in the end it had caught up with durban himself he had gone nobly willingly to death by fire in order to save others and take the threat with him and he had gone alone refusing to allow monk to share his fate he had physically thrown him off the stern of the ship into the boiling wake rather than let him also perish and had not had time to save himself before the magazines exploded what kind of friendship or loyalty can you give to someone who is so supremely brave and yet also desperately flawed what do you owe to promises made or understood what if the other person is gone and no more explanations can be asked for or given and still you have to act and believe something scuff was watching him waiting to see what he did because of this latest revelation and monk was intensely aware of it mebbe she could ave put phillips away scuff said hopefully dyer think that were why e were after er or mebbe phillips did er in too dyer think an thats why nobody found er monk had to answer him no not really she might ave scuff raised his voice to sound more positive even trying to be cheerful monk knew it was for his sake shes iding cause shes scared stiff o phillips she could ave seen wot appened mebbe shes somebodys ma wot phillips done perhaps monk conceded although he did not believe it durban never mentioned her in his notes and surely he would have if thats who she was scuff thought about that for quite a long time they had hailed a ferry and were more than halfway across the river weaving in and out of the great ships at anchor before he found a solution mebbe that were to keep er safe if she saw summink phillipsd kill er fer an e would he suggested hank could not see scuffs face in the darkness of the river but he could see the hunch of his narrow shoulders and the way he held himself when he was hurt the oars splashed in and out the ferryman had a good rhythm probably from years of practice an like you said scuff replied unhappily theres gentlemen in it up ter their necks gentlemen wot got enough money ter pay yer friend the lawyer wot spoke up fer phillips and yer dont know oo they are cause they dont exactly go round tellin people they go in fer wot e does youre right scuff monk said decisively i should have thought of that for myself of course you are he could see scuffs grin even in the dark when a bed had been made up for scuff and he was sound asleep in it hester and monk sat in the kitchen over a very late supperreally no more than two large pieces of fruitcake and two cups of tea i cant let him go back until phillips is arrested and locked up he said anxiously watching her face its as much my responsibility as yours she answered then she smiled of course we cant and that might be quite a while so you had better get him some clean clothes im much too busy to wash these every night even supposing i could dry them you might even get a pair of boots that fit himand really are a pair she wanted to talk about something that was worrying her he could see it in her eyes in a kind of hesitation as though she were still looking for a way to avoid saying it at all he told her about hearing of mary webber but not of durban s violence towards the pawnbroker or his use of rank to prevent the constable from charging him he realized with surprise that it was not hester he was protectingit was durban because he himself cared so intensely what hester thought of him he was imagining that durban would too why are you smiling she asked him puzzled and a little off balance i dont know he admitted at scuffs help i suppose suddenly she was profoundly serious be careful william she warned please i know hes looked after himself for years but hes only a child lots of people die on the river she left the rest unsaid there were more like fig than like scuff and they both knew that he looked down at her hands on the table they were very slender like a girls but strong their beauty lay not in soft white skin or delicate nails but in grace they were quick and gentle and their touch was light they would be broken before they would let a drowning man go but they would allow a butterfly to leave as simply as it had come he loved her hands he wanted to reach out and touch them but he felt selfconscious when there was so much more urgent business at hand durban was being blackmailed she said quietly not meeting his eyes i dont yet know what for could that be to do with this mary webber whoever she is i dont know he confessed he wished he did not have to know he was overburdened with knowledge already and the more there was of it the more it hurt what was it that drove people on and on to seek the truth to unravel every knot even when it was the ignorance and the peace of heart that made it all endurable was truth going to heal anything how much of it could any one person grasp she stood up thats enough for today lets go to bed she said it gently but she was not going to accept an argument and he had no wish to offer any hester was concerned for durban s reputation too not so much for himself as for what the discoveries could do to monk her husband had had few friends at least that he could remember at one time he and runcorn had been more than allies they had shared the involvement and the tragedy of police work and the dangers but monks abrasive tongue and his ambition had driven runcorn to a bitter jealousy he was a narrower man in both his vision and his ability the rivalry had brought out the meanest spirit in him friendship had eventually become enmity of course she did not explain any of this to sutton when she met him to take up the search again he would think their purpose was to find some evidence to prove phillips guilty of something for which they could try him he must know that the death of fig was closed to them now even if he had been tactful enough to refrain from saying so they rode the bus in companionable silence snoot by suttons feet as always hester sat in the top of the bus watching the narrow closely crammed houses with the stained walls and sagging roofs as they moved closer to limehouse and the printer sutton had told her they were going to he had helped in many things and she knew he would do all he could now he would call in favors incur more spend all day away from his own work to help her find what she was seeking but sutton could not tell her what it was that she wanted to find or what she hoped it would prove they could not undo the failure of phillipss trial nor the fact that rathbone had defended him they might find out the reason for that choiceif indeed it had been choice and not some kind of necessity but it might be confidential and something they could never learn did it matter could they not trust rathbone after all the battles they had fought together in framing the question she realized with a jolt of cold surprise that the answer must be that she did not or she would not have asked she would not have said the same a year ago had his marriage to margaret really changed him so much or was it simply that it had brought to the fore a different weaker part of his character or was it a different part of hers she had never been in love with him it had always been monk even if she had doubted at times that he would ever love her or make her happy in fact she had considered it impossible that he would even wish to try but she had liked rathbone deeply and she had trusted a decency in him if this were a lapse for whatever reason could she not forgive him was her loyalty so shallow that one mistake ended it loyalty had to be worth more than that or it was little more than convenience the bus stopped again and more people climbed on standing packed together in the aisle and monks loyalty to durban she thought that also had to be strong enough to handle the truth she wanted desperately to protect him from the disillusion she feared was coming there were moments when she did not want to know why rathbone had defended phillips but they passed her better self despised the weakness that preferred ignorance or worse lies she would not want anyone she cared for to love a false reflection of her after all could there be a greater loneliness than that they reached the terminus and alighted it was a walk of about half a mile along the busy street and she had to go behind sutton and snoot because the way was so narrow they could not pass together without bumping into the traffic going the other way every few moments sutton would look back to make sure she was still on his heels sutton stopped at a small door next to an alley no more than ten feet long and ending in a blind wall snoot instantly sat at his heels sutton knocked and several moments passed before it was opened by a small hunchbacked man with an extraordinarily sweet expression on his face he nodded when he recognized sutton and his dog then he glanced at hester more questioning whether she were with them than for her name or business satisfied by suttons nod he led them inside to a room so cluttered with books and papers he had to clear two chairs for them to sit down there were reams of blank paper stacked against the wall the smell of ink was sharp in the air the little man hitched himself back with some difficulty into what was obviously his own chair i dint print it he said without any preamble his voice was deep and chesty and his diction remarkably clear sutton nodded i know that it was pinky jones but hes dead and hed lie about the time of day just tell mrs monk what it said if you please mr palk its not nice palk warned is it true hester asked although she had not yet been included in the conversation oh yes its true lots of folks around here know that then please tell me he looked at her for the first time curiosity sharp in his face you have to understand durban was a man of strong passions he began nice on the surface funny when he wanted to be ive seen him set the whole room laughing and generous he could be but he felt some things hard and it seems this mary webber was one o them never heard why never heard who or what she was that made him care he never found her dont know miss but if he didnt it wasnt for want of trying this all started when he went to ma wardlops house brothel it ismebbe a dozen girls or so asking her if shed seen mary webber he shook his head wouldnt let it drop no matter what finally ma wardlop told him one of the girls knew something and took him to her room he questioned her in there for more than an hour until she was screaming at him that point ma went an fetched a revenue man who lived a couple o doors away big man he was he pulled his lips into a thin line an expression of great sadness punched the door in and said he found durban in a position no policeman should be with a whore but didnt say what it was exactly she claimed hed forced himself on her he said he never touched her hester did not reply her mind raced from one ugly scene to another trying to find an answer that would not disgust monk palks face was screwed up in revulsion but it was impossible to say whether it was for durban or the lie the prostitute might have told ma wardlop said shed keep her mouth shut about it all if durban would be wise enough to do the same only she meant about anything he might see in the future and he knew that blackmail hester said succinctly he nodded again he told her to go to hell and take the revenue man with her palk said it with some satisfaction curling back his lips in a smile that showed surprisingly strong white teeth they said theyd not just spread it around the streets theyd put it in the papers too he told them he agreed with the duke of wellingtonpublish and be damned he wasnt going to keep his mouth shut about anything he didnt want to and what happened she asked fear and admiration tightening inside her her stomach knotted her breath slow as if the noise of it might stop her hearing what he would say next it was stupid durban was dead and could not be hurt anymore and yet she cared painfully that he had had the courage and the honor to defy them nothing until the next time he caught them robbing a customer the little man answered and put the girl in prison for it then they published it all right his eyes did not move from hers very embarrassing it was for durban but he weathered it lost a good few hed thought were friends hard way to find out they werent got laughed at in places where they used to call him sir it hurt him but i only seen him show it once and then just for a moment he took it like a man never complained and never far as i know looked the other way on anything they did what happened to the girl she felt a flood of warmth inside her an easing of the ache of tension then the chill again and fear of the next answer nothing palk told her his eyes reading her emotions like print on the page that wasnt durban s way he knew she was only doing what she had to to get by he had a hot temper but he never took it out on women or kids soft he was in his own fashion as if he knew what it was like to be poor or hungry or alone he smiled at the memory beat the hell out of willy lyme for knocking his wife around but gentle as a woman with old bert when e got daft and didnt even know who he was anymore went into the canal after the poor old sod drowned himself and cried when he couldnt save him poor old bert came to his funeral durban did never knew for sure but i reckoned he paid for most of it bert hadnt sixpence to his name he looked narrowly at hester i dont know why yer want to know miss you cant hurt durban now but theres a lot of folk wont take it kindly if you speak ill of him wouldnt be a good thing im trying to stop those who would she replied he looked puzzled searching her face she smiled at him my husband took his place in the river police because durban suggested him we tried to solve durban s last case and we failed so badly we cant go back and do it again i want to show that the court was wrong and we were right durban and my husband and i wont do any good palk told her yes it will well know it and that matters is monk the new fellow at wapping yes wont be easy to follow durban depends where he was going he looked at her without blinking right and wrong he said no mans right all the time but he was more than most she stood up i hope so but i need the truth whatever it is and then youll tell everybody depends i dont know what it is yet he nodded thatll do but be careful theres plenty thatd kill to make sure you dont i know that he hitched himself down off his chair awkward one shoulder almost half a foot higher than the other and made his way to the door to show them out unaware of hesters mission monk started out again in the morning with scuff beside him dressed as yesterday in the old boots very soon monk would get him something better but now he was compelled to go back to tracing durban s search for mary webber he would rather have been alone the effort of concealing his emotions and keeping up a civil conversation was more than the value of any help scuff could give but he had left himself no choice apart from wounding him by rejection he dare not allow scuff to wander around by himself now he had endangered him and he must do what he could to protect him from the consequences by midmorning after several failed attempts he was almost robbed by the very scufflehunter he was actually looking for they were at the black eagle wharf between a cargo of timber and lightermen unloading tobacco raw sugar and rum there was no breeze off the river to move the smell of it in the air the tide was low again and the water slurped over the weed on the steps and the lighters bumped against the stones an argument between a lighterman and a docker spread until it involved half a dozen men shouting and pushing it was a form of robbery monk had seen many times bystanders watched a crowd gradually gathered and while their attention was on the fighting pickpockets did their silent job monk felt the jolt swung around and came facetoface with an old woman who grinned at him toothlessly and at the same moment there was a touch behind him so light the thief was a couple of yards away before monk lunged after him and missed it was scuff who brought him down with a swift kick to the shins which left him sprawling on the ground yelling indignantly and hugging his left leg monk yanked him to his feet without sympathy ten minutes later they were sitting on the top of the steps the scufflehunter between them looking uncomfortable but willing to talk i didnt tell im nowt cause i dont know nuffin he said aggrievedly i never eard o mary webber i said id ask around an i did i swear why did he want her monk answered what kind of woman was she supposed to be when did he first ask he must have told you something more than her name how old was she what did she look like what did he want her for why ask you was she a pawnbroker a money lender a receiver a brothel keeper an abortionist a whore a procuress what was she the man squirmed gawd i dont know e said she were about fifty or summink like that so she werent no ore not any longer anyway she could a been any o them other things all e said were er name an that she ad goldybrown eyes an curly air little fine curls why did he want her when did he first ask you i dunno the man shivered and moved an inch or two away from monk shrinking into himself dyer think i wouldnt a told im if id a known monk felt the fear eat inside him also for an utterly different reason when he insisted when did he first ask you about mary webber what else did he ask nuffin were about two year ago mebbe less winter i mind because e stood out in the cold an i were near freezin me ands were blue did he ever find her i dunno nobody round ere never eard of er an i know all the fences and receivers all the ock shops an moneylenders from wappin ter blackwall an back monk swiveled to face him and the man flinched again stop it monk snapped im not going to hit you he heard the anger in his voice almost out of control the names of durban and mary webber were enough to cause fear but the man either could not or would not tell him any more he tried other contacts along the water that he had made in the six months since he had been in the river police and names that had been in durban s notes people orme or any of the other men had mentioned e were lookin for fat tildas boy an old woman told him with a shake of her head that set her battered straw hat swiveling on her head they were on the corner of an alley a hundred feet from the dockside it was noisy dusty and hot she had a basket of shoelaces on her arm and so far did not seem to have sold many gorn missin e ad told er ed possibly gone thievin an been caught but she were fraid that phillipsd got im could ave daft as a brush e is an all what happened monk asked patiently stupid little sod fell in the water an got fished out by a lighterman who took im all the way down ter gravesend come back three days later right as rain she grinned at the memory as if she found acute satisfaction in it but mr durban looked for the boy yeah i said so it were im as found im at gravesend an brought im back otherwise e could a been took ter sea an ended up dinner for some cannibal in the south seas thats wot i told my boys do as i tell yer or yerll get run off an be boiled an ate up monk cringed inwardly at the thought reckon e thought phillips could a got im right enough the old woman said dourly her smile vanished its a bad shame mr durban is dead e were the one as mebbe could a done for phillips didnt take no nonsense from no one e dint but e were fair an nothin werent too much trouble if yer was down scuff stood suddenly upright monk swallowed durban course durban she snapped glaring at him oo dyer think i was talkin about the lord mayor o london ard man if yer was bad but soft as muck if yer was sick or poor or old like me e wouldnt ave stood ere in the sun leavin me on me feet an me mouth dry as a wooden boot ed a gave me a cup o tea an bought a couple o pairs o shoelaces an all why was he looking for tildas son monk had to examine the moment of kindness so it would not later fade and slip out of his grasp cause e were afraid phillips might ave got im yer fool she said in disgust was that likely e knew tried is ardest ter get the bastard then e got killed isself now them stupid sods o the river police int good for nothin cept smugglers pickpockets an a few eavy orsemen she was referring to the thieves who stole goods from the ships and brought them ashore in specially designed pockets inside their coats the reproof stung less than monk would have expected and he shot a glance at scuff to prevent him from leaping to his defense then he was going to catch phillips he asked mildly she looked him up and down yer want a pair o laces she asked he fished tuppence out of his pocket and passed it to her she gave him the laces yer int man enough to do it she responded yer gotter ask an old woman like me the way scuff could take it no more you mind yer gob yer ol mare he said furiously mr monks strung up more murderers than yerve ad ot dinners or like ter ave mr durban never got phillips neither an you int no elp wheres is boat eh oo goes on an off it oo puts burns on them boys when they get out o line oo kills em an why eh dyer even know wot yer talkin about yer ol bag o bones she darted her hand out and gave him a swift hard slap around the ear monk winced as he heard the crack of skin on skin scuff let out a howl wotd i tell you lot fer the old woman demanded furiously yer wouldnt do nothin yer wouldnt take no risks ter keep the little bastards safe not like e did risks monk asked gulping down hope and trying to keep his voice steady he must not let her know it mattered she would play every advantage he even tried to invest his tone with some skepticism she was still angry her contempt was bitter in the deep lines around her eyes and mouth e got melcher dint e she gave a toothless sneer real clever sod e were when e wanted and e conned melcher every time if e dint keep an eye on other boys an phillips knew it pearly boy too werent till after durban were dead that reilly went but wotd yer know bloody useless she spat on the dusty ground yer dont make me laugh like e did an dont give me nothin ter eat he walked away with scuff thinking deeply the insults did not bother him it was the information whirling in his head that he needed to order melcher he knew was a heavy horseman one of the roughest according to the old woman durban had held something over him pearly boy was an opulent receiver a fence of the more elegant and expensive goods stolen and resold along the river a man whose reputation for ruthlessness and greed was well enough known to keep him insulated from the usual dangers and irritations of rivalry in his particular trade it seemed durban had somehow manipulated him too phillips would not have liked that but who was reilly or if the old woman was right who had he been and what had happened to him scuff was worried he glanced at monk now and again then away quickly what is it monk asked eventually as they crossed the narrow bridge on the wapping basin and moved west she dint ought ter ave talked to yer like that scuff replied yer shouldnt a let er get by wi it takes erself liberties she does scuff was right monk had been too relieved to hear someone speak so well of durban that he had ignored the fact that he had allowed her to disparage him and done nothing to assert his authority it was an error that would have to be corrected or he would pay the price later he conceded the point to scuff who was satisfied but took no pleasure in his victory in his own way he was worrying about monk afraid he was not fit to do the job or to look after himself in the dangerous alleys and docksides of his new beat there was a very strict hierarchy and monk was letting his place in it slip ill deal with her monk repeated firmly you watch pearly boy scuff looked up at him i int never met im meself careful not ter but i eard es real nice to yer face an tear yer gizzard open the moment yer int lookin monk smiled you havent heard what they used to say about me when i was in the regular shore police yeah but the anxiety in his manner did not diminish at all was he being tactful afraid for him a little pitying it hurt monk was allowing his concern for durban to erode his skill at his own job it was past time he amended that i will be very careful of pearly boy he assured scuff but i need to find information about him and at the same time let him know that i am no easier to deal with than durban was and no pleasanter scuffs shoulders straightened a little and his step became a trifle cockier but he did not answer six monk could put it off no longer he was at rathbones office when the clerk opened the door before nine in the morning good morning mr monk he said with some surprise and a certain degree of discomfort no doubt he knew more about many things than he ever disclosed even to rathbone himself i am afraid sir oliver is not in yet ill wait monk replied it is of some importance yes sir may i get you a cup of tea monk accepted and thanked him for his thought as soon as he was seated he wondered if the clerk were also concerned that his master whom he had served for eight years that monk knew of was in some kind of moral morass and his life had taken a darker turn or was that whole idea fanciful they were all in a morass monk too he could hardly blame rathbone if pride a professional arrogance had made him take a case even as ugly as phillipss to prove that he could win it he was testing the law to its boundaries holding it of value above the decency that was the ultimate safeguard of everyone on the other hand if monk had not also been so arrogantly sure of his skill he could have let phillips die on the river and none of the rest of it would have happened rathbone came in half an hour later dressed immaculately in pale gray and looking as effortlessly elegant as he always did good morning monk rathbone made it something of a question he seemed undecided exactly what manner to assume a new case monk stood up and followed rathbone into his office it was tidy and casually elegant like its inhabitant there was a cutglass decanter with an ornate silver stopper on the narrow side table two very beautiful paintings of oceangoing ships decorated the one wall on which there were no bookshelves they were small and heavily framed monk knew at a glance that they were very good indeed there was at once a simplicity and a power to them that marked them as different from the usual rathbone saw his glance and smiled but he offered no comment what can i do for you monk monk had rehearsed in his mind what he was going to say and how to begin but now the words seemed contrived revealing the vulnerability of his position and his recent total defeat but he could not stand there saying nothing and there was no point trying to trick rathbone of all people candor at least on the surface was the only possibility im not sure he replied i failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that phillips killed figgis and the crown didnt charge him with blackmail pornography or extortion obviously i cant reopen the first no matter what proof i might find but the others are still available rathbone smiled bleakly i hope you are not looking for me to assist you in that monk opened his eyes wide would that be against the law it would be against the spirit of it rathbone replied if not illegal then certainly unethical monk smiled aware that it was a bleak even sarcastic expression towards whom jericho phillips or the man who paid you to defend him rathbone paled very slightly phillips is despicable he said and if you can prosecute him successfully then you must do so it would be a service to society but my part in the due legal process is to prosecute or defend as i am employed to do but never to judge jericho phillips or anyone else we are equal before the law monk that is the essence of any kind of justice he stood near the mantel shelf leaning his weight rather more on one foot than the other if we are not then justice is destroyed if we charge a man usually we are right but not always the defense is there to safeguard us all against those times when we are wrong sometimes mistakes have been made lies told where we do not expect them evidence tampered with or misused personal hatred or prejudice can be exercised fears favors or selfinterest can govern the testimony every case must be tested if it breaks under the pressure then it is unsafe to convict and unforgivable to punish monk did not interrupt him you loathe phillips rathbone continued a little more at ease now so do i i imagine every decent man and woman in the courtroom did then there is all the more necessity that we must be fair if we of all people allow our revulsion to control our dealing with justice what hope is there for anyone else an excellent speech monk applauded and absolutely true in every regard but incomplete the trial is over i have already conceded that we were slipshod we were so certain phillips was guilty that we left loopholes for you to use which you did we can now never try him again for figs murder any new case would be separate are you warning me that you would defend him again either by choice or from some kind of necessity because you owe him or someone else who has his interests at heart monk changed his position deliberately or possibly you or your principal he continued are bribed coerced or threatened by phillips and feel you have no choice but to defend him in any issue whatever it was a bold even brutal question and the moment he had said it he doubted himself rathbone was now very pale there was no trace of friendship in his eyes did you say bribed he asked i included it as a possibility monk replied keeping his eyes and his voice steady i dont know the man or woman who paid you to defend phillips you do are you certain you know why something in rathbones stance changed it was so slight monk could not identify it but he knew that a new idea had suddenly occurred to rathbone and it was one that troubled him possibly only very little but he was uncomfortable nevertheless you may speculate as you please rathbone answered him his voice almost as level as before almost as assured but you must be aware that i cannot comment my advice to other people is as confidential as is my advice to you of course monk said drily and what is your advice to me i am commander of the river police at wapping i need to prevent the crimes of violence abuse and extortion of pornography and child murder that happen on my beat i made a mess of phillips murdering figgis how do i prevent the next one and the one after rathbone did not answer but he made no attempt to hide the fact that he gave the matter consideration he walked over to his desk our loyalties are different monk he said at last mine is to the law and therefore is larger than yours and i do not mean by that that it is better simply that the law moves slowly and its changes can stand for generations your loyalty is to your job to the people on the river today to their immediate danger or suffering the simple answer is that i cannot advise you your loyalty is not larger monk replied you care for the interests of one man i care for everyone in that community are you certain you want to tie your name and your commitment to that man and therefore to whomever he in turn is bound for whatever reason we all have fears debts hostages to fortune do you know his well enough to pay the price he bit his lip or are they really your own ask me that again monk and i shall take offense i dance to nobody elses tune except the laws rathbones eyes were steady his face utterly without humor or gentleness he drew in his breath and i might equally ask you if you are as certain of durban s loyalties as you would like to be you have tied your reputation and your honor to his is that wise perhaps if i had any advice to give you it would be to think far harder before you continue to pursue that he may have had flaws of which you are unaware the blow cut deep but monk tried not to show it he knew he must leave before the interview became a battle in which too much was said for either of them to retreat afterwards it was on the brink of that point now i didnt expect you to tell me his name or what you know of him he said aloud i came to advise you that in looking more closely into phillipss business i am also learning more of everyone he associated with what he owed them and what they owed him i cannot prosecute him for murdering figgis but i may be able to for pornography and extortion that will obviously lead me much closer to those who patronize his business there is much to suggest that they come from all walks of life even police rathbone said tartly of course monk agreed no one is excluded even women can have much to lose or to fear in those they love and he turned and walked out the door wondering if he had said far more than he wanted to rathbone looked at the closed door with far greater disquiet than he had allowed monk to see monks questions had struck a nerve and far from fading away the unease they had caused was increasing arthur ballinger was margarets father a highly respected attorney with whom it was naturalindeed expectedthat he would do business those facts had dulled his natural edge of inquiry as to why ballinger had handled the subject of phillipss defense for whoever it was who was financing it was it possibly even phillips himself ballinger had said that it was not but as monk had pointed out did ballinger really know rathbone admitted to himself that some of the evidence had shaken him more than he had expected he could no longer dismiss it from his mind or pretend that it was an issue that could be forgotten he knew at least the first step he would take and once that was made he was able to address the rest of the days business seven oclock in the evening found him in a cab on the way up primrose hill on the outskirts of london the evening was bright and warm and the sun was still high enough that there was no gold in the air yet no lengthening haze to the light there was a faint wind in the trees so that the shadows flickered a man was walking his dog and the animal raced around busy with scents and movements in a whole exciting world of its own the cab stopped rathbone alighted paid the driver and walked up the path to his fathers door he always came here when he had issues that troubled him and he needed to explain them clarify the questions so that the answers emerged unclouded he realized now standing on the step aware of the heavy perfume of honeysuckle that since his marriage he had been here a lot less often than before was that because henry rathbone had been so fond of hester and oliver had not wanted him to make the comparison with margaret the fact that he had raised the question was at least in part an answer the door opened and the manservant welcomed him in his face expressionless except for the civility a good butler should always show if anything were needed to confirm that he had been here too seldom lately that was it in the sitting room french doors were open on to a lawn sloping down towards an orchard in full leaf the blossom long finished henry rathbone himself was walking up the grass towards the house he was a tall lean man very slightly stooped he had a mild pointy face and blue eyes that combined both a burning intelligence and a kind of innocence as if he would never really understand the pettier grubbier things of life oliver he said with evident pleasure increasing his pace how very nice to see you what interesting problem brings you here oliver felt a sharp jolt of guilt it was not always comfortable to be known so very well he drew breath to deny that it was a problem that brought him and then realized just in time how foolish that would be henry smiled and came in through the doors have you had supper no not yet good then let us dine together toast brussels sprouts pâté and i have a rather good medoc then apple pie and clotted cream henry suggested and perhaps a spot of decent cheese if you feel like it it sounds perfect oliver felt some of the tension slip away this was probably the best companionship he had ever known gentle without manipulation and also totally honest there were no lies either intellectual or emotional over the meal he would be able to explain primarily to himself the exact nature of his unease henry spoke with his manservant then he and oliver walked the length of the garden to the orchard at the end and watched the light deepen in color as the sky began to burn and fade in the west the perfume of the honeysuckle became stronger there was no sound but the humming of insects and in the distance a child calling out to a dog they ate in the sitting room with the food on a small table between them the french doors still open to the evening air so what is it that disturbs youthe case henry prompted reaching for a second slice of crisp brown toast oliver had avoided mentioning it in fact he could even have let it slide altogether and simply absorbed the peace of the evening but that was cowardly and a solution that would evaporate in a few hours eventually he would have to go home again and in the morning back to the law it was difficult to explain and as always it must be done as if it were all merely hypothetical as he tried to frame it in his mind he became aware that much of the pain he felt was due to the fact that monk and hester were involved and it was their opinion of him their friendship and the damage to it that hurt it concerns a case he began an attorney to whom i owe certain duties and obligations told me that a client of his wished to pay for the defense of a man accused of a particularly appalling crime he said that he feared that the nature of the offense and the mans occupation and reputed character might make it impossible for him to receive a fair trial he would need the best possible representation if justice were to be served he asked me as a favor to him to defend this man henry looked at him steadily oliver found the innocence of his gaze unnerving but he was too experienced an interrogator himself to be maneuvered into speaking before he was ready to henry smiled if you would prefer not to discuss it please dont feel pressured to do so oliver started to protest then changed his mind he had been wrongfooted so easily and it was because he did feel somehow guilty although he did not know of what i accepted he said aloud obviously or i would have no problem wouldnt you henry asked surely you would then have denied a friend to whom you owed something or at least you felt as if you did what had this accused man been charged with doing killing a child deliberately very he tortured him first allegedly i am almost certain that he did in my own mind i have no doubt at the time you took the case there was no judgment in henrys voice oliver stopped for a moment trying to remember how he had felt when ballinger had first asked him and he had reviewed the facts henry waited in silence my reasoning was sophistry oliver admitted unhappily i thought he was very probably guilty but that the law to be perfect must convict him only if it was proven and i sensed an emotional vendetta against him as the driving force behind the case i took the opposing side in order to give it some balance and perhaps out of a little hubris because you have the skill to do it henry asked gently and to show off a little to the man who had asked you you wished to impress him or someone else who will come to know of it you know the case oliver felt foolish as if he had been playacting and been caught at it halfclothed henry smiled not at all but i know you i know your strengths and your weaknesses if you did not feel guilty about it you would not be troubled i assume you won you would always try your best you are incapable of anything else losing justly would not disturb you if the man were guilty winning unjustly is another matter it wasnt unjust oliver said immediately and just as immediately knew that he had spoken too quickly it was not by dishonest means he corrected the prosecution was sloppy too governed by emotion to make certain of all its facts which weakness you knew and used henry extrapolated why does that trouble you oliver looked down at the longfamiliar carpet its reds and blues like stainedglass windows in the last of the sunlight slanting low in through the open doors the evening scent of the honeysuckle was now stronger than the wine again henry waited the silence grew deeper homing birds fluttered up across the darkening color of the sky i knew some of the chief witnesses well enough to use my understanding of them to their disadvantage oliver admitted at last and lost their friendship henry asked very gently did they not understand the necessity that you defend the man to the best of your ability you are his advocate not his judge oliver looked up surprised the question cut closer to the truth than he wished because now he must answer honestly or deliberately choose to lie lying to his father had never been an option it would unalterably destroy the foundation of his own identity his belief in the goodness of what mattered yes they both understood that what they didnt and still dont understand is why i chose to take that case when i didnt have to knowing that the man now cannot be tried again although he will certainly go back to the river and continue with his filthy trade if i am honest i know he will almost certainly kill again i could have left his defense to someone else who would not have had the privileged knowledge i had and would have given him a defense adequate before the law and gained a verdict of guilty which i believe would have been the right one i think that is what an equal contest would have produced henry smiled you credit the mans escape to your superior ability superior knowledge of the emotional involvement of the chief witnesses for the prosecution oliver corrected him are they not by definition always involved oliver hesitated police henry asked monk and hester oliver said quietly staring down at the carpet they cared about the boys murder too much to be thorough it was durban s one unfinished case before he died too many debts of love and honor involved he looked up and met his fathers eyes and you used them henry concluded yes and your own debt of honor that caused you to take the case does monk know of that i imagine he will find out perhaps you had better find out first yourself have you perhaps caused monk to pay your debt to someone no no i paid more than i owed because i wanted to be comfortable oliver said with sudden lacerating honesty it was to margarets father because i wanted to please her at hesters expense oliver knew why his father had asked that and exactly why the hurt was there in his voice henry had always liked hester better he tried to hide it he was fond of margaret and would have been kind to any woman oliver had married but margaret could never make him laugh as hester had nor would he feel comfortable enough with her to argue for fun or tell long rambling tales of gentle adventure and dry humor margaret had dignity and grace morality and honor but she had not hesters intelligence nor her passion was she less or more vulnerable henry was watching his son closely he saw the change in his eyes hester will survive anything you can do to her oliver he said that is not to say that she may not be hurt oliver remembered hesters face as she had stood in the witness box the pain and surprise on it she had not expected him to do such a thing either to her or to monk guilt henry asked him or fear that you have forfeited her good opinion of you that was the crux of it he was startled at how sharply it cut he had frayed a tie that had been part of his happiness for a long time he was not sure if it would eventually break altogether she asked me if i knew where the money to pay me had come from he said aloud and how it had been earned do you i know who paid it to me of course but i dont know who his client is or why he should wish the accused man to be defended and since i dont know who ballingers client is naturally i dont know where the money came from he looked at the floor i suppose im afraid it could be the accused mans own money and i certainly know how that was made by extortion and pornography i see henry said quietly what is the decision you have to make oliver looked up i beg your pardon henry repeated the question oliver thought for several moments actually im not sure perhaps there is no decision except how i am going to come to terms with myself i defended the man and i took the money for it i cant give it back i could donate it to some charitable cause but that doesnt undo anything and if i am remotely honest it wouldnt salve my conscience either it smacks of hypocrisy he smiled very slightly a small selfmocking gesture perhaps i simply wanted to confess i wanted to not feel alone in my sense of having done something vaguely questionable something i think i may well be increasingly unhappy about i believe so henry agreed to admit that you are unsatisfied is a step forward it takes far less energy to confess an error than it does to keep trying to hide it would you like another glass of medoc we might as well finish the bottle and the pie too if you care to i think there is a spot more cream rathbone arrived home quite late and was startled to find margaret still up he was even more surprised unpleasantly so to realize that he had counted on her being asleep so that any explanation of his absence could be put off until the following morning by that time he would be in a hurry to leave for his office and could avoid the subject again she looked tired and anxious yet she was trying to conceal it she was worried because she did not know what to say to him he knew it and wanted to touch her tell her that such worries were superficial and of no lasting importance but it seemed an unnatural thing to do he realized with a jarring loneliness that they did not know each other well enough intimately enough to overcome such reservations of the mind you must be tired she said a little stiffly have you had supper yes thank you i dined with my father now he would have to find an explanation as to why he had gone to primrose hill without taking her he could not tell her the truth and he resented having put himself in the position where he needed to lie this was undignified and ridiculous he was also suddenly and painfully aware that he would have told hester the truth they might have quarreled over it even shouted at each other in the end they would have gone to bed at opposite ends of the house desperately miserable then at some point he would have gotten up and gone to her and resumed the quarrel because he could not bear to live with it as it was emotion would have overridden sense and pride need of her would have been stronger than the need for dignity or the fear of making a fool of himself her ability to be hurt would have been more important than his own margaret was more selfcontrolled she would ache quietly within and he would never be certain of it it would not show on her calmer prettier more traditional face that was what made her safer for him a far more comfortable and suitable wife than hester would ever have been he had never needed to worry that margaret would say or do anything that would embarrass him now he owed her an explanation something resembling the truth and yet not exposing her to the knowledge that her father had put him in the position of defending phillips as a favor she did not ever need to know that in fact unless ballinger told her she must not it was a professional confidence i needed to discuss a case he said aloud hypothetically of course i see she said coolly she felt excluded and the feeling was too raw for her to hide it he must say more if i had explained it to you you would have known who it was which would have broken a confidence he added that at least was true i could not do that she wanted to believe him her eyes widened hope stirring did it help perhaps at least i understand my problem a little more clearly the process of thought required to explain sometimes clarifies the mind she decided to leave it while she had some form of comfort rather than press for more im glad would you like a cup of tea it was a politeness something to say she did not want him to accept he could hear that in her tone no thank you it is quite late i think i shall simply go to bed she smiled very slightly i too good night while monk was busy with scuffs help searching for further evidence of the darker side of phillipss trade hester set out to learn more about durbans past including such family as he might have had she needed to know because she was afraid of what monk might find out that would hurt him and by extension eventually the river police and that would hurt him even more she understood loyalty within a service and how in dangerous circumstances where mens lives were often in jeopardy loyalty must be absolute commanding officers were seldom afforded the luxury of time in which to ask or answer questions and they did not explain themselves they expected obedience the army could not function without it an officer who did not inspire loyalty in his men was ultimately a failure whether or not that loyalty was warranted by either his ability or his character she walked down grays inn road towards high holborn it was hot and dusty and her skirt was already grimed at the hem she was passed by traffic its wheels rattling over the cobbles the sun glinting on polished harnesses and brass four huge shire horses passed slowly pulling a brewers dray cabs clattered by in the opposite direction their horses hooves loud long whips curling in the air above the horses ears an open landau offered a glimpse of summer fashion pale parasols to keep skin fair the sound of laughter the bright silk of a puffed sleeve and satin ribbons in the breeze hester thought of blind loyalty in the army the unquestioning obedience perhaps the alternative was chaos but she had seen the death and it had stunned her bruised her heart and mind forever she had been on the heights of sebastopol during the crimean war and watched the slaughter at the charge of the light brigade into the russian guns she had tried afterwards to rescue some of the few mangled but still alive the senselessness of it still overwhelmed her she was very uncertain that she would give blind loyalty to anyone she had tasted its cost at the bottom of grays inn road she turned into high holborn and walked to the left when there was a lull in the traffic she crossed over kept walking and then turned right into castle street she knew exactly where she was going and for whom she was looking still it took her another half hour to find him but she was delighted when she learned the reason she was told at his lodgings that he had obtained a job as a clerk at a trading house a skill he had acquired since losing a leg in the crimea nine years ago at that time even writing his name had been a challenge to his literacy when she arrived at the trading house she controlled her urgency as well as she could but the head clerk still looked at her dubiously chewing his lip as he considered whether he would give permission for one of his employees to stop work and speak with her she smiled please she said with as much charm as she could muster i was the nurse who looked after him when he lost his leg at sebastopol im trying to find another man or at least learn where to look and i think mr fenneman could help me well yes of course the head clerk said nervously i i suppose a few moments wouldnt hurt sebastopol really he never said you know people dont like talking about it she explained it was pretty dreadful ive heard others talk he argued so have i she agreed usually they were not there they only heard about it from tales the ones who saw it say nothing i dont actually like talking about it myself and i only experienced the aftermath searching among the dead for those still alive that we might be able to help the head clerk shuddered his face a little paler ill fetch mr fenneman for you fenneman appeared a few moments later he was thinner than the last time she had seen him and of course no longer in army uniform he had a wooden peg fitted to the stump of his lost leg a little above the knee and he moved with one crutch balancing quite efficiently she still felt a little sick when she remembered the agile young man he had been and the desperate struggle she had had to save him it had been she who had actually sawn through the bone in the shattered remnants of his leg unable even to render him unconscious during the agony of it but she had stopped the bleeding and with help gotten him from the battlefield to the hospital now his face lit with pleasure at seeing her miss latterly fancy finding you here in london mr potts said as i could help you id be happy to in any way i can he stood in front of her smiling leaning sideways a little to level his weight on his crutch she wondered whether to ask if there was somewhere he could sit and decided against it he sat at his work and it might insult him obliquely if she took such notice of his disability as to instantly suggest that he could not stand its good to see you looking so well she said instead and with a good job he blushed but it was with selfconscious pleasure im looking for information about a man who died about the turn of the year she hurried on aware that the head clerk would be watching the seconds tick by his name was durban he was commander of the river police at wapping and i believe you grew up in shadwell he never spoke about himself so i hardly know where to begin to look for his family can you suggest anyone who might help me durban he said thoughtfully cant say i know anything about his family or where he came from but i heard he was a good man but corporal miller dyou remember him little man with red hair and we called him dusty but then we call all millers dusty he smiled at the recollection in spite of his lost leg his memories of the companionship in army life were still good i can give you the names of two or three others if you like yes please she accepted quickly and where i can find them if you know that he swung around on his crutch and moved rapidly back to the bench where he worked he wrote on a sheet of paper dipping his quill in the inkwell and concentrating on his penmanship he returned several moments later and handed her the sheet covered with beautiful script letters he was watching her pride in his face anxious to see if she observed his achievement she said the names and addresses and looked up at him thank you she said sincerely i know now if i ever want a job as a clerk not to come here this standard is something i couldnt achieve seeing you has lightened a dark day for me ill go and look for these men thank you he blinked a little uncertain what to say and ended by simply smiling back it took her the rest of the day and half the next one but she gained bits and pieces from all the men whose names fenneman had given her and gathered a picture of durban s own account of his youth apparently he had been born in essex his father john durban had been headmaster of a boys school there and his mother a happy and contented woman about the home and the schoolhouse it had been a large family several sisters and at least one brother who had been a captain in the merchant navy travelling the south seas and the coast of africa there was no hint of darkness at all and durban s own official police record was exemplary the village of his birth was only a few miles away along the thames estuary it was still barely past noon she could be there by two oclock find the schoolhouse and the parish church look at the records and be home before dark she felt a twinge of guilt at the whisper of caution that drove her to do it this was durban s own account she would never have doubted him before the trial and the questions rathbone had awoken in her but the lean intelligent face of oliver rathbone kept coming back into her mind and the necessity to check to prove to be able to answer every question with absolute certainty she spent the money and traveled in a crowded carriage out to the stop nearest the village and then walked the last couple of miles in the wind and sun the water of the estuary glinting bright to the south she went to the schoolhouse and to the church there was no record whatsoever of anyone named durban no births no deaths no marriages the schoolhouse had every headmasters name on its board from to the present date there was no durban she felt sick confused and very afraid for monk as she walked back towards the railway station and the journey home the road was suddenly hard her feet hot and sore the light on the water was no longer beautiful and she did not notice the sails of the barges coming and going the ache inside herself for the lies and the disillusion ahead outweighed such peripheral physical things and the question beat in her mind over and overwhy what did the lies conceal in the morning feet still aching she was at the clinic on portpool lane intensely relieved that margaret was not present who perhaps just now found their meetings as unhappy as hester did she had visited all the patients they currently had and attended to a little stitching of wounds and the repair of a dislocated shoulder when claudine came into the room and closed the door behind her her eyes were bright and she was slightly flushed she did not wait for hester to speak ive got a woman in one of the bedrooms she said urgently she came in last night she has a knife wound and bled rather badly hester was alarmed you didnt tell me why didnt you have me see her she rose to her feet is she shes all right claudine said quickly motioning for hester to sit down again shes not nearly as bad as i let her think she is i spread the blood on to a lot of clothes so it would look dreadful and she would be afraid to leave claudine what on earth now hester was frightened not only for the woman but for claudines sanity claudine interrupted her her face even more flushed i needed to speak to you privately before you go to her she might be able to tell you something important if you go about it the right way she barely paused for breath she knows jericho phillipshas for a long time since he was a child knew durban a bit also really now she had hesters entire attention where is she she had started towards the door by the time claudine replied and had her hand on the knob before she turned back to thank her her own voice now also filled with urgency claudine smiled it was a start but she knew it could still prove fruitless she needed to help hester walked quickly along the corridor up a flight of stairs and along another even narrower hall until she came to the last quite goodsized room at the end it was out of the way of the normal traffic within the clinic sometimes they used it for people who had infectious illnesses or for those they feared were terminally ill it was large enough for a second cot where a nurse could catch short naps so as not to leave anyone alone in their last hours the woman inside was far from dying claudine had indeed made it look dramatic there were still bloodstained clothes and bandages lying in a basin and padding sitting on the small table needles and silk for stitching wounds and a carafe of water the woman looked frightened lying in the bed with her head propped on pillows and her injured arm lying swathed in bandages beside her although she had good color in her cheeks and none of the holloweyed stare of the desperately injured hello hester said softly closing the door behind her my name is mrs monk ive come to look at your wound and see what i can do for you whats your name mina the woman said hoarsely fear choking her voice hester felt a strong twinge of guilt but did not allow it to alter her intent she pulled up the hardbacked chair until she was close enough to the bed to work comfortably then began as gently as she could to unwind the bandages and examine the wound without taking off the final gauze which would certainly start it bleeding again claudine had done a very good job of cleaning it and stitching the raw edges together the jagged knife slash was not as deep or as dangerous as mina had been allowed to believe hester began to talk casually as if merely to take minas mind from what she was doing it was a rule of the clinic never to ask patients for details they were unwilling to give unless it was necessary for the treatment of whatever was wrong with them sometimes the conditions of where they lived mattered very much especially if it was mainly on the streets with no bed no shelter no water and only such food as they could beg then they would keep them in until they were considerably better one or two had even remained here as permanent help paid with lodging and food often the sudden new and respectable occupation was a benefit beyond price after the usual account of her circumstances in answer to a question from hester mina went on to describe certain aspects of her daily life including some dangerous clients past and present and you really know jericho phillips hester said in awe yeah i know im mina replied with a smile it was oddly attractive in spite of a chipped front tooth no doubt also sustained in a fight e werent that bad at least for business your business or his hester asked with a smile mine mina said indignantly i int got nothin ter do wif is hester refused to allow her imagination to picture it she concentrated on examining the wound most of the bleeding had stopped it only seeped through the stitches but it looked raw and painful she kept talking both to probe for information and to keep minas mind off the pain as she cleaned away the dried blood and closed the edges of the flesh a little more cutting away bloodied gauze i suppose youve seen a side of him nobody else has she remarked oh i int the only one mina found that amusing i just mebbe knowd im longer but i got more sensen ter say so dont like bein reminded o the past e dont rotten poor e were always cold an ungry an knocked about summink wicked is ma were a bad one temper like one o them rats wot comes out o the sewers sometimes fight anyone what about his father hester asked mina laughed came off some ship an then got right back on it she answered drily keeping her eyes tightly closed in case she accidentally caught sight of the wound lived down by the river almost in the water e did always cold poor little sod now e goes barmy if e ears anythin drippin but he lives in a boat hester protested yeah daft int it mina agreed i knew a feller once oo were scared stiff o rats dreamed about em e did woke up sweatin like a pig ear im screamin sometimes send yer blood cold it would made isself keep a rat in a cage right there in is room could ear the bleedin thing scrapin its silly little feet an squeakin she shivered convulsively without realizing it moving her arm so that hester momentarily held the scissors away do you think thats what jericho phillips does with the water she asked curiously she imagined a man forcing himself to live with his haunting fears until he had inured himself to them and no longer panicked it was the ultimate control in some ways that might be the most frightening thing about him she started to rebandage the wound as gently as she could while thinking of the bullied child afraid of the cold afraid of dripping water who had grown into a cruel man steeled against every weakness above all his own she was not sure if she could pity him or not are you frightened of him she asked mina when she was nearly finished mina kept her eyes closed nah keep me mouf shut do wot e wants an e pays good int me e ates hester put a few stitches in to keep the bandage from unraveling who does he hate she asked durban mina replied he was only doing his job like all the river police hester pointed out you can open your eyes now ive finished mina looked at it with admiration yer make shirts an all she asked no i only stitch skin and bandages im not very good at anything more than mending yer talk like yer ad servants ter do it for yer mina remarked i used to on ard times are yer there was sympathy in minas voice yer want money fer that she indicated her arm i int got none but ill pay yer when i ave no i dont want money thank you youre welcome to a little help hester replied did phillips hate durban in particular i think durban hunted him pretty hard course e did mina agreed ated each other dint they hester felt the chill back inside her why natural i spose mina gave a slight shrug on her uninjured side grew up together dint they durban done good an phillips done bad gotter ate each other dont they hester said nothing her mind was whirling crowded with lies and truths dishonor and light fear and gaping unanswered questions gently she finished the rebandaging putting the old gauze and linen aside to be washed seven monk sat quietly in the parlor and went through all durban s notes yet again and found nothing in them that he had not seen before so many pages held just a word or two reminders in a train of thought that was gone forever now the only man who might be able to make sense of it was orme and so far his loyalty had kept him silent about all except the most obvious hesitantly and with deep unhappiness hester had told monk what the prostitute mina had said about jericho phillips and finally whitefaced she had added that durban had grown up in the same area the whole story of the schoolmaster and the happy family living in a village on the estuary was a dream something he created out of his own hungers for things he had never known hester had knotted her hands and blinked back sudden tears as she had told him monk had wanted to disbelieve it what was a blank school registry a parish record the word of an injured prostitute compared with his own knowledge of a man like durban who had served the river police for a quarter of a century he had earned the love and loyalty of his men the respect of his superiors and the healthy fear of criminals great and small the length of the river and yet monk did believe it he felt guilty as if it were a kind of betrayal he was turning his back on a friend when there was no one else to defend him what did that say of monk that he was weak in faith and loyalty placing himself first or a realist who knew that even the best of men have their flaws their times of temptation and vulnerability he could argue with himself forever and resolve nothing it was time to look harder for the truth to stop using loyalty to justify evading it he put the papers away and found orme but it was late in the morning before they were alone where there would be no interruption they had very satisfactorily solved a warehouse robbery and the thieves had been arrested orme stood on the dock near the king edward stairs as monk finished congratulating him on the arrest thank you sir orme acknowledged the men did a good job your men monk pointed out orme stood a trifle straighter our men sir monk smiled feeling worse about what he had to do there was no time to delay it he liked orme and he needed his loyalty more than that he admitted he wanted his respect but leadership was not about what you wanted there would not be a better time to ask maybe not another time at all today how well did durban know phillips mr orme orme drew in his breath then studied monks face and hesitated i have a good idea already monk told him i want your view of it was figs death the beginning no sir orme stood more stiffly the gesture was not one of insolencethere was nothing defiant in his facejust a stiffening against an awaited pain when was the beginning i dont know sir thats the truth ormes eyes were clear so far back then orme flushed he had given himself away without meaning to it was obvious in his tightened lips and squared shoulders that he also saw that monk knew and that evasions were no longer possible it would have to be the truth or a deliberate planned lie but orme was not a man who could lie unless it were to save life and even then it would not come lightly monk hated everything that had put him in the position of having to do this he still did not wish to give away durban s own lies about his youth orme might guess that was different from knowing when was the first time you knew it was personal monk asked he phrased it carefully orme took a deep breath the sounds and movement of the river were all around them the ships swaying in the fastrunning tide the water lapping on the stones light in evershifting patterns reflected again and again birds wheeling and crying overhead the clank of chains the grind of winches men shouting in the distance about four years ago sir orme replied or maybe five what happened how was it different from what youd seen before orme shifted his balance he was very clearly uncomfortable monk waited him out one minute it was just mr durban asking questions the next minute the whole air of it changed an they were shouting at each other orme replied then before you could do anything about it phillips had a knife outgreat long thing it was with a curved blade he was swinging it wide he gestured with his own arm like he meant to kill mr durban but mr durban saw it coming an moved aside he swerved with his body mimicking the action there was both strength and grace in it what he was describing became more real go on monk urged orme was unhappy go on monk ordered obviously he didnt kill durban what happened why did he want to was durban accusing him of something another boy killed who stopped phillips you no sir mr durban stopped him himself right how how did durban stop a man like phillips coming at him with a knife did he apologize back off no orme was offended at the thought did he fight back yes with a knife yes sir he was carrying a knife and he was good enough with it to hold off a man like jericho phillips monks surprise showed in his voice he could not have done that himself at least he thought he could not have possibly in the closedup past further back than his memory he had learned such things orme yes sir yes he was phillips was good but mr durban was better he fought him right back to the edge of the water sir then he drove him into it half drowned phillips was and in a rage fit to kill us all if he could have monk remembered what hester had told him about phillips and the water and about being cold had durban known that had orme he looked across at ormes face and tried to read it he was startled to see not only reluctance but also a certain kind of stubbornness he knew he could not break and he realized he did not want to something innate in the man would be damaged he also saw a kind of pity and knew without any doubt that he was not only protecting durban s memory he was protecting monk as well he knew monks vulnerability his need to believe in durban orme was trying to keep a truth from him because he would be hurt by it they stood facing each other in the sun and the wind the smell of the tide and the swirl and slap of the water why did that make you think they knew each other monk asked it was only part of the question allowing orme to avoid the answer if he wanted to orme cleared his throat he relaxed so very slightly it was almost invisible what they said sir dont remember the words exactly something about what they knew and remembered that sort of thing monk thought about asking if they had known each other long since youth maybe and then he decided against it orme would only say that he did not hear anything like that monk understood the water was the answer the cold and phillipss hatred hesters prostitute was not lying thank you mr orme he said quietly i appreciate your honesty yes sir orme totally relaxed at last together they turned and walked back towards wapping for the next two days monk called into the station only to keep track of the regular work of the police reluctantly he took scuff with him scuff himself was delighted he was quite aware that some of the earlier errands had been to keep him safe rather than because they needed doing monk had imagined himself tactful and was somewhat taken aback to find that scuff had read him so easily he certainly could not apologize at least not openly but he would be less clumsy in the future at least in part because scuff was so determined to prove his value and his ability to take care not only of himself but of monk also their paths crossed durban s several times he had learned the names of almost a dozen boys of various ages who had ended up in phillipss care surely among them there must have been at least two or three willing to testify against him they followed one trail after another up and down both banks of the river questioning people searching for others at one point monk found himself in a fine old building at the legal quay he stood with scuff in a woodenpaneled room with polished tables and floorboards worn uneven with the tread of feet over a century and a half it smelled of tobacco and rum and he almost felt as if he could hear ageold arguments from the history of the river echoing in the tight closed air scuff stared around him eyes wide i int never been in ere before he said softly wot der they do ere then argue the law monk answered in ere i thought they did that in courts maritime law monk explained to do with who can ship things laws of import and export weights and measures salvage at sea that sort of thing who unloads and what duty is owed to the revenue scuff pulled a face of disgust dragging his mouth down at the corners lot o thieves he replied shouldnt believe a thing they tell yer were looking for a man whose daughter died and whose grandson disappeared hes a clerk here they found the clerk a sad pinchfaced man in his fifties how would i know he said miserably when monk began his questions mr durban asked me the same things an i gave im the same answers molls usband got killed on the docks when billy were about two year old she married again to a great brute wot treated er real ard beat billy till e broke is bones poor little beggar his face was white and his eyes were wretched at the memory and his own helplessness to alter it werent nothin i could do broke my arm when i tried off work for two months i were damn near starved billy ran off when e were about five i eard phillips took im in an fed im reglar kept im warm gave im a bed an far as i know e never beat im i let it be like i told mr durban it were better than ed ad before better than nothin what happened to moll monk asked then instantly wished he had not took ter the streets o course the clerk answered wot else could she do kept movin so e wouldnt find er but e did killed er wi a knife mr durban got im for that anged e were he blinked away tears i went an watched gave the angman sixpence to ave a drink on me but i never found billy monk did not reply there hardly seemed anything to say that was not trite and in the end meaningless there must be many boys like billy and phillips used them but would their lives without him have been any better or longer monk and scuff ate hot meat pies sitting by the dockside in the noise of unloading watching the lightermen coming and going across the water there was a long apprenticeship to the craft of steering them and monk watched them with a certain admiration there was not only skill but also a peculiar grace in the way they balanced leaned pushed realigned their weight and did it again there was steady noise around them as they ate their pies and drank from tin mugs of tea winches ground up and down with the clang of chains dockers shouted at one another lumpers carried kegs and boxes and bales there was the occasional jingle of harness and clatter of hooves as horses backed up with heavily loaded drays and then the rattle of wheels on the stone the rich exotic aroma of spices and the gagging smell of raw sugar drifted across from another wharf mixed with the stinging salt and fish and weed of the tide and now and then the stench of hides once or twice scuff looked at monk as if he were going to say something then changed his mind monk wondered if he were trying to find a way to tell him that boys like billy were better off with phillips than frozen or starved to death in some warehouse yard i know he said abruptly eh scuff was caught by surprise it isnt all one way we arent going to get boys like billy to tell us anything scuff sighed and took another huge bite of his pie would you like another one monk asked him scuff hesitated unused to generosity and not willing to chance his luck monk was not hungry but he lied i do if you fetch one for me you might as well get one for yourself oh well scuff considered for about a second then stood up dont mind if i do he held out his hand for the money dyer want another cup o tea an all thank you monk replied i dont mind if i do it took them quite a while to find a boy willing to speak to them and it was orme who finally succeeded it was in one of the alleys close to the water the passageway was so narrow a tall man could stretch his arms and touch both sides at the same time and the buildings almost met at the roof edges creating the claustrophobic feeling of a series of tunnels it was crowded with shops bakers chandlers ships outfitters ropemakers tobacconists pawnbrokers brothels cheap lodging houses and taverns there were openings into workshops and yards for the making mending or fitting of every piece of wood metal canvas rope or fabric that had to do with the sea and its cargo or its trade the wood creaked and settled water dripped footsteps sounded uneasily and the shadows on the walls were always moving sometimes it was caused by light from the shifting tide in a dock inlet water slapping against stone walls or the thump of timber against the sides more often it was someone running or creeping or carrying a load the stench of river mud and human waste was overpowering the boy refused to be named he was thin and sallow it was hard to tell his age but it was probably somewhere between fifteen and twenty he had a chipped front tooth and one finger missing on his right hand he stood with his back to the wall staring at them as if expecting an attack i int swearing ter nothin he said defensively if e finds me ell kill me his voice wobbled ow dyer find me anyway he looked first at monk then at orme ignoring scuff from mr durbans notes orme answered its worth two shillings to you to answer truthfully then well forget we ever saw you answer wot i dunno nothin you know why so few boys ever run away monk told him young ones we can understand theyve nowhere to go and are too small to look after themselves what about older ones fourteen or fifteen if you dont want to go to sea why not simply leave customers are coming and going from the ship arent they couldnt you go out with one of them he cant keep you locked up all the time the boy gave him a look of withering contempt theres twenty of us or more we cant all go some are scared some are sick some are just babes where can we go ood feed us get us clothes give us a place ter sleep ood ide us from phillips or is like theres just as bad on shore youre on shore now and safe from him and im not talking about the young ones i asked about boys your age monk pressed him why dont they go one by one before he sells them to a ship the boys face was bitter you mean whyd e kill fig an reilly an them like that cause they stood up agin im its a lesson see do as yer told an yerll be all right fed somewhere ter sleep shoes and a jacket mebbe a new one every year make trouble an yerll get yer throat cut escape monk reminded him the boy gulped his thin face twisting painfully escape an ell unt yer down an kill yer but before that ell urt the little kids left beind burn their arms an legs maybe worse i wake up in the night earin em scream an find its just rats but i still ear em in me ead thats why i wish i adnt left but i cant go back now but i int swearin ter nothin i told mr durban that an im tellin you yer cant make me i never thought to try monk said gently i couldnt live with it either i have enough already without adding that i just wanted to know he fished in his pocket and pulled out the two shillings orme had promised the boy he held them out the boy hesitated then snatched them monk stood aside so he could pass the boy hesitated monk backed further away the boy dived past him as if terrified he would be seized then he ran with surprising speed almost silent on the cobbles only then did monk realize his feet were bound in rags not boots within seconds he had disappeared into one of the many alleys like a tunnel mouth and he could have been no more than the voice of a nightmare as they walked back towards the open air of the dockside they kept in step with each other walking single file because there was no room to do anything else monk went first glad of the enforced silence between them what the boy had said was hideous but he never questioned the truth of it it explained not only why no one had testified against phillips but also why durban had been fired by an uncontrollable anger helplessness and a sense of the terror and pain the sheer despair of others had drowned the outside world and its balance its values of caution and judgment monk felt closer to durban as he made his way along the tortuous alleys following memory and the sound of water yard by yard towards the open river he understood not only his actions but also the emotions that must have crowded his mind and made his muscles clench and his stomach churn he shared the anger the need to hurt someone in return for all the wrong but was monk remembering him as he had really been or was grief painting it in warmer colors of companionship than reality he did not believe that it was not only dishonest it was also cowardly to pretend now that the sense of friendship had been artificial he could still hear durban s voice and his laughter taste the bread and beer and feel the companionable silence as dawn came up over the river they watched the light spread across the water catching the ripples and brightening on the drifting mist that hid some of the harsher outlines lending beauty to the crooked spars of a wreck and blurring the jagged line of utilitarian buildings scuff was immediately behind him now padding along looking warily to either side narrowness frightened him he did not want to think about what hid in the passages he had heard what the boy said about the others that phillips had taken he knew it could happen to him also without monk it could happen very easily he wanted to reach out and take hold of monks coat but that would be a very undignified thing to do and it would tell everybody that he was afraid he would not like orme to think that of him and he could not bear it if monk did he might even tell hester and that would be worse still they worked for several more days questioning lightermen ferrymen dockers and mudlarks they found thieves and beggars heavy horsemen and opulent receivers asking each about durban and his pursuit of phillips it took them upstream and down both sides of the river on docksides and into warehouses alleys shops taverns dosshouses and brothels on one occasion the search for information took monk and scuff into the strangers home in limehouse it was a handsome and commodious building on the west india dock road cor scuff said deeply impressed by the entrance he stared up and round at the sheer size of it so utterly different from the narrow and squalid houses they had been in earlier where men slept a dozen to a room they were passed by an african seaman his smooth dark skin like a polished nut against his white shirt almost on his heels came a malay in striped trousers and an old pea jacket walking with a slight roll as if still aboard ship scuff stood transfixed he heard a score of languages and dialects around him in the main room crowded with men of every shade of skin and cast of feature monk yanked him by the hand to waken him from his daydream and halfdragged him towards the man he was seeking a seaman from madras who had apparently given durban information several times oh yes sir yes the seaman agreed when monk put the question to him certainly i spoke to mr durban on several occasions he was seeking to apprehend a very bad man which is uncommonly difficult when the man is protected by the fact that he is using children who are too frightened of him to speak out why did he ask you monk said without preamble the man raised his eyebrows there are certain men that i know you see not from any choice of course but in a way of business mr durban thought i might be aware of earlier how shall i express it weaknesses do you understand me sir monk had neither time nor patience for obliqueness patrons of phillipss boat and its entertainment the man winced at monks bluntness exactly so it seemed to me that he had the belief that certain of these men had great influence when it came to bringing the law into such matters and quite naturally a strong desire that it remain a private affair among phillips these gentlemen and the children they abused monk said brutally quite so i see that you understand entirely and were you able to help him the man shrugged i gave him names and instances but i have no proof what names monk said urgently certain harbormasters revenue men the owner of a brothel a merchant who is also a receiver although very few know it another name he looked for was the master of a ship who came ashore and set up his own importing business friend of a revenue man so mr durban said that sounds more like corruption of the revenue than anything to do with phillips monk answered oh it was about phillips the seaman insisted mr durban almost had im two or three times then the evidence just vanished away like mist when the sun comes up you can see it happen but you can never put your hand on it do you see he shook his head mr phillipss goods are not cheap to buy at least not the ones he sells on his dirty little boat the men who buy them have money and power comes from money thats why mr phillips is very difficult to catch in the hangmans noose monk asked more questions and the man answered him but when monk rose to leave closely followed by scuff he was not certain how much more he knew all kinds of men were involved and at least some of them had the power to protect phillips from the river police yer better be careful scuff said his voice tight and a little high with anxiety he had abandoned even trying to look as if he were not frightened he kept pace with monk now putting in an extra little step every so often to make up for his shorter stride them revenue men is summink wicked get them on yer tail an yer might never get out o trouble mebbe thats why mr durban backed off like maybe monk agreed the day after that scuff accompanied orme and monk went alone to pursue the few friends or informants he had gained in the short time he had been on the river he began with smiler hobbs a dour north countryman whose lugubrious face had earned him his nickname wot are yer after now smiler asked when monk walked into his pawnshop and closed the door behind him i got nothin stolen an dont yer stand there like the judgment o the almighty yer put off me customers worse than buildin next to a garbage dump yer are good morning to you also smiler monk replied making his way through the piles of pots and pans musical instruments flat irons several chairs and an endless variety of odd china ill go as soon as i learn what i want to know then yer in fer a long wait cause i int got nowt stolen an i dont know nowt about owt smiler glared at him of course you dont and as to what you havent got i dont care monk responded smiler looked surprised then his eyes narrowed monk remained exactly where he was but i could always become interested he observed nice sextant you have there pity it isnt at sea doing some good smilers expression became even more dismal as if he were staring at the ultimate disaster when mr durban was trying to prove that jericho phillips was responsible for the boys death did he speak to you about it monk asked which boys death smiler retorted monk was about to snap back with figs name then he saw the wider opportunity and seized it reilly he replied or any of the others e asked everyone smiler told him like i said i know nowt about it or anythin else i buy things as people need ter sell an i sell things they need ter buy public service it is i know you do i need to buy information i dont give away nowt neither do i monk agreed at least not often you tell me what i want to know and ill pay you by not coming back here to keep on asking smiler pulled down the corners of his mouth until his face was a mask of tragedy no better than durban yer arent pick on the easy ones an twist them an all the while creatures like phillips pearly boy an the fat man cut peoples throats like they was rats an wot do yer lot do about it nowt absolutely bloody nowt the fat mans dead monk told him yeah maybe smiler was skeptical for certain monk responded truthfully i saw him go down and i know for sure he never came up i was there smiler gave a long sigh then yer done summink right fer once but yer made an almighty mess o gettin phillips i spose someone got ter yer too just like they did ter durban yer cant beat the devil yerll learn if yer live long enough he sighed again which i doubt monk swallowed who got to durban ow do i know smiler asked sadly arbormaster magistrates men with money and their heads in politics lumpers fer all i know judges too yer cut off one arm an while yer lookin for the second one itll grow the first one back again yerll not win yerll just end up dead like durban no onell care theyll say yer were a fool and theyll be right they wont say i didnt try smiler pulled an exaggerated expression curling his lips downwards an what goodll that do yer in yer grave im going to see phillips hang i promise you monk said rashly he could feel the rage boil up inside him and see in his mind phillipss sneering face in the dock as the verdict came in yerd best slit is throat if yer can catch im smiler advised yerll not catch him fair any more than durban did after im like a terrier with a rat one minute an the next he backed off like ed been bit isself then six months later back after im again then out of the blue sky ands off an leave im alone as if e were the lord mayor o the river durban dint call the tune i can promise you that an neither will yer for all yer swank coat an yer quality boots yerll end up just like im bitin yer own tail ill give yer ten shillings fer them boots if yer dont ruin em first so someones protecting him monk said acidly ill get them too and ill keep my boots smiler gave a sharp bark that with him passed for laughter yer dont even know oo they are an before yer start threatening me like durban did i take bloody good care not ter know either offers open on the boots who is mary webber gawd not yer too smiler rolled his eyes i got no idea i never eard of er till durban came threatenin everyone with gawd knows what if we didnt tell im i dunno his voice rose sharply aggrieved get it i dunno now get out of ere an leave me to do me business before i set the dog on yer by accident like i keep im on a chain but sometimes i think it int too strong not my fault not that thatll elp yer much monk retreated his mind crowded with thoughts he was quite sure smiler would lie if it suited him but what he had said fit in too well with the facts so far durban was not the simple man that monk had thought and that he had wanted him to be he crossed the road and turned back towards shadwell high street yet monk could remember the man he had known vividly his patience his candor the way he unquestioningly shared food and warmth his optimism his compassion for even the most wretched could it all have been a lie even his laughter he shivered even though the sun was bright off the water and the air was warm there was a sound of music in the distance from a hurdygurdy somewhere out of sight what a living hell this world was but for boys like fig and perhaps reilly and any number of others whose names he would never know there had been no choice and no escape except death no wonder durban had done everything he could to catch phillips and have him hanged even at the cost of bending a few rules or that the men who had already paid so much paid even more to protect their provider and tormentor it gave new layers to the concept of corruption who had paid oliver rathbone to defend this man in court and why monk was on the open dock now not far from wapping the tide was rising and the water lapped over the stone steps creeping higher and higher the smell of it was harsh and yet he had become accustomed to it welcomed it this was the greatest maritime highway in the world beautiful and terrible in all its moods at night its poverty and dirt were hidden lights of ships from africa and the pole china and barbados danced on the tides the city domed and towered was black against the stars at dawn it would be misted softened by silver fastrunning waters glittering there were moments in the flare of sunset when it could have been venice the dome of st paul s above the shadows a marble palace floating on the lagoon towards the silk roads of the east the sea lanes of the world met here the glory the squalor the heroism and the vice of all humanity mixed with the riches of every nation known to man he faced the question deliberately what would monk have done were it someone he loved who faced exposure and ruin from phillips would he have protected them belief in your ideals was one thing but when it was a living human being who trusted you or perhaps deepest of all who loved and protected you in your need that was different could you turn away was your own conscience more precious than their lives did you owe loyalty to the dead yes of course you did you did not forget someone the moment the last breath left their lips he looked around the skyline to the north and south and across the teeming water this was a city of memories built of the great men and women of the past around midafternoon of the next day monk faced the opulent receiver known as pearly boy he had been known that way for so long nobody could remember what his original name had been but it was only since the death of the fat man the previous winter that he had taken over a far larger slice of business along the river and prospered to the degree of wealth that he now possessed he was slender and softfaced and he wore his hair rather long he always spoke quietly with a very slight lisp and no one had seen him winter or summer without his waistcoat which was stitched with hundreds of pearl buttons that gleamed in the light he was the last man one would expect to have a reputation for ruthlessness not only for a hard bargain but if necessary with a knife pearlhandled of course they were sitting in the small room behind pearly boys shop in limehouse the shop was ostensibly to sell ships instruments compasses sextants quadrants chronometers barometers astrolabes set out in order on a table was a variety of dividers and parallel rules but pearlys main business took place in the back room largely concerning stolen jewelry objets dart paintings carvings and jewelencrusted ornaments he had already taken over most of the fat mans territory he looked at monk blandly but his eyes were as cold as a polar sea always appy to elp the police he said what are you looking for mr monk it is monk isnt it eard word you know reputation monk did not take the bait yes indeed he said with a nod something we have in common pearly boy was startled whats that then reputation monk was unsmiling i understand youre a hard man too pearly boy thought that was funny he started to giggle and it grew and swelled into rich chortling laughter finally he stopped abruptly wiping his cheeks with a large handkerchief im going to like you he said his face beaming his eyes like wet stones im delighted monk replied sounding as though he had smelled spoiling milk we might be of use to each other that was language pearly boy definitely understood even if he was dubious about believing it oh yeah an hows that then friends and enemies in common monk explained pearly boy was interested he tried to hide it and failed friends he said curiously oos friends o yours then lets start with enemies monk answered with a smile one of yours was the fat man he saw the flash of hatred and triumph in pearly boys eyes one of mine too monk added you have me to thank that hes dead pearly boy licked his lips i know that i eard drowned in the mud off jacobs island they say thats right nasty way to go monk shook his head would have fished the body up but it was hardly worth it got the statue which is what mattered hell keep down there nicely pearly boy shuddered youre a hard bastard all right he agreed and monk was not sure whether he meant it as a compliment or not i am monk conceded im after several people and i dont forget either a good turn or a bad one who is mary webber no idea never eard of er which means shes not in my business she int a thief nor a receiver nor a customer pearly boy said flatly monk was not surprised he had not expected her to be and im after a boy named reilly and even more than that im after whoever was forced into looking after him seeing to it that he didnt get hurt pearly boy opened his eyes wide forced ow could anyone be forced oo would do that an why mr monk mr durban would have done it monk replied steadily because he didnt like having boys murdered well i never pearly boy affected amazement but his curiosity overcame his judgment as monk had hoped it would pearly boy dealt not only in stolen goods but in rare or precious information as well that too at times stolen oo could stop that appening then someone with power monk said it as though he were thinking out loud and yet someone who had a lot to lose as well a lot in danger if you understand me pearly boy was still two steps behind ood be killin boys then jericho phillips if they get out of line rebel against he stopped seeing pearly boys face go suddenly pallid and his body in its decorated waistcoat stiffen until his arms were rigid suddenly monk was as certain pearly boy was one of durban s informants against phillips as if he had written it in his notes he smiled and saw in pearly boys eyes that he had read the understanding and it knotted his stomach with terror one of phillipss clients monk went on his voice quite casual now he leaned elegantly against the mantel watching pearly boys discomfort i can imagine it happening cant you durban would have followed the man until he could confront him maybe somewhere near phillipss boat perhaps it would be just after this man whoever he is had left a nights entertainment and the excitement and guilt were still hot inside him pearly boy was motionless eyes on monks face no lie would come to him easily then monk continued no matter how often he had prepared for such a moment durban would have chosen a place where there was enough light to be sure the man recognized his marks of office his uniform his cudgel yes hed definitely take a cudgel just in case the man was desperate enough to fight after all he would have a lot to losepublic disgust ridicule loss of position friends money power perhaps even his family pearly boy licked his lips nervously then durban would make the offer monk said use your power to protect reilly the boy most in danger because of his age and his courage and ill protect you let reilly die and ill expose you to the whole of london pearly boy licked his lips again so oo was it then that is what i want from you pearly boy monk answered pearly boy cleared his throat an if i dont it could ave been lots o people i dunno oos got that kind o weakness it could be a revenue man a magistrate a rich merchant an arbormaster they got all kinds o tastes or it could ave been another policeman ever thought o that of course i have who could have protected reilly thats the key to it who had the power above all who was important enough to phillips that he would listen to him understanding flashed in pearly boys soft clever face and the excitement of knowledge you mean oos got an appetite e cant control an needs phillips ter feed it an yet es got some kind o power to elp phillips thats so good phillips as got to keep im sweet too thats a nice one mr monk a very nice one indeed yes it is and i want a nice answer monk agreed pearly boys eyebrows rose or what he was shivering very slightly monk could smell the sweat of fear in the closed air of the room what if i cant find out he tried a bit of bravado or if i decide not to i shall see that phillips knows that you told mr durban about this very interesting client and are on the point of telling me when we can agree on a price pearly boy was white the sweat beading on his face and what price would that be he asked hoarsely monk smiled showing his teeth future silence and a certain shortsightedness now and then where the revenue men are concerned dead men are silent pearly boy said through thin lips not those who can write and leave clear instructions behind them mr durban might have been very nice to you i wont be i could ave you killed dark night narrow alley the fat mans dead im not monk reminded him take the easy way pearly boy youre a receiver not a murderer you kill a river policeman youll be tracked down do you want to be buried feetfirst in the thames mud never come back up again pearly boy went even paler still youll owe me he challenged his eyes flickering a little monk smiled i told you ill forget about you to a point ill put you last on my list to close down rather than first pearly boy said something obscene under his breath i beg your pardon monk snapped ill find im pearly replied suddenly monk was gracious thank you it will be to your advantage but as he left his emotions were tangled he walked warily along the narrow street keeping to the middle away from the alley entrances and the sunken doorways what was the difference between one blackmail and another was it of kind or only of degree did the purpose justify it he did not even have to think about that if he could save any child from phillips he would without a thought for the morality of his actions but did that make him a good policeman or not he felt uncomfortable unhappy uncertain in his judgment and closer to durban than ever before but it was a closeness of emotion rage and vulnerability and of course when durban had died at the turn of the year the protection of reilly had disappeared he had been left naked to whatever phillips had wanted to do that thought made him feel sick even as he came out of the alley into the wind and the sun of the open dock eight rathbone sat at his own dinner table and felt curiously without appetite the room was beautiful greatly improved from its original rather sparse elegance since margarets advent into the house he was not quite sure what it was specifically that was changed but it was somehow warmer than it had been before the table had the same clean lines of adam mahogany the ceiling still had the heavy plaster borders of acanthus leaves the blueandwhite curtains were different far less heavy than before there were touches of gold here and there and a bowl of pink roses on the table they gave both warmth and a sense of ease to the room as if it were lived in he drew in his breath to thank margaret because of course it was she who had caused the changes then he let the moment slip and ate some more fish instead it would sound artificial as if he were searching for something polite to say they should be talking about real things not trivia like the curtains and flowers she was concentrating on her food looking down at her plate should he compliment her on it it was she who had engaged the cook what was she thinking about with that slight frown between her brows had she any idea what was turning over and over in his mind she had been proud of him for winning the phillips case he could remember the brightness in her face the way she had walked head high back even a little straighter than usual because it was clever did skill matter so much ahead of wisdom was it because she was on the winning side and hester had lost or had she not been proud at all but concealed it very well with that small show of defiance and loyalty was that towards him or her father did she even know that it was her father who had represented phillips indirectly had she any idea what phillips was really like rathbone was only just beginning to appreciate that himself how could she know more and if she could be loyal could he not at least do as much he finished the fish i dont know exactly what the changes to this room are he said aloud but it is much pleasanter to eat in i like it she looked up quickly her eyes questioning do you im glad it wasnt anything very big sometimes it is small things that make the difference between beauty and ordinariness he answered or good and evil she asked small to begin with this was becoming a conversation he did not wish to enter that is too philosophical he looked down at his plate a little heavy for the fish course he smiled very slightly would you prefer it with the meat she asked her voice perfectly steady the thought flickered into his mind that hester would have told him not to be pompous and charged ahead with the conversation anyway that was one of the reasons he had hesitated to ask her to marry him and been so much more comfortable with margaret i am not sure that i know enough about the origins of good or evil to discuss them at all he said frankly but if you wish to i suppose i could try it was meant to dissuade her she would defer to him he had been married long enough to know that of her it was how her mother had taught her to keep her husbands regard hester would have given him an answer that would have scorched his emotions and left him stinging and fiercely alive perhaps he would not always have trusted her to be the lady that was mrs ballingers ideal but he left the thought there it must not be pursued not now not ever he forced himself to look at margaret she had her head bent but she caught his movement and looked up at him i have compared good and evil enough today my dear he said quietly i can see too much of both sides and the cost of each i should very much prefer to be able to speak with you of something pleasanter or at least less full of pitfalls and failures and mistakes that we see too late to help her face filled with concern im sorry i should prefer something more agreeable as well i have spent the day trying to raise money for the clinic mostly from people who have far more than they need and are still desperate for something further so many women of high fashion dress not to please the man they love but to spite the women they fear he had not intended to but he found himself smiling some of the knots inside him eased they were moving onto surer ground i wonder if they have any idea that you have observed them so accurately he remarked she looked alarmed although not entirely without a flash of humor my goodness i hope not they avoid me rapidly enough as it is because they know i shall ask them for money if i can manage itat times and in places where it will be hard for them to refuse his eyes widened i hadnt realized you were so ruthless you werent meant to she retorted a flicker of genuine admiration touched him bringing with it a pleasure he clung to i shall immediately forget he promised let us speak of other things i am sure there must be some current event that is worthy of debate the following day was saturday no courts were in session normally rathbone would have spent at least the morning looking through documents for the following week finally he made up his mind to face the issue that had been troubling him for several days he was at last honest enough to admit that ignoring it was an evasion there would be no right time no appropriate words he excused himself to margaret without explanation this was not out of the ordinary he had deliberately developed the habit of not telling her often because it was confidential he said simply that he would return before lunch it was a short cab ride to arthur ballingers house he would have preferred to have this conversation in offices where there was no possibility of domestic interruption and no need whatever for margarets mother to know that he had called but he felt he could no longer put it off or risk professional obligations delaying it yet further the maid welcomed him and he hoped for one breathless moment that he might escape without having to explain himself to his motherinlaw but she must have heard the door because she came down the stairs with a broad smile greeting him warmly how delightful to see you oliver you look very well i hope you are she meant very formal because he was in his business clothes he wished arthur ballinger would appreciate the gravity of what he was going to ask neither friendship nor ties of marriage altered the moral issues involved in excellent health thank you mamainlaw he replied and so is margaret i am sure she would have sent you her best wishes had she known i was coming however the matter is confidential it is mr ballinger i need to see i believe he can advise me in a matter of some importance is he at home he knew it was ballingers habit as it was his own to prepare for the following week on a saturday morning for one thing it enabled him to avoid the various domestic or social requirements his wife might ask of him why yes certainly he is at home she answered a little crestfallen she had been hoping it was a personal visit to lighten the tedium of the morning does he expect you no i am afraid i have only just resolved to consult him i apologize for the inconvenience it is no inconvenience at all she brushed it aside you are always welcome and with a swish of her abundant skirt she led him across the hall to the study door where she knocked at the sound of ballingers voice she opened it and announced rathbones presence ballinger had no possible choice but to invite rathbone in as if he were delighted to see him however as soon as the door was closed the tension was palpable in the air in spite of the pretense they both remained standing ballinger hesitated for a moment obviously debating how frank to be and decided on the least possible frankness i cant imagine what you could wish my advice for but of course if i can help then i shall be happy to please make yourself comfortable he waved to the other large armchair opposite his own would you care for tea or perhaps something cold rathbone could afford no time for niceties and he knew acceptance would mean at least two interruptions one to request the tea and a second to accept it no thank you he declined i dont wish to disturb you longer than necessary he sat down mostly to establish his intention to remain until the business was concluded ballinger sat also so as not to give the impression that he was urging rathbone to leave rathbone plunged in it was not going to get easier with delay the phillips case still troubles me he admitted he saw ballingers face tighten so slightly that it could have been a trick of the light except that he had not moved the questioning of police motives was fair in principle in fact it is a tactic one has to consider in any case you conducted the case brilliantly ballinger said and there is nothing even remotely questionable about it i dont understand what it is that could disturb you now the moment he spoke he realized his mistake it allowed rathbone the opening he would otherwise have had to create rathbone smiled very slightly i was naturally very careful not to ask phillips directly if he was guilty i behaved as if he were not as i was obliged to but i find myself more and more convinced that in fact he did murder that child he saw ballinger wince and ignored it and probably others as well i know that the river police are still investigating him in the hope of building a different case and i have no doubt at all that they will be a great deal more careful the second time ballinger shifted very slightly in his chair if they do bring another case rathbone continued is your client going to wish you to deal with it again or if i may put it more plainly is this debt of honor now satisfied or does it stretch to defending jericho phillips indefinitely whatever the charge ballinger flushed a painful color and rathbone felt guilty for having placed him in such a situation it was going to make friendship between them impossible he had already crossed a boundary that could not be forgotten this man was his wifes father the price was high if you cannot answer for him which would be perfectly understandable perhaps proper he continued then may i speak to him myself it was what he had wanted from the outset the anonymity of the man who would pay to defend phillips had always troubled him now with so much darker a picture emerging of phillipss trade it disturbed him even more who is he i am afraid i cannot tell you ballinger replied there was no wavering in him not an instant of uncertainty the matter is one of complete confidentiality and to be professional i cannot tell you certainly i shall convey to him your concern however i think it may be premature the river police have not arrested phillips or laid any new charge naturally they are distressed at the failure of their case and at the ensuing suggestion that the late commander durban was of questionable competence even of conduct not always becoming to his office he moved his hands in a slight gesture of regret it is most unfortunate for their reputation that their new man monk seems to be cut from the same cloth but we cannot alter the law to suit the weaknesses of those who administer it i am sure you would be among the first to agree he smiled very slightly the warmth was on his lips but not in his eyes your own words in defense of the law still ring in my mind it must be for all or it is eventually for no one if we build either reward or punishment on our own likes loyalties or even sense of outrage then justice is immediately eroded he shook his head his gaze direct candid the time will come when we ourselves are disliked or misunderstood or strangers different from our judges in race or class or creed and if their sense of justice depends upon their passion rather than their morality who is to speak for us then or defend our right to the truth he leaned forward that is more or less what you said to me oliver here in this room when we spoke of this very subject earlier i have never admired any mans honor more than i did yours and still do rathbone had no answer his emotions were intensely troubled and his mind was utterly wrongfooted off balance as a runner who is tripped and suddenly finds his own speed his enemy it flashed into his mind to wonder if the person who had paid to have phillips defended not only wanted it but far more than that needed it was he one of phillipss clients who could not afford to have him found guilty who exactly did phillips cater to considering rathbones fee for his services a man of very considerable means indeed he felt a sharp stab of guilt for that it was a sizable amount of money and now it felt dirty in his hands he could buy nothing with it that would bring him pleasure ballinger was waiting watching and judging his reactions rathbone was angry first with ballinger for knowing so well how to use him then with himself for being used then another thought occurred to him which was painful halting his emotions with an icy hand was the man a friend of ballingers a man he had possibly known in his youth before this desperate twist of hunger had imprisoned him in loneliness shame deceit and then terror does one ever quite forget the innocence one has known in the past the times of greater hope unforced kindness among boys before they became men or the debts incurred then perhaps it was even worse than that it would be a double pressure a debt compounded if it were his other soninlaw margarets sisters husband it could be all ages and types of men were subject to hungers that tortured and in the end destroyed both the victim and the oppressor in their grip or was it mrs ballingers brother or one of her sisters husbands the possibilities were many all of them harsh and full of entangled obligations and pities loyalties too complex to untangle and where words did nothing whatever to ease shame or despair without warning rathbones anger was overtaken by pity he searched for something to say and before he found it there was a tap on the door but it did not open it had to be the maid ballinger rose to his feet and went to the door a low voice spoke with the deferential tones of a servant ballinger thanked him and turned back to rathbone im sorry but i have an unexpected visitor a client who needs urgent help and i cannot put him off anyway i think i have explained my position and there is nothing further i can add i apologize he stood as if waiting to usher rathbone out and the invitation to leave was implicit rathbone stood up he had no idea who this new client was and the fact that ballinger did not introduce him was not remarkable business with ones attorney could be sensitive in fact if one called personally on a saturday morning then it was at the very least extraordinary and unexpected thank you for your courtesy in receiving me without notice he said with as much grace as he could muster not at all ballinger replied were there not an emergency it would have been a pleasure to offer you tea and to speak longer they shook hands and rathbone went out into an empty hall whoever had called to see ballinger had been shown into another room at least until rathbone had left it flashed into his mind to wonder with some discomfort if it was someone he would have recognized it was not a pleasant thought as he was riding home in a cab a certain degree of anxiety would not leave his mind if phillips had among his clientele men with the money to pay rathbones fee and to call on ballinger uninvited on a saturday morning what else could they do if pressured with sufficient threat of exposure not that he knew that ballingers guest this morning had anything to do with phillips but the possibility would not leave his mind ballinger had made clear that the client was someone to whom he owed loyalty whatever the nature of his clients problem rathbone was troubled as he rode through the bustling saturday streets with their tall elegant facades their carriages with matched pairs the horses coats gleaming footmen in perfect livery fashionable ladies who else could jericho phillips call upon if he felt threatened by monks continuing investigation and what power might such men have and be willing to use to save their reputations and colder and closer to him than that whose side would margaret be on if any of it came into the open or at the very least into family hostility her father of a lifetime or her husband of a year he did not wish to know the answer to that either would be painful and he hoped profoundly that she would never be put to that test and yet if she were not wouldnt he still wonder monk took a brief respite over the weekend he and hester walked in the park climbing the slow rise and standing close to each other on the top in the sun they stared down at the brilliant light on the river below them watching the boats ply up and down like longlegged flies oars dipping and rising monk knew exactly the sound the water would make off the blades if he were close enough to hear it from this distance the music drifted in snatches and the breeze was cool rustling the leaves mellowing the sharp smell of the tide with the sweetness of grass but monday was different he was met by orme on princes stairs on his own side of the river even before he got on the ferry to take him over to the wapping police station his uniform was immaculate but his face was weary as if even at seven in the morning he had already worked long and exhaustingly morning sir he said standing to attention ive a ferry here for you if you like monk met his eyes and felt a tightening in his stomach a slow clench into a knot thank you he acknowledged have you learned something since i was in he followed orme to the edge of the dockside and down the steps to where the ferry was rocking gently in the wash of a passing lighter they stepped in and the ferryman set out for the farther bank yes sir orme said quietly dropping his voice so they would not be overheard above the creak of the oars and the hiss of the water im afraid chargesve been laid against mr durban though hes dead an not here to face them or tell them the truth and if you ask me thats a cowards way of getting at a man you didnt ave the courage to face in life his voice shook with indignation and far more powerful than that a deep unconcealable pain then well have to answer for him monk responded instantly and realized as the words were on his lips just how rash they were but he was prepared to follow through the cowardice of it was despicable what are they charging and for that matter who is saying it ormes face was stiff he was a quiet man gentle but perhaps lacking in breadth of thought once or twice he had hinted at a religious upbringing certainly he could be suspicious of laughter except of the most goodnatured sort he was offended to have to say the words that monk had asked of him they were pulling out into the mainstream of the river now bucking a little against the strength of the tide the slap of the water was louder and orme had to raise his voice against it government officer sir a couple of magistrates theyre saying that he got hold o boys for phillips in his trade theyre using the same evidence we found as to how mr durban helped some o the mudlarks and pickpockets and lookouts and sweeps boys turn to honest work theyre saying that he sent them phillipss way into use for prostitution an playacting and photographs he swallowed with difficulty monk could see he was having trouble even framing the thoughts that followed yes he prompted finding his own throat tight an that mr durban fell foul o phillips an wanted to put him away sos he could take the business an run it for himself orme finished wretchedly he looked at monk his eyes imploring a denial and the will and strength to fight monk felt sick the evidence he had uncovered about durban could very easily be used to support such allegations it was all capable of being interpreted against him as well as for him why had he pursued phillips so erratically harrying him one month and then ignoring him the next was it to protect reilly or another boy like him or was it to further his own interests in the business or worse to elicit money from phillips was it a personal war yes of course it was everything pointed to that and orme knew it even better than he did even if he did not know why durban had loathed phillips with a driving passion at times it had consumed him his temper had exploded he had gone far beyond the limits of the law but he had also used his power of office to coerce people into what he wanted them to do some would say he had abused it and who was mary webber no one seemed to know no one else had connected her name to the case anywhere why had durban lied about his own origins was it the ordinary human weakness that tempts everyone to make themselves more important than they are more interesting more talented more successful what was his past really that he denied its entirety orme was still watching him waiting for a word of encouragement he must feel dreadfully alone abandoned to a fight for which he had been given no weapons we have to learn the truth monk said firmly nothing else is going to help us in this and we need to be careful whom we trust there seems to be someone working against us more than one orme said unhappily but his eyes were steady im sorry sir but theres something else theres talk of the metropolitan police taking us over completely so we dont even have our own commander anymore just come under the nearest local station we wouldnt have the river anymore just our bit at the bank the news papers are saying were corrupt an we need sorting out most of us got rid of they even said something in the house of commons as if we hadnt looked after them near a hundred years no loyalty one bad patch an theyre on us like wolves doubt lurched up inside monk like nausea they were almost at the far bank by the wapping stairs they would reach it and have to go ashore in minutes then there would be no more time to speak without the risk of being overheard it would take only minutes to cross the open dockside and reach the station orme was waiting for him to make the decision whether to go forward fight all the way or retreat now before even more was exposed and perhaps all reputation was lost they were at the steps the ferry bumped at the landing wood against stone there was no more time monk paid the ferryman and climbed out a step behind orme he could not ask anyone else to make the decision he was the leader he must lead durban would have that was one thing of which he was certain and evasion willing blindness was no way out whatever was discovered at least it was a way to move forward discretion was sometimes an answer cowardice never which was this he followed orme across the quayside to the station then inside still without answering they had to spend the rest of the morning dealing with the usual river police business of thefts smuggling and the occasional violence by the middle of the day monk was back near wapping again knowing that with luck he would have most of the afternoon to think about durban since the charge was that durban had procured boys first for phillips then later with the intention of using them in the same trade himself he knew he should go back and retrace every connection durban had had with boys seek the proof his enemies would use pursue it as ruthlessly as they would and then hopefully not find it for that he would need scuffs help south bank please he said to the ferryman rotherhithe thought you said wapping the man responded tartly i did ive changed my mind princes stairs and wait for me im going up to paradise place and ill be back the man nodded agreement monk settled back in the stern as they swung around and headed across the river he knew from the mans manner that word had already spread that the river police were in trouble even in these few hours their influence was beginning to erode monk had a sudden moment of helplessness a sickening doubt that he would never stop the destruction how could he find the skill to prevent the rising confidence of the thieves and chancers up and down the river the thousands of men who were kept reasonably honest only by the certainty of the river polices authority the knowledge that crime was punished immediately and effectively to some extent it was a matter of bravado of who kept their nerve the longest since the days of harriott and colquhoun the river police had had the upper hand but now the greedy on the river were gathering strengthening circling to attack when they reached the far side he went immediately to paradise place he opened the door and shouted for scuff as loudly as he could he tried to think of a suitable punishment if the boy had gone and knew there was none he had no right to give commands except those pertaining to conduct in the house and yet scuff was roughly eleven a child in years if not in experience he might have strong and subtle knowledge of the street but his emotions were still appallingly easy to hurt as vulnerable as any other childs scuff appeared at the top of the stairs his hair damp and a clean shirt on which was a little too large for his narrow shoulders and hanging over the top of his trousers ah monk said with relief i need your help are you busy no scuff said eagerly starting down then he remembered his dignity and slowed not very whatre we gonna do monk had already decided to tell him the truth people are saying some very ugly things about mr durban in fact they are actually going to charge that he was guilty of getting boys for phillips to use on his boat knowing what it was for thats stupid scuff said disgustedly ed a never done that anyway es dead then instantly he was sorry but now it was too late to take it back i dint mean ter say that he apologized looking ruefully at monk to see how hurt he was but wot fer they cant do nothin to im now even if it was true its a cowardly thing to blame a dead man who cant answer you back monk said with as much composure as he could he did not want scuff to think he had been clumsy and its a good way to get out of it yourself it turns us away from what we should really be looking at but all the same im going to find out scuff looked doubtful it wont ang phillips monk had a sudden flash of understanding scuff was afraid it might be true and he was imagining how monk would be disillusioned by it not directly monk agreed casually keeping the emotion out of his voice with difficulty but just at the moment im even more concerned with saving mr durbans good name he stopped catching the anxiety in scuffs eyes because he was commander of the river police and now people are beginning to say were all rotten and theyre taking liberties he explained i have to put a stop to that scuff drew in a deep breath understanding flooding his face and then anger yer gotter mr monk he agreed seriously let em get at it once an yerll ave twice the trouble gettin em back ter straight well come on then monk turned and went back to the front door he heard scuffs feet clattering down the stairs and running after him to the step the door slammed and then scuff was beside him monk smiled they worked for the rest of the afternoon and into the early evening tracking down the name and fate of every boy and what he said of durban the next day they started far earlier by midafternoon scuff had been off by himself for several hours and was late returning to the place they had agreed to meet monk was pacing from crate to embankment edge and back again wishing he had not allowed the boy to go off alone when scuff finally showed up his face was dirty his shirt torn and he looked apprehensive monk was too pleased to see him to care about the torn new shirt scuff was also unconcerned and that worried him far more scuff was very aware that the clothes were a present and he was half afraid he would have to give them back one day if they were torn or stained he could be in a lot of trouble worse than that hester might think he was not grateful now he stood uncertainly as if to deliver bad news what did you find out monk asked him no doubt scuff was tired and hungry but relief would have to wait scuff hesitated he looked as if he had already been considering for some time how to tell monk whatever it was he drew in his breath and then let it out again what did you find out monk repeated his voice sharper than he meant it to be scuff sniffed mr durban sometimes e caught boys thievin just little stuff andkerchiefs sixpence or a bob ere an therean ed let em off give em a clip round the ear but also mebbe a cup o tea an a sandwich or even a piece o cake other copsd ave ad em locked em up some folks thought e were good for that others said e were doin it for is own reasons some of em boys werent around anymore after that he frowned searching monks face to watch how he took the news i see monk said levelly how old were these boys and how often did that happen were they talking about once or twice or lots of times scuff chewed his lip lots o times an one fat ol scuffleunter told me some o their crimes was worse than light fingers e said one boy mr durban caught werent five or six at all e were more like ten an e were a right thief alfway ter bein a fine wirer thats someone as can pick a ladys pocket an shell never even feel it i know what a fine wirer is why did durban not arrest him if he stole valuable property was there some doubt about it scuffs eyes lowered till he was staring at the ground e were a finelookin boy wi fair air some said mr durban ad another place fer im he looked up again quickly not that they got any proof o course seein as it int true who said that sort of thing monk asked him i dunno scuff said too quickly yes you do you know better than to come with stories out of nowhere who said it scuff hesitated again monk was on the verge of shouting at him then saw his misery and knew that it was not on his own behalf but came from a powerful awareness of monks own vulnerability he knew what it was to admire someone to rely on them as your teacher and friend and in some ways both your protector and your responsibility that was how scuff regarded monk was he imagining that monk regarded durban the same way scuff he said gently whatever it is i need to know well find out if its true or not but we cant do that if i dont know what it is and who said it scuff sniffed again and pulled his face into an expression of reluctant concentration mudlarks i know he replied taffyi dunno is last name cause e dont know it neither potter an jimmy macsummink an mucker james they all said they knew o mr durban seein boys steal sometimes something thatd ave fetched em two or three years in the coldbath fields an tellin em off mostly little kids little monk asked feeling the chill inside him and his skin hot and then cold five or six mebbe scuff looked miserable most o them took cause they was ungry or scared o oever it were put em up to it are they still around the little boys i dunno i dint find any scuff looked defiant that dont mean they int there they could be keepin out o the way theyre just the kind phillipsd take yes i know that thank you for telling me scuff said nothing but that evening when hester was in the kitchen scuff steeled his courage stomach knotted fingers digging into his palms and went in to see her hoping intensely that he would find the words before monk should come either to speak to hester himself or to see what he was doing there hester was bending over the sink washing the supper dishes he took a deep shivering breath and plunged in miss ester can i say summink she straightened her back slowly hands dripping soapy water but she did not turn to face him he knew she was listening by the way she stood so still he liked the smell in this room warm food and cleanness there were times when he did not want to ever leave it yes of course she answered what is it he pushed his hands into his pockets so that if she turned she would not see his white knuckles i did summink today that that urt mr monk but i dint mean ter now she did look at him what did you do there was no help but to tell her the truth i asked some boys i knew about mr durban an i eard some things that was pretty bad he stopped afraid to tell her the rest would she know anyway she often seemed to know what he was thinking even when he did not say it sometimes that was very comfortable and sometimes it wasnt i see did you tell him the truth as to what you heard yeah he gulped she was going to say he shouldnt have he knew it she smiled but her eyes were dark with worry he could see that he knew fear and recognized it with instant familiarity he felt sick that was the right thing she told him she moved her hand to touch him then changed her mind he wished she hadnt it would be nice to be touched but why should she he did not really belong here they said mr durban let kids off wot should a gone ter prison fer stealin he said quickly little kids like phillips takes they said mr durban werent no better theyre wrong int they now she hesitated then seemed to make her mind up i dont know i hope so but if theyre right weve got to face that mr monk will be all right because well be here he stared at her searching her face to know if she meant it or if she was just being nice to him thinking he was a child and could not take anything worse gradually he became sure that she did mean it she did not have children and she was not treating him like one he smiled at her she smiled back and reaching out touched him quickly and very gently on the cheek he felt the warmth of it run right through him he turned away and went back upstairs before monk could catch him and somehow take the moment away it was private just between him and hester he reached the top of the stairs and touched his cheek experimentally to see if it was still warm in the morning hester went to see oliver rathbone at his office she did not go to portpool lane first she did not want to have to speak to margaret she felt guilty about that they had been close friends perhaps the closest woman friend hester had knownat least in normal circumstances away from the horrors of war to avoid her now because of rathbones part in the trial and the fear and confusion she felt added to her unhappiness yet she could no longer put off facing rathbone she rode the bus along as far as london bridge then alighted and took a cab across the river to rathbones office near the inns of court his clerk recognized her immediately and invited her in with a mixture of pleasure and embarrassment she wondered what his own opinion was of the phillips case and rathbones part in it of course it would be completely improper to ask him and he could not possibly answer her im sorry mrs monk but sir oliver has a gentleman in to see him the clerk apologized i cant say how long it will be before he is free he remained standing where he was it was intended as a polite discouragement if i may i will wait she replied meeting his eyes squarely and not moving a step of course maam he conceded reading her correctly that she intended to wait whatever he said in the office or even outside in the street if that were forced upon her may i bring you a cup of tea and perhaps a biscuit or two she beamed at him thank you that would be most kind of you he retreated knowing well when he was beaten and in this case not minding at all she did wonder fleetingly if she might be about to fight this battle for him as well as for herself she had rather more than threequarters of an hour to wait because as soon as the first client left another arrived and she had to wait for his departure also before being shown into rathbones office good morning hester he said somewhat warily good morning oliver she replied as the clerk closed the door behind her she accepted the seat opposite his desk i am sure you are busyin fact i have already seen two clients come and goso i shall not waste your time with polite conversation you may take it for granted that i am interested in your health and happiness and that i have assumed all the usual polite inquiries from you about mine he sighed very slightly and sat down behind his desk and that i have already had tea she added most graciously served naturally there was the very faintest smile on his lips should i apologize for keeping you waiting or is that to be taken for granted as well you did not keep me waiting she replied i have no appointment with you oh dear i see we are to be honest to the point of i am not sure what are we being honest about or am i going to regret asking such a question i seem to remember you telling me a long time ago that a good lawyerand you are extremely gooddoes not ask a question unless he already knows the answer she replied he winced so slightly she was not sure if she had seen it or imagined it you are not going to prompt me into assuming the answer hester he replied you are very good yourself but i have had rather more practice she gave a very slight shrug a great deal more the people you deal with are captive in quite a different way from those that i do and though they do not always realize it i also have their interests at heart that is easy to do he rejoined their interests do not conflict with each other you are naive oliver i have only so much money so much medicine so many beds of course they conflict with each other he was caught off guard i know that you were employed to defend phillips she said leaning forward in her chair and that bound you to his interests just as the prosecution was bound against them once you had accepted the case unless he admitted his guilt you had no choice but to defend him was that why you did not call him to the stand to deny that he killed fig you were certain in your own mind that he had no i was not he said with sudden vehemence he did deny it i simply did not think that the jury would believe him he is not an attractive character and if he had spoken that would very definitely have shown the jury should weigh only the evidence but they are peoplepassionate vulnerable full of pity and outrage for the crime and intensely afraid both of doing the wrong thing and of one day being victims of crime themselves he spoke so quickly he scarcely had time for breath they would have been led by dislike into believing him guilty they could very easily have crossed the line from being convinced that he had committed other crimes which i have no doubt he has to believing that he had committed this one also they do not have to give reasons for their verdict i cannot argue with them and point out that their logic is flawed once they have spoken i have to accept unless there is a point of law on which i can argue illogic is not such a point i know she said drily tremayne could have used emotion to sway them against phillips and you would have had no recourse because they would not have realized what he had done they would have imagined that the feelings were entirely their own not manipulated by counsel he smiled very slightly exactly i am pleased you see it with such a fair mind it was her turn to smile with the same chilly humor of course i do now she replied unfortunately i didnt see it so plainly when you were manipulating me nor im afraid did mr tremayne you are better at it than either of us but then i dare say you are right in that you are more practiced the color washed deep red up his face i had no choice hester should i have done less than my best for him because you were the witness if i had when defending someone you liked you would have been the first to call me dishonorable you cant have justice dealt one way for those you like and another for those you dont of course not she agreed her voice tighter than she had meant it to be it gave her away and she knew he would hear it i followed the case because i believed passionately that phillips was an evil man who tortured and murdered a child who had the courage to stand up against him i still believe it but i know that i let my emotions rule me instead of my intelligence i was not impartial in my judgment and it let me down you took advantage of my weakness because you knew me well enough to do so she ignored the flare of anger and perhaps shame in his eyes i am not sure whether i know you well enough or not oliver i used to think i did but people change and those closest to them do not always see it was it love of justice or emotion that caused you to take up the defense of jericho phillips he was startled she did not stop to allow him the chance to interrupt her did you defend him because you thought no one else would do it adequately or even at all perhaps you are right if you think no one else would have done it as well or did you do it to pay a debt to some friend to whom you owe a loyalty a pity or a matter of honor past or future she swallowed or to show off because it seemed impossible and yet you accomplished it he was very pale now is that what you think of me hester she did not flinch it is not what i wish to think before the trial i would have stood in that witness box and sworn that you would not she thought of mentioning money and decided against that ultimate insult do you even know who actually paid you she said instead are you certain it was not phillips himself isnt he clever enough to have done it through so many other avenues you could not trace it back to him then the question is if he had come to you directly not through a client and a friend would you still have taken the case i dont know that is not how it happened he replied i cannot explain it to you because it is in confidence as are all legal consultations you know that and you knew it when you came here you are not usually impractical enough to waste time and energy railing against the past what is it you want it was blunt his eyes were hard and hurt he was also surprised that she had outmaneuvered him i would like to know who paid you she began dont be foolish he said sharply you know i cannot possibly tell you that i didnt ask you that she answered equally sharply i know you cannot if either you or they were willing to own up to it you would have done so already she allowed her fear to show through brittle and bright i wanted you to know that because of the doubt cast on commander durbans honor now the whole of the thames river police is under suspicion to the degree that they may even be taken over completely as a separate arm of the metropolitan police all their specialist experience will be lost and dont bother to tell me that that is as much my fault as yours i know it is i am not concerned with blame as you said it is a waste of time to cry over the past which cannot be changed i am concerned for the future she leaned towards him oliver between us we have come close to destroying something that is good you can help us save durban s reputation without damaging your own and monks of course he said cruelly again she did not flinch of course and mine too for that matter is helping us a reason for not doing it hester for no of course it isnt he protested i didnt expose any of you because i wanted to you left yourselves wide open i did what i had to do to uphold the law so now do what you can to uphold justice she returned jericho phillips killed fig although it is pointless to prove that now even if we could he killed others too and well be a lot more careful about our evidence next time but in order to do that the river police have to survive with their own command not broken up into a dozen different entities each just part of their local station she stood up slowly careful to straighten her skirtsomething with which she did not usually bother we have all done something ugly all three of us i am asking you to help us mend it as much as it can be mended we may never catch phillips but we can do all that is possible to prove to london that the river police need and deserve to remain a separate department with their own command he looked at her with what for him was an extraordinary sense of confusion emotions conflicted with intellect loneliness dismay perhaps guilt breaking apart his usual sanctuary of reason ill do what i can he said quietly i have no idea if it will be of use she did not argue thank you she said simply then she smiled at him i thought you would he blushed and looked down at the papers on his desk overwhelmed with relief when the clerk knocked on the door she considered returning home to change from her most flattering dress which naturally she had worn to see rathbone before going to portpool lane but decided that it was a waste of the fare she always kept clean working clothes at the clinic in case of accidents which happened quite often she found the clinic busy with its regular affairs tending to the few who were sick enough to require days in bed and the walking patients with knife or razor wounds who needed stitching bandaging general comfort and a little respite from the streets perhaps a decent meal the regular chores of cleaning laundry and cooking never stopped she offered words of approval and encouragement a minor criticism here and there then went to find squeaky robinson in his office he had taken his bookkeeping duties very seriously this last year or so she had not recently heard him complain about having been cheated out of the building which when it was his had been the most successful brothel in the area his new vision of himself more or less on the right side of the law seemed to please him good morning squeaky she said as she closed the door giving them privacy in the cluttered room with its shelves of ledgers the desk was scattered with sheets of paper pencils two inkwells one red one blue and a tray of sand for blotting this last was seldom used he just liked the look of it mornin miss ester he replied searching her face with concern he did not ask her how she was he would make the judgment himself she sat down in the chair opposite him this whole business is becoming extremely ugly she said frankly there are whispers of accusation that mr durban was procuring boys for jericho phillips and the river police in general are being dirtied with that accusation there seem to be several incidents where he found boys stealing and deliberately did not charge them there may be other explanations as to why that happened but the worst is being assumed he nodded looks bad he agreed sucking air in through his teeth int nobody oo int tempted by summink whether its money or power or pleasure or just avin people owe em ive seen some where its just feelin superior as does it specially women seen some awful superior women beggin yer pardon she smiled so have i and i wanted to slap them until i realized thats probably all they had a friend of mine used to say that there are none as virtuous as those who have never been asked i like that he said with profound appreciation he mulled it over like a good wine yeah i do squeaky i need to know how phillips gets his boys there was a tap on the door and as soon as hester answered claudine came in good morning she said cheerfully would you like a cup of tea both hester and squeaky knew that she had come because she could not bear to be left out of the detection she desperately wanted to help but she had not yet let down her barriers of dignity enough to say so outright thank you hester declined quickly but i need to go out and i think i need squeaky with me he knows people that i dont claudine looked crestfallen she tried to hide it but the feeling was too deep to conceal it from her eyes int summink you would know about squeaky said brusquely dont spose you even know why girls take ter sellin theirselves on the streets let alone kids of course i know she snapped do you think i cant hear what theyre saying or that i dont listen to them squeaky relented a fraction boys he explained we dont get no little boys in ere if they get beat no one knows ceptin ooevers keepin em like jericho phillips claudine snorted and what is going to be so different about why they take to the streets she asked cold hunger fear nowhere else to go lonely someone offers to take them in easy money at first youre right hester agreed surprised that claudine had apparently listened so closely to what was voiced including the words themselves which were often shallow and repetitive sometimes full of excuses or selfpity more often with a bitter humor and an endless variety of bad jokes but i need to prove that it wasnt commander durban procuring them so it has to be specific commander durban claudine was clearly horrified i never heard anything so wicked dont worry ill look after everything here you find out all you can but be careful she glared at squeaky you look after her or i shall hold you accountable believe me you will be sorry you were born and with that she turned around whisking her very plain gray skirt as if it had been crimson silk and marched out squeaky smiled then he saw hester and assumed instant gravity well be goin then he said flatly ill put on me oldest boots thank you she accepted i will wait for you by the door they spent a miserable afternoon well into the early evening moving from one to another of squeakys contacts in his previous life as a brothel owner they continued the next day going deeper into the network of alleys in limehouse shadwell and the isle of dogs on the north bank of the river and rotherhithe and deptford on the south hester felt as if she had walked as far as from london to york circling the same narrow byways crowded with dosshouses taverns pawnshops brothels and all the multitudinous traders associated with the river squeaky was very careful even secretive about their search but his whole manner changed when it was time to bargain the casual rather inconspicuous air vanished and he became subtly menacing there was a stillness about him a gentleness to his voice that contrasted with the noise and bustle around him i think yer know better than that mr kelp he said in almost a whisper they were standing in what was ostensibly a tobacconists shop darkly wood paneled one small window its glass ringed like the base of a bottle the lamps were lit or they would not have been able to see the wares laid out although the pungent aroma was powerful enough to drift out into the alley and tempt people even above the stench of rotting wood and human waste kelp opened his mouth to deny it and reconsidered there was something about squeakys motionless figure in its faded striped trousers and ancient frock coat his stringy hair and lantern face that frightened him it was as if squeaky somehow knew himself to be invulnerable in spite of not apparently having any weapon and no one with him but one rather slightly built woman it was inexplicable and anything he could not understand alarmed mr kelp he swallowed well he prevaricated i heard things o course if thats wot you want like squeaky nodded slowly thats wot i want mr kelp things youve eard accurate things things you believe yerself an yer would be very wise indeed not ter tell anybody else that i ave asked an that yer ave been good enough ter elp me there are those with long an careful ears who would not be pleased let us leave them in their ignorance shall we kelp shuddered oh yes mr robinson sir very definitely he did not even glance at hester standing a little behind squeaky she was watching with growing surprise this was a side of squeaky she had not imagined and her own blindness to its possibility was disturbing she had grown accustomed to his compliance in the clinic and forgotten the man he used to be in fact she had never really known more than the superficial fact that he had owned the brothel that had occupied the portpool lane houses squeaky was approximately in his fifties but she had thought of him as old because he sat in a bent hunched position and his hair was long and gray hanging thinly down to his collar he had complained vociferously about being cheated and abused as if he were a man of peaceful habits wrongfully treated the man she saw here in the tobacconists was nothing like that kelp was afraid of him she could see it in his face even smell it in the air she felt a shiver of doubt at her own foolhardiness and forced it from her mind with some difficulty kelp swallowed what appeared to be a lump in his throat and proceeded to tell squeaky everything he knew about the procuring of boys for men like jericho phillips it was sad and very ugly full of human failure and the opportunism of the greedy who preyed on the weak it also included durban catching boys some no more than five or six years old stealing food and small articles to sell he had seldom charged them and the assumption was that he had bought them from their parents in order to sell them to phillips or others like him there was no proof one way or the other but too many of them had not been seen again in the usual places nor was anyone saying where they had gone or with whom im sorry squeaky said as towards evening they walked along the path close to the river on the isle of dogs they were making for all saints stairs to catch a ferry across to the pier on the south side and then a bus to rotherhithe street from which it was a short walk to paradise place squeaky had insisted on seeing her home even though she frequently rode the bus or a cab by herself looks as if yer durban could a been bent as a pigs tail he added she found it difficult to speak what was she going to tell monk she needed to know before he did so that she could do something to soften the blow but what if this were true it was worse than she had imagined i know she said huskily dyer want ter keep on he asked yes of course i do thats wot i thought but i gotter ask he glanced at her then away again it could get worse i know that too even good men ave got their weaknesses he said an women too i spose i reckon yers is believin people its not a bad one ter ave mind am i supposed to be grateful for that no i reckon it urts yer but if yer knew everythin yerd be too cocky ter be nice not much chance of that she replied but she did smile faintly even though he could not see it in the fitful street lighting they made their way down towards the top of the all saints stairs just before they reached them a figure stepped out of the shadows of a crane and the light from the street lamp showed his face like a yellow mask wide thin mouth leering jericho phillips he looked at hester ignoring squeaky i know youve been looking for reilly miss yer dont want ter do that squeaky was taken aback but he hid it quickly you threatenin er mr phillips he asked with exaggerated politeness spot of advice phillips replied friendly as it were reckon i owe er a lot he smiled showing his teeth might be swingin on a gibbet by me neck if it werent for er evidence at me trial he laughed softly his eyes dead as stones yer would find out a lot o things yerd be appier not knowin seein as you admired mr durban so much yer find reilly poor boy an youll like as not find out what appened to im an believe me miss yer wont like that at all there was a ferry making its way across the oily black surface of the water oars dipping in and out rhythmically brave boy reilly phillips added foolish mind trusted those e shouldnt ave like river police found out moren its good fer a boy like im ter know so you killed him just as you killed fig hester said bitterly no reason to miss phillips told her it werent me reilly were goin ter tell on i treat my boys very well stupid not to ask em you wont find one asll speak against me i dont beat em dont forget meself an oller and scream at em i know me business an i look after it proper she looked at him with total loathing but she could find no answer with which to retaliate think about it miss phillips went on yer been askin a lot o questions about durban wot did yer find out eh liar werent e lied about everythin even where e came from lost is temper something rotten beat the tar out o some folks covered up crime in some lied about it in others now me i might do that but then yerd expect it o me he smiled utterly without humor durban s different nobody trusts me but they trusted im that makes it somethin else a kind o betrayal right fer im ter break the law is bad very bad believe me miss yer dont want ter know all about mr durban yer really dont neither does your good man saved my life twice over e did once in the river oh he raised his eyebrows dint e tell you that she stared at him with hatred his smile widened yeah could a let me drown but e saved me an then ocourse all that evidence of is in court reckon without that i wouldve anged fer sure not a pretty way ter go miss the rope dance not at all you dont want ter know what appened ter poor reilly miss nor all about mary webber neither now heres a ferryboat come ter take yer ome yer sleep well an in the mornin go tend to yer clinic an all them poor ores wot yer bent on savin he turned and stalked away consumed almost immediately by the shadows hester stood on the steps shivering with rage but also fear she could not refute a single thing phillips had said she felt helpless and so cold in the summer night that she might as well have fallen in the dark swiftmoving water the ferry was now bumping on the steps the oarsman waiting yer want ter leave it miss ester squeaky asked she could not see his face they had their backs to the light now how could she read his emotions from his voice can it get any worse she asked hasnt anything got to be better than accepting this course it can he said instantly it can get a lot worse yer could find out that durban killed reilly an phillips can prove it no he cant she said with a sudden burst of logic if he could prove that he would have done so already and destroyed durban s evidence without having to hope rathbone could discredit us it would have been much safer then if yer want im appy ter go on nailin that bastardd be better than a bottle o napoleon brandy do you like napoleon brandy she said in surprise no idea he admitted but id like ter find out nine hester slept late the next morning and was far less disturbed than usual to find that monk had already left there was a note from him on the kitchen table scuff was nowhere to be seen so she assumed that he had gone with monk however she was halfway through her breakfast of tea and toast when the boy appeared in the doorway looking anxious he was already dressed and had obviously been out he was holding a newspaper in his hands he seemed uncertain whether to offer it to her or not she knew he could not read but she did not want to embarrass him by referring to the fact good morning she said casually would you like some breakfast i ad some he replied coming a couple of steps into the kitchen there is no reason not to have some more if you would like it she offered its only toast and jam but the jam is very good and tea of course oh he said eyes following her hand with the toast in it well i dont mind if i do then come and sit down and i will make it for you she finished her own toast and raspberry jam holding it in one hand while she cut and toasted more bread with the other they sat at opposite sides of the table and ate in silence for some time he took apricot jam twice may i look at your newspaper please she asked at length course he pushed it over towards her i got it fer yer yer int gonna like it he looked worried i eard em talkin around the newsboy thats why i got it theyre sayin bad things she reached for the paper and looked at the headlines then opened it and read inside scuff was right she did not like it at all the suggestions were veiled but they were not so very far from the sort of thing that phillips had said on the dockside the previous evening there were questions about the river police their record of success suspiciously high but were the figures honest how had they come to recruit a man as obsessed with personal vengeance as durban had beenand apparently not just once but twice was the new man william monk any better what was known about him for that matter what was known about any of them including durban it was a dangerous state of affairs for the nation when a body of men such as the river police had the kind of power they did and there was no check upon the way they used it or abused it if the members of parliament who represented the constituencies along the river were doing their duty there would be questions asked in the house she looked up at scuff he was watching her trying to judge what the paper said from her expression yes they are saying bad things she told him but so far it is just talk i need to know whether they are true or not because we cant deal with it until we know wotll appen to us if its true he asked she heard the fear in his voice and the inclusion of himself in their fate she wondered if he had meant her to notice that or not she would be very careful to reply in the same tones equally casually well have to face it she answered if we can well prove that were not like that but if we arent given the chance then well have to find some other job we will dont worry there are lots of things we can do i could go back to nursing i used to earn my own living before i married mr monk you know did yer like lookin after the sick they pay yer fer that his eyes were wide his toast and jam halfway to his mouth definitely she assured him if you do it well enough and i was very good i did it in the army for soldiers injured in battle when they come ome again certainly not i went to the battlefield and tended them there where they fell he blushed then he grinned sure that she was making a joke even if he didnt understand it she thought of teasing him back then decided he was too genuinely frightened to absorb it right now he had just found some kind of safety perhaps for the first time in his life people not only to love but also to trust and it was slipping out of his hands really in the battlefield she answered thats where soldiers need doctors and nurses i went to the crimea with the army so did quite a few other ladies the fighting was pretty close to us people used to go out in carriages to the heights above the valley and watch the fighting its not dangerous or of course they wouldnt do it but we nurses sometimes saw it too and then went to find those who were still alive and who we could help werent it orrible he asked in a whisper toast still ignored yes it was more horrible than i ever want to think of again but looking away doesnt solve anything does it that was a statement more than a question wot can yer do fer soldiers as are urt real awful he asked dont they ave ter ave doctors an such there arent enough doctors to attend to everybody at once she told him remembering in spite of herself the sounds of men in agony the chaos of the wounded and dying and the smell of blood she had not felt overwhelmed then she had been too busy being practical trying to pack wounds amputate shattered limbs and save men from dying of shock i learned how to do some things myself because it was so bad i couldnt make it worse when its desperate you try even if you dont know what to do to begin with you can be a lot of help with a knife a saw a bottle of brandy and a needle and thread and of course as much water and bandages as you can carry with you wots a saw for he asked quietly she hesitated then decided that lies would be worse than the truth to saw through jagged bones so you can make a clean cut and sew it up she told him and sometimes you have to take somebodys arm or leg off if its gone bad with gangrene which is sort of like rotten meat if you dont it will go all through them and theyll die he stared at her he felt as if he were seeing her for the first time with all the lights on before it had been almost as if they were in the half dark she was not as pretty as some of the women he had seen certainly not as fancy as some of the ladies in fact the clothes she wore were downright ordinary hed seen just as good on women near the docks when they went out on sundays but there was something extra in her face especially in her eyes and when she smiled as if she could see things other people didnt even think of he always used to think that women were nice and certainly useful in the house the best of them but most of them had to be told what to do and they were weak and scared when it came to fighting looking after important things was mens work protecting fighting seeing that nobody stepped out of line had to be done by a man and for clever things it was always men of course that went without anybody needing to say it hester was smiling at him but there were tears in her eyes and she blinked quickly when she talked about the soldiers dying the ones she couldnt help he knew what that felt like the ache in your throat so big you couldnt swallow the way you kept gulping breath but it didnt get any better nor did the tightness go out of your chest but she didnt cry he hoped to goodness mr monk looked after her properly she was a bit thin usually real ladies had a bit more softness about them somebody should take care of her yer gonna ave another piece o toast he asked would you like one she misunderstood him he was not asking for himself will yer ave one he changed his approach ill make it fer yer i know ow ter make toast thank you she accepted that would be very nice perhaps i should boil the kettle again she began to rise ill do it he stepped in her way so she had to sit down all i gotta do is move it over on ter the eat thank you she said again slightly puzzled but willing to accept very carefully indeed he cut two more slices of bread a little thick a trifle crooked but good enough he put them on the toasting fork and held them to the open door of the stove this was not going to be easy but he could look after her it needed doing and it was his new job he would see to it from now on the toast started to smoke he turned it round just before it burnt he had better concentrate hester had debated whether to take scuff with her or not when she went back to look further into durban s history and whether the charges against him were in any part true the matter was taken out of her hands by scuff himself he simply came im not sure she began he smiled at her continuing to look oddly important you need me he said simply then fell in step beside her as if that settled the matter she drew in her breath to argue and found that she had no idea how to tell him that she did not really need him the silence grew until it became impossible and by default she had accepted that she did as it transpired he helped her find most of the people she eventually wished to speak to it was long and tiring walking from one narrow crowded street to another arguing asking pleading for information and then trying to sort out the lies and the mistakes and find the elements of truth scuff was better at that than she was he had a sharp instinct for evasion and manipulation he was also more prepared than she to threaten or call a bluff dont let em get away with nothin he said to her urgently as they left one smoothtongued man with a wispy black mustache thats a load o he bit his tongue to avoid the word he had been going to use i reckon as it were mr durban as pulled im out o the muck an es too mean ter say it thats wot that is he stood in the middle of the narrow pavement looking up at her seriously a costermonger wheeled his barrow past them knowing at a glance that she would not buy yer dint ought ter blieve every stupid sod as tells yer scuff continued well yer dint he granted generously ill tell yer if its true or not we better go and find this willie the dip if es real two washerwomen barged past them sheets tied around dirty laundry bouncing on their ample hips you dont think he is hester asked scuff gave her a skeptical look dip means e picks pockets oo dont round ere i reckon es all guff and so it turned out but by the end of the day they had heard many stories of durban from a variety of people up and down the dockside they had been discreet and hester believed with some pride that they had also been inventive enough not to betray the reason for their interest it was well after dusk with the last of the light faded even from the flat surface of the water when they finally made their way up elephant stairs just a few yards along from princes street the tide was running hard slapping against the stone and the sharp river smell was almost pleasant in the air after the closedin alleys they had walked all day and the heavy throatfilling odors of the docks where men were unpacking all manner of cargoes pungent clinging some so sweet as to be rancid the quiet movement of water was a relief after the shouting clatter of hooves and clank of chains and winches and thus of heavy loads they were tired and thirsty scuff did not say that his feet were sore but possibly he regarded it as a condition of life hester ached all the way up to her knees and beyond but in the face of his stoicism she felt that it would be selfindulgent to let it be known thank you she said as they started to walk up in the direction of paradise place you are quite right i do need you sall right he said casually giving a little lift of his shoulder visible as he passed under the street lamp he took a deep breath e werent a bad man he said then looked sideways at her quickly i know scuff does it matter if e told a few lies about oo e were or where e come from i dont know i suppose it depends what the truth is yer think its bad then they came to the end of elephant lane and turned right into church street it was completely dark now and the lamps were like yellow moons reflected over and over again right to the end there was a faint mist drifting up in patches from the water like castaway silk scarves i think it might be otherwise why would he lie about it she asked we dont usually lie about good things he was quiet scuff yes miss you cant go on calling me miss would you like to call me hester he stopped and tried to look at her hester he said carefully sounding the h dont you think mr monk might say im bein cheeky i shall tell him i suggested it hester he said again experimentally then he grinned hester lay awake and thought hard about what steps she should take next durban had tried for a long time well over a year to find mary webber he was a skilled policeman with a lifetime of experience in learning questioning and finding and he had apparently failed how was she to succeed she had no advantages over him as far as she knew beside her monk was asleep she thought she lay still not wanting to disturb him above all not wanting him to know that she was thinking puzzling durban must have searched for all the families named webber who lived in the area and gone to them he would even have traced any who had lived there and moved if it were possible if he had not found mary that way then hester would not either then just as she was finally drifting off towards sleep another thought occurred to her had durban gone backwards had he found out where they had come from before that the idea did not seem nearly as clever in the morning but she could think of nothing better she would try it at least until another avenue occurred to her it would be better than doing nothing it was not particularly difficult to find the local families by the name of webber who had a mary of roughly the right age it was simply tedious looking through parish registers asking questions and walking around people were willing to help because she embroidered the truth a little she really was looking for someone on behalf of a friend who had died tragically before finding them but whether mary webber was a friend or witness help or a fugitive she had no idea if it had not been for monks sake she might have given up after some time she found what appeared to be the right family only to discover that mary had been adopted from the local foundling hospital her mother had died giving birth to her brother and the adoptive family had no ability to care for a baby the wife being handicapped herself there was only one such hospital in the area and it was no more than half an hours bus ride to its doors it was a further half hour before hester now with scuff determinedly on her heels was shown into the office of donna myers the brisk and rather starched matron who ran it from day to day now what can i do for you she asked pleasantly looking hester up and down and then regarding scuff with a measuring eye scuff drew in his breath to protest that he needed nobody to look after him then realized that that was not what miss myers had in mind and let it out in a sigh of relief weve got plenty of work mrs myers told hester wages are poor but well feed you and the boy three square meals a day porridge and bread mostly but meat when we have it no drink allowed and no men but the place is clean and we dont treat anyone unkindly im sure the boy could find something too errands or the like hester smiled at her appreciating from her own experience in running the clinic just how strict one had to be no matter how deep or how genuine your pity to indulge one was to rob another thank you mrs myers i appreciate your offer but it is only information im looking for i already have work running a clinic of my own she saw miss myerss eyes open wider and a sudden respect flickered alive in them really mrs myers said guardedly and what is it that i can do for you then hester wondered whether to mention that monk was in the river police and decided that in view of the present highly unfavorable publicity it would not be a good idea i am seeking information about a woman who came here as a girl of about six with her mother she answered perhaps about fortyfive years ago the mother died in childbirth and the girl was adopted i believe the baby remained here i would like to know as much about them as your records show and if there is anyone who knows what happened to them i would be most grateful and why is it you wish to know mrs myers looked at her more closely are they related to you in any way what was the mothers name hester had known that the question would be asked but she still felt foolish that she could not answer i dont know her name there was no choice but the truth anything else would make her look dishonest so much of what she was saying was no more than an enlightened guess but it made the only decent sense it is the baby who concerns me she went on he would be in his fifties now but he died over six months ago and i want to trace the sister and tell her perhaps she would like to know what a fine man he was he was doing all he could to find her but he failed i am sure you understand why i wish to complete that for him she was leaping far to such a conclusion if durban had really been born in a foundling hospital was that why he had invented for himself a gentler more respectable background and a family that loved him poverty was not a sin but many people were ashamed of it no child should grow up with nobody to whom he was important and precious mrs myerss face was touched with pity for a moment she looked younger wearier and more vulnerable hester felt a sudden warmth towards her a momentary understanding of what her task must be to keep such a hospital functioning and not be overwhelmed by the enormity of her task the individual tragedies were intensely real the fear of hunger and loneliness too many bewildered women were exhausted and at their wits end to find the next place to rest the next mouthful to give their children the searing loneliness of giving birth in such a place stunned her and ridiculously she found herself gulping and tears stinging her eyes she imagined passing over your newborn child perhaps holding it only once and then bleeding to death alone buried by strangers no wonder mrs myers was careful and tired or that she kept a shell around her to close out some of that tide of grief ill ask my daughter mrs myers said quietly i doubt shell know but it is the best place to try thank you hester accepted immediately i would be very grateful indeed what year would that be mrs myers inquired turning to lead them through bare clean corridors sharp with the smell of lye and carbolic about the best calculation i can make hester answered but i am going on memory of neighbors of the family i will do what i can mrs myers replied dubiously her heels clicking sharply on the hard wooden floors maids with mops and buckets redoubled their efforts to look busy a palefaced woman hobbled out of sight around a corner two children with straggling hair and tearstained faces peeped around a doorway staring as mrs myers followed by hester and scuff striding past without looking to either side they found stella in a warm room facing the sun sharing a large enamel pot of tea with three other young women all dressed in what looked like a simple uniform of gray blouse and skirt and short black boots all of their boots were dirty and worn lopsidedly at the heels it was one of the younger women who stood up to lift the heavy pot and refill all the cups while stella remained seated hester assumed that was the privilege of being the matrons daughter until they were level with the table and she saw that stella was blind she turned at the sound of unfamiliar footsteps but she did not speak or rise mrs myers introduced hester without mentioning scuff and explained what she had come for stella considered for several moments her head raised as if she were staring at the ceiling i dont know she said at last i cant think of anyone who would remember that far back we have our people the right age her mother prompted do we i cant think who stella said very quickly mrs myers smiled but hester saw a sadness in it that for a moment was almost overwhelming mr woods might recall mina he barely remembers his name stella cut in her voice gentle but very definite he gets terribly confused mrs myers stood quite still mrs cordwainer she suggested there seemed to be a complete silence in the room no one moved i dont know her well enough to ask her such things stella replied huskily shes very old she might she did not finish the sentence perhaps mrs myers conceded she appeared to hesitate then came to a decision i will leave mrs monk to talk with you you may be able to think of something else excuse me and she walked away gathering speed and they could hear her footsteps fading away hester looked at stella wondering if the blind girl were aware of her scrutiny did she read voices as other people read expressions on a face miss myers hester began it really is of very great importance to several other people as well as to me i did not tell your mother the full extent of how much this matters if i can find her she may be able to clear away certain suspicions i believe to be urgent but without her help i cannot prove it if there is anyone at all you can think of to ask i have no other source left to try stella turned towards her her brow puckered she was clearly struggling with some decision she found intensely difficult there was pity in her expression as sharp as if she had not just seen hesters face but also read the emotions behind her eyes it was strange to be looked at so perceptively by someone who had no sight mrs monk if if i take you to see mrs cordwainer will you be discreet about anything you may see or hear in her house will you give me your word hester was startled it was the last sort of request she had expected what on earth could mrs cordwainer be doing that required such a promise was hester going to be asked to do something that would trouble her conscience was the old woman being cheated or abused in some way looking at stella she did not think that likely if i give you such a promise am i going to regret it she asked stellas lip trembled possibly she whispered but i cannot take you if you dont promise is mrs cordwainer suffering in some way because if she is i should find it very hard indeed not to do what i could to help stella almost laughed but she choked on the sound she is not that i can say absolutely hester was even more puzzled but the only alternative to accepting the conditions was to give up altogether then i give you my word she replied stella smiled and stood up then i shall take you to see mrs cordwainer she lives in a small house on the hospital grounds shell be asleep at this time of day but she wont mind being woken up if its to ask questions about the past she likes to tell tales of times back then can can i elp yer scuff offered hesitantly it was her turn to consider her answer she decided to accept although hester realized she must know her way around the hospital more easily than scuff she followed as side by side they made their way out of the room and down the corridor stella pretending she did not know where she was going and scuff pretending that he did they left the main building of the hospital and made their way along a wellworn path up a short flight of steps and to a row of cottages stella knew her way by the exact number of paces never once did she hesitate or miss her footing she could have done it in the pitchdark then hester realized with a jolt that in fact that was what she was doing always and she felt almost guilty for the bright sunlight and the color she could see stella knocked on the door of one of the cottages and it was immediately opened by a man in his middle forties shy and plain but with an acute intelligence in his eyes and his whole countenance lit with pleasure when he saw stella it was a moment before he even realized that there was anyone else with her stella introduced them and explained their purpose the man was mrs cordwainers son if she were as old as mrs myers had suggested then he must have been born to her late in life of course he said smiling at hester and scuff im sure mama will be pleased to tell you whatever she can he led them through into a small sunlit room where an ancient woman sat in an armchair wrapped around with a light shawl quite obviously asleep mr cordwainers book a translation of the plays of sophocles was lying faceup where he had left it to answer the door it was only as stella sat down in one of the other chairs that hester realized with amazement and then a wave of understanding that cordwainer had not guided her in here nor had he indicated to her where the chair was she must be sufficiently familiar with the room not to need such assistance and he knew that perhaps for her they were careful never to move anything even a few inches from its accustomed place was that the secret that she must not tell cordwainer was perhaps twenty years older than she and quite clearly he loved her there was no time to think of such things mrs cordwainer had woken up and was full of interest with very little prompting she recalled mary and her mother and the birth of the baby ard thing it were she said sadly blinking sharp gray eyes she werent the last i seen die but she were the first an i dint never forget er poor soul just young she were for all that the little girl were about five near as we could tell she sighed got er adopted out in a year or so nice family as were keen to ave er webb they was called or something like that but they couldnt take the babe couldnt manage a babe woman were crippled we dont like ter split em up but we got too many mouths ter feed as it were an they really wanted er what happened to the little boy hester asked softly she could imagine him growing up motherless one of many cared for but not special to anyone fed clothed possibly even taught but not loved it was so desperately easy to see why he had invented a happiness that had never existed nice little lad e were mrs cordwainer said dreamily curly air andsome enough even if e were a bit of a scrapper now an then but that int something i mind in a boy bit o spirit used ter make me laugh e did i were youngthen got away wi all sorts cause e made me laugh an e knew it what happened to him hester said again i dunno e stayed ere till e were eight then we let im go where to who took him took im bless you nobody took im e were old enough to work for isself i dunno where e went hester glanced at scuff who seemed to understand perfectly he shrugged and put his hands in his pockets she realized he had almost certainly been more or less alone since he was that age perhaps durban had been a mudlark as well was durban his mothers name she asked aloud we never knew is mothers name the old lady replied cant recall as we ever asked er we called im durban after a man from africa oo gave us money one time seemed like a good enough name an e dint mind did he ever come back went ter africa again far as i know not the man the boy oh not as i can think of went to look fer is sister little mary but shed gone e did tell us that dont know nothin else sorry were all a long time ago thank you so much youve been very helpful hester said sincerely mrs cordwainer looked at her her face puckered wot appened to im then dyou know he grew into a fine man hester replied joined the river police and died about six months ago giving his life to save others im looking for mary webber to tell her and give her his things if shes his sister but shes hard to find he was looking for her before he died but he never found her mrs cordwainer shook her head but she said nothing they declined a cup of tea not wishing to put them to trouble and mr cordwainer escorted them to the door when they reached it and scuff and stella were already outside he put his hand on hesters arm and held her back youll not find mary he said very softly he looked acutely unhappy its a long story carelessness a bit lonely wanting to please and maybe a bit too trusting but not fault not really hester was lost again what are you talking about she found that she was whispering in turn mary he replied shes in prison my mother kept up with her for the boys sake then when she got old i kind of took her place which prison is she in hester felt the knot of pain tighten inside her no wonder durban had not found her or had he and the end of his search was tragedy how that must have hurt him was that how she was connected to jericho phillips suddenly she wished with a passion that she had not asked mrs myers or old mrs cordwainer it was too late now holloway he replied he was watching her seeing the hurt and the disillusion in her face shes not a bad woman he said gently she married a chandler named fishburn he was killed when a dray came loose and crushed him left her the house but not much else she sold it and bought another one miles away in deptford turned it into a lodging house called herself myers to get away from fishburns debts seems hed been a bit of a gambler he sighed one of her lodgers was a thief she didnt know it but when he slipped she got caught with the things hed taken shed kept them against his rent but the police wouldnt believe that she got six months for it and lost the house of course im sorry she meant it whatll happen to her when she gets out the sadness in his expression answered her maybe i can find a job for her she said before thinking what it would involve she might not like her she had only cordwainers word that she was not really a thief or a receiver he smiled and nodded slowly stella and scuff were waiting she thanked cordwainer again and followed after them back in the hospital she thanked stella who looked at her anxiously and reminded her of her promise hester assured her that she had not forgotten and took her leave but as she approached the main door out she encountered mrs myers again she hoped profoundly that she was not going to have to lie to her but she was perfectly prepared to if necessary she had given stella her word not to disclose anything of her romance however she had been gone so long she could not pretend not to have seen old mrs cordwainer she was also acutely aware of scuff at her elbow and his opinion of her honesty which she found mattered to her even more than she had expected it would mrs myers smiled did stella take you to see old mrs cordwainer after all she asked i prevailed upon her hester replied thinking how she could word her reply so that it would sound as if the old lady had given her all the information and not even suggest that mr cordwainer had been present at all nothing clever came to her she was left with simply lying it would have been so much easier had scuff not been there mrs myers nodded i dont imagine it was difficult hester said nothing it was more uncomfortable than she had expected was she able to help mrs myers asked another lie but it was either that or admit that he had been there the lie was the better of the two evils yes thank you i now have a better idea at last where to look i dont mind you know mrs myers said gently i beg your pardon now hester was at a loss and knew she must look foolish i think john cordwainer is a very decent man and exactly right for stella mrs myers said frankly i just wish she would stop assuming i disapprove and accept him she is quite old enough not to mind what i think she owes me no more than to make the very best of her life hester felt a great weight slip from her and found herself smiling idiotically really she said with feigned innocence as if she had no idea what they were talking about your smile gives you away mrs myers said drily but i am glad you kept your word although if you hadnt it would make it easier for me to broach the subject how on earth do i say something without letting her know i have intruded on her privacy hester thanked her again for her help and went down the steps smiling even more widely of course it was not so easy to gain admittance to holloway prison or permission to see any particular person held there her first instinct was to ask monk to obtain it for her then she bit the words back and grasped for something else to say her whole purpose was to protect him she asked instead what he expected to do the following day and when he told her she chose a time when he would be alone away from the wapping station in which to go there and see if she could speak with orme she could explain to him exactly what she wanted and he would understand why orme chose to go with her and ask permission on the spot it might have been out of kindness to her but she felt that his own curiosity was also urgent and perhaps he wanted to meet the only sister of a man he had known respected and cared for for a great deal of his adult life it was this last that troubled hester she did not know how to say to him that she preferred to see mary alone and his presence might inhibit her from being open also as deeply felt if not as important to the case she was afraid that it would be an emotionally distressing experience for him she had seen his face when they had uncovered facts about durban that were ugly that threw doubt on his honesty his morality even the kindness that had long been part of his character orme had tried desperately to hide such unpleasantness to drown it out with loyalty but it was there growing slowly she turned to face him in the bleak stone corridor thank you mr orme i could not have done this without you but i need now at least the first time to speak with her alone you knew mr durban for years far better than she ever did think how she will feel she may care too much what you think of her to be frank we need the truth she said that firmly emphasizing the last word holding his gaze if we lose this chance there will not be another please let me speak to her alone the first time he gave a funny lopsided little smile are you protecting me too maam she realized that perhaps she had been would he be pleased or offended she had no idea the truth had at least the advantage of easing her conscience im sorry she admitted i suppose i was he blinked very faintly she could barely see it in the flat light but she knew he was not displeased she was shown into a plain cell with a wooden table and two chairs and a moment later the wardress brought in a woman in her middle fifties she was of average height and a little gaunt in the face causing hester to look a second time before realizing that she was handsome beneath the pallor and the fear and her eyes were golden brown just as durbans had been she sat down when hester invited her to but slowly stiff with anxiety hester sat also as the wardress said she would be immediately outside the door if she were needed and they had thirty minutes then she left hester smiled wishing she knew of a way to ease the womans fear without at the same time jeopardizing her mission my name is hester monk she began my husband is now head of the thames river police at wapping the position your brother held then suddenly she wondered if mary knew of his death had she been incredibly clumsy how long was it since she and durban had met what were the emotions between them mary moved her head minutely less than a nod it was time to stop prevaricating she lowered her voice did anyone tell you that he died heroically at the turn of last year he gave his life to save the lives of many others she waited watching mary webber nodded and her eyes filled with tears running unchecked down her thin cheeks hester took her handkerchief out of her small purse and placed it on the table where mary could take it im sorry i wish i did not have to bring this up he was looking for you frantically but as far as i know he didnt find you did he mary shook her head she reached out to the white cotton handkerchief then hesitated it was dazzlingly clean compared with her gray prison sleeve please hester urged mary picked it up and pressed it to her cheek it was faintly perfumed but such a thing may have been far from her mind now hester continued mindful of the minutes ticking into oblivion mr durban was a hero to his men but there are other people now who are trying to destroy the river police and they are blackening his name to do it i already know where he was born and spent the first eight years of his life i spoke to mrs myers she saw a smile touch marys lips but dim struggling against grief i know that you saved money and sent him all you could do you know what happened to him after he left the hospital mary blinked and wiped the tears off her cheeks yes we kept in touch for a long time she gulped until i realized what kind of man fishburn was she looked down after that i was ashamed and i kept out of my brothers way when fishburn was caught stealing and went to prison i changed my name and moved away when he died i sold the house i didnt dare before that in case he got out or he had one of his friends come and find me her voice was very low and she did not once look up at hester then i kept a lodging house an you dont need to tell me hester stopped her i know how you came to be here i imagine that was why your brother couldnt find you mary looked up i didnt want him to know i was here i spose the few people that knew me lied to him to cover it up theyd have known how i didnt want him even to to know id come to this he used to look up to me when he was little we she looked down again we were close then close as you can be when we scarce saw each other but i never stopped thinking of him i wish without thinking hester reached out and put her hand on marys where it lay on the rough tabletop i think he might have understood he was a good man but he knew none of us were faultless he hated cruelty and he wasnt above bending the law a little to stop people hurting women or especially children a lot of people admired him but there were some who hated him and a good few were scared half silly if you even said his name dont put him on a pedestal mary or think that he put you on one too late now mary replied with selfmockery its not too late to help clear his name hester said urgently ill fight as hard as i can and more important so will my husband but i cant do it without the truth please tell me what you know of him his character good and bad it will spoil everything if i try to defend him from an accusation and then make a fool of myself because it was true after that no one would believe me even if i were right mary nodded i know at last she met hesters eyes shyly but without flinching he was good in his own way but he had things to hide he grew up pretty rough had to beg and scrounge and i shouldnt wonder if he stole a bit the hospital had to put him out when he was eight had no choice i was the lucky one it wasnt till the webbers lost their money that i even knew what it was like to be hungry i mean the kind of hungry when you hurt inside and all you can think of is food any kind just so you can eat it he always knew hester cringed she did not have to imagine it she had seen it in too many faces but she did not interrupt he ran with some pretty rough people mary went on i know because he didnt hide it but i didnt ever ostracize him all i wanted was that he would stay alive she took a deep breath but i didnt know how bad it was or id have been much more scared hester moved without thinking her muscles knotted mary nodded imperceptibly he had some bad friends up and down the river mostly linehouse and the isle of dogs a bank was robbed and three of them were caught they were sent up to the coldbath fields one of them died there poor creature only twentythree he was the other two got broken in health and one of them at least drunken out of his mind when they got sent down was when durban joined the river police i never asked him if he was in on the bank job and he never told me i didnt want him to think i even thought it of him but i did he was pretty wild an a temper on him like one of those snapping eels she sighed it was all different after that he got a fright and he never went back to the old ways reckon maybe thats what made him such a good policeman he knew both sides of the road you may not be able to help or make anyone see that there was so much good in him but id be grateful to you all my life if youd try hester looked at the sad woman in front of her broken and alone and wished she could offer her something more than words of course ill try every way i can my husband liked durban more than anyone else he knew i liked him myself although we didnt meet very often but apart from that the reputation of the river police depends on proving that jericho phillips and anyone to do with him are liars jericho phillips mary said quietly her voice tight in her throat is he the one doing this yes do you know anything about him mary shivered and seemed to shrink further into herself i know better than to cross him does he know who i am durban s sister no i dont think anybody knows that suddenly a great deal more was clear to hester the urgency with which durban had looked for her and yet would tell no one why not even orme the fear that must have consumed him for her if phillips had found her before he did it would be a threat even more vivid than to kill another of the boys and he wont know anything i do hester added aloud i mean to see phillips hang so by the time you are out of here he will be dead and you can start a decent life without giving him a thought youll have a little money because durban would have wanted you to we have it safely for you you are his only relative so it has to be yours and if you would like a job and dont mind some hard work id like to have your help in the clinic i run in portpool lane at least think about it thered be a room for you good work to do and some decent friends to do it with hope flared in marys tired eyes so bright and sharp that it hurt to see it you be careful of phillips she said urgently he isnt alone you know he started that business on his boat with money quite a lot of it looks like nothing on the outside but i heard fishburn say it was like the best bawdy house on the inside comfortable as you like and photograph machines dont come for nothing an investor mary nodded not just that hes very well protected theres a few people who wouldnt like anything bad to happen to him and at least one of them is in the law and stood up for him in court a really top lawyer not one of them that hangs around the courthouse hoping to pick up business a queens counsel all silk robes wigs that kind of thing suddenly hester was icecold imprisoned in something terrible without escape as if the iron door were locked forever she could kick and scream forever but no one could hear her a queens counsel one who had defended phillips in court im sorry mary said apologetically i can see ive scared you but you have to know i cant sit by and let something happen to you when youve been so kind to me hester found it hard to speak her lips seemed numb her mouth full of cotton batting a lawyer are you sure mary stared at her struggling towards a dark understanding she had no trouble recognizing the pain phillips has power over lots of people she said lowering her voice as if even in prison she was afraid of being overheard maybe thats why my brother never caught him lord knows he tried hard enough be careful you dont know who hes got in his pocket whod like to escape but cant no hester whispered back without knowing why no i suppose you cant ten it was the middle of the afternoon and monk was busy catching up on some of the more pedestrian cases of theft from various yards along the waterfront when one of the men came to his door and told him that superintendent farnham had arrived and wished to see him immediately farnham was sitting down when monk went into the room and he did not rise he was clearly unhappy and in a very bad temper he indicated curtly for monk to take the chair opposite him the phillips case is over he said grimly his eyes hard and flat you lost in fact not only you monk but the whole of the river police you dont seem to be aware of quite how much he held up his hand to keep monk silent just in case he should think of defending himself it was bad enough when the wretched man was acquitted through your inefficiency and your wifes emotionalism although one expects such a thing from women but monk was so furious he could barely keep still sir that when i have finished farnham exploded until then you will hold your peace i am disappointed in you monk durban recommended you highly and i was fool enough to listen to him but thanks to your meddling your obsession with this phillips case not only i but most of the senior police in general and half the ferrymen lightermen dockers and warehousemen up and down both banks of the river also know a great deal more about the late commander durban than we wish to leave it monk that is an order there is quite enough crime on the thames that genuinely needs your attention solve it all of it with speed and justice and you may begin to redeem not only your own reputation but ours as well commander durban was a good officer sir monk said between his teeth acutely conscious of everything hester had told him the previous evening i have learned nothing about him to his discredit he added bluntly that only suggests that you are not a very good detective monk farnham replied there is a considerable amount that it seems for all your effort you failed to discover no sir there is not monk contradicted it was a firm lie and he intended to stick to it i have traced him back to the day he was born i just choose not to discuss it with others when it is none of their business he was a good man and deserves the same dignity of keeping his family affairs private that is accorded to the rest of us farnham stared at him across the table and gradually some of the temper died out of his eyes and left only tiredness and anxiety perhaps he conceded but now we have newspapermen asking more and more questions about him why he was so obsessed with this damned phillips case and why youre just as bad if not worse and we are doing nothing to curb you youre leaving half the regular work that should be your responsibility for orme to do he denies it but others say its true hes a loyal man orme he deserves better than to be lumbered with your job while you chase after phillips phillips beat us it happens sometimes we cant catch every single villain on the river we need to get this one sir hes like a malignant wound one that if it isnt cut out will poison the whole body farnham raised his eyebrows is he or have you just convinced yourself of that because he beat durban then he beat you can you swear to me that it isnt pride monk and prove it to me sir phillips murdered a young boy figgis because figgis wanted to escape the servitude phillips had him in which was far more than labor he was an object of pornography for the use and entertainment of phillipss customers its filthy farnham shivered with disgust but there are brothels all over london and every other city in europe in the world for all i know yes he murdered the boy god knows why it would surely have been much simpler to have put him on one of the ships leaving port and much less of a risk it was discipline sir monk interrupted to demonstrate to the rest of his boys what happens to those who defy him not very efficient farnham countered they wouldnt go if they didnt believe theyd be the ones whod get away then hed simply kill one of the others monk explained watching farnhams face one of the younger more vulnerable ones whoever the escapee was most fond of farnham paled and started to swear then bit it off its more than that also monk went on have you considered sir what kind of men his clients are farnhams lips curled it was a subconscious expression of revulsion men with obscene and uncontrolled appetites he replied the use of street women may by some stretch of the imagination be understandable the abuse of terrified and cowed children is not no sir its not monk agreed vehemently but that was not the aspect of them that i was thinking of they are deplorable but phillipss clients are also rich or they couldnt pay his prices its not a brothel he runs its entertainment costumes charades photographs they pay well for it your point monk we know phillips profits thats why he does it its hardly worth making a point of no sir monk said urgently thats only part of the reason perhaps even more important than that is its power he leaned forward a little his voice becoming sharper they are important men some of whom hold high office they know their appetites are not only twisted but because it is boys they are also criminal he saw a hideous understanding dawn in farnhams eyes they are highly corruptible in all sorts of other ways sir have you never wondered why durban couldnt catch phillips before he was close many times but phillips always got away oliver rathbone conducted his defense but who hired him do you know that i dont but i would dearly like to it could be farnham stopped his eyes wide yes sir monk finished for him it could be almost anyone a man in bondage to a devil inside himself and a monster like phillips outside is capable of all manner of acts he could lie at the heart of our justice our industry even our government do you still want me to forget about phillips and concentrate on warehouse robberies and the odd theft from cargoes on the water i could tell this damn journalist this farnham said very quietly god knows what hed do with it hes saying now that the corruption in the river police is deep and lasting and that the public has a right to know exactly what it is and where it leads hes even suggesting so far only verbally but print will follow that we should cease to exist as a separate body at all but be broken up and come under the local stations our survival depends on this monk yes sir ive heard rumor of it already but then he may be one of phillipss customers or in the pay of one farnham looked as if monk had slapped him but he did not retaliate it was himself he was furious with because he had not thought of it he even put up the possibility that durban was a partner in phillipss trade he said bitterly and his pursuit of phillips was in order to take over all of it thats what hell write if we dont find a way of stopping him his shoulders hunched tightly as if every muscle in his body were knotted tell me monk dont leave me defenseless when i talk to this bastard what did you find out about durban we cant afford dignity now for the living or the dead i wont tell him but i need to know or i cant defend any of us monk weighed his trust and his loyalties he needed to trust farnham for the sake of the future he lied about his family sir he admitted said his father was a schoolmaster in essex actually i dont think he knew who his father was his mother died in a foundling hospital giving birth to him he grew up there he was put out in the streets to earn his own way when he was eight thats why he had such compassion for mudlarks and other children or women on their own the hungry the frightened the abused it was fellow feeling hed known it himself oh god farnham ran his hands through his sparse hair any crime known against him and tell me the truth monk if i get caught in a lie just once theyll never believe me again not known sir monk said reluctantly but friends of his robbed a bank bad associates growing up in the streets thats unavoidable it was just after that that he joined the river police thank god now who is this mary webber he was hell bent on finding childhood sweetheart commonlaw wife what sister sir older sister she was adopted but the family who took her the woman was crippled and couldnt cope with a baby so he was left behind mary used to save up pennies and send them to him they lost touch when she married and later discovered her husband was a thief she was too ashamed to let durban know that the hospital gave him the name of durban after one of their benefactors who happened to be from africa she changed her name when she married and then again when her husbands creditors came after her where is she now i know but its irrelevant sir shes safe for the time being farnham blasphemed gently i apologize monk you did a superb job finding out about durban i hope nobody but me ever has to know about it ill put a flea in this newspapermans ear that will keep him busy and far away from us for as long as possible if he speaks to you tell him you are under orders on pain of losing your job to say nothing do you understand yes sir thank you youll keep me informed yes sir monk told orme briefly what farnham had said and was only just outside the station walking towards the stairs down to where the police boat was waiting when a man approached him he was ordinary slightly shambling impossible to describe so he would be known again he wore an old seamans jacket shapeless enough to hide his build and a cap on his head which hid his hair his eyes were narrowed against the bright light off the water commander monk he said politely monk stopped yes got a message fer yer sir from whom dint give me no more sir said as yerd know the mans voice was innocent even courteous but there was something knowing in his manner and the creases that almost concealed his eyes suggested a sneer whats the message monk asked then half wished he had refused to listen never mind if you cant tell me who its from maybe it doesnt matter gotta deliver it sir the man insisted paid ter do it wouldnt reckon my chances if i mess wi this gentleman nasty he would be real nasty if yer get my meanin he looked up at monk and he was definitely smiling now glad ter see yer listenin sir save my neck maybe gentleman said ter tell yer ter back off the durban case whatever that is dyou know he lifted an eyebrow yeah i can see yer do e said it would be best people think like they do cause durban did wot e did otherwise this gentleman said ed make the ole thing public said e as all the evidence that yer took on this durban s job wi the police wi all is papers and things an yer took over is other interests an all the business o getting little boys that is yer got one special trained up fer yerself an all clean and bright e is go down a treat wi certain gentlemen wi special tastes scuff i think e called im that sound right to yer sir monk felt sick to his stomach his body cold it was obscene as if a filthy hand had reached out and touched everything that was decent and precious staining them with its own dirt he wanted to lash out at the man hit him so hard he broke that leering face and left it a bloody pulp so he would never smile again never speak clearly enough to say words anyone could distinguish but that would be exactly what he wanted and he was probably not unarmed an attack would be the perfect excuse to knife him in the stomach it would be selfdefense another example of river police brutality he could say honestly that he had accused monk of procuring a small boy for phillipss use who could prove otherwise was this what durban had faced threats of blackmail do what i want or ill paint every decent act of compassion as an obscenity the accusation will stain your name because of their own filth there will be those who believe it you will be unable to do your job ill cripple you or do what i say turn a blind eye to the cases i tell you to and ill keep quiet and when youve turned away from some out of fear of me ill have another unbreakable thread to bind you with and this one will be true you will have denied your duty corrupted yourself to stay safe i hear you monk replied tell your paymaster to go to hell oh very unwise mr monk sir very unwise the man shook his head still smiling id think again on that if i were yer you probably would monk agreed but then you are obviously for sale i am not tell him to go to hell the man hesitated only seconds then realized that he would gain nothing by remaining and turned and went away at a surprisingly rapid pace monk walked back into the station what he had to do was best done immediately before he had time to weigh his words and be afraid orme looked up surprised to see him back so soon he must have read the concern in monks face he stood up as if to follow him into his office i need to speak to everyone monk said distinctly now orme sat down again slowly and one by one the other men stopped what they were doing and faced him he had their attention he must begin as soon as i stepped outside a few minutes ago he said i was accosted by a man who delivered a message he did not say from whom but the implication was obvious it was difficult to trust he hated making himself so vulnerable he looked at their waiting faces this was his future he must trust these men or lose their respect and the one chance he had to lead them this man told me to leave the jericho phillips case alone he went on if i dont phillips will make sure that i am accused of procuring small boys for use on his boat to be rented to his clients and then photographs taken in obscene and illegal acts to be sold for entertainment he drew in his breath and let it out slowly to try to stop the terror in his voice it embarrassed him that he could not stifle it completely he will say to the press that initially commander durban was not phillipss enemy but his partner and that they fell out over sharing the profits he will say also that when i took over commander durbans position here i took over his business interests as well and that the boy my wife and i have taken into our home is intended for that purpose also he had committed himself he had not intended to he had also said that scuff was remaining with them he realized without any real surprise that he meant that and he knew hester had long ago stopped debating with herself it remained only to hear what scuff thought once the immediate danger to him had passedif it did he looked around at the mens faces afraid of what he would see amusement disgust disappointment the struggle whether to believe him or not fear for their own positions we must stop him he went on avoiding meeting the eyes of anyone in particular he would not try to demand or intimidate and certainly not beg if we dont he will do all he can to bring down the whole river police we are the only force standing between him and running his filthy trade unhampered should he tell them the rest the even greater danger he had trusted them this far now was the time to win or lose them altogether he looked at orme and saw his steady gaze grave and unwavering there was hardly a sound in the room it was too warm for the black stove at the end to be lit the doors to the outside were closed muffling the noises of the river its worse than just the boys as victims he went on now looking at their faces one by one phillipss patrons are men of wealth or they couldnt afford his prices rich men have influence and usually power so his opportunities for blackmail are limitless you can imagine them for yourselves port authorities harbormasters revenue men lawyers he clenched his hands us no one moved you see the danger he made it a statement rather than a question even if we are not guilty there is the high chance that we may be accused and which of us would not be tempted to do as we were told rather than have that charge made in public no matter how innocent we were the thought alone is enough to make you sick what would your wives have to endure your parents or children he saw in their faces the understanding and the fear he waited for the anger but it did not come he did not even sense it im sorry that my haste to convict phillips allowed him to be acquitted for the murder of figgis ill get him for something else he said it calmly but as he said it he knew the promise would bind him forever yes sir orme said as soon as he was certain monk was not going to add any more he looked at the men then back at monk well get him sir that too was an oath there was a murmur of agreement no dissenting voices no halfheartedness monk felt a sudden ease as if he had been given a blessing he did not expect or deserve he turned away before they saw him smiling in case anyone misunderstood the emotion of joy for something more trivial and less profound in its gratitude oliver rathbone was increasingly unhappy about the phillips case it invaded his thoughts at the times when he had expected to be happiest margaret had asked him what it was that caused his anxiety and he could not answer her an evasion was undignified and she was intelligent enough to know it for what it was to lie was not even a possibility it would close a door between them that might never again be opened because guilt would bar it and yet in the quiet ease of his sitting room with margaret opposite him wishing to talk with her he remembered how much he had enjoyed it only a month or two ago he recalled her smile in repose she was happy in his mind he could hear her laughter at some joke she liked the subtle ones best always catching the point even their long discussions when they disagreed were delicate and full of pleasure she had an acute grasp of logic and was surprisingly wellread even in subjects he would not have expected a woman to know but he sat in silence not daring to speak about the phillips case and the rift with monk and hester it seemed to touch so many things like a drop of ink in a glass of clear water it spread to stain everything it touched still it was painful to sit in the same room not talking to each other he was being a coward it must be addressed or gradually he would lose all that he valued most it would slip away inch by inch until there was nothing left to grasp what was he afraid of truly that he had lost the respect of monk and hester a sense of honor with phillips he had won but the victory was sour he had been supremely clever but he knew now that he had not been wise phillips was guilty probably of having murdered fig but certainly of the vile abuse of many children and rathbone was beginning to believe also of the blackmail and corruption of many powerful men he looked across at where margaret sat sewing but he was careful not to meet her eyes in case she read in him what he was thinking he could not continue like this the gulf was widening every day there was no answer other than to find out who had hired arthur ballinger to retain rathbone in phillipss defense he had already asked and been refused it must be done without ballingers knowledge ballinger had said it was a client therefore it would be in his official books at his chambers the money would have gone through the accounts because it was the office that had passed it to rathbone since it was a client and money was involved it would have been noted by cribb ballingers meticulous clerk it must have begun roughly the time ballinger had first come to rathbone and continued until the time of the trial and phillipss acquittal if rathbone could find a list of ballingers clients between those times it would be a matter of eliminating those whose cases had been heard in some other matter and would now be public knowledge or of course those still pending but due to come to trial soon but he could hardly go to ballingers office and ask to see his books the refusal would be automatic and cause highly uncomfortable questions it would make the relationships between rathbone and his fatherinlaw virtually impossible and obviously margaret would be aware of it yet it would be wildly dangerous to pay someone else to do it even if he could find anyone with the requisite skills the temptation to extort blackmail afterwards would be almost overwhelming not to mention the chance to sell the information elsewhere possibly to phillips himself there was only one answer rathbone would have to devise a way to do it himself the thought made him thoroughly miserable a kind of sour chill settled in the pit of his stomach after all he had no idea who might be blackmailed by phillips who were the victims of such appetites as he fed and thus could be manipulated as phillips wished it could be any of the men rathbone had previously considered his friends honorable and skilled and then an even more painful thought forced itself into his understanding if people were aware of phillips and his trade they might equally well think such things of rathbone himself why not he was the one who had defended him and gained his acquittal at the price of his own previously treasured friendships yes tomorrow he must go to ballingers office and find the records he really had no other endurable choice it was one thing to make up his mind it was quite another to execute the plan the following morning as his cab set him down outside ballingers offices he realized exactly how far apart he and ballinger were he knew from past experience that ballinger himself would not be in for at least another hour but the excellent cribb was always prompt had the offices been any other than those of his fatherinlaw he would have considered trying to lure cribb away and into his own service good morning sir oliver cribb said with courtesy that bordered on genuine pleasure he was a man of about fortyfive but with an ascetic air that made him seem older he was of average height and had a lean bony face that showed intelligence and a very carefully concealed humor good morning cribb rathbone replied i hope you are well very thank you sir i am afraid mr ballinger is not in yet is there anything with which i can assist you already rathbone loathed what he was doing how much easier it was to be honest the embarrassment and strain of this was awful thank you he accepted he must cast the die quickly or he would lose his nerve i believe there is he lowered his voice it has come to my knowledge and of course i cannot tell you from whom that one of mr ballingers clients may be involved in something distinctly unethical a matter of playing one person against another if you understand me how very distasteful cribb said with some sympathy if you wish me to inform mr ballinger of course i shall do so perhaps you would prefer to leave it in writing for him i can give you pen and paper and an envelope with wax to seal it rathbone smothered his scruples with an effort thank you but i have nothing sufficiently specific so far i know only when the man in question was here if i might glance at his diary for the period it would confirm any suspicions or deny them cribb looked troubled as rathbone had known he would im very sorry sir but i cannot show you mr ballingers diary it is confidential as i am sure your diary is he shifted his weight very slightly from one foot to the other i know you would not wish anything wrong sir rathbone did not have to try to look confused no i would not he agreed i had hoped that if i explained my dilemma to you you might have some idea how to solve it you see the difficulty is that the man may well be a personal friend of mr ballingers so much so that he may refuse to believe it of him until it is too late unless i can prove it oh dear cribb said quietly yes i perceive your difficulty sir oliver i am afraid mr ballinger is more charitable in some of his judgments than perhaps the circumstances justify rathbone understood exactly that was cribbs loyal way of admitting that ballinger did not choose all his friends with care perhaps sir we might discuss this problem in my office it might be more discreet if you dont mind cribb suggested of course rathbone agreed thank you he followed cribb to the tiny room barely more than a large cupboard where a wellpolished desk was crowded in between walls covered from floor to ceiling with shelves of files cribb closed the door as much for room so that they might both sit as for privacy he looked at the wall briefly knowing exactly where every file and folder was rathbone followed his glance to the diary for the month in question this is a very difficult problem indeed cribb said facing rathbone again i really dont know what is for the best sir oliver i have the greatest respect for you and i am aware that you are concerned for mr ballingers welfare both professional and personal i need to think on this very deeply perhaps i might fetch you a cup of tea so we may discuss it in some comfort thank you rathbone accepted that would be very good of you cribb hesitated an instant looking very steadily at rathbone then he excused himself and left closing the door behind him rathbone felt vile as if he were about to steal something the diary was on the shelf he was committed whether he looked at it now or not cribb would believe that he had what was rathbone trying to do find the truth whoever it saved or lost he took the book down and searched the right pages rapidly little more than scribbling he took down the names he was barely finished and had only just replaced the diary on the shelf when cribb returned carefully making a noise with his feet on the boards outside before he opened the door cribb set the tea tray down on the desk thank you rathbone said his mouth dry shall i pour sir cribb offered if you please rathbone found that his own hands were shaking he considered offering cribb some kind of appreciation what would be suitable and not insulting thirty pieces of silver cribb poured the tea a cup for rathbone nothing for himself it was the most difficult thing rathbone had ever swallowed it tasted sour and he was aware that it was he himself who had poisoned it thank you he said aloud he wanted to add something but it was all contrived insulting you are welcome sir oliver cribb replied calmly he appeared to see nothing odd in rathbones manner in fact to be totally unaware of his appalling discomfort i have given the matter a great deal of thought and i am afraid i can think of no solution for it i was wrong to have asked rathbone replied and that at least he was absolutely certain about i must seek some other solution he finished the tea please do not trouble mr ballinger with it until i can think of some way to ease his mind at the same time as i tell him of it if i am fortunate it may turn out to be an error anyway let us hope so sir cribb agreed in the meantime as you say it would be better not to distress mr ballinger unnecessarily rathbone thanked him again and cribb walked with him to the front door rathbone went down the steps into the street heavyfooted imprisoned within himself and weighed down with a moral dilemma from which there was now no escape he went straight to his own office and spent the next four hours comparing notes of cases he knew court dates and trials past and pending against the names he had copied down from ballingers diary he pursued every one to its conclusion finding out who the people were of what they were accused by whom they were defended and what had been the verdict most of the cases were trivial and easy enough to dismiss as regular business in fact many were to do with family estates wills and quarrels over property some were trials or settlements out of court for cases of financial incompetence or malfeasance those that had gone to trial and were concluded he could also discount their course was clear and now in the public domain simple cases of moral decline ending in tragedy common enough in the end he was left with only three who could be phillipss benefactor or victim sir arnold baldwin mr malcolm cassidy and lord justice sullivan it was that last name that caused him to freeze and his hands to clench the paper but that was ridiculous lord justice sullivan had to have a solicitor like any other man he would have property in all likelihood a house in london and a home in the country property always involved deeds money and possible disputes and of course there were wills and inheritances and other matters of ownership and litigation his immediate task was to learn more about each of the men on the list and if necessary to actually meet them although exactly how he would determine which of them it was he realized he had no idea what did a man look like who was driven by such an appetite was he frightened plagued with guilt compulsive like one who gambles or drinks to excess or did he look like anyone else and that darker part of his nature emerged only when he permitted it secretly on the river at night this was forced upon him even more plainly upon meeting both cassidy and baldwin the first at a luncheon the latter at one of the gentlemens clubs of which he was a member he observed nothing about either of them that made him wary indeed it was only his own suspicions that caused him any preoccupation whatever meeting sullivan proved more difficult and he felt a crowding sense of inevitability as if in his mind he had already determined the mans guilt since he was the judge who had actually heard the case the situation was hideously tangled by that fact alone in order to meet the judge rathbone had to connive to obtain an invitation to a reception to which he had not originally been invited a most unseemly act and it was not easy to ask margaret if she would come to her it was even harder to offer any explanation that was not clearly an evasion im sorry my dear he said busying himself with sorting his cuff links so he did not have to meet her eyes i realize it is unfair to expect you to give up your evening at such little notice but the opportunity only came today or i should have told you in better time there are people who will be there whom i wish very much to meet i cannot discuss it because it has to do with a case now he faced her the words had come to him just in time and it sounded perfectly reasonable what was more they were true if taken obliquely enough of course she replied searching his eyes to understand his meaning he smiled i should enjoy it far more if you were able to come with me that was untrue but he felt he had to say it it would be simpler if he were alone he would not have to guard himself against being too closely observed and possibly caught in an inconsistency i should be delighted she replied then turned away also not having seen the candor she was looking for is it formal yes im afraid it is it is not a concern i have plenty of gowns that at least was true he had seen that she had more than sufficient in the latest fashion simply for the pleasure of it she could look superb but always in the discreet taste of a woman of breeding she would not know how to be vulgar it was one of the things that most pleased him about her he would like to have told her so but to say so now would be forced it would be robbed of all sincerity and he did mean it they arrived at the reception at precisely the best time neither early enough to seem too eager nor late enough to appear as if wanting to draw attention to themselves to be ostentatious was illbred to say the least margaret was dressed in cool plain colors shading towards the blues rather than the reds and subdued as if in shadow her bodice was cut low but she could wear it without showing more of herself than was modest because she was slender her skirt was full and she had always known how to walk with great grace you look lovely he said to her quietly as they came slowly down the stairs her hand resting lightly on his arm he saw the color warm her neck and cheeks and was glad he meant it it was no empty compliment they were greeted by the hostess a thin handsome woman of excellent family who had married money and was a little uncertain whether she had been as wise as she thought she smiled shyly and welcomed everyone then fell back on polite conversation about nothing at all leaving people wondering if they had accepted an invitation they were offered only out of courtesy poor soul margaret said quietly as she and rathbone moved into the crowd nodding to acquaintances acknowledging briefly those whose names they could not immediately remember or whom they wished to avoid some people did not know when to allow a conversation to die a natural death poor soul rathbone questioned wondering if there were something he should have known margaret smiled our hostess made a financially suitable marriage and is more than a little out of her depth within trade instead of aristocracy she explained but if one wishes to one can learn he raised his eyebrows i beg your pardon for the first time in several days she laughed outright you look concerned oliver do you regard yourself as trade i had not seen myself as impoverished and i certainly did not marry you for money i refused wealthier men than you i thought you might be interesting he let out his breath slowly feeling a certain warmth rise up his cheeks this was the woman he had fallen in love with i am professional he replied with mock tartness which is nothing at all like trade but it is still a considerable advantage to have a wellbred wife even if she does have rather more wit and spirit than is entirely comfortable she gripped his arm for a moment then eased away it is not good for you to be comfortable all the time she told him you become complacent and that is most unattractive perhaps you had better find whoever it is you wish to see he sighed perhaps i had he conceded the misery swelling inside him again making it hard to draw his breath it was not difficult to encounter sullivan without it seeming forced but rathbone could feel his heart pounding it was hard to get his breath and when he spoke to keep his voice steady what would he do if sullivan simply refused to see him alone rathbone must phrase it so that he had no suspicion or does a guilty man always suspect they were separated from the next group by a yard or two and sullivan had his back to an alcove full of books and objets dart ah nice to see you rathbone he said warmly still celebrating your victory i imagine you achieved what i would have thought was damned near impossible rathbone hid his feelings about his own part in the trial which were growing more and more repugnant to him all the time thank you he accepted since to do anything less would be discourteous and he had to be civil at least until he could find a time and place to speak to sullivan alone he was used to seeing him in his wig and robes and at a distance of several yards from the floor of the court up to the judicial bench closer he was still a handsome man but the features were a little less clearly defined the skin blotchier as if his health were compromised perhaps by selfindulgence and the resultant dyspepsia it proved less difficult than i foresaw he added since sullivan seemed to be waiting for him to say something further river police dug their own graves sullivan replied grimly both durban and monk i think their power needs curbing maybe the newspapers are right and its time they were dispersed and command given entirely to the local stations on shore too much a law unto themselves at the moment rathbone choked back his protest he could not afford to antagonize sullivan yet and he would learn nothing if he put him on the defensive do you think so he asked assuming an air of interest it seems they have a particular knowledge and i must say up to this point an excellent record up to this point sullivan agreed but by all accounts durban was not as clever or as honorable as we had assumed and this new man monk has followed too much in his footsteps you have only to look at the phillips case to see that he is not up to the job promoted beyond his ability i dare say i dont think so rathbone protested sullivan raised his eyebrows but my dear fellow you proved it yourself the man involved his wife a good woman no doubt but sentimental full of wellmeaning but illogical ideas and he apparently fell victim to the same wishful thinking he presented inadequate evidence to poor tremayne and so the jury had no choice but to find phillips not guilty furthermore we know that now he cannot be tried for that crime again even if we find incontrovertible proof of his guilt we cannot afford many fiascos like that rathbone no indeed rathbone said with perfectly genuine gravity the situation is now very serious indeed more than perhaps monk has any comprehension then you agree that perhaps the river police should be disbanded sullivan prompted rathbone looked up at him no no i was thinking of the critical problem of blackmail he watched sullivans face and knew from some movement of shadow in his eyes that he had struck a nerve how deep he had yet to find out he smiled very slightly naturally in order to defend phillips i had to study the evidence with extreme care and of course question him closely naturally sullivan agreed his face oddly stiff but do be careful rathbone whatever he told you as your client is still confidential regardless of the fact that the verdict is in and he is acquitted i am not the judge hearing the case now and no privilege pertains to me none at all rathbone said drily i was not going to let anything slip beyond generalities he has never denied that he makes his living by satisfying the more pathetic and obscene tastes of men who have the money to pay to have their fantasies indulged sullivans face reflected a conflict of emotions fear contempt and flickering excitement also with such knowledge it must have cost you dearly to defend him he observed while they might have pretended amiability it was now gone completely and both men knew it what remained was mutual dislike and a thin film of disgust a lot of people i defend have practices that revolt me rathbone replied i am sure you have conducted cases where both the crime itself and the character of the accused offended you profoundly it would not cause you to recuse yourself from the case or some cases would never be heard sullivan gave a slight shrug and half turned away i am aware of the difficulties of the law and justice he said without expression is someone accusing blackmail or is all this merely theoretical rathbone steadied his breathing with difficulty sullivan was a judge rathbone had stolen the information from ballinger which he could not afford to have anyone know for his own sake for cribbs possibly even for margarets but rathbone had something to learn and something to redeem he must lie regrettably i believe it to be fact at least in one case possibly more phillips does nothing unless there is profit for him in it in the case of supplying boys to satisfy these appetites there is double profit first for the satisfaction itself second to keep silence afterwards because in some instances if not all it is illegal it seems these men will not or cannot control themselves even when it is of such fearful cost to them he watched the blood ebb from sullivans skin leaving his cheeks blotched his expression did not change in the slightest i see he said very quietly in little more than a whisper i was certain you would rathbone agreed since they are obviously men who can pay blackmail sufficient to keep phillipss silence they are wealthy men and so likely to also be men of power and even of farreaching influence we can have no idea who they are you do not need to spell it out rathbone i perceive where you are going it is very grave as you say and if you throw around wild and rash accusations you will place yourself in very great danger indeed i imagine you realize that it was quite definitely a question and it required an answer of course i do my lord rathbone said grimly i have taken intense care regarding to whom i spoke about this it might not be wise to let sullivan think he had told no one else but i cannot ignore it the potential for corruption is too great corruption sullivan asked staring at rathbone are you not exaggerating a trifle if certain men have tastes that you deplore is their private behavior or the company they keep really your concern if they can be blackmailed for money then i suppose that it is not rathbone replied measuring every word then they are victims but until they complain it is a private suffering a footman passed hesitated and moved on a woman laughed but if they are men of power he continued and the price is no longer money but the abuse of that power then it is the business of us all most particularly if the power concerned is high office in finance or government or most especially in the judiciary his eyes met sullivans squarely and it was sullivan who flinched and looked away what if this man were to pay his blackmail in blindness to bending the law he asked or what if he used fraud embezzlement of money to pay phillips after his own funds have run out or police authority to allow or even abet in a crime port authorities might overlook smuggling theft even murder on the river lawyers or even judges may corrupt the law itself who can say who is involved or how far it may seep into the fabric of all we believe in all that separates us from the jungle sullivan swayed his face gray get a grip on yourself man rathbone said between his teeth im not going to let this pass those boys are beaten and sodomized and the ones who rebel are tortured and murdered you and i have both connived to let phillips get away with it and you and i are going to put that right you cant sullivan said weakly no one can stop him youve seen that you were used just as much as i was if you turn against him now hell say you were a customer and defended him to save yourself that your payment was blackmail hope flickered on his face pasty and sheened with sweat he took several steps backwards but there was nowhere to escape to rathbone followed him even further away from the crowd people assumed they were speaking confidentially and left them alone the crowd swirled around them and away oblivious how in gods name did this happen to you rathbone demanded sit down before you fall over and make a complete fool of yourself sullivans eyes widened as if the idea appealed to him insensibility there was a way to get out after all dont entertain it rathbone snapped people will think you are drunk and it will only delay what is inevitable if you could control yourself if you could stop surely to god in heaven you would have sullivan shut his eyes to block out the sight of rathbones face of course i would have damn you it all began in innocence before it became an addiction really rathbone said icily sullivans eyes flew open i only wanted excitement you cant imagine how bored i was the same thing night after night no thrill no excitement i felt half alive the great appetites eluded me passion danger romance was passing me by nothing touched me it was all served up on a plate empty without without meaning i didnt have to work for anything i ate and left as hungry as i came i presume you are referring to sexual appetite im referring to life you smug bastard sullivan hissed then one day i did something dangerous i dont give a damn about relations with other men that disgusts me except that its illegal his eyes suddenly shone have you ever had the singeing in your veins the pounding inside you the taste of danger terror and then release and known you are totally alive at last no of course you havent look at you youre desiccated fossilized before youre fifty youll die and be buried without ever having really been alive a world he had never thought of opened in front of rathbone a craving for danger and escape for wilder and wilder risks and do you feel alive now he asked softly helpless to control your own appetites even when they are on the brink of ruining you you pay money to a creature like jericho phillips and he tells you what to do and what not to and you think that is power hunger governs your body and fear paralyzes your intellect you have no more power than the children you abuse you just dont have their excuses for an instant sullivan saw himself as rathbone did and his eyes filled with terror rathbone could almost have been sorry for him were it not for his complete disregard for the other victims of his obsession so you went to ballinger to find a lawyer who could get phillips off he concluded of course wouldnt you have sullivan asked because hes my fatherinlaw and i was monks friend and knew him well enough to use the weaknesses that were the other side of his strengths im not a fool sullivan said waspishly yes you are rathbone told him a total fool now you have not only phillips blackmailing you you have me as well and the payment i shall require is the destruction of phillips that will silence me forever on this issue and obviously it will get rid of phillips on the end of a rope with luck sullivan said nothing his face was sweating and there was no color in his skin at all i wont ruin you now rathbone said with disgust i need to use you then he turned and walked away in the morning rathbone sent a message to the wapping station of the river police asking monk to call on him as soon as he was able to there was no point in going to look for monk who could have been anywhere from london bridge to greenwich or even beyond monk arrived before ten he was immaculate as usual freshly shaved and with a neatly pressed white shirt under his uniform jacket rathbone was mildly amused but too sick inside to smile this was the monk he knew dressed with the careless grace of a man who loved clothes and knew the value of selfrespect and yet there was no lift in his step and there were shadows of exhaustion around his eyes he stood in the middle of the office waiting for rathbone to speak rathbone was horribly familiar with the charges against the river police in general and durban and monk in particular he had resented it before since last night it woke an anger in him that he could hardly contain he wanted the rift between monk and himself healed but he avoided words they only redefined the wound monk was waiting rathbone had sent for him so he must speak first the situation is worse than i thought he began he felt foolish for not having seen it from the start phillips is blackmailing his clients and god only knows who they are i imagine the devil knows too monk said drily i assume you didnt send for me to tell me that you cant have imagined that i was unaware im threatened myself because ive taken in a mudlark largely for his protection phillips is suggesting that i am his partner in procuring rathbone felt the heat of guilt in his face i know where the money came from that paid me he said i will donate it to charity anonymously i think i am not proud of the way i obtained the information a flash of pity lit monks eyes which surprised rathbone there was a temperance in monk he had not seen before the instructing solicitor was my fatherinlaw he continued the next was more difficult but he would not prevaricate or attempt to excuse i will not tell you how i learned who his client is there is no need for the guilt to be anyones but mine it is sufficient for you to know that it is lord justice sullivan he saw the incredulity on monks face then dawning perception and amazement his smile was bleak precisely he said with bitter humor it throws a new light on the trial does it not monk said nothing there was no anger in his face no blame although it would have been justified i faced him last night rathbone continued obviously he is one of phillipss clients and victims he used the word addiction to describe his craving for the illicit thrills he gains from his pleasures perhaps it is i never thought of pornography as anything but the grubby voyeurism of those who were incapable of a proper relationship perhaps it is more than that a dependence of character as with alcohol or opium it seems with him it is the danger the risk of being caught in an act that would unquestionably ruin him i found him both pathetic and repellent monk was beginning to think rathbone saw the ideas race in his mind the keenness of his eyes i imagine he may be of use to you he suggested that was my purpose in unmasking him at least to myself but i advise you to handle him with care he is erratic both angry and frightened possibly a little less than sane as you or i would see sanity he might very well rather put a bullet through his brain than face exposure thank you monk said meeting his eyes rathbone smiled he knew in that moment that monk understood how difficult it had been for him in all its complexity of reasons he said nothing but words were far too clumsy too inexact anyway eleven claudine burroughs arrived early at the portpool lane clinic it was not that there was a particularly large amount to do it was more that she wanted to tidy up linens make certain of supplies and put things in order she had started working there because she needed something to occupy herself that left her feeling less empty than time spent with her acquaintances she could not call any of them friends she felt that hardship had a warmth to it an implicit trust in kindness even a common purpose or dream she found none of these things in the visits tea parties dinners and balls she attended even church had seemed more a matter of discipline than of hope and of obedience rather than kindness she had chosen this particular charity because no one else she knew would ever involve themselves in anything so vulgar or so practical they wished to appear virtuous they did not wish to put on old clothes roll up their sleeves and actually work as claudine was now doing sorting out kitchen cupboards of course at home she would not have dreamed of doing such a thing nor even would her cook any respectable household had scullery maids for that kind of task actually she found it rather satisfying and while her hands were in the hot soapy water her mind was turning over the small signs of anxiety and unhappiness she had seen in hester lately she appeared to be avoiding margaret rathbone who was also distant and on occasion a trifle sharp claudine both liked and respected margaret but not with the same warmth she felt for hester hester was more spontaneous more vulnerable and less proud therefore when bessie came into the kitchen to say that hester was here and she was going to make her a pot of tea and take it to her claudine told bessie to finish restocking the cupboards and said that she herself would take the tea when she put the tray down on the table in the office she could see at a glance that hester was still just as worried as before if not more so she poured the tea to give herself an excuse to stay right at this moment she wanted more than anything else to help but she was not certain what was wrong there were so many possibilities the first was money either personally or for the clinic or it might be a serious case of injury or health that they did not know how to treat that had happened in the past and no doubt would again or it could be quarrels with the staff differences of opinion in management or domestic trouble or unhappiness but what she considered most likely was something to do with the criminal trial where hester and her husband had given evidence but she could not ask it would be both clumsy and intrusive to do so i think mrs rathbone i mean lady rathbone will not be in today she said carefully she saw hester stiffen and then relax a little and she went on but she looked at the finances yesterday and we are really doing quite well good hester acknowledged it thank you that seemed to be the end of the conversation however claudine would not give up so easily she looked concerned to me mrs monk do you think she may be not quite well hester looked up giving it her full attention now margaret i hadnt noticed i should have i wonder if she stopped she is with child claudine finished for her possibly but i dont think so to be honest she looks anxious rather than sickly to me i was being less than honest when i said not well hester did not bother to hide her smile not like you claudine why dont you fetch another cup theres enough tea here for two claudine did as she was asked and returned a few moments later they sat opposite each other and hester spoke candidly this case of jericho phillips has divided us naturally margaret sides with her husband as i suppose she should claudine interrupted she was aware that it might be unseemly but she could not hold her peace i do not believe that god requires any woman to follow her husband to hell mrs monk she said decisively i promised to obey but im afraid that is a vow i could not keep if it should go against my conscience maybe i will be damned for it but i am not prepared to give my soul over into anyone elses keeping no i dont think i am either hester agreed thoughtfully but she is only recently married and i think she loves sir oliver very much also she may well believe that he is absolutely right i have not troubled her with the investigation i have been making or the horrors of the case that i have learned because it would place her in a position where she might have to stand against him claudine made no reply but waited for hester to explain hester told her the barest outline of phillipss business and what she had since learned of the extent of his power to blackmail claudine was disgusted but she was not greatly surprised she had seen behind the masks of respectability for many years usually it was far pettier than this but perhaps great sins start as simple weakness and the consistent placing of self before others i see she said quietly pouring more tea for both of them what can we do about it i refuse to accept that there is nothing hester smiled so do i but i confess that i dont yet know what it is my husband knows the name of at least one of the victims but cutting them off is not much use we need the head of it jericho phillips claudine put in he is central certainly hester agreed sipping her tea but i have been thinking about it a lot recently and i wonder if he is alone in his enterprise or if perhaps he is only part of it now claudine was surprised hester leaned forward why would one of phillipss victims pay to have him defended and able to continue with his blackmail because he also provides the pornography to which this wretched creature is addicted claudine replied without hesitation true hester agreed but when phillips was in custody who went to this man and told him to pay for phillipss defense phillips would hardly have sent for him or the mans secret would be out and he would have destroyed his power over him oh claudine was beginning to understand there is someone else with power who for his own reasons wishes phillips to be safe and to continue to profit one has to assume that if phillips were found guilty this mans loss would overall be greater than his gain hester winced very direct youve seized the point admirably i am not sure how much we can succeed until we know who that person is i am afraid that he may be someone we will not easily outwit he has managed to protect phillips very well up until now in spite of everything either durban or we could do claudine was chilled you surely dont think sir oliver was black mailed do you she felt guilty even for having the thought let alone asking she knew the heat burned her face but it was too late to retreat no hester said without resentment but i wonder if he wasnt manipulated into defending phillips without realizing what it really meant the trouble is i dont know what i can do now to reach phil lips were all soshe sighedso vulnerable claudines mind was racing perhaps she could do something in her time here in the clinic she had learned about sides of life she had not previously even imagined in nightmare she understood at least something of the people who came and went through these doors in clothes and manners they were different from the society women she knew and in background and hopes for the future in health ability and the things that made them laugh or lose their temper but in some ways they were also heartbreakingly the same those were the things that twisted inside her with a warmth of pity and all too often of helplessness she finished her tea and excused herself without saying anything more about it and went to see squeaky robinson a man with whom she had a most awkward relationship that she spoke to him at all was a circumstance that had been forced upon her at least to begin with now they had a kind of restless and extremely uneasy truce she knocked on his door heaven only knew what she might find him doing if she went in without that precaution when he answered she opened it walked through and closed it behind her good morning mr robinson she said a little stiffly when we have finished talking i will fetch you a cup of tea if you would like it first i need to speak with you he looked up warily he was wearing the same rumpled jacket as usual and a shirt that had probably never felt an iron and his hair was standing up at all angles from where he had obviously run his fingers through it in some degree of frenzy good he said immediately say what yer ave to im thirsty he did not put his pen down but kept it poised above the inkwell he wrote all his figures in ink apparently he did not make mistakes her temper flared at his dismissiveness but she kept it under control she wanted his cooperation a plan was beginning to take shape in her mind i would like to have your attention if you please mr robinson she said carefully all of it he looked alarmed wots appened i had thought you were as aware of it as i but perhaps you are not she sat down uninvited i shall explain it to you jericho phillips is a man who i know all about that he said tartly then you know what has happened she responded it is necessary that we conclude the matter so that we can all get back to our own business without the distraction of his behavior he is causing mrs monk some distress i would like to be of assistance a look of total exasperation filled his face raising his wispy eyebrows and pulling the corners of his mouth tight yer got no more chance o catching jericho phillips than yer ave o marryin the prince o wales he said with barely concealed impatience get back ter yer kitchen an do wot yer good at are you going to catch him she said frostily he looked uncomfortable he had expected her to be deeply affronted and lose her composure and she had not that gave him a surprising and inexplicable satisfaction it should have infuriated him well are you she snapped if i could i wouldnt be sittin ere he retorted fer gawds sake fetch the tea she sat without moving he takes and keeps small boys to be photographed performing obscene acts is that so he blushed annoyed with her for embarrassing him she should have been the one embarrassed yes yer shouldnt even be knowin about such things that was a definite accusation a lot of use thats going to be she told him witheringly i assume he does it for money there could be no other reason he sells these pictures yes o course e sells them he shouted at her where what dont pretend to be stupid mr robinson where does he sell them how much more plainly can i put it i dunno on is boat in the post ow do i know why not in shops as well she asked wouldnt he use every place he could if i had something i knew i could sell i would offer it everywhere why wouldnt he all right so e would wot about it that dont do us no good with difficulty she forebore from correcting his grammar she did not want to anger him any more than she had already is there not any law against such things if it involves children boys yes o course there is he looked at her wearily an oos goin ter force it eh yer me the cops nobody thats oo i am not quite certain that there is nobody she said softly you might be surprised what society can do and will if it feels itself in danger either financially or more important in comfort and selfrespect he stared at her surprise and the beginning of a new understanding dawning in his eyes she was not quite sure how much she wished to be understood perhaps she needed to change the subject rapidly if she could do so and still learn from him what she needed to know the wild idea that had begun in her mind was becoming stronger all the time there is a law against it she repeated urgently o course theres a law he snapped it dont make no difference cant yer understand that yes i can she wanted to crush him but could not afford to she needed his help or at the very least some co operation so it would have to be sold where the police would not see it o course it would he said in exasperation where where all over the place in back alleys in shops where it looks like decent books financial books ledgers tracts on ow ter mend sails or keep accounts or anything yer like i seen some as yerd take fer bibles till yer looked close tobacconists sell em or bookshops printers all sorts i see yes very difficult to trace thank you she stood up and turned to leave then hesitated down in the alleys by the riverside i suppose yeah or anywhere else but only where folks go as knows wot they want yer wont find em on the igh street or any place as the likes o yerd be going she gave him a slight smile good thank you mr robinson dont look so sour i shall not forget your tea claudine was not happy to return home but sooner or later it was inevitable it always was you are late her husband observed as soon as she entered the drawing room having gone into the house through the kitchen rather than be seen at the front in her clinic clothes now she was washed and changed into the sort of lateafternoon gown she customarily wore it was fashionable wellcut richly colored and a trifle restricting because of the tightly laced corset beneath it her hair was also becomingly dressed as that of a lady in her station should be im sorry she apologized there was no use explaining he was not interested in reasons if you were sorry you would not keep doing it he said tartly he was a large man broadbellied heavyjowled a highly successful property developer in spite of his years his hair was still thick and barely touched with gray she looked at his sneering expression and wondered how she could ever have found him physically attractive perhaps necessity was the mother of acceptance as well as of invention you spend far too much time at that place he went on this is the third time in as many weeks that i have had to mention this to you it will not do claudine i have a right to expect certain duties of you and you are not behaving appropriately at all as my wife you have social obligations of which you are not unaware richmond told me you were not at his wifes party last monday he said it as a challenge it was to raise money for charity in africa she replied i was working for a charity here he lost his temper oh dont be absurd you insulted a lady of considerable consequence in order to go fetching and carrying for a bunch of whores off the street have you lost absolutely all sense of who you are if you have then let me remind you who i am i am perfectly aware of who you are wallace she said as calmly as she could i have spent years she nearly said the best years of my life but they were not indeed they had been the worst i have spent years of my life performing all the duties your career and your station required and your station claudine he interrupted i think too often you forget that that was definitely an accusation his face was reddening and he moved a step closer to her she did not move back she would refuse to no matter how close he came that station which you take so lightly he went on provides the roof over your head the food in your mouth and the clothes on your back thank you wallace she said flatly she felt no gratitude whatever would it have been so bad to have worked for it herself and owned it without obligation no that was a fantasy one then had to please whoever employed you everyone was bound to somebody else he did not hear the sarcasm or chose not to but then he had very little sense of irony or appreciation of the absurd you will oblige me by writing a letter to mrs monk and telling her that you are no longer able to offer your assistance in her project tomorrow he took a deep satisfied breath i am sure that after her unfortunate appearance in criminal court she will not be in the least surprised she was a witness claudine protested and instantly knew from his face that it was a technical error of course she was a witness he said with disgust the kind of life she leads the people she associates with she is bound to see all sorts of crimes the only miracle is that she was for the prosecution not for the defense i have been extremely tolerant so far claudine but you have now exceeded the limit of what is acceptable you will do as i have instructed that is all i have to say on the matter claudine could not remember ever having been so angry or so desperate to fight back he was taking from her everything that had brought her the most joy in her life she realized that with a shock of amazement it was absurd but working in portpool lane gave her friendship purpose and a sense of belonging of being valued even a sense of mattering she could not allow him to simply remove it because he thought he could i am surprised she said controlling her voice as well as she could although she was aware that it trembled i do not wish to discuss it further claudine he said coldly he always addressed her by name when he was displeased i have no idea why you should be surprised except that i have allowed it so long it is totally unsuitable i am surprised that you find it so she was attacking now and it was almost too late to draw back she plunged in and i admit it frightens me his eyebrows rose high frightens you that is a foolish thing to say you are becoming hysterical i have simply said that you are no longer to associate yourself with a clinic for whores forgive me for using the word but it is the correct one that is immaterial she brushed it aside with a wave of her hand she was not a beautiful woman but her hands were lovely what alarms me is that i have allied myself with people who have publicly stood up against a man who traffics in children small boys to be precise for the use of men in their more revolting appetites since we are using correct words she mimicked his tone exactly i believe the term is sodomy this abuse of children is practiced by all sorts of men she continued of a bestial and debased nature but this man caters to those with money that is largely of our own social class she saw the blood rush to his face in a scarlet tide it frightens me she continued relentlessly her voice now quivering with real fear although not of what she was claiming that you do not wish very publicly indeed to show yourself to be in the battle against it she drew in her breath and let it out slowly trying to control the shaking of her body i do not suspect you of such an appetite wallace but i am more than slightly worried that you forbid me to continue in my support for mrs monk and all those who fought at her side what will people think it is bound to become even more public than it is now i am not sure that i can oblige you by retreating from the conflict he stared at her as if she had grown horns and a tail she found herself gulping for air she could never go back now as long as she lived she knew how caesar must have felt when he crossed the rubicon to declare war on rome are you sure that is what you wish me to do she said softly i dont know what has happened to you he said looking at her with loathing you are a disgrace to your sex and to all that your parents hoped of you you are certainly not the woman i married i understand how that pains you she replied she was well on the far bank of the rubicon now you are the man i married and that pains me which perhaps now you also understand there is little for us to do but make the best of it i shall do what i believe to be right which is to continue to help those in need and fight with every ability i have to bring men like jericho phillips to justice before the law i think you would find it in your best interests to pretend that you support me you would be hard put to justify any other course to your friends and i know you value their opinion whatever their private habits they could not be seen to think differently and before he could reply she left the room and told her maid that she would take supper in her boudoir in the morning she left for the clinic very early indeed before six it was light at this time of the year and when she arrived half an hour later she found ruby up and working in the kitchen she had already decided that it was ruby whose help she would ask mornin mrs burroughs ruby said with surprise summink appened yer look kind o upset bit feverish like a cup o tea good morning ruby claudine replied closing the back door behind her yes i would like a cup of tea i have not had breakfast yet and i imagine you havent either i brought some butter and a pot of marmalade she produced it and set it on the table and a loaf of fresh bread she added i wish for your advice in confidence ruby looked at the excellent dundee marmalade and the crusty bread and knew that it must be serious she was alarmed claudine saw it there is no need to be concerned she said going over to the stove and opening the door ready to make toast i wish to do something that i hope will help mrs monk it will be uncomfortable and possibly a little dangerous so i imagine she would stop me if she knew which is why i am speaking to you in confidence are you willing to help me ruby stared at her in wonder she was very aware that hester was in trouble everyone knew it course i am she said decisively wotdyer want i want to sell matches claudine replied i thought of bootlacesthat might also workexcept people do not need to buy them very often flowers would be no use at all nor would any kind of food she straightened up from the stove and began to slice the bread the aroma of it filled the room ruby pulled the kettle over onto the burner and reached for the tea caddy her mind whirling why dyer wanter sell matches she was utterly lost she knew it could not possibly be for money claudine was rich anyway as an excuse for standing in the street outside the sort of shop where they would sell the photographs that jericho phillips takes of little boys claudine replied we know the faces of some of his boys perhaps i can find these photographs or at least tell commander monk where they may be found then he will have another way in which to trap phillips or he may trap some of the men who buy them the further she went in trying to explain her idea the more desperate and foolish it sounded cor ruby let out her breath in a sigh of amazement and admiration her eyes were wide and shining then ed ave the proof e could make em split on phillips eh it wouldnt be like angin im but itd make im mad for certain an itd make is customers as mad as wasps in a fire an all ill elp yer an i wont tell no one i swear thank you claudine said with profound gratitude now shall we have breakfast i trust you like marmalade cor yeah i do ta ruby looked at the jar and she could almost taste it already yerll ave ter ave a blouse an skirt wots right an a shawl i can get yer one itll smell mind but it should yer cant go lookin like that or theyll con yer in a second an yerll ave ter keep yer mouth shut as much as yer can ill tell yer wot ter say or better pretend as yer deaf an cant ear nuffin an boots ill get yer some boots wot look like yerd already walked ter scotland an back in em thank you claudine said quietly she was beginning to wonder if she really had the courage to go through with this it was an insane idea she was totally incompetent to carry off such a thing it would be humiliating they would see through her disguise in an instant and wallace would have her committed as a lunatic he would have no trouble at all what other explanation could there be for such behavior ruby shook her head yer got some guts missus her eyes shone with awe i reckon even miss esterd be proud o yer course i wont tell er she added hastily i wont never give yer away that sealed the decision there was no escape now she could not possibly forfeit rubys faith in her and that burning admiration thank you claudine said again you are a loyal and excellent ally ruby beamed with pleasure but she was too thrilled to speak naturally claudine did not go until it was dusk when she had far greater chance of being unrecognized even so she walked with her head down shuffling a little in unfamiliar and extremely uncomfortable boots she must have looked dreadful her hair was greased with oil from the kitchen the smell of which she found distasteful like a stale pan her face was carefully smeared with grime similarly her hands and as much of her neck as showed she had an old shawl around her and was glad to hold it tight not for warmth because the evening was mild but to conceal as much of herself as she could she carried a light tray that would be hung around her neck on a string and a bag full of matchboxes to sell she also had about one and sixpence worth of change mostly in pennies and halfpennies ruby had told her that more would be suspicious she began on the dockside beyond wapping and walked slowly until she found a corner between a good tobacconist and a public house then stood there with the tray resting just below her bosom and felt as conspicuous as a squashed fly on a white wall and about as useful she also felt afraid as darkness settled she could see only the short stretches under the street lamps clearly or wedges of broken pavement where light spilled out a window or a suddenly opened door there was noise all around in the distance dogs were barking above the clatter of hooves from the traffic on the busy cross street seventy yards away closer to her people were shouting and above it was the occasional burst of laughter she was ridiculously grateful when someone bought matches and actually spoke to her just that they had seen her and acknowledged her as a human being broke the loneliness that had hardened around her like imprisoning glass she smiled and then with a shock of shame remembered that ruby had also blackened two of her teeth she said they were beautiful far too even and white for the sort of woman she was pretending to be what was even stranger and more disconcerting was that the man did not even notice he took her for exactly what she was pretending to be a street woman too old and too plain to be a whore but still needing to earn perhaps a shilling or two standing alone in the night on a street corner selling matches mild or freezing wet or dry she was relieved but oddly puzzled also was that really the only difference clothes and a little dirt the way she carried her head whether she dared meet his eyes or not she could stand here all night and those who were sorry for her might buy matches but she would learn nothing she needed to move closer to the shops that sold books and periodicals tobacco the sort of things a man would buy without arousing any interest or comment ruby had told her where they were and what they were like maybe she should be closer to jericho phillipss boat she wanted to catch his trade in particular maybe it was like most other trades people had their own areas one did not trespass certainly she was growing cold and stiff here and achieving nothing except a little practice she began to walk back towards the river and the stretch half a mile or so to the south of execution dock that was one of the places where phillips had been known to moor his boat another was further south again on the limehouse reach there was another where the curve of the isle of dogs bends back to the blackwall reach opposite the bugsby marshes too far for rich men to go for their pleasures and certainly a less profitable place to sell books and pictures was she being intelligent or merely too stupid to know just how stupid she was wallace would have said the latter if he were not too apoplectic with rage to say anything at all she could not bear for him to be right that would be almost as bad as letting ruby down she kept walking it was late and completely dark now how long did shops stay open buying pornographic photographs of little boys was surely not a daytime occupation at this time of the year maybe they stayed open all night perhaps people went to such places after the theater the most obvious of all would be after visiting jericho phillipss boat that was her best chance to go towards the river and the alleys leading off the waterfront but she paced up and down fruitlessly until after midnight then tired cold and dispirited she went back to the clinic and ruby let her in it was then that she made the wild boast that she was not beaten and would quite definitely return the following evening she went into one of the empty bedrooms kept for patients with contagious diseases and slept until she was woken in the morning by the sound of footsteps and one of the maids cursing under her breath the next evening claudine found herself standing on the corner of the same street again in gusting wind and a fine summer rain carrying a tray of matches covered with oilskin when a couple of welldressed men passed by apparently not even aware of her she turned as if to cross the street or possibly even to follow after them and beg them to buy a box of matches but instead she passed by them and took a quick furtive glance at the photograph one of the men was looking at she was too disappointed that it was an adult woman to be shocked at her total nakedness all she felt was chagrin that it was not one of phillipss boys to her guilt she was also relieved they were pictures she did not actually wish to see it was simply that she could hardly take any proof back to hester if she could not swear what it was then she realized that of course selling one kind of pornography does not exclude selling another kind she stopped abruptly as if she had forgotten something then turned and went back again to take up her place a few yards from where she had been before this time she was on the opposite side of the street where she could watch whoever went into the shop from either direction she allowed several very ordinaryappearing customers to go in and come out again but the next time a welldressed man went in she crossed over and went in after him she stood in the corner as if waiting in the shadows for her turn well out of the sound of his voice at a glance one might have thought she was being discreet when he had agreed on the cards he wished for and paid his money to the shopkeeper she moved forward pretended to be dizzy and swayed to one side as though by accident she knocked the cards out of his hand and they fluttered to the floor two lay facedown three were faceup they showed naked and frightened little boys in attitudes only grown men should adopt and that in the strictest privacy one of them had bloody weals on his flesh where any clothes at all would have concealed them claudine closed her eyes and sank to the floor not entirely having to pretend a feeling of nausea the shopkeeper came around the counter and tried to assist her to her feet while his customer scrabbled on the floor to pick up his treasures the next few moments passed in a daze she staggered to her feet now quite genuinely dizzy and at the shopkeepers insistence drank a small mouthful of brandy probably all he could afford to offer then she told him her husbands tobacco would have to wait she needed some air and without accepting any further assistance she thanked him and blundered outside onto the dark street and the beginning of more rain it was light only a drifting mist blowing off the river the mournful sound of foghorns echoing up from limehouse reach and the long stretch beyond she leaned against the wall of the tenement houses a sickness in her stomach the taste of bile in her mouth she shuddered with cold her back ached and her feet were blistered she was alone here in the dark and dripping street but this was victory three or four more men walked past two bought matches she was going to earn enough for a loaf of bread actually she had no idea what a loaf of bread cost a pint of beer was three pence she had heard someone say that four pints for a shilling nine shillings a week was a fair rent half a laborers weekly wage they were well dressed these customers of the tobacconist their suits must have cost two pounds or more that ones shirt looked like silk how much were the photographs sixpence a shilling another man had stopped in front of her she had not even noticed him approaching it must be midnight he was a big man solid holding cards facedown like the ones shed seen in the shop yes sir matches sir she said through dry lips ill have a couple of boxes he replied holding out two pennies she took them and he helped himself to two boxes off the tray he looked up at her and she glanced at his eyes to see if he was going to ask her for something more then she froze every shred of warmth vanished from her body she must be as white as a winter sky it was arthur ballinger she had no doubt of it she had met him at several social functions with wallace she remembered him because he was margaret rathbones father did he remember her was that why he was staring at her this was even worse than in the shop he would tell wallace he would be bound to there was no conceivable explanation she could give what reason could a lady of society have for dressing up like a pauper and selling matches on the street outside a shop that sold pornography of the most depraved kind no it was far worse than that ballinger would understand the reason he would know she was spying on him and others like him she must speak say something to shatter his suspicion and make him certain she was just what she looked like a peddler a woman of grinding poverty thank you sir she said hoarsely trying to imitate the voices of the women who came to the clinic gawd bless yer she added and choked on the gasped air and the dryness of her throat now so rasping it nearly strangled her ballinger backed away a step looked at her again then changed his mind and strode away two minutes later he was out of sight and she was alone in the street which was now so dark she could barely see the ends the lamps hung like straightedged towers girded by pale wreaths that moved dissolved and formed again as the wind from the water gusted between the dark housefronts a dog trotted by soundlessly its shape indistinct a cat ran low to the ground shinned up a wall seemingly without effort and dropped on the other side invisibly somewhere out of sight a man and a woman were shouting at each other then three men came around the corner abreast swaggering towards her as they passed under the lamp she saw their coarse faces two of them were looking at her with anticipation one of them ran his tongue over his lips she dropped the match tray and ran ignoring her illfitting boots on the uneven cobbles the enclosing darkness and the stench of garbage she did not even look which way she was going anything to get away from the pursuing men shouting after her laughing and yelling obscenities at the end of the street she turned left around the nearest corner that allowed her not to cross the open stretch where she would be seen this alley was darker but she knew they would still hear her boots on the stones she turned again and again always running her dread was that she would find one of the alleys blind and they would trap her against a wall with nowhere else to go a dog was barking furiously somewhere ahead there were lights a tavern door was open and a yellow lantern gleam spilled out onto the cobbles the smell of ale was strong she was tempted to go in it was bright and looked warm perhaps they would help her or perhaps not no if someone tore at her clothes they would see the clean linen under them she would be exposed for a fraud they would be furious they would feel mocked duped they might even kill her she had seen the wounds of too many street women who had incurred someones uncontrolled rage keep running trust no one her breath stabbed in her aching lungs but she dared not stop there was more shouting behind her she tried to run faster her feet were slipping on the cobbles twice she nearly fell only saving herself by swinging her arms wildly to keep her balance she had no idea how long she ran or where she was when finally she fell exhausted huddling in the doorway of some tenement house on a narrow street walls above her almost meeting at the roofs she could hear scuffling the scrape of animal claws and breathing but no human boots on the roads surface no voices shouting or laughing there was someone near her a woman like a pile of laundry all ragged and tied together with twine she crept near her glad of the warmth perhaps she could even sleep a little in the morning she would try to find out where she was for now she was invisible in the dark another bundle of rags just like all the rest hester arrived at the clinic in the morning to find squeaky robinson waiting for her she had barely sat down at her desk to look at the figures for medicines when he knocked and came straight in without waiting for her to answer he closed the door behind him he looked angry and worried he had a piece of stiff white notepaper in his hand he started to speak without even the barest civility of a greeting two days he said sharply nothing at all not a word and now eres her usband writing us letters demanding er ter come ome he waved the paper in proof who hester asked him she did not question his manners she could see that he was very obviously distressed er usband he snapped he looked at the papers wallace burroughs then she understood and was instantly as concerned as he you mean claudine hasnt been here for two days and she hasnt been home either he closed his eyes in exasperation thats wot i jus said shes gorn missing taken off the stupid he fumbled for a word violent enough to express his emotions and failed to find one he could use in front of her show me hester held her hand out for the note and he passed it to her it was brief to the point of curtness but perfectly explicit he said he had forbidden claudine to involve herself any more deeply in the affairs of the clinic and she had apparently defied him and had now been missing from her home and her duties for two whole days and nights he required immediately that whoever was in charge of the clinic should send claudine home and not in future address her or importune her for further assistance either with time or for financial offerings at another time hester would have been furious with his arrogance and his patronizing and domineering manner but she read in his tone not only injured pride but also genuine anxiety not just for his own wellbeing but for claudines this is serious squeaky she looked up at him if she isnt at home and she isnt here then it may be that she is in some trouble i know that he said sharply his voice unusually loud why dyer think i came ter yer shes gorn an done summink stupid what sort of thing what do you know squeaky i dunno nothin or id be tellin yer he said his exasperation had reached the point where he could not keep still he moved his weight from one foot to the other in agitation nobodys gonna listen ter me yerll ave ter ask bessie an ruby an anyone else or put the word out tell mr monk if yer ave ter we gotta find er or shell come ter some arm gawd knows shes daft enough hester drew breath to give a string of alternatives as to where claudine could be all of them safe but of course she knew that claudine would not have gone on any kind of social trip without telling them and at the moment her mind was worried and angry over jericho phillips just as they all were ill speak to ruby and bessie she stood up then if they have nothing ill start with the women we have in at the moment good he said firmly he hesitated over whether to thank her or not and decided not to she was doing it for herself not for him ill wait ere he finished she left him and went to find bessie who knew nothing at all except that she thought ruby was looking busy and selfimportant these last couple of days and now she was a bit preoccupied this morning thank you hester said fervently ruby was alone in the scullery looking over what vegetables they had left hester decided to preempt any denial by assuming guilt not a practice she normally approved but this was not normal claudine was lost and they must find her and ease any damage to any hurt feelings later good morning ruby she began please forget the carrots and listen to me mrs burroughs is missing and may be in trouble or even danger her husband does not know where she is she has not been home for two nights and she has not been here either if you know something you must tell me immediately she were ere night afore last ruby said intently dropping a bunch of carrots on to the bench no one saw her here are you sure you have the correct night hester asked her yes miss she came in tired and pretty rough dint want no one ter see er slept in the fever room went out early i saw er did you indeed where did she go ruby looked straight at her i cant tell you miss i gave er me word her eyes were shining and her face was a little flushed hester was assailed by a terrible thought it was adventure in rubys eyes claudine had gone to do something ruby held in supremely high regard something wonderful she found herself almost choking on her own breath ruby you have to tell me she may be in terrible danger jericho phillips tortures people and murders them she saw rubys face go white tell me she lifted her hands as if to take ruby by the shoulders and shake her and only just restrained herself in time i promised ruby said in a whisper i gave er me word you are released from it hester said urgently honorably released where did she go ter find out where they sell em pictures wot phillips takes she answered huskily what hester was appalled how where did she go to you cant just walk into a shop and ask if they sell pornography has she lost her wits ruby sighed impatiently course not she went dressed like a match seller all scuffed up an dirty like she dressed proper old boots an all i got er an old skirt and shawl from one o the women wot comes in ere an greased er air an blackened er face an er teeth yerd never ave known er from the real i promise yer hester let her breath out slowly her mind filled with horror oh god help us she said there was no point in blaming ruby thank you for telling me the truth count the rest of the carrots she goin ter be all right miss ester ruby asked nervously hester looked at her her face was twisted with fear her eyes dark yes of course hester said quickly well just have to go and find her thats all she turned again and left going rapidly back to her office her heels clicking on the wooden floor with a sharp hasty sound she was almost at the end of explaining to squeaky what she had learned when margaret rathbone came in it was obvious from her expression that she had overheard a good deal of the conversation good morning margaret hester said with surprise i didnt know you were there so i gathered margaret replied coolly she was wearing a flattering green muslin dress and looked as if she had come to do no more than deliver messages her clothing contrasted strongly with hesters blouse and bluegray skirt which was obviously made for working in margaret came further into the room nodding to squeaky but not speaking to him were you going to tell me that claudine is missing squeaky looked at her then turned back to hester eyes wide hester was caught off guard i hadnt thought about you at all she replied honestly i was wondering what best to do to find claudine have you some suggestion my suggestion would have been not to take claudine into your confidence about your obsession with jericho phillips she replied she admires you so much she would do anything to earn your friendship she is a society lady bred to be charming entertaining obedient and a good wife and hostess she has no idea about your world of poverty and crime except the bits she overhears from the street women who come here she didnt come to the trial she was too busy keeping the clinic working and she certainly wouldnt read about it in the newspapers decent women dont read such things and most street women cant read anyway she is naive about your world and if youd taken any proper responsibility you would know that hester could think of no defense for herself to argue whether the streets were her world was to evade the point claudine was naive and hester knew it or she would have had she bothered to take any thought she was just as guilty as margaret had accused her of being let us hope to hear that it does not end in tragedy margaret added there was a movement at the door and they all swiveled round to see rathbone come in presumably he had accompanied margaret perhaps they had come from some function together or were intending to leave for one he looked at each of them in turn his face grave his eyes rested on hester for a moment then he spoke to squeaky mr robinson would you be good enough to leave us for a few moments thank you the last was an acknowledgment as squeaky glanced at hester and at her nod went out of the room closing the door behind him hester waited for rathbone to endorse margarets accusation instead he turned to margaret your criticism is unhelpful margaret he said quietly and i think it is also unfair mrs burroughs took whatever action she did from her own belief and from her desire to help if it turns out to have been foolish that is tragic all we can usefully do now is set out to look for her in the hope that she may be rescued from whatever discomfort or distress she is in of course hester is determined to do whatever is possible within the law to stop jericho phillips it is her fault that he is free from the noose for having killed the boy figgis i understand her compulsion to put right that error we would all do better if we acknowledged our mistakes instead of making excuses for them and did everything within our power to put them right occasionally we need help in that which claudine burroughs realized the fact that her assistance may be of more harm than use is regrettable but it is not stupid nor is it evil the color drained from margarets face and she stared at him in astonishment his expression did not alter it takes courage he went on i think those who have never made any grand mistakes do not realize how much that costs it is to be admired not criticized margaret slowly turned from him towards hester her eyes filled with tears she swung around and walked out her head high her back stiff she did not speak to either of them rathbone did not go after her i know that because i have made a few myself he said with a slightly twisted smile his voice gentler than before phillips was one of them and i dont know how to put it right hester blinked confused her mind racing what he had said was true but she was astounded that he had expressed it aloud she looked at his face remembering all the battles they had fought together in the past before ever knowing margaret it had been more than friendship there had been understanding loyalty and a belief and a cause shared it was a bond too deep to break easily he had made a mistake over phillips the thing that mattered was that he had owned up to it forgiveness was instant and complete she smiled at him and saw the answering warmth in his face and a flare of intense gratitude bright and sweet we must find claudine she said aloud before we think of anything else squeaky should be the best person for that rathbone cleared his throat can i help she looked away not yet but if you can ill ask you hester i will i promise before he could say anything more and she was suddenly afraid of what that might be she brushed past him and went to look for squeaky twelve when squeaky robinson left hesters office he went straight to his own office intending to wait for her the discussion between her and rathbone sounded as if it might become personal and rather heated squeaky had not thought about it much before but it seemed to him now as if there was a bit more to that friendship than he had supposed he hoped hester was not going to get hurt by it she had already been hurt more than enough by her meddling in the jericho phillips affair women would be a lot better off and a lot less trouble if they had smaller hearts and bigger brains and that certainly went for claudine burroughs too stupid mare now he would have to go and look for her wherever she had gotten to and the sooner that was done the better dress up as a match seller hadnt the wits she was born with no wonder her husband was as cross as a wet hen not that squeaky knew anything about hens wet or dry it was just something hed heard someone say and it seemed to fit the kind of pointless and ineffectual temper he imagined of wallace burroughs it was up to squeaky to do something sensible he would do it right now before hester could come and tell him differently he wrote a short note to her and left it on the very top of the ledgers on his desk dear miss hester i know where mrs burroughs might be gone to look for her s robinson he went to his bedroom and changed into some far scruffier and more disrespectable clothes than the ones he had taken to wearing in his office recently and set out from the back door he picked up a cab in farringdon road and asked to be taken to execution dock that was as good a place to start as he could think of on the way he tried to let his mind follow what claudine would have thought according to what hester had from ruby claudine was going to look for shops that sold pornographic photographs of little boys he let out a howl of anguish at the idiocy of such a thing but fortunately the driver did not hear him or took no notice a man could die in here and no one would care he thought aggrievedly and yet if the driver had stopped and come to inquire if he was all right he would have been even angrier on arriving he alighted paid the cabby the fare and gave him a tuppence tip then started walking along the dockside to the nearest alley leading inland the alleys were narrow stifling in the heat as the sun rose towards midday he had not been here in some time and he had forgotten how disgusting they smelled he knew where the brothels were and the shops that sold pornography of all sorts he began asking casually at first he wanted to know if anyone had seen a match seller answering claudines description it was tedious many people were disinclined to reply with any degree of honesty he had been working at it for two or three hours before he was mimicked very disrespectfully by a couple of urchins and he realized with a shiver of horror how polite he had become it was appalling he had changed beyond all recognition from the man he used to be he sounded like some daft old stranger he lunged after one of the boys and caught him by the scruff of the neck he lifted him right off the ground feet dangling and held him in the air treat yer elders wi respect yer piece o vermin he hissed at the child or ill teach yer the ard way an yerll wish yer adnt been born now ill ask yer nice one more time because i don like twistin childrens eads off makes me tired most especial it does on a summer day where did the match woman go as was ere two days ago tell me no lies cause if yer do ill come lookin fer yer in the middle o the night when no onell see wot i do ter yer got it the boy squealed his eyes bulging with the savagery of the grip around his collar squeaky dropped him on the ground and he howled answer me or yerll be sorry squeaky whispered bending down till his face was close to the boys shes a friend o mine an i dont want nothin bad to appen to er got it the boy whispered out a reply squeaky thanked him and walked away leaving him to scramble to his feet and make for the nearest alley squeaky set out in the direction suggested feeling guilty and a little selfconscious what on earth was happening to him he used to behave like that all the time he had not actually hurt the child at all in the past he might well have cuffed him round the ear until his head had buzzed was this what working for hester monk had done for him made him soft he would not be able to go back to the streets even if he wanted to he was ruined that wasnt the worst of it he loped along the narrow footpath at alarming speed always deeper into the warren of alleys dead ends and tunnels bending back on themselves towards the river again but worse than actually becoming respectable was the secret knowledge he would admit to no one he rather liked it he asked more people peddlers shopkeepers pawnbrokers beggars some he threatened some he bribedwhich was really very painful indeed because it was his own money he traced her as far as the tobacconist and bookseller where she had apparently collapsed and knocked into a man buying postcards sending them all on to the floor what on earth was the stupid woman playing at but through his anger which was really fear he knew exactly what she was doing with a little more threat bribing and invention he heard about her sudden hysterical flight but no one knew where she had gone after two or three twists mad woman they said who could explain anything she did drunk most like he wanted to knock them over for that claudine would never be drunk might be happier if she were now and then it was getting dark and the clammy air of the day was cooling off where the devil in hell was the woman anything could have happened to her in these miserable alleys at the very least she would be frightened possibly worse than that another night was coming on he began to lose his temper with people more genuinely perhaps the old squeaky wasnt so completely lost just a little submerged under layers of newfound habits in politeness that thought did not make him as happy as he had expected it to it took him another hour of questions tracking down strangers and several false hopes and misidentifications before finally close to eleven oclock he found her sitting in a heap on the steps of a tenement off the shadwell high street what on earth was she doing here she looked utterly wretched had he not been looking for her specifically he would never have recognized her he stopped squarely in front of her blocking her chance to get up and run away he saw the fear in her face but she was too tired to move and she simply stared at him defeated not even knowing who he was the words of anger died on his lips he was horrified at himself at how relieved he was to see herif not well at least alive and uninjured he swallowed and drew in his breath well he said to her then he lost his temper wot the bleedin ell are yer doin ere yer daft cow he shouted scared the bleedin daylights out of us yer did ere he thrust out his hand to help her up well come on then wots the matter with yer broken yer bleedin legs he waved his hand almost jabbing it at her now he was afraid that she really was hurt in some way what on earth was he going to do if she was he couldnt carry her she was a substantial woman built the way women were supposed to be very cautiously she grasped his hand he heaved to pull her up overcome with relief when she stood he was about to shout at her again when he saw the tears in her eyes and the gratitude he sniffed and turned away to avoid embarrassing her well come on then he said gruffly we better be gettin ome if were lucky we might find some sort of a cab in the igh street can yer walk in them great ugly boots of course i can she said stiffly and promptly stumbled he had to catch hold of her and support her weight to stop her from falling he made no remark about it and tried hard to think of some other subject to talk about why dint yer go ome then he demanded because i was lost she replied not looking at him they walked in silence for another fifty yards find any pictures he asked he was not sure if that was a good thing to say or not but perhaps it was worse to take her failure for granted yes i did she said immediately she named the shop and the exact address i have no idea which boys they were she shuddered violently but it was the sort of thing that phillips does i imagine i would prefer not to know any more about it really squeaky was surprised he had not expected her to succeed at all that must have been when she knocked the cards out of the mans hand so you dint really faint then she stopped abruptly how do you know about that well ow dyer think i found yer he demanded i been askin dyer think i just appened ter be wanderin along ere fer summink ter do then she started to walk again hobbling a bit because her feet were so sore she said nothing for quite a long time eventually all the words she could find were thank you i am grateful to you he shrugged its nothin he replied he did not mean that it was of no importance to him he meant that she did not owe him any debt he wondered if she understood that but it was far too awkward to explain and he did not know where it might lead mr robinson she said about a hundred yards later they were in the shadwell high street but there were no cabs in sight only the usual traffic of carts and drays he looked at her to indicate his attention i saw some customers go in and out of that shop she said a little hesitantly i recognized one of them she went on that was why i ran away oh yeah oo was it he was not sure if it would matter and who could possibly recognize her looking like this mr arthur ballinger she replied he stopped abruptly catching her arm and swinging her to a halt as well wot ballinger as lady rathbone were he said incredulously yes her eyes did not waver he is her father buyin pictures o little boys his disbelief sent his voice up almost an octave dont look at me like that mr robinson she said sharply her voice catching in her throat i am acquainted with mr ballinger i ran because he looked at me very closely indeed and i was afraid that he had also recognized me where dyer know im from he asked still dubious she shut her eyes as if her patience were exhausted her voice was flat and tight when she answered it is part of my duty and i suppose my privilege as mr burroughss wife to attend a great many social functions i met him at several of those along with mrs ballinger of course much of this time the ladies are separate from the gentlemen but at dinner we will all sit where we are directed according to rank and i have had occasion to sit opposite mr ballinger and listen to him speak it was an unknown world to him listen ter im speak he asked it is not appropriate for ladies to speak too much at table she explained they should listen respond appropriately and ask after interests welfare and so on if a gentleman wishes to talk and usually they do you listen as if fascinated and never ask questions to which you suspect he does not know the answer he will almost certainly not listen to you but he will certainly look at you closely if you are young and pretty he caught a sadness in her voice possibly even a shadow of real pain and felt an upsurge of anger that startled him ask opinions or advice she continued lost in memory that is flattering but it is unbecoming to offer either one is not supposed to have them but i am quite sure it was ballinger i have listened to him on several occasions one has to listen or one cannot ask appropriate questions sometimes it is even moderately interesting she stopped suddenly for a moment he was not sure if it was because she was still remembering something of the past that alarmed her or if it was simply that her feet pained her too much to continue then he realized that they had reached an intersection of two fairly busy streets and she was hoping at last to find a cab when he had hailed one and they were at last sitting side by side necessarily rather close together she spoke again if mr ballinger is involved in this business she said looking towards him in the dark her voice anxious it is going to be very distressing that was an understatement he thought it would be monumental lady rathbones father it may even reflect upon sir oliver she added since he was the one to defend phillips there will be many people who will not accept that he had no idea of the connection he may be accused of participating in the profit being tainted by it mrs monk will be very unhappy he said nothing he was thinking of just how awful it would be the few moments of conflict in hesters office would be a summers day compared with what might be to come so i would be very grateful mr robinson if you would say nothing about my seeing mr ballinger at least not yet please it would be the honorable thing to do the right thing no he agreed without hesitation no i wont tell er yer say when yer ready thank you they rode in silence for quite a while he was not sure but he thought she might even have gone to sleep poor creature she must be so tired she would have slept on her feet now that she knew she was safe guaranteed she was hungry too and would like a clean hot cup of tea more than anything in the world except maybe a bath funny how women liked a bath when they arrived at portpool lane it was after midnight but hester was still there she had fallen asleep in one of the chairs in the big entrance hall where they first saw people as they arrived she was curled up with her feet half underneath her her boots on the floor she woke as soon as she heard their footsteps jerking her head up blinking she recognized squeaky before she realized that it was claudine with him she scrambled to her feet and ran across to throw her arms around claudine then with flushed face and eyes shining with relief she thanked squeaky profoundly thats all right he said a bit selfconsciously werent nothin she were lost thats all he made a casual gesture as if to dismiss it hester decided to allow it to pass just at the moment she was dizzy with relief that claudine was safe she realized only now how deeply afraid she had been that some harm had come to her if she had gone around asking about phillips he was quite capable of killing her and they would probably never even know she would appear to be just one more beggar woman dead of cold or hunger or some unspecified disease even a knife attack or a strangling would not occasion a great deal of remark she thanked squeaky again told ruby that claudine was safe and decided to allow wallace burroughs the privilege of having a good nights sleep or not she would send him a letter in the morning unless claudine wished to go home and tell him herself if she did not then that was up to her another message she would definitely send would be to rathbone to tell him that claudine was safe it would be polite to address it to margaret as well over breakfast in the large kitchen she asked squeaky what claudine had discovered if anything but he told her he had no idea he looked slightly surprised when he said it and it was several moments before she realized that it was not claudines lack of discovery that startled him but his own reply to hester that must be because it was a lie to defend claudine she looked at him more closely and he returned her look with a straight slightly belligerent gaze she found herself smiling squeaky was definitely defending claudine when she had eaten her toast and drunk her own tea she made more set it on a tray and took it up to the bedroom claudine was using she found her just beginning to wake up ravenously hungry and longing for a cup of tea hester sat on the bed while claudine ate and drank she addressed the subject what did you discover she asked claudine stared at her over the top of her cup i asked squeaky but he wont tell me hester explained he said he doesnt know but hes lying so that makes me think its important claudine finished her tea slowly giving herself time to think finally she put the cup down on the bedside table and took a deep breath i found a shop selling pornographic photographs of young boys i saw a couple they were terrible i dont want to talk about them i wish i didnt have them in my mind i didnt realize how hard it is to get something out of your memory once youve seen it its like a stain no amount of soap or water can remove it dulls with time hester said gently as you get more and more things in there theres less room for the horrors push it out every time it comes back and eventually the details will fade have you seen them not those but ive seen other things on the battlefield and heard them sometimes when we have someone in here with a knife wound the smell of blood brings it all back claudines face was gentle full of pity why wouldnt squeaky tell me that hester asked her that doesnt make sense that wasnt what he wouldnt tell you claudine replied it was who i saw on the pavement just outside the shop with cards in his hand he bought some matches from me and stared at me very closely i was scared hed recognized me hester frowned her imagination struggling who did you see claudine bit her lip mr ballinger lady rathbones father hester was stunned it seemed preposterous and yet if it was true it explained rathbones predicament exactly are you certain she said aloud yes ive met him several times at dinners and balls my husband is acquainted with him he stood no more than two feet from me hester nodded it was hideous how on earth could margaret bear that if she believed it if it became known had rathbone had any idea how would he see it disgust pity loyalty protection for margaret and her mother she could not believe that he knew already and yet he would have to one day perhaps he could in some way prepare your husband was worried about you she said to claudine would you like me to send a letter i could say you were kept in some kind of emergency but we had better offer the same explanation a shadow crossed claudines face i dont think he is going to forgive me whatever it is she replied i am not quite sure what i am going to do i shall have to give it a great deal of thought if if he puts me out may i live here she looked frightened and embarrassed of course hester said instantly if you wish to for whatever reason she nearly added that rathbone would give her legal help then she thought that was a little premature surely wallace burroughs would calm himself and behave a little more reasonably although his behaving reasonably was a very long way indeed from giving claudine any kind of happiness i shall write to him that you were helping someone in an accident there was a note of gentleness in her voice he will never know differently she went on you had better say the same you know enough details to give them to him if he should ask you he wont he is never interested in such things claudine told her but thank you hester very briefly told squeaky that she was going to the wapping police station to find monk then she left immediately dreading the chance of running into margaret on the way out she caught a cab on farringdon road and half an hour later was in wapping she had a further hour to wait before monk returned from the water but she was prepared to wait far longer had it been necessary he closed the door of his office and stood waiting for her to speak briefly leaving out everything that was irrelevant to the issue she told him of claudines adventure and that she was certain beyond any doubt that it had been arthur ballinger she had seen she must be wrong he said she was tired frightened upset after seeing the cards no she wasnt william hester said levelly she knows ballinger how would she know him hes not her solicitor surely no they move in the same circles in society she explained claudine may scrub kitchens and cook for the sick in portpool lane but in her own home shes a lady she probably knows most people in society more or less now she is terrified because he looked so closely at her she was afraid he had recognized her too he did not fight any longer the grief in his eyes showed his acceptance we have to be prepared she continued more gently i dont imagine oliver knows but perhaps he does it may even be the reason he took phillipss case in the first place but ill wager margaret doesnt or her mother she winced i cant imagine what that will be like for them if they are forced to know monk breathed out slowly god what a mess there was a sharp rap on the door and before monk could answer it opened and orme stood there ashenfaced eyes hollow hester saw him before monk did what is it she demanded fear gripping her like a tightening noose monk swung around to orme orme handed him a sheet of paper folded over once monk took it and read his hand shaking the color draining from his cheeks what is it hester demanded more urgently her voice highpitched her heart pounding jericho phillips has scuff monk replied he says that if we dont stop pursuing him all of us the river police then he will use scuff in his trade and when hes finished with him hell either sell him on to someone or if hes a nuisance and causes trouble then hell kill him then we will stop hester nearly choked on the words but she could not even imagine letting scuff endure that the possibility did not exist to consider thats not all monk went on his voice shaking now i must publicly condemn durban and say everything bad about him that i can including his early involvement with the men who robbed the bank then i must retract all the charges ive made against phillips and say that they were motivated by my desire to vindicate durban s name and pay my debt to him his price is scuffs life if i dont his death will be slow and very unpleasant she stared at him for interminable seconds unable to grasp what he had said then slowly it became clear indelible impossible to bear we must do it she felt as if she were a betrayer even as the words were on her lips and yet any other answer was unthinkable what happiness or honor could there ever be again if they let phillips keep scuff and one day torture him to death the power of terror and extortion was sickeningly clear and without escape she saw something else in monks face intelligence understanding and deeper horror what is it she demanded leaning forward as if to grasp him and at the last moment stopping what do you know i was thinking that i should go to rathbone and tell him about ballinger he replied almost in a whisper he needs to know for his own sake hideous as it will be for him and he might be able to help i dont know how poor oliver she said quietly but i would tell everybody any truth if i had to to get scuff back claudine thought ballinger might have recognized her monk said quietly his voice rasping it seems he did and told phillips thats why phillips has taken scuff now they know the net is tightening his face was very pale eyes hollow we have to get scuff back or get some hostage of our own that will force phillips to let him go ill go to rathbone im coming too she said instantly no i wont shut you out i promise im coming if you go after scuff and anyone is hurt i can do more for them than any of the rest of you for the first time her glance took in orme pleading you know that monk turned back and faced her yes i do know it i also know that you would not forgive me if anything went wrong and you might have prevented it and i couldnt live with that i give you my word that i will not go without you or orme if youll come he added looking at the other man ill come orme said simply ill get a boat ready and some pistols monk nodded his thanks and touched hesters hand in passing it was just a momentary warmth skin to skin and then it was gone monk went straight to rathbones office and asked to see oliver his clerk dobie was apologetic im sorry mr monk but sir oliver is with a client at the moment i expect him to be free in half an hour if it is urgent he said courteously it is extremely urgent monk replied unless his client is coming up for trial tomorrow it cannot wait jericho phillips has kidnapped another child please interrupt sir oliver and tell him so tell him it is scuff oh dear dobie said with extreme distaste did you say scuff sir yes very well sir would you please wait here he did not bother to ask monk to be seated he could see very well that he was too distressed to sit down monk paced back and forth the seconds seemed drawn out even the minutest sound ringing in his ears finally dobie returned solemnfaced sir oliver will see you immediately he said i shall ask all other clients to wait until you inform me otherwise thank you monk strode past him and opened rathbones office door rathbone turned face pale eyes wide are you sure he did not elaborate there was no need yes monk replied closing the door behind him he sent a message to say that if i didnt stop pursuing him and blacken durban s name in public hed use scuff in his trade and then kill him it was difficult to even say the words as if they gave it a more intense reality im going to get him back and i need your help rathbone started to say that it was not a legal matter then realized that of course monk knew that he had not yet come to the worst monk told him quickly sparing nothing claudine burroughs dressed as a match woman and went to try to find where they were selling phillipss photographs she succeeded in finding at least one shop the photographs were appalling but what matters is that she recognized one of the purchasers because she knew him socially she is afraid that he also recognized her and that is why phillips has attacked rathbone frowned i dont follow your logic why would phillips do that he wont care about individual customers even if mrs burroughs was right monk hesitated for the first time he loathed doing this it was arthur ballinger he said quietly i think he warned phillips that we are closing in on him and this is phillipss retaliation im sorry rathbone stared at him the blood draining from his face he looked as if he had been struck such a blow as to rob him momentarily of thought or the power to respond monk wanted to apologize again but he knew it was futile it is the only thing that has changed he said aloud before that phillips was winning and he knew it he had no need to do anything but wait us out now we have seen ballinger and that must matter to him rathbone moved to the chair and sat down slowly ill do what i can his voice was hoarse ill do what i can to help you rescue scuff he said his voice strained he stood up and swayed very slightly sullivan is the weak link he will know where phillipss boat is and i can force him to take us hell know the times and places because he goes there i dont think we have time to waste he moved to the door monk followed him he wanted to ask about ballingers involvement but the wound was too raw and too deep to probe yet he could barely imagine how it must hurt rathbone not for ballinger but for margaret he thought of hester whose father had taken his own life after a financial scandal that had ruined him he had believed it to be the only decent way out and he had had no fault but faith in a man who was beneath honor of any kind they took a cab and rode in silence to sullivans chambers the hot air was sharp with the smells of horse dung the leather inside the cab and stale sweat monks imagination was crowded with fear for scuff how had he managed to get caught how terrified he must have been when he recognized phillips knowing what lay ahead of him was he already burned bleeding where would phillips begin slowly delicately or straight into the maximum pain the sweat broke out and ran cold on his own skin as he tried to force the images out of his mind they reached sullivans chambers still without speaking again it was understood that rathbone would address the subject for both of them as expected they were told to wait and possibly lord justice sullivan would see them rathbone replied that it was a police emergency concerning a matter of the utmost personal importance to sullivan and that the man would rue the day he did so if he attempted to block their way within half an hour they stood in sullivans rooms facing a man who was both angry and frightened his big body was clenched and shivering sweat shining on his skin in the heat as the sun shone in through the long windows what is it you want he ignored monk and looked only at rathbone as if expecting the details from him he was not disappointed rathbone came immediately to the point we wish you to take us to jericho phillipss boat tonight secretly if you do not innocent people will die so there is no bargain to be made no equivocation or denial possible i have no idea where his boat is sullivan protested even before rathbone had finished speaking if the police wish to board it that is up to them i am sure they have informants whom they can ask there are all sorts of people we could speak to rathbone replied icily with all sorts of information to give or to trade i am sure you already understand that in all its shades of meaning we must do it tonight and without phillips receiving any warning so he could move the child he has kidnapped i cant sullivan protested his hands whiteknuckled the sweat running down his face for a man who thrives on the thrill of danger you seem to singularly lack courage rathbone said with disgust you told me you loved the danger of risking being caught well you are about to have the greatest excitement of your life monk stepped forward not out of pity for sullivanwho appeared to be about to chokebut because he was afraid they would lose his usefulness if he had a stroke you can leave once we are there he said raspingly if we find the boy alive if not believe me i will expose you to the whole of london more important to the judiciary who presently admire you so much you may well have friends there but they will not be able to help you and unless they are suicidal they will not try to ballinger will not get sir oliver to help you and i will not make the mistakes i made with phillips monk rathbone said urgently his voice sharp like a lash monk swung around and stared at him ready to accuse him of cowardice or even complicity he is no use to us a gibbering wreck rathbone said gently dont frighten him witless he looked at sullivan nevertheless what monk says is true are you with us you wanted dangerthis should be full of it weigh the risks phillips might get you and he might not we certainly will no shadow of a doubt i personally will ruin you i swear it sullivan was almost beyond speech he nodded and mumbled something but the words were unintelligible monk wondered if the excitement for which he had risked so much had only ever been an idea to him and being caught exposed and torn apart never a reality there must be a streak of sadism in him as well there had never been chance or excitement or a hope of escape for the boys disgust welling up inside him cold and sour he turned away rathbone will tell you what to do he said perhaps hed better bring you of course ill bring him rathbone retorted with a sting in his voice do you think im not coming monk was startled he swung back eyes wide warmth inside him again rathbone saw it he smiled very slightly but his eyes were bright and clear youll need all the help you can get he pointed out and possibly a witness whose word may stand up in court his mouth twisted with irony i hope apart from that do you think i could miss it good monk responded then we will meet at the wapping stairs at dusk hester will join us rathbone was stunned for a moment then denial swept in you cant possibly let her come he protested apart from the danger itll be something no woman should see havent you listened to your own evidence man were not going to find just poverty or even fear or pain itll be he stumbled to a halt i gave her my word monk told him its scuff he found it hard to say and apart from that she is the only one with any real medical ability if someone is hurt but it will be men at their most rathbone started again raw monk suggested naked no woman should rathbone tried again do you think youll manage monk said with an edge of pain in his voice that surprised him rathbones eyes widened have you ever seen a battlefield monk asked him i have once ive never known such horror in my life but hester knew what to do forget your preconceptions rathbone this will be reality rathbone closed his eyes and nodded speechless monk waited on the dockside just beyond wapping stairs at dusk hester beside him she was dressed in trousers that orme had borrowed from the locker of a young river policeman it would be dangerously impractical for her to go on an expedition like this either hampered by a skirt or recognizably vulnerable as a woman darkness was shrouding the water and the farther side was visible only by the lights along the bank warehouses and cranes stood up hard and black against the southern sky and after the warmth of the day a few threads of mist dragged faint veils across the water catching the last of the light there was a bump of wood against stone as orme drew up with one of the police boats the second boat loomed out of the shadows with sutton already in it snoot crouched beside him on the rear seat footsteps sounded along the quay rathbone crossed the shaft of light from the police station lamp sullivan reluctantly behind him his shoulders high and tight his eyes sunken like holes in his skull no one spoke more than a word a gesture of recognition sutton nodded at rathbone possibly remembering many of their narrow escapes rathbone nodded back a bleak smile brief in his face before turning to the business of climbing down the wet slimy steps into the two boats they had four river police to row and as soon as they were seated they slid out into the still water which was slack at the turn of the tide they moved out noiselessly except for the bump of metal against wood as the oars rattled in their locks no one spoke everything had already been said all the plans argued over and decided sullivan knew the price of refusal and worse of betrayal even so hester sat beside monk in the stern of the second boat and watched the judge with coldness creeping up inside her cramping her stomach and tightening her chest until she found it hard to breathe there was a desperation in him that she could smell in the air sharp and sour above the detritus drifting on the oily water he was cornered and she was waiting for him to attack something long ago had separated him from the compassion he should have had and left him erratic and ultimately unreachable at another time she could have pitied him as a man incomplete now all she could think of was scuff alone and terrified intelligent enough to know exactly what phillips would do to him he would know that monk would try everything he knew or could invent to rescue him he also knew that they had all failed before phillips had beaten them and mocked them and escaped to continue unhampered he had won every time all the love in the world did not blind scuff to the reality that they could fail again he was a child with hope optimism and a lifetimes knowledge of failure behind him the difference between surviving and not was waferthin she did not even think what scuffs death would do to monk she could feel his weight beside her he was too muffled by his clothes to warm her but the feeling was there in her memory and imagination the darkness inside was colder and denser than anything on the water around her they could not afford mistakes of judgment hesitation even mercy they made good speed in the strange stillness of the turn of the tide in only a few minutes the tide would begin to run again gathering speed upriver rising slapping against the steps lifting the ships at anchor pulling everything upstream carrying in the hungry sea bringing back the rubbish and the flotsam of life and death and trade they were almost at sufferance wharf on the south bank the low line of a moored boat was just discernible perhaps twenty yards from the stone embankment it was riding at anchor only its lanterns visible at bow and stern all was silent except for a footfall now and then on the deck a faint scuffle as someone briefly opened a hatch and the inside light and noise escaped voices a stifled laugh and then gone again it was in one of those movements that hester saw the motionless figures of watchmen on deck prepared to repel boarders they might have guns but it was far more likely to be knives or sharpened grappling hooks a quick stab a lunge and there would be another corpse carried up with the returning tide she knew monk and orme were armed she could not imagine that rathbone was since he usually forswore using weapons but then she had discovered that she did not know him nearly as well as she had supposed they were almost to the boat monk stood up and hailed them she saw with slight surprise how easily he balanced now in spite of the slight rocking as he moved his weight he had learned quickly the watchman answered he demanded to know who monk was but his voice was quiet controlled he was only twenty feet away got a gentleman to see you monk said gave him a lift the boat rocked a little the seconds ticked by hesters breath choked in her throat what could they do if sullivans courage failed him and he would not board what if his terror of jericho phillips was greater than his terror of monk or even of societys ruin of him get up rathbone whispered to him harshly or i will let monk give you to the brothel owners youve put away in the past that death will be very slow and very intimate i promise you hester gasped she saw monk stiffen sullivan staggered to his feet and swayed as his clumsiness rocked the boat and nearly plunged him over the side monk caught hold of him just in time sullivan spoke his name and repeated the password that identified him the watchman relaxed he turned and spoke to his companion who had come to reinforce him just in case monk should try to board as well he offered his hand to sullivan the boat pulled close enough for sullivan to scramble up and heave himself on to the deck just as hester saw the shadow move behind him a moment later first one watchman fell and then the other orme sutton and more river police crowded over the deck sullivan stood frozen monk rathbone and sutton clambered over the gunwale hester picked snoot up and passed him into suttons hands then gripped monks outstretched arm the next moment she was on the deck herself leaving only one man to keep the boat silently they moved over to the hatch she saw the faint gleam of light on the barrel of a gun in ormes hand and realized from the way monk held his right arm that he had one also this could end in blood and death orme bent and opened the hatch light flooded up and the noise of jerky nervous laughter with a slight edge of hysteria sharp and veering out of control prickly with excitement there was an odor of whisky cigar smoke and sweat hester gulped fear shot through her like pain not for herself but for monk as he went inside and down he was followed immediately by orme then sullivan rathbone and two of the police two more remained on deck to impersonate the unconscious men who were now bound and gagged hester followed through the hatch and into a surprisingly clean and comfortable cabin it was small only a couple of yards across clearly an anteroom to the main saloon and whatever rooms were beyond that for more private entertainment she was familiar with the geographic layout of brothels although few were as extensive as the property at portpool lane the salon was filled with half a dozen guests welldressed men of varying ages at a glance they had little in common but a fever in the eyes and a sheen of sweat on the skin jericho phillips stood at the far end next to a small rise in the floor like a stage on which were two boys both naked one was about six or seven years old bending over on his hands and knees like an animal the other was older just entering puberty the act they were performing was obvious as was the coercion of a lit cigar smoldering in phillipss hand and unhealed burn marks on the older boys back and thighs come ter join us at last ave yer mr monk phillips asked with a curl of his lip that showed his teeth knew yer would one day must say though i thought itd take yer longer his eyes flickered to sullivan and then to rathbone and he wet his lips with his tongue his voice was brittle and half an octave too high fear was acrid in the air like stale sweat some men shifted from one foot to the other tense on the edge of some kind of violence they were robbed of the release for which they had come uncertain what was happening or who the enemy was like animals on the edge of a stampede hester was rigid heart pounding did monk know how close they were to mindless violence this was nothing like the army in the moments before battle tight with discipline ready to charge into what could be death or worsehideous mutilation this was guilty and tainted men afraid of exposure and its shame this was animals unexpectedly and at the last moment robbed of their prey the feeding of their primal hungers she glanced at the other police at phillipss guards in the room then caught rathbones eye she saw the desperate revulsion in him and something more a deep and tearing pain beside him sullivan was shaking his eyes darting one way then the other his hands clenched then unclenched as if his fingers sought something to grip it was sutton who sensed the danger get on with it he hissed at monk i dont want to join you exactly monk answered phillips id like some of your guests to join us just to clear the way a bit phillips shook his head slowly the smile still fixed on his lips his eyes dead as stone i dont think any of em would care to go with yer an as yer can see theyre gentlemen as yer cant push around like they was nobdy he was motionless not moving his hands or his gaze from monks face but several of the men seemed to be waiting for some signal from him did his men have knives easier to use in this enclosed space less likely to injure your own yer already made a fool o yerself once phillips continued yer cant do that again an ope ter keep yer job mr monk not as i minds if yer dont yere too stupid ter be a real bother ter me but i wouldnt care if yer went ooever comes after yer wont be no better neither just like durban wasnt his voice was softer and still he did not move his hands the riverll go on an men wi ungers they cant feed wiout me or someone like me were like the tide mr monk only a fool stands in our way get yerself drownded he relished the word on his tongue the tension was slipping out of him now the years of selfdiscipline were winning he was in control again the moment of fear had passed monk had to balance phillipss likely impulses either to panic and bolt for freedom or to marshal his returning confidence and attack the police neither would help find scuff the one advantage he had was that phillips did not want violence either it would be bad for business his clients wanted imaginary danger not the reality they sought sexual release bloodshed but not their own he made his decision jericho phillips i am arresting you for the murder of the boy known as scuff he held the gun so that it was clearly visible now pointed at phillipss chest and mr orme is going to arrest sir john wilberforce there he named the only other guest whose face he recognized wilberforce burst into protest his cheeks scarlet streaming with sweat orme his back to the bulkhead raised his gun the light gleamed on the barrel and wilberforce abruptly fell silent it was phillips who spoke shaking his head slowly from side to side makin a fool o yerself again mr monk i dunno where your boy is an i dint kill no one we been through all o that as is lordship sullivanll ere tell yer an sir oliver an all yer jus dont learn do yer he turned to wilberforce the sneer broadening on his face his contempt naked no need to get inter a sweat sir e cant do nothin to yer think o oo you are an oo e is an get an old o yerself yer got all the cards if yer play em right there was a snigger of laughter from one of the other men they began to relax they were the hunters again no longer the victims orme had taken off his jacket and given it to the older boy to cover his nakedness and his humiliation sutton did the same for the younger one the movement caught hesters eye and suddenly she realized that they were all frozen here arguing and any torture could be happening to scuff there was no purpose in pleading with phillips to tell them where he was she slipped between two of the customers and touched orme we have to look for scuff she whispered there may be other guards so keep your gun ready right maam he yielded immediately he nodded to sutton who was almost beside him snoot now on the floor at his heels the three of them inched towards the doorway as the quarrel between monk and phillips grew uglier monks men were posturing themselves to take over with violence moving to get the physical advantage disarm those most likely to have weapons or to be able to seize one of the children to use as a hostage wilberforce was drawn in sullivan swayed from one side to the other his face dark congested with a desperate hatred like a trapped creature between its tormentors monk would strike soon and then the fighting would be swift and hard hester was afraid for him and for rathbone as well she had seen a horror in his eyes far beyond the cruelty or coarseness of the scene he was struggling with some decision of his own that she did not yet recognize she imagined that it could be a kind of guilt now at last he was seeing the reality of what he had defended not the theory the high words of the law perhaps some time she would even apologize to him for the harsher things she had said this was not his world he might really not have understood now all that mattered was to find scuff she dared not let her mind even touch on the chance that he was not here but held captive locked in some room on shore or even dead already that would be almost like being dead herself she followed sutton through the doorway and found herself instantly in a passage so narrow the slightest loss of balance bumped her shoulders into the wooden walls sutton had already turned left towards the bow of the boat snoot was almost under his feet but as always not making the slightest sound except for the faint scrape of his claws on the damp wood of the floor the smell of bilges and the mustiness of wet rot were stronger as they went forward sutton turned abruptly left again and scrambled down a steep flight of steps he reached for the dog but snoot slithered down fell the last short way and was on his feet again in an instant here the ceiling was low and hester had to bend to avoid cracking her skull on the crossbeams sutton halfcrouched as well the smell was stronger here and the dogs hackles were raised his small body shivering and bristling in awareness of something deeply wrong hester could feel her breath tight in her chest and the sweat running down her back inside her clothes there was a row of doors sutton tried the first one it was locked he lifted his leg and kicked it hard with the flat of his foot it cracked but did not give snoot was growling high and softly in the back of his throat his sensitive nose picked up the odor of fear sutton kicked again and this time it gave way it crashed open to reveal a small room little more than a cupboard in which cowered three small boys dressed in rags their eyes wide with terror they were comparatively clean but the arms and legs poking out of their clothes were thin and as pale as splintered matchwood hester almost choked with hope and then despair well come back for you sutton told them hester was not sure whether that was a promise or a threat to them perhaps their choice lay between phillips and starvation but she must find scuff everything else would have to wait sutton forced open another door to a room with more boys he found a third and then a fourth that was right at the very stern empty scuff was nowhere hester could feel her throat tighten and the tears sting her eyes she was furious with herself there was no time for this he had to be somewhere she must think what would phillips do he was clever and cunning and he knew monk as it was his business to know his enemies he found stole or created the right weapon against each of them snoot was quivering he darted forward and started to run round in tight little circles nose to the floor cmon boy sutton said gently dont matter about rats now leave em alone snoot ignored him scratching at the floor near the joints in the boards dont matter about rats sutton repeated his voice tight with grief snoot started to dig scraping his claws along the joints snoot sutton reached for the dogs collar there was a faint scratching sound beneath snoot barked sutton grasped his collar but the dog was excited and he squirmed out of suttons grasp yelping sutton bent forward and hester was right behind him looking more closely at the floor she saw that the lines of the boards were not quite even its a trapdoor she said hardly daring to believe it to the bilges mind your hands therell be rats always is sutton warned her his voice breaking with tension he reached for the knife at his belt flicked open the blade and used it as a handle to ease the trap open and pull it up below them scuffs ashen face looked up eyes wide with terror skin bruised and smeared with blood and filth hester forgot all the decorum she had promised herself and reached down to pull him up and hold him so tightly in her arms she might easily have hurt him she pressed her face into his neck ignoring the stench of rot on his skin and hair and clothes thinking only that she had him at last and he was alive he clung to her shuddering uncontrollably sobs racking his thin chest it was suttons voice that brought her back to the present and the danger she had momentarily forgotten theres rats down ere all right he said quietly its straight to the bilges an theres been another boy down ere poor little thing but there int much left of im now just bones an a bit o flesh dont look miss ester take the boy out of ere enough to drive im out of is ead stuffed in ere with rats and the alfrotted corpse of another child ill tell you this if mr monk dont get that son of the devil anged this time ill do it with me own ands his voice trailed off suffocated by emotion reluctantly hester let go of scuff but he couldnt let go of her he whispered softly just a little cry and fastened on to her more tightly she would have had to break his fingers to loosen his hold she staggered to the door arms around him keeping her head low beneath the boarded ceiling and met orme at the top of the steps his face shining with relief ill tell mr monk he said simply swiveling to go back up again ill ill tell im he stood still for a moment as if imprinting the scene on his eyes then grinning even more widely he swung around and made his way rapidly back to the main saloon hester lost count of how long she sat on the floor cradling scuff in her arms before monk came down just to look at the boy for himself the other boys explained that the corpse below the trapdoor was that of reilly the other missing boy who had tried to rebel he had been almost old enough to sell to one of the ships leaving london but he had tried to rescue some of the younger boys and had been locked in the bilges for his rebellion as an example he could be identified by the small charm around what was left of his neck we can hang phillips for that rathbone said hoarsely his eyes dark with horror and that terrible grief she had seen in him before are you sure she asked really sure oliver please dont promise something you only believe i dont want comforting i need the truth its the truth he replied at last she let go of scuff and reached out to touch rathbones arm very gently even though her hand was cold and filthy warmth shot between them like the force of life and passion and gentleness then what is the truth she asked he did not evade her you asked me before who it was that paid me to defend phillips he replied i thought i could not tell you but now i know it was also he who set phillips up in business in the beginning knowing the weakness of men like sullivan and feeding it until it became consuming she waited understanding something of his horror imagining his guilt yes i know his voice was so low she could barely hear it margarets father no she was wrong she had barely touched the magnitude of the horror he felt this drowned anything else she had conceived of it touched the very core of his own life she struggled for words but what could she say she tightened her hand on his and lifted it very slowly to her cheek then let it go she rose and carried scuff past him up into the light of the passage outside the saloon leaving rathbone by himself the big room was nearly empty monk was standing in the center with orme the rest of the police were gone as were the other clients monk looked pale and unhappy there was a bruise already darkening on his cheek whats happened hester demanded surprised but there was no fear in her she had scuff by the hand he was standing up now but pressed hard against her side most of them are under arrest he answered she felt a chill most im sorry his voice was tight with pain and guilt in the dark and the fighting the men we left upstairs got drawn in sullivan betrayed us and got phillips away i should have watched him and seen it coming well get him back and when we do no one will help him escape the rope this time she nodded not wanting to blame him and too near tears to speak she felt as if some enormous weight had all but crushed her the injustice of it was monstrous they had tried so hard even as she fought for breath she knew her disappointment was childish no one had ever promised justice not quickly or that she would see it happen they had scuff back alive he might have nightmares for years but they would look after him she was never going to let him be alone or cold or hungry again she shook her head blinking hard in time she said a little stumblingly weve got scuff and youve proved what phillips is no one will doubt you or durban or the river police now he tried to smile then turned away no one mentioned sullivan or what might happen to him what he might testify to beyond tonight what was there that they could prove against him if he accused them as phillips had suggested it was well past midnight now and all phillipss men were either under arrest or waiting under guard for more boats to come and collect them there were boys frightened humiliated and in need of care they were all halfstarved many had bruises on their bodies and some had bleeding and suppurating burns the police were busy with the arrests rathbone questioned the boys gently drawing out detail after hideous detail he persisted writing everything down in a little notebook from his pocket meanwhile sutton rummaged for all the food he could find most of it was delicacies meant for the jaded palates of gentlemen not the empty stomachs of children but he made something better of it than hester could have she did the best she could to treat the boys hurts with cold water salt and good shirts and underwear torn up to make bandages for once it was a disadvantage not to have been wearing petticoats as soon as there were boats available she would get them to the clinic in portpool lane and do all this better for now just care and gentleness helped and the knowledge that they were on the brink of freedom she did not stop to think how much better it would be if she could tell them that phillips was on his way to prison and would soon be dead monk climbed the steps on to the deck as the pale cold fingers of light crept across the water the high tide was past and beginning to drop again the outlines of the warehouses and cranes were sharp black against the sky even as he watched the darkness receded and he saw the stakes of execution dock tracking the shining surface of the river it was not until he looked more closely that he realized there were bodies there just tipping above the tide a string of lighters went by their passage creating a wash which uncovered sullivans dead body his throat gaped open where he had slashed it himself in a last act of despair possibly it was some kind of reparation because trapped inside the pirate gallows eyes wide open mouth in an eternal shriek as the water he dreaded closed over his living face was what was left of jericho phillips there were footsteps on the wood behind him and monk turned to see hester dont he began but it was too late she looked across the retreating wash her mouth pulled tight her eyes filled with great pity ive seen dead men before she told him slipping her hand into his i would sooner that god had to deal with that one than we did well just try to heal some of the pain he put his arms around her and held her feeling the strength in her and the gentleness it was all he needed to face any battle now or ever about the author anne
